basic auditing lecture given on 5 december 1963 well hello audience hello imagine finding you here glad to see you today winter is upon us in just fifteen days i think it is we get the shortest day in the year and then the sun comes back north again so remember at christmas to burn your christmas trees so as to attract the sun north again probably nobody even realizes why they have christmas well whats the date audience december 5 five dec the nautical month ad 13 andhavent anything to talk to you today about at all i gave you vent of meanness cussedness and viciousness yesterday i know several of you went through the floor not those who had their names mentioned but those whose pcs had been humming and doodling in session the problems of auditing are divided into three classifications im not mad at you i wasnt then im not today i just want you to be successful thats all sometimes i get little snarly when i dont think youre being as successful as fast as you might be able to auditing is divided into three areas and these areas are basic auditing technique and case analysis now when we say technique we mean the exact patter or procedure necessary to get something audited on the pc we do not mean technology the technique involvedlets take an old process were really exhuming them out of the rag bag reg was showing list of processes being compiled for level ii and nostalgia reigned in all directions waterloo station thatgosh you know i remembered one myself i used to run on groups always very successful the only processes anywhere in that lineup that were at all dangerous were the mockup processes and you just get those out and sometimes running havingness process it is too far away from the pcs havingness command and you actually tighten his can squeeze up but at level ii thats just tough you wouldnt do very much about that of course you wouldnt be getting tone arm action level ii is run by tone arm there is needle in level ii so that this still would not go unnoticed but i was looking at some of these old processes and one of them i used to run on group was spot three spots in the body spot three spots in the room remarkable process that is almost an optimum process youd be surprised what that will drag pc out of and drag him out of his body too on some cases if you keep it up long enough it actually tends to pull him out of pieces of the bank dont you see and so on its quite interesting so any exteriorization process short of actually exteriorizing the pc is quite valid its quite decent process you know the original exteriorization process not included in that remark and that is of course try not to be three feet back of your head that was the original exteriorization process try not to be three feet back of your head i dont know if you know it but somebody put that over the air on new york radio station i can see the cab driver now you see tried not to be three feet back of that cab but thesethe actual act of exteriorization generally brings the person back into his body more solidly because he becomes alarmed he becomes upset he is unstable and this isactually occurs at higher levels you inadvertently exteriorize somebody while doing level vi what now amounts to level vi processes or level v processes you can actually blow somebody out for moment and he has some adventure that he doesnt particularly like and he tends to come back in and hold on harder fortunately at level vi with your ot processes and so forth why he recovers from that because the gpms being gone theres nothing to upset him but the fact is that various things happen to people its not that exteriorization is bad its just that they become frightened and stay in harder such fellows walking downor hes driving down the street and somebody has exteriorized him and hes been exteriorized for day or so and hes feeling wonderful by the way and he draws up to stop light and theres the body in the car dont you see and he draws up to the stop light and stops the car and then wanders off and sits up on top of building and starts surveying the city and how isnt it very nice up here and then suddenly horrifyingly comes to himself that the light has changed and every car down there is honking and he becomes afraid that hed just walk off and abandon his body and his property dont you see and this alarms him so he goes spang back into his head again and the next time you get him out its rather hard to do bit harder to do and then it gets bit harder and bit harder and so forth well the reason why is that hes so mucked up with energy and massesgpms and implant engrams and all that sort of thing you seehe goes through these ridges they disturb energy masses and its these which are upsetting him not the misadventures which he has as result he merely misassigns it and misattributes these misadventures to being frightened when as matter of fact the reason he was frightened is because of energy masses that are exerting certain emotional responses upon him otherwise he couldnt care that much about it but any exteriorization type process like three spots in the body three spots in the room anything that tends to bring somebody out of something like where arent you you know where arent you now and that sort of thing why these things are quite marvelous and they work on groups and individuals and so on theres tremendous numbers of recall processes and so on which fall into those categorieswhich is something you wouldnt mind forgettingtell something you wouldnt mind forgetting that sort of process now the liability of these is that they run into gpms which have ris in them such as forgetting see you run into the ri forgetting this becomes restimulated and pulled out of line but this happens less often than you would think and frankly the individual audited up to about level iii the way you will see them coming up are just about as far from past life or gpm as you actually could get theyre riding in all this overcharged fat in the top ris and anything is lock and anything you audit off of that is improving the pcs perception his orientation making him wiser with regard to his environment so hes in better shape with regard to his environment and as result the gpms tend to destimulate not restimulate but always remember when youre running repetitive process always recall that the danger of restimulation of an actual gpm ri or lock on an actual gpm ri or an implant ri or lock on an implant ri and so forth is always present and the fancier and more comprehensive oror goofball the wording is of the process the more likely you are to do this see now you actually run this same problem at level i of all places when you say what solutions have you had to that because what is the entirety of the track but series of solutions and the only thing that saves your bacon in this particular instance is because theythey dont have any reality on any earlier lifetime or any other interior proposition these things just bite in this lifetime now if in doubtif in doubt you should presage your auditing commands with in this lifetime and youll probably start doing that at about level iii that starts to get possible and by level ivpresent level ivyou will find that you jolly well better had because this individuals awareness and alertness with regard to his existence is coming up to point where he slides through and out of this lifetime just about as easy as slipping on banana peel you couldnt move him out of this lifetime ordinarily at level i with building jack dont you see you couldnt do anything about that at all lets takelets take doctor snodgrass and hes been working away for lot of years and he knows all about life and death hes seen more bodies you know lying there dead and he knows all these things this tremendous overburden of false knowledge dont you see thats sitting there why you start running process on him hell always apply it to this lifetime see automatically and immediately when he gets processed enough and he gets enough charge off this lifetime hell begin to realize that it isnt this lifetime that is aberrating him and let him collide with this reality all on his lonesome nothings happened to him in this lifetime enough to aberrate him to any great degree and let him run into this propounded problem self propounded well if theres nothing in this lifetime that could make hate spinach ahhh wheres it coming from must be coming from someplace and this dawning feeling i wonder if i ever lived before that might have something to do with this and by that time hes getting creaky well by that time of course you must start limiting your processes if youre going to run repetitive processes and so forth otherwise you really will collide with gpms ris implants and all sorts of stuff of this particular character well they slip through in due course and they will collide with the materials of the whole track willynilly some sooner and some later main trouble you will have is the fellow at level i whos on manic on backtrack and hasnt been in this lifetime yet dont you see he keeps arguing that he can only run stuff on the whole track and so forth well thats all right thats your problem ive already had that problem problem of that type was what first shattered the first foundation in elizabeth new jersey we had couple of blokes around there that could only run past life engrams on each other couldnt find any present life engrams and they were busy running past life engrams and i remember poor old joe winter and parker morgan and john campbell and the rest of them all sitting around there and they proposed motion that past lives must not be researched or mentioned of course they didnt know up to that time that i could get mad they found it out right then right that minute upset them they went into terrible shock walking around sadly for days but they were in terrible shock because they were trying to make guilty and make back down on the thing because they said it had bad public presence that was their argument well one asks this fantastic question public presence what are we doing public presence or are we trying to pry people out of the mud now which are we doing and the saturday evening post reporter that was mucking up my weekend here couple of weeks agoi finally recovered from ittook some doing he had collected every bad news story that had ever been printed anyplace about anything anywhere and he was sitting there with this stuff stacked up at about foot and half high dont you see and hes trying to take up each one of these stories one by one to find out if there was any truth in it of course i just cut his throat and let him bleed all over the place because i told him american newsman has ever interviewed to get any of the material for any of those bad stories youve got there so why are we taking them up that finished it left him completely adrift anywaywell it was it was nonsense but the point here is that the university depending for its endowment upon its public presence the politician depending for his next election upon his public presence this planet is public presenced to death see and theres room in all this for truth room in all this for truth because of course if anybody even in the field of psychology researching they have to think of this because the university in which the research is being done of course must think of its good name i think its remarkable state of mind in which to do research you see well now you can go over the other way and become completely antipathetic with what you research but my point of view is that truth came first and everything else fell in second and if you could fit it in second or third in line good by all means do so but truth came first and thats how we got where we got to which was good forthright straight look at the whole situation public presence though very often got in our road youyoull have these problems and so forth this dear sweet soul who has been thejust as calm and as pleasant and cheerful in this particular coaudit comes in one day and shes found out that she was submarine commander in world war i or something like this you see or she was space commander you see in the second galactic battle or something you see and the other people start getting upset with her you see and try to jar her and you dont want her reality to be knocked apart and you actually dont want their reality to be knocked apart so you ordinarily solve it by being just pontifical about the whole thing and standing beautifully aloof telling them well if she believes it she believes it and if she was she was and if she wasnt she wasnt and thats all there is to that truth is truth and that is all there is to it trutha fact is either true or false and amount of opinion will make it either one so you get around it to this degree but youre going to run into trouble in that particular direction even at level ii and these lowlevel processes now i dont think you will often run into it at level i but even then you might run into it because i remember one time at swimming pool out in kansasit was very countryclub type swimming pool and this society matron had been reading dianetics modern science of mental health and was pleading with to tell her that children could not remember prenatal existence and she read it in the book and she was pleading with to tell her this and so forth and i said well i cant tell you that i said youve got little boy over there hes four or something like that why dont you ask him she called the little boy over and says now how far back do you remember johnny and he said oh i remember when i was in your tummy mommy and went over and jumped in the swimming pool very embarrassing but theres apparently such thing as acceptable truth and i dont think thats true at all i think thats the biggest lie at all because that gives you athat gives you bonus for not telling the truth so you actually cant compromise with truth at certain levels about the only thing you can really do is to hold the line on the average with pc any effort to go back into past lives or something like that early on before their ptps are handled will be met with catastrophic results they will turn on somatics the like of which you never heard of theyre stuck into things that they cant handle theyre disoriented and so forth theyre actually being audited against hidden standards they have terrific present time problems they dont know yet whether they should go down to the doctor or not to see about their tonsil which is sore theyre not quite sure in this direction or that direction life is just sort of disoriented confusion to them and all of sudden you blang them into some new startling datum well you havent got their present environment resolved at all and here they are confronting this big new datum and it turns on somatics and upsets them opalso lays them wide open for invalidation so youll find most of your problems are solved by following this rule of process them within their class now youre going to ask yourself why why within their class certainly cases can be processed at once higher than level i certainly they can be certainly youll find the bulk of them cant be the bulk of them really cant be processed higher and that accounts for most of the processing failures they want to talk about it they want to talk about it little bit their idea of control is so nervy and so upset that to do more than to just sit there and say some things about some section of their life is quite beyond them they want to talk about this or that or the other thing evenif you start to guide them into ow or something like this they cant take that much responsibility youd be surprised they even get results getting off motivators asknowing the mechanics of the mind better youll often be surprised at how improvement can take place in the teeth of some wellknown datum this guy sits there and gets off all his motivators dont you see and of course if you could get off the overt the recovery would be quite rapid and the recovery really doesnt take place fully until you do but nevertheless getting off the motivator does get them some distance of course thats an auditable situation somebody can do that with this person but also this person is capable of doing that now if we look at all these various classifications and so on well see that its just an increasing level of responsibility for self and for the dynamics and this is what this is basically plotted against so the processes laid out for the individual in any given classof course thats gradient scale of processes too that gradient scale should be plotted against increasing level of responsibility so it starts with motivators more or less and ends with overts dont you see so any type of gradient that can be made inside class is actually just increased level of their own awareness of their own responsibility youll find out that this is fairly successful pattern of operation but oddly enoughoddly enoughas simpleive just discussed these various levels to increase your familiarity with them still talking about these three factors of basic auditing technique and case analysis you are still looking dont you see there at technique when you are looking at these processes now those are all techniques those techniques must be programed the programing of those techniques is based on case analysis which technique do you run first see thats case analysis whats this fellow really worried about well thats what were going to do with him dont you see thats case analysis so in actual fact every levelnot for somebody just at highlevel auditor but in actual fact every level has its own case analysis has its own case analysis and case analysis rises up to the highest level at the high complexity of gpms and implants and all of this sort of thing all the bricabrac and machinery and bits of mass of the mind are taken into account there but you can say almost the same thing at very very low level at ii you can ask the fellow well was this something that was done to you implant or was this something you did actual gpm im indebted for that clever wording to my friend edgar he slickered somebody here into case analysis situation did something with his potential tuberculosis in thirtyfive minutes or something with this type of case analysis now he just took the basic steps of case analysis discovered what the pcs sitting in get him to itsa it and then fix it veryas accurately as possible see there was those three steps of case analysis well you find out that theres need to depart from that pattern of case analysis in any level and that oddly enough probably delivers the whole world ofthis mustnt be on the tape peter so dont bother to erase itthe whole world of healing the whole world of healing is actually at this moment at our complete mercy at our mercy we may not take it up but this was one of the research targets that i set last january and it unwrapped itself and you got it very casually the other day as case analysis and these steps of case analysis have some fantastic workability and apparently have fantastic workability in the field of illness and disease which i think is quite remarkable now auditor is being advised to use these in this particular field but there it sits there sits the hbomb that blows the medical profession over the hill and into oblivion every one of these levels has its own approach for case analysis but this first level is just sort of anat level i it would just be discussion of how theyre feeling or something like this dont you see or what considerations have they had about some illness which they have you possibly wouldnt be more definitive than this but certainly thats perfectly valid itsa now as soon as we move up to level ii or level iii certainly were into case analysis which goes like this where is the person sitting in other words what engram or something are they sitting in what lifewe used to do this by the way in dianetics wed say in when i snap my fingers an age will flash snap and the person would get something like twelve something like that all right is that twelve years old yes well all right thats where he was sitting see all right what happened to you when you were twelve years old see and youll finally be able to fix the fact that he was sitting in an engram which occurred when he was twelve and the thing is frozen there in his mind now theres crude level of that same case analysis going forward of course this moves up to the situation at level vi is this an implant gpm is this you see is this an actual gpm is this only goal is this an ri is it an actual ri is it an implant ri is it lock on an actual ri is it lock on an implant well look at the technology here which the pc has to know actually progressively he has to know more and more technology from level i up to get any response at all but at level vi we have all of this panorama but only those three steps of case analysis see discover what hes sitting in you know how do you feel today i have cold see thats level 0level i you know well thats it good what have you done for it see do you feel better theyre actually your three steps dont you see of case analysis shoved in at level i theyrethey sound almost social but as an actual fact they are those three harshly definitive steps which is discover what the pcs sitting in get the considerations hes had about it in other words get the lies off of it which tend to make it persist and then establish accurately thisconditions see and tell him about them these are your three steps in every case so case analysiscase analysis has considerable breadth of view it apparently takes anything in from healing out very broadly into the whole track all the rest of this now word of warning as pc runs additional actualthis iswell lets go really out of this world nowas pc runs actual gpms and starts stacking up actual gpms the subitsa and the pcs ability to itsain other words what the meter reads and what the pc can actually seecome closer and closer together and they come closer and closer together and then on case analysis fold over and the pc can see better than the meter you can get condition which develops about halfway through to ot where if the pc doesnt say it is it you wont get it to read and you try to do case analysis this way is this an actual gpm see thats it your needle just kept onmaybe there was the tiniest little stub here if you had microscope you might have seen it go see maybe but significant read that anybody in his right mind could detect pc sits around and thinks about it for while says yes its an actual gpm crash rocket reads bang down goes the tone arm are weis this wrong item we have here or are we listing from wrong source are we listing from wrong source you see you cant find the next item it wont prove out are we listing from wrong source have we found wrong item areare we listing that meters not doing confounded thing doing nothing obviously one of the two are true see theres only two things can be wrong at any given time you found wrong item or you listed from wrong item thats why youre messed up at this particular line see its only two and you get smooth flow on both of them its got to be one or the other pc sits back thinks it over well i told you all the time its wrong source psssswww crash bang down goes the tone arm everything blows down in other words there is point of case where the meter becomes useless now originally that itsa gap between the itsa and the sub itsawhat the meter reads and what the pc can tell youthats pretty wide thats reading down below all the fat dont you see thats pretty wide so your case analysis can be very adroit at about level iii and practically ceases to exist at the upper end of level vi quite interesting now you get somebody with eight nine or ten gpms run actual gpms all run accurately and the whole case smooth and so forth you will see this you will start running out of meter it isnt registering because of course the meter depends on mass and the meter depends on connections and short circuits in that mass and that sort of thing in order to read and youre getting person up to selfdeterminism where unless they think it it isnt so in other words your basic auditing at the beginning of the line in the earlier parts of the line particularly levels ii and iii has to be magnificent because the pc doesnt know what the hell youre talking about you get the idea see pc in order to work anything through this about his own life or something like this is herculean proposition hes got nomenclature he has reality on this thing he cant put these things together easily or smoothly and so forth and whats the whole burden the whole burden is on basic auditing which of course is just handling the pcs itsa improving the pcs itsa most basic of basic auditing youve got to handle the pc and handle the session and handle the meter when its present but above all these things youve got to handle the pcs itsa and improve that pcs itsa because if youre not working all the time in improving the pcs itsain other words never give it to him on the meter when he can give it to you thats one of the little laws that go along with this but at the same time the pc says would you check this on the meter is it guffball or gumshoe see and you say naw you tell im afraid that violates handling the pcs itsa it actually isnt being courteous isnt helping the pc but somewhere along the line you got to wean him you got to wean him off meter give less and less dependency because its going to happen anyway and if you havent enormously improved the pcs ability to itsa as he came on up the line god help you if you get half through bank having knocked the pcs itsa in the head all the way pcs now in condition where he cant tell you and the meter wont see you could get yourself into wonderful impasse here on level i they dont know what youre talking about the thing is turned full cycle in both of those cases youve got basic auditing standing in the easiest area where basic auditing can be poor and not be noticed is at about levels iii and iv of the present chart scale basic auditing can be pretty cottonpicking poor because youve got meter and it answers most of your questions at those levels and you havent got much to worry about and so on sobut even through there if youre not working at handling the pcs itsa and improving and increasing the pcs itsa why he wont make anywhere near the progress that he could make so regardless at how the basic auditingi mean at what level basic auditing is applied it is the dominant point in all levels now you getthere is technique and many techniques and types of techniques for the various levels those things are something you can learn like good pianist learning new tune doesnt take him long to do that your basic auditing is grooved thats fairly easy to do you have to do these things and they have to be quite precise and your case analysisyour case analysis is on the same fundamental steps but it is quite variable all the way up along the line and the only things that vary in basic auditingthe only real things that vary is that ayour start with meter tone arm youve still got meter there isnt any place on that scale where you omit the meter the meter can be at any place on that scale you can also run without them at the very early scale but you expect somebodys going to be sitting there with tone arm and we dont care what level their auditing is going forward at least get them used to that tone arm because they will get familiarity with meter and theyll begin to appreciate what it is and youve gotten tremendous bonus so that when they get trained on the meter it doesnt appear to be an unfamiliar article to them that scares them to death and so youve got as you move along this lineup the complications of metering are added to basic auditing metering gets more and more complicated as you go on up along the line and you think youre playing theater organ on meter when you get to level vi if you cant handle meter that smooth fast and good why it will find you out man if youre having any trouble theres little tricks on these mark vs by the way theres something ive been meaning to tell you for some time you know you never run these mark vs at levels v and viyou never run mark v meter higher than eight sensitivity and lot of your trouble if youre having any trouble at such level comes from setting the meter sensitivity too high ive had some trouble latelya couple of times ive set it too low ive left it on one and wondered if the pcs rr was shutting off or something until i suddenly wake up with shock and realize that i havent advanced it from the startofsession can squeeze just point of amusement see pc gets soneedle gets so loose as youreas youre moving up into these levels that frankly level i on mark v is reading quite nicely and it never occurs to you to run the level i because it looks like somebody at about level iii process you see operating at full blast on the meter but eighteight is about as high as you ever run the sensitivity on one of these things youll get any read that is at all significant at that if youre getting dirty needle your basic auditing is just too sour for words you shouldnt ever have to advance sensitivity to get rid of dirty needle so that you can move through it bah its just horrible comment and also i put out bulletin the other day and i said that your basicit was session arc breaks that caused the dirty needle and therefore those were solved by l1 and its atits in that bulletin but it possibly is not stated strongly enough that the violence of the arc break is actually caused by the bypassed technical charge like the wrong goal or something like this and youve got to pick it up with l4 and so forth but it isnt going to cure your dirty needle its just technical fact that youve now got to go back to your session arc break to cure that up it could have sat there without session arc break and never keyed in and never given you any trouble but you gave it session arc break and it keyed it in quite in addition to that none of these heavy charges ever have the power of creating dirty needle they dont create dirty needles dirty needles come solely and totally from basic auditing whats the value of this thing is not how you handle arc breaks but how you supervise auditing or how you supervise your own auditing because you see youre sitting there looking at dirty needle you know darn well that youve done something in this session which was not very good in the line of itsa and also in supervising auditing you can go down line of auditors and look at the meters and anybody thats sitting there with dirty needle youve got somebody whose basic auditing is awry for that particular level thats for us very very good point to know its not because hes got wrong goal that he has dirty needle its because his basic auditing is sour now basic auditing cannot help but increaseas you come up the line cannot help but increase with practice and familiarity im quite surprised the degree that the basic auditing can be improved i was quite amazed few months ago when i made some tests i actually played you the tape i made some tests onthose of you who were here few months agoand i just busted the pcs arc and so forth in the session with an inadvertent cut of itsa and few things like that well it woke up to the fact that my auditing could be improved and so i set out to improve my auditing and to handle itsa and that sort of thing and just made project out of it and ive been working on that for about three months same length of time as some of you have been around here my auditing has improved has yours aw thats nasty thing to say but i have noticed considerable improvement in auditing which is basically expressed in the tremendous amount of ta action which i can pull out of session now of course i know im running level vii you cant expect ta action like this at any lower level but in the last five sessions of sixteen hours and ten minutes total auditing time 638 ta divisions down making an average of 398 ta divisions per hour of auditing and 993 i think it is per two and half hour session average now that is donethat is done with basic auditing now you can say the technique is responsible but do you know the same technique used and the same amount of elapsed time and so forth might only have brought off youve only got as half as much work donebut it only might have brought off half of that dont you see it was the basic auditing which made the big difference thats what made the difference now i listened to the tape that i played you yesterday and i didnt think i made my point well because i listened to that tape and it all sounded very comfortable and very easy it sounded very relaxed well thats liability because from the auditors viewpointwas liability as demonstration i thought maybe i hadnt put my point across at all because i heard that thing playing on and it all sounded very casual very calm well of course it was meant to sound very casual and very calm actually the auditor in this particular case was auditing like mad whirling dervish you see you know that was really driven session but it sounded awful calm but the auditor wasnt particularly calm running it dont you see but here were all the factors of basic auditing the auditor was not uncomfortable running this dont you see but he was right up on it see there was relaxed frame of mind from the auditors point of view see he was right up on it you know the do fish swim or whatever it was see the pc was adding long comm lags you see she felt selfconscious about this later adding these long comm lags finally the pc answered it and said tttttada ttttada ttttada the pc obviously had finished that answer obviously said everything she was going to say and so forth and bang there was another auditor action right there get that it was lag auditor comm lag see it was right there right on top of the pc see pc never had time to breathe wonder the pc was comm laggingonly time the pc didnt have to work but now in that very session you were looking at that ta was rollingthat ta was rolling all the time that was taking place there it was in constant motion i gave you slightly bum datum when i said you only go to the stoppoint or still point of the ta dont you see you dont just sit and wait for the ta to move in case it moves again you go to the stoppoint of the ta and i got to thinking about it later and i got to looking at it in last nights session and i was quite struck by the fact that there were stillpoints of the ta so i have to amend that for you ta notably slowed down doesnt have to be stopped point of ta because if youre really auditing they cease to exist there is moment in the session when that ta isnt jittering its moving from whum to whum to bing to bow to zzzzzzzbump to dip to dap zzzzzzzthud up up up up zzzzzzzzzz bump thats the way its going its just moving all the time youre only getting fifteen ta divisions in session see thats what five every hour its not quite itsits what clever arithmeticsixpoint something you getyou know your ta is stopped most of the time stopped stopped dead still there are long periods in the session when that ta isnt budging isnt moving hair and so forth well you get up to ta quantities like 993 ta divisions down in two and half hours of auditing which is at the rate of the one i just gave you 398 ta divisions per hour actually well below that point i think its about twenty an hour you dont have stopped points there arent points when the ta is motionless the more constantly the ta is moving of course the more ta youre getting but it gets up to certain accelerated type of activity and there just are stopped points it doesnt come down and stick it slows down and drifts and then it gets into businesslike action again you see well that makes it perhaps very hard for you to judge when should you talk and when not talk and so forth and its basically on the basis of the big fast swoops you keep your mouth shut if it just so happens that at that moment when youre expected to say something youve got big fast swoop in progress on your ta you wait until it has eased off before you start talking i wanted to give you little more accurate presentation of this thing because itsi saywhat i told you was not quite accurate it would fit very well see on the auditing youre doing at the moment but if you thought that was all there was to know about it youd start coming cropper level or two above where youre auditing you see because here youre getting accustomed to the fact that the ta stops which it is doing at this particular time with you and you go much higher in terms of levels than this and your ta doesnt stop so you just have to learn to talk only when the ta is moving slowly well you get blowdowns such asyou dont have extreme blowdowns to get ta like this by the way halfhalf of that action was from something like 275 to 35 extreme highs extreme lows now look how frantic the tone arm had to be only running over 75 area of dial see that had to be pretty fast and you run into oddities as you go along on this you get such steep blowdown that it doesnt have time to recover before your next blowdown but does recover and then you get blowup you get into this kind of nonsense and once in while youll sit there and be terribly puzzled as to what the devil happened well probably your meter didnt track with everything that was happening in the session see or you were busy doing something or other and you didnt get the recovery that did occur but you didnt set your needle to it because it happened too fast something like this so youll finally find that the rule gets to be at the upper grade of the thing is when the ta is remarking with blazing speed if its moving with blazing whitehot speed shut up and if its not moving much talk and youll more or less keep out of trouble but you can turn off somebodys heat very easily by talking when the ta is in motion because if somebodys got heat on they got fast ta motion going on and if the auditor says anything they suppress the heat at these higher levels and youve got to get the suppress on it doesnt do any good to get the suppress on the item youve got to get the suppress on the heat you got that youve got to get the suppress on the heat has anything suppressed that heat oh yes i suppressed it because you said something oh all right thank you the heat goes back on your tone arms moving now if you went ahead and made the same stupid blunder again your ta is now flying because the rest of the heat is coming off and you say oh well thats good the tone arm is moving now you see whohhhuup thats the end of that heat blowoff and you say on this item has anything been suppressed nothings been suppressed on the item the heats been suppressed so youd have to get it back on thisi know this looks very complicated and something or other but these things all have ramifications they all follow in along the line of basic auditing when youve got bunch of action going on in the pc when youve got bunch of introversion going on in the pc when the pc is very happy telling you all about something when the pc is introverted and looking at his own case when lot of action is going on what is an auditor doing starting action i mean its as simple problem as that ill show you how complicated the problem can look you see tas move fast at some types of processes and dont move so fast at others and you have to adjust your ta and all this thing yeah but lets just get the basic rule what really is this basic rule youve got lot going on with the pc shut up if youve got nothing going on with the pc right now start talking dont wait till next week its the auditor that raises the mischief in session two ways if theres nothing going on in the session the auditor should start something and he raises the devil with the session if he doesnt and if theres something going on and the auditor starts something why then everything goes to pieces what is this this is just crude handling of communication cycles or action cycles see youve got bad handling of an action cycle thats all that is involved in that somethings going on with the pc why are you trying to start something with the pc nothings going on with the pc what are you doing not starting something with the pc thats about all it breaks down to and therefore its true for all levels but youll find at the upper levels that you havent got time to pay any attention to basic auditing it better be something youre practically born with you know you dont go along street wondering about the steps of walking now i pick up the right leg and i let the body fall slightly forward and i put the right foot out in front of to catch the body so that it doesnt hit the pavement well ive got that done now whew all right now the left leg is back little bit so i pick up the left leg and i put it slightly forward now the body must be made to fall slightly forward again and i catch it with my left foot ahhhh i finally got that step you shouldnt be in that condition with basic auditing when youre trying to nun whirling dervish type process like level vi i know it sounds obvious i know it sounds awful obvious but as obvious as it sounds it is horribly true and i had to learn it the hard way it is something that you assume you know its an everybody knows and that sort of thing but you shouldnt be sitting around worrying about you talking when the pcs not talking and oohrooohrooohroo sorting all this out man you ought to have that stamped into the bone and marrow of your auditing because just handling an emeter at level vi well thats athat would be athat would be fulltime job for theater organist keeping that thing paced in there and keeping that needle somewhere approximating set and because i audit with counter on the thing of course i mustnt move the ta while the pc is moving because it throws your ta division count out youll have ta counters in the very near future theyre quite successful theyre marvelous youd never have time at level vi to record ta youd never have chance you just wouldnt be able to do it the only thing you can do is when you ask the question you can write down where the ta was sitting at that instant and you better had because thats the last glimpse youll have of it see and then you know what it blew down from because youve got to mark your blowdown in terms of figures after the item when youve got it well youve got lots of time to do that because of course youre marking it while it is blowing down see you use the time that you would be silent in order to catch up with your administration without distracting the pcs attention too much well usually during steep blowdown at having been given the item the pcs too comatose to see it anyway the pc wouldnt notice it if you were doing something as long as it isnt too distractive so youve got that little period there in which to do your administration and this thing went from 42 to 33 and you write that down to 3o you know 42 to 2to 33 you write down to 30 which is theirthey itsaed little bit and it gave it another push but that of course wasnt the original blowdown that was the itsa blowdown so its added with another to it and that gives you your codification therefore you know how this thing behaved well of course you can sometimes notice that the tone arm is going up badly as youre doing list so you can make notation over on the left side of the list occasionally that the tone arm is now at 41 or something like that it gives youall youre looking for is the figure because when the blowdown happens you wont have chance to see where it blew down from so you just keep handy reference and that is only tone arm noting that you have any opportunity to do at level vi its just not possible to keep painstaking tone arm record you couldnt do it youd spend time doing anything but that prepchecking oh heck in prepchecking youve got all the time in the world if you didnt have tone arm record to keep youd get nothing to do at all but the tone armtone arm counters are marvelous and you have to be very careful when youre using tone arm counter that when the pc starts using the cans for pair of dumbbells to do some settingup exercises or something like this you see youve got to notice the pc is doing this and then not touch your tone arm till they bring the cans back down into their normal position otherwise youre going to add lot of false ta to your meter all the time you see then your tone arm counter then is telling you false story continuously so youve got all these various things to note and action and of course even at eight pc who is running at level vi even at eight sensitivity on one of these mark vs you get this quite remarkable meter response your meter responses are big and theyre not minute at all and the pcs needle is so loose that youve got problem in keeping the thing exactly to set now you dont think this is serious problem perhaps but do you know you cut your pcs itsa to ribbons by not knowing the interesting trick of trained left thumb that thumb has got to be so trained that when you swing your needle back to set your thumb also puts the brake on the needle and stops it cold at set in other words you not only move the needle to set you stop the needle at set now the delicacy of thumb touch and practice in order to do this is quite remarkable if you dont believe it turn your meter up to 128 put your sensitivity up here to 32 and try to kick the needle over here to set just more interesting like that just you see just try to kick it to set without that wobble see that wobble all right letsthe needle came down here all right now lets kick it back to set with wobble notice im pushing it here with my fingers not in an educated way but you see that wobbles all over the place how do you get that needle back there to set well while youre doing that before you ask the pc the question you are putting in silent spot and youre inviting itsa and youre chopping his itsa line to pieces and youve got his action cycle all disarranged simply because youre not right there with your meter see and thats what makes lot of auditors look kind of silly theyauditors try to get this needle in and they you can see them start tipping their heads pc becomes interestedattracts attention you see well you should take andand turn it up to an extremity like this and see howhow good you are at bringing needle back here to set and stopping it swing it over here and just bring it around to stop and brake it you actually can brake the needle right in at set ive just done it but if i turned it around and showed it to you i couldnt do it because ive not ever run meter so the pc could read it now all right thats an interesting gimmick on meter reading there theres then refinements above refinements above refinements on the subject of meter reading possibly you hadnt even thought of that particular one although you may very well have had trouble with it but you actually can educate your thumb believe it or not that will bring that thing right back itll bring right back to pang and stop it right on the button and there it is right there also you can get that so practiced that you begin your question as you do it so that during the last half of the question the needle is freely drifting the last half of the question the first half of the question youre talking there in this session has anything been suppressed in this session needle braked stopped has anything been suppressed click this sounds likethis sounds like an old professional marine or something like this what they can do with rifles and so forth and what they can do with drill manuals and that sort of thing but it gets up to that line you say well this guy hes just doing paradeground drill well youd be surprised how that parade ground drill can develop the princess pats of world war 1 fame particularly used to have manual they called the princess pat manual and they would drop rifle from slope arms off of the right shoulder the rifle would do complete spin opening its bolt and move sideways to inspection arm see they just let the rifle fall off of their shoulder and then over the biceps and it would come up to inspection with the bolt open dropped more rifles doing that its really goofball types of maneuvers i remember embarrassing marine captain one day i did princess pats spin with rifle see itsbring it up from order arms catch it in this hand and without this hand being far away from you since that would look clumsy the rifle does whole parabolait goes all the way around see and drops to inspection arms but its like you handled small straw you know the thing goes through the air like alike ton of lead you see traveling at high speed and these things weigh about nine pounds and i think you get deck courtmartial in the marine corps for dropping rifle and he saw this happen and so forth id seen an old professional marine do it and was finally gotten able to do this thing you see and he said that looks interesting he said how did you do that and he picked up this rifle fortunately it wasnt my rifleand he threw it up toward his arm you see and he missed and the rifle went about twenty feet through the dust plowing up canal of dust he turned around and walked off the company street saying more about it even letting somebody pick up that weapon of course hed laid himself open to summaryi mean deck courtmartial real proim not making any real point out of thisbut in any particular field youll find that the real pro the guy thats been around for quite whiletake professional truck driver lets get down into those levels you know the things those guys can do with trucks the ways they can turn them around and that sort of thing its unbelievable nobody can do that you can do the same thing with meters at first it just looks like ifs very simple and theres not much to meter and theres nothing much that you could amplify with meter but you finally get up to point where theres just tricks galore that you can pull with meters and you can set meters up in various particular ways you can make meters well if youre really used to needles you can tell whether or not the pc is telling you the truth or not without even asking for missed withholds have you missed withhold on the pc if youre really smooth as ice why you know youve missed withhold on pc if your basic auditing is so good you know he didntyou didnt cut his itsa and you just look at your needle and you could go on talking to the pc along these lines and you say well and so on something you didnt mention to in the mid ruds so forth you sure there isnt something you didnt tell oh well except last night i was drunk and i brrrrr you see pulled withhold without withholds you can watch the responses of the needle you can see howwell lets take can squeeze if youre real sharp as an auditor you dont have to run havingness you just ask the pc what has upset them whats upset their havingness during the session pc tries to give you an introverted remark well they thought something or other they thought something or other itll be something with regard to the room it wont be anything with the session so you say well was the room too hot was the room too cold i mean were you uncomfortable at any time was it noisy around ohit was awful noisy around here thank you very much all right squeeze the cans bang his havingness is up to what it was at the beginning of the session you see theyre just and here is lots of commands of havingness and getting the pc wrestling around down in the middle of the bank where you had just fished him out of do you see its clever ways to bring up can squeeze it comes under the borderline of meter handling you know that meter is responding to pulledin mass or the pc is more introverted than he was with regard to the room not with regard to his case and you can bring up his havingness accordingly you can inspect the meter during the last part of the session and know that his havingness is down you can alsoyou can also look at theat the way the tone arm is riding to be very obvious about something you can look at the way the tone arm is behaving in the session and you know this tone arm up hereill give you the extreme viewits up here at 525 its been there for quite while well anybody would wake up to the fact that there was something wrong around here with that well lets take it just little bit more mildly than this lets take higherlevel process the tone arm is at 35 and has not been riding at 35 and for the last couple of minutes has been riding up here at 35 which is brandnew then we see the tone arm starting to rise one way or the other conceive that the pc must be upset about something conceive that something must be wrong in what we are doing conceive that something is going awry and simply keep an eye on it expecting trouble doing more than just expect trouble and then of course be not startled at all when it suddenly breaks around our head and say well i dont know youve already sorted it out well the pc probably listed down into something or other and i dont know we probably missed an item here wesomethingssomethings going on here thatprobably some implant ri or another that we havent gotten ahold of hmm or havent fully discharged something i dont know i dont know dont know youre going on auditing all this time you see and youre just waiting for the firstthe first breakloose on the part of the pc well all this is informed meter operation youve already been told this pcs going to arc break if youre not careful because this meter is behaving differently than it was behaving before and its starting to ride higher than it was riding before and all is not well all read off meter well its not in the textbooks that you should use meters this way well i gave you an idea of the pro see well its like the thumb trick is bang it goes down so forth you bring it back to set stop it dead on at set see of course it goes bang down again all right bring it right back to set see stop it motionless every time it comes and so it canyoud be surprised with little practice how you can manage this sort of thing well if youre that familiar with the meter you should be that familiar with the communication cycle of the pc what do you mean having trouble with communication cycle with the pc any more than well you have trouble withyou missed read that sounds awfully corny this sounds something that might have happened inoh i dont know i guess you could hearsomebody in poughkeepsie at some time or another might miss read or angeles theysomething you see something but scientologist certainly scientologist would miss read or clean clean now if your worries about meters are at the level of missing reads or cleaning cleans well thats fine thats down there at perhaps level iii level ii and im sure that one should worry about them at some time or another at about the same time he worries about the onoff switch but there is if you areif you were to have greater familiarity with the meter than youre still worried about things like that man you could never run level vi for the life of you because youve got attention for the meter this meter is somethingyou dont sit there and worry about how you put piece of beefsteak in your mouth youve got time at all to spend on this meter and your technique is an alldevouring monster you know ive had to develop shorthand methods of recording on level vi just to keep up with it and even that the only thing that slows down level vi now is the recording of level vi if i could figure some way to speed it up again level vi would speed up again but its practically at zenith you cantyou can only write so fast and you can only shorthand what youre doing so well and never write an item twice never do this never do that got those things all cut out and keep the thing all straight on the sheet of paper and so forth but thats whats slowing things down now itsthats time to be worrying about your basic auditing about the handling of the pc for instance lets see the pc has now answered the question lets see now i thinki think im supposed to say something now that is not the level in which you should be worrying about that now let somebody at level ii worry about that see but not at level vi see you just wont ever make it youve got to get it up to point where the pcs itsa is just rolling along like welloiled perambulator see and you instinctively promote the pcs itsa well you got list here and you see the pcs looking very introverted and so forth and you say well which one do you think it is and the pc says oh uhhhhh cat whiskers cat whiskers all right that reads is that your item now theres an opportunity to do that but next time the pc is looking you know thats not the opportunity to say which one is it hes liable to say how the hell should i know my god this is too terrible you almost arc broke him you see by overloading his reality his reality you canis pretty poor at this particular line hes just done long list and hes very puzzled which one do you think it is that would be about all youd need to torch off the haystack dont you see but lot of times you can do that but doing level v or level vi is not the time to be worried about how you handle basic auditing now i admit that ive learned great deal about basic auditing while doing these upper levels i havent had any opportunity to do it any other way but ive been quite surprised that basic auditing is basic auditing regardless of what level it is practiced any level it is practiced its still basic auditing and theres practically zenith on how good your basic auditing can become and theres nothing unknown about any of its laws these are the lawssimply are based on observation and you say do fish swim and the pc says hmm long silent period well thats time to say well all right all right ill check it on the meter see give the pc chance to answer the auditing question man you busted up your comm cycle of course youre going to bust up his itsa youre going to dirty up your needle youre going to distract his attention youre going to shift him startle him one way or the other youre going to throw him out of session turn him against the auditor pull his attention out of his bank put it on the auditorcan you think of any more see i mean its not just crime its hanging offense so the pc you say do fish swim you know and the pc says i dont know ii dont know well you know better than to say yes thank you okay at that point because hes says i dont know yah oooooohhhh you can hear the rest of the communication that is going to follow this see ooooohhhh dont know well i dont think they do thank you see now here would be another horrible error you see do fish swim pcs silent well i dont know i dont think they do auditor pc hmmhmmhmmhmmhmm this is too corny for words dont you see well the funny part of it is you could probably make some mistakes with technique you could probably make some mistakes in case analysis not very manyand get somewhere with pcs but ill tell you where you cant make mistakes and thats basic auditing and it sounds like it is the area where you could afford to make the most mistakes and that isnt true at all the advance of your pc is totally dependent upon your basic auditing and its better than that and its worse than that so heres your three zones of auditing they areactually if you do sloppy technique youll pay the penalty your basic auditing will be stretched to singing high whine itll sound like banjobanjo tuned up for the days of 49 you know bzzzz because your basic auditing will really be called on here you didnt quite master how to handle getting down an implant gpm pattern and he gets halfway down and youve left half the items charged your basic auditing is now going to be under strain that i assure you but its your basic auditing thats going to be under strain lets say we analyze the case wrong we decide that he really should have this particular next series of whatever it is run dont you see and we shouldnt finish off the engramthe whole track engram that we were doing because its getting too hard and solid on the pc so we make mistake you see somehow or another we cut off something he was deeply interested in doing your basic auditing is going to come under fantastic strain but the funny part of it is nothing very serious is going to happen to the pc because of errors in technique nothing very serious and errors in case analysis nothing serious is going to happen to the pc this is mostly true below level vi because pc is pretty much under stress at level vi and nevertheless it even holds true at vi its basic auditing thats going to pitch him on his head if your basic auditing is bad matter what level youre on thats going to catch it if the technique is wrong the basic auditing catches it case analysis is wrong its going to be the basic auditing catches it so let that be good strong wall on which to build your sessions and you will be all right and if theres anything awry with basic auditing then youre going to pay the full penalty slightest error in techniquecrash there goes your session slightest error in case analysisboom all in flames right now see do you get the difference of ratio here you want to know why some pcs are feeling badly well the auditorthe usual thing is the auditors basic auditing is out its missing somewhere of course there can be technique errors dont forget this you can start down gpm an actual gpm with the wrong technique and youll have more pc into more ditch in short time than you could possibly shake stick at and case analysiscase analysis has to be pretty accurate nobodys running these things down but you can recover easily on those and they actually arent terribly hard on the pc unless the basic auditing is out the only place you get somatics turned on for instanceand this is new datum for youthe only way you turn on somatics in level vi ot processes is by invalidation you found an item you said it was the item then you said it wasnt the item result somatics you found an item that wasnt the item you said it was the item and said another wasnt the itemyou see youre invalidating items somatics and you can really wrap guy around telegraph pole with somatics somatics are very very rough at level vi in exact ratio to the amount of invalidation done its an exact ratio lot of invalidation lot of somatics little invalidation little somatics it isnt that items turn on pain youll get your pain turned on in this wise you find the goal to spit you analyze it all out rocket read everything said it was an actual gpm and then somehow or another because of the collusions of the conflusions of the something or other and the next session and so forth and couldnt get it to read and so forth so you abandon it and decide to extend the goals list and so forth dont be surprised in thirtysix hours if you got good sick pc on your hands invalidated the goal dont you see well you caits also true that you can find things that arent right so you pays your money and you takes your chance and thats about the only thing you can do just do it as possiblyas well as you can with as little invalidation as possible thats pretty hard one so that makes the steps of case analysis mandatory in preparing these things the considerations must be taken off these things must be straightened up before you go on otherwise your pc is going to be bogged down with somatics but even so if your basic auditing is in that is cut to minimum too because the pc has an opportunity to talk to you about them the pc has an opportunity to comment on it the pc expressed his opinion concerning the thing and his itsas being promoted up along the line his opinion is apt to be more accurate so you make less mistakes so even that buffers up against this potential somatic situation you see how were headed in this way now those are the relationships of the three parts of auditing i havent too much stressed technique i havent too much stressed case analysis but both of them are built on the single point of basic auditing and im just giving you wideopen invitation to become an absolute whiz bang genius on the subject of basic auditing not talking when you should be silent not being silent when you should be talking riding it right straight up driving the session all the way through in very relaxed attitude which is going forward in an awful hurry and youll find out that the heaviest dividend that you can get out of auditing out of auditing training is actually the perfection of your basic auditing and you can move thisof course that includes metering and you move this all up into zone of perfection and so forth youll find youre so relaxed youve got an opportunity to learn technique youll find youre so relaxed about this you can do an accurate case analysis this gone you cant even start on the others thats how these things sit in their relationship i know ive been studying my own basic auditing for about three months i was never any slouch at auditing but when i think back over what i once called good basic auditing im horrified im actually horrified because the blunders are just wideopen it looked very smooth to everybody else it looked very smooth to at the time and i had to really work on it for quite while to find out how bad it was maybe some of us are in that particular condition i dont mean to say so im just saying that i had been in that condition and id be very happy with you if youdif youd sweat this one out and make it look real grooved in and alert and carry it on down the line and i can guarantee your tone arm motion will triple with some concentration spent on this particular subject okay thank you very much
