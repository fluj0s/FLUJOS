of fairly recent immigrants in utilizing ge nealogical research to learn more about individual ancestral roots until recently ge nealogists had only the traditional tools of their trade available to them to conduct this research such as hist orical documents and other paper records more recently with the commercialization of genetic ancestry testing genealogists and others have gained access to new tool genetic ancestry testing may be used to identify biological relatives validate genealogical records and to fill in gaps in family histories1 in addition this testing may be us ed to aid in

2007affiliation3 this report considers only nonhea lth and nonforensic applications of genetic ancestry testing commercial genetic an cestry testing was first offered in 2000 by the company family tree dna4 since that time this testing has grown in popularity especially among africanamericans attempting to lear n more about their history and culture5 currently almost two dozen companies offer genetic ancestry testing and it is estimated that roughly 460000 people have undergone testing at cost ranging anywhere from 100 to 900 per test6 these tests are termed recreational in deference to and in contrast with genetic tests performed fo r health or forensic purposes broadly there are three types of genetic ancestry tests available chromosome testing mitochondrial dna mtdna testing and autosomal ma rker testing since the chromosome is passed down essentially unchanged from fa ther to chromosome testing of male can help to determine the origin of pa ternal ancestors mitochondrial dna on the other hand is passed down from mother to child unchanged therefore mtdna testing of an individual may be used to help determine th origin of maternal ancestors importantly mtdna or the chro mosome represents only small portion of an individuals total dna the third type of testing autosomal marker testing utilizes markers located on autosomes nonsex chromo somes it is currently offered by company called dnaprint genomics autosomal marker testing is the most challenging type of testing since it requires substantial amount of data to ensure the accurate interpretation of the results scientific considerations despite the recent proliferation of commercially available genetic ancestry tests the literature has reported several scientific limitations to current tests7 these limitations are important because they raise certain policy issues as discussed in the next section genetic ancestry testing cannot always definitively determine the ethnicity or geographical location of an indi viduals ancestors scientists point out that we have very limited genetic data ava ilable from the ethnic groups in frica less than 1 have been analyzed and that the migration of africans makes it difficult to match african americans to exact ethnic groups8 they also note that some less common lineages can be traced to particular ethnic groups or cales but that tracing the more commonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22830crs3 9 shriver md and ra kittles genetic an cestry and the search for personalized genetic histories nature reviews 5611617 2004 10 ely b et africanamerican

found that about 50 of the africanamericans were match to multiple african ethnic groups 40 did not match any sequence in the da tabase and only 10 were perfect match for single african ethnic group10 difficulty determining an individuals exact ethnic match has generated mixed results for consumers henry louis gates jr who has done mu ch to draw public attention to genetic ancestry testing with his pbs special african american lives reportedly had testing performed twice he was first told that his maternal ancestors were most likely egyptian nubian the second test conclude d that his maternal ancestors were most likely european11 ron nixon new york times journalist reports that he had his dna tested by multiple companies and was told that he was match with the mende and kru people from liberia the songhai in mali various ethnic groups from mozambique and angola and the bambara from mali while some of these ancestral links were confirmed by multiple tests each additional test also indicated several unique links of its own12 as these reports demonstrate pinpointing ones an cestral ethnicity may be difficult and often not possible using current genetic testing techniques the accuracy of genetic ancestry testing is dependent on the size and sampling of the database used to match test samples to populations or ge ographical regions scientists note that many databases that are derived from published research are too small and lack samples in certain geographical regions13 at this point in time because of limited data the interpretation of test re sults often relies on signifi cant amount of inference the information provided by these tests therefore is only probabilistic in nature and is not definitive in addition scientifically suspect infe rences may sometimes be made such as assuming that specific genetic variation is diagnostic of partic ular population when it may also be present in many othe r populations just at lower rates14 in other words an individual may carry particular variant or pattern of variation and be told that he or she definitely has ancestors belonging to s ubpopulation where that particular variant or pattern of variation is common however b ecause the particular variant or pattern of variation may in fact be pres ent in other populations albeit at lower rates it is possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22830crs4 15 coleman t

17 ibid 18 ibidalthough less so that he or she has ances tors belonging to this group as well or exclusively the possibility for subjectivity in the interpretation and presentation of results concerns some scientis ts while others maintain that appropriate methods used in rigorous manner may achieve valid results although with clear limitations that should always be communicated to the consumer15 lineagebased testing that is testin g of the mtdna or chromosome examines only small percentage of an individua ls total dna and th erefore provides limited information about an individua ls complete ancestry one major disadvantage of lineagebased analyses is that they focus on single maternal or paternal lineage and therefore neglect the contribution of the vast ma jority of an individuals ancestors to their genome16 this testing may be informative in certain cases but scientists stress that some customers may lack the understanding that their maternal and paternal lineages do not necessarily represent th eir entire genetic makeup17 policy considerations genetic ancestry testing raises several policy considerations these include concerns about directtoconsumer ma rketing of the tests rein forcement of scientifically questionable ideas about the re lationship between race and ge netics and privacy of the test results directtoconsumer testing although genetic ancestry tests are not health related genetic tests they are nonetheless very complex tests that provide qualified information about issues of si gnificant social and personal im portance such as racial or ethnic identity or geographical origin the results of such tests are highly qualified and the public may not fully appreciate these limitations in the absence of thorough pretest education on the part of the company offeri ng the testing companies often argue that directtoconsumer testing em powers individuals and this premise may be true but is predicated on providing the consum er with complete information in addition concern with any directtoc onsumer marketed genetic test is that it might exploit particularly vulne rable groups of people such as the elderly the infirm or those with personal or family history of dis ease in the case of genetic ancestry testing some africanamericans have b een seeking out testing in an attempt to learn more about history that was obscured by the slave trade africanamericans pursuing the identification of their ancestral communities is in fact cited as the most prominent example of those seeking genetic ancestry testing18 understandably the emotional investment in seeking and finding such information may result in less critical appraisalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22830crs5 19 amy harmon seeking ancestry in dna ties uncovered by tests new york times april 12 2007 20 dna testing and native americans h 809 19992000 sess vermont legislatureof the test or acknowledgment of its limitations appropriate pretest education may help address this issue proprietary databases currently many companies performing genetic ancestry testing maintain proprietary databases of sequences that are used to make matches with test takers dna sample from commerc ial perspective ma intaining proprietary databases is unders tandable however in terms of producing more reliable analysis of ancestry pooling data might be more pr oductive approach in addition the propriety nature of the databa ses makes an open assessment of scientific cla ims about test difficult interaction with existing policy some national policies have as their goal fair compensation for individuals who were disa dvantaged due to thei r racial or ethnic affiliation especially since r acial and ethnic affiliation are often culturally determined as well as selfreported ancestry sting might undermine the social goals of these policies for example the new york times reports that some white skinned applicants have applied as minority candidates for both em ployment opportunities and college admission based on results of ge netic ancestry tests19 this is illustrative of the problems that genetic ancestry testing may create for social policy it also clearly demonstrates the problems inherent in equating race with genetics discussed below there is some concern that genetic ancestry testing may become requirement for receiving benefits based on racial or ethnic background this is particularly concern with respect to native american ancestry in 2000 bill was introduced in the vermont legislature recommending that the commissioner of health establish standards and procedures for dnahla testing to determine the identity of an individual as native american at the request and the expense of the individual the results of such testing shall be conclusive proof of the native american ancestry of the individual20 the bill did not pass and triggered criticism by some who maintained that it would potentially allow genetic identity to supercede cultu rally determined one proponents of the bill stated that it was meant to allow genetic tes ting to be used as an additional method for determining native american heritage not to replace culturally and socially determined heritage race genetics and ancestry the relationship between race genetics and geographical origin is extremely complex and the subject of significant academic debate experts in anthropology and sociology maintain that race is social and cultural concept race they argue has been defined by obser vable ie phenotypic traits such as skin color or eye shape which have been arbitrar ily vested with degree of social importance or relevance thus race is viewed by thes groups as fluid concept whose definition has been influenced more by social and historical forces than by true genetic differences to some degree race correlates with patterns of genetic variation but this correlation is seen primarily when race acts as proxy for geographical origin geographical origin does reliably correlate with specific patterns of genetic diversity reflecting the evolution of specific genetic variants or patterns of variation in early human populations

ibidbesides the scientific concer ns about geneticizing race social concerns are raised as well attempts have been made in the past to inaccurately use the science of genetics to legitimize various prejudiced policies and positions21 for example claims have been made that genetically based differences in iq exist between different races22 in this social context genetic ancestry testing may create false impression in the public that race is primarily genetic in nature genetic ancestry testing for race and ethnicity implies that race and ethnicity may be uncove red utilizing genetic test premise that many argue is false23 this could serve to reinforce common misconceptions that there is biological basis for differences between racial groups this misconception might be employed to support policies that claim that differences between racial groups are inherent and therefore unable to be addresse d or remedied through social policy this is particularly relevant with respect to hea lth disparities policy because ch policy attempts to redress differences in health outcomes by race privacy finally the information generated by genetic ancestry testing is not viewed as personally identifiable health info rmation and so is not protected under federal privacy protections pursuant to the hea lth information portability and accountability act24 the results of genetic ancestry tests do not fall under the definition of protected health information under the privacy rule and testing companies do not fall under the definition of covered entities under the privacy rule protecting the privacy of the results of these tests is at the discretion of the company offering the test for example at the company family tree dna dna sample s are barcoded in order to protect an individuals identity customers are asked if they will provide their consent to the banking of their dna for future testing and of more than 70000 individuals undergoing testing only two requested that their samples be destroyed25 this raises several important issues first even if samples are barcoded to protect individuals identities they may be linked to personally identifiable information held by the company in order to facilitate future testing second given the extr emely low number of individuals requesting that their dna sample be destroye d questions naturally arise about the degree of education that companies provide to cust omers during the consent process one senior research scientist noted that how much responsibility company has in educating potential client prior to sample submissi on and credit card number is value judgment matter26 third and finally as these databases grow in size they will grow in potential value as well family tree dna maintains that its database currently is not for sale however as its size and potential value increas this may be rea ssessed on the other hand as the databases grow in size their value to individual companies may be greater if they are kept proprietary
