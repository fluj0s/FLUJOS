confidence in election outcome classified by dcm nancy mceldowney for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary experts on civilmilitary relations in ankara contend the turkish general staff tgs is satisfied with the process set in motion by its april 27 warning and the constitutional courts subsequent decision on the presidency vote which brought turkey to early elections analysts claim that the military and prosecular opposition parties buoyed by mass prosecular demonstrations in may and june believe that even if the akp emerges from july 22 elections able to form singleparty government it will be forced to accept consensus candidate for the presidency despite these claims of confidence the military continues to work to exploit debate over crossborder operation against pkk terrorists as well as press allegations that the us is either directly or indirectly providing weapons to the pkk to make the akp government appear weak on security and of course there is the possibility of last ditch attempt by the military via public statements policy maneuvering or partisan manipulation to sway undecided voters towards secular opposition parties military reaction to the elections may be affected by the tgss allconsuming annual exercise of the supreme military council which starts august 1 end summary 2 c the crisis atmosphere following the tgss april 27 warning which led many to fear some kind of military intervention has been replaced by more traditional politicking in the final stretch to july 22 national elections after public sparring with the government in may and june over who would take responsibility for crossborder operation against pkk terrorists in northern iraq designed to show the akp government as soft on terrorism the tgs has refrained from public statements on domestic political issues for the past two weeks chief of defense gen buyukanit and deputy chod saygun enjoyed scheduled vacations on the coast in late june and early july 3 c according to ankara university professor tanel demirel the tgs achieved its primary shortterm objective via the april 27 announcement preventing abdullah gul from becoming president and ensuring constitutional court ruling raising the vote threshold for president to 367 the head of the secular and nationalist ataturk thought association add retired general sener eruygur pointed to the large turnout at prosecular rallies in istanbul izmir and other cities as proof prosecular forces are rising to challenge the akp 4 c several observers such as bilkent university professor and military analyst umit cizre identify the pivotal moment in the akps relations with the military as the private may 4 meeting between pm erdogan and chod buyukanit at the dolmabahce palace in istanbul although cizre and other analysts are not sure what happened during the 25 hour session they conclude that buyukanit and erdogan reached some understanding ankara university professor nuran yildiz believes buyukanit made military red lines over the presidency clear to erdogan at that encounter all agree that the situation relaxed considerably after that 5 c analysts views vary widely on the significance of the militarys april 27 internet warning that it was ready to intervene to protect turkeys secular democracy cizre and demirel believe the april 27 statement was both harmful and unnecessary since the constitutional court was poised anyway to affirm 367 quorum requirement for the presidency and thus defeat guls candidacy precipitating early elections yildiz and others including retired general riza kucukoglu at ankaras eurasian studies institute asam assert the military has played its role correctly in counterbalancing akp attempts to monopolize all major power centers even critics of the militarys announcement such as ankara university professor bedriye poyraz believe that the akp provoked military intervention by blatant attempts to fill ankara 00001842 002 of 002 the government bureaucracy with its supporters and its illconsidered nomination of gul for president they acknowledge that despite criticism of the militarys intervention by some intellectuals and pundits most turks see it as natural if not appropriate for the generals to make their political views known 6 c looking at postelection scenarios most observers with whom we have spoken tell us the military can live with another akp government as long as the president is secular figure selected by consensus the prospect of the akp cooperating with independent kurdish deputies in order to form government is more controversial as this would bring together the military and secular establishments two archenemies islamists and separatists while cizre believes the generals could tolerate an alliance of akp and kurdish independents as long as the president is secular adds eruygur termed such an alliance nightmare for turkey asams kucukoglu asserted that the military would be uncomfortable with independent kurdish mps citing their past behavior in the early 1990s the previous iteration of prokurdish mps attempted to take the parliamentary oath in turkish and made statements that triggered the lifting of their parliamentary immunity and eventual prosecution he claimed however that military coups are longer necessary now that the majority of turks who favor secularism have found their voice 7 c comment despite analysts claims of military confidence the generals are clearly working behind the scenes using ongoing pkk terrorism and the debate over the necessity of crossborder operation into northern iraq to portray the akp as weak on terrorism we also detect the militarys hand behind recent allegations that the us has either directly or indirectly provided weapons to the pkk in northern iraq this is also designed to weaken akps national security credentials and encourage undecided voters to turn to tougher prosecular parties while the military could roil the waters and make public statement on the elections at any time its postelection reaction may be delayed by the august 1 start of annual and allconsuming supreme military council yas promotions and assignments deliberations end comment visit ankaras classified web
