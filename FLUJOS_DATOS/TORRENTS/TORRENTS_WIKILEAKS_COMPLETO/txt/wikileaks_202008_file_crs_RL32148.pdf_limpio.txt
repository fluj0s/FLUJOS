to the majority and minority parties in manner that corre sponds closely to the party strength in the full chamber this repor t provides an overview of senate standing committee sizes and ratios for 11 congresses 98th through 108th also included are data on select committees with legislativ jurisdiction for each congress table shows the total number of seats on each co mmittee the number of seats assigned to the majority and minority pa rties and where present the number of seats assigned to independents the tables also provide the number of majority and minority seats on each committee as percentages of the total and majorityminor ity seat margins in the chamber in the total number of committee seats and on each individual committee the percentage of committee seats held by the majority is compared with its full chamber strength during the 11 congresses the sizes of committees have generally increased as have the number of committee assignments senator typically receives data from this study indicate that the majority party ratios on committees roughly approximate the majority party strength in the senate chamber regardless of which party is in control with very slight overrepresen tation on overall total committee seats the data also suggest that the narrower the majorityminority party margin in the chamber the tighter the control the majority exerts in

first official list prepared excluding preliminary lists under the direction of the secretary of the senate as senate public ation most of the lists were issued in the spring of the first session of each congress in the 99th congress the list used as source was marked preliminary as were all the lists published during the first session of that congress the dates of the publications are f ootnoted at the end of each table as noted the 107th congress is an exception due to the unusual circumstances of the equally divided senate 2at the beginning of the 107th congress the senate was divided equally between republicans and democrats as result demo crats chaired all committees for the first 17 days of the session and republicans assumed the committee chairmanships following the inauguration of vice president richard cheney an historic powersharing agreement sres 8 was presented by party leaders and agreed to on jan 5 2001 in june 2001 after one republican announced his intention to become an independent the republicans were reduced to 49 seats and the democrats with 50 seats gained control of the senate provision of sres 120 agreed to on june 29 2001 gave the majority one seat advantage on each senate committee except for the ethics committee the resolution further provided that senator would lose committee seat by virtue of the resolution for more details

party ratios 98th108th congresses the standing rules of the senate are silent regarding committee party ratios the majority and minority leaders in consu ltation determine the apportionment of the committee seats to each party they imple ment this agreement through resolutions electing senators to committees this report provides an overview and data on senate standing committee party ratios the 98th through 108th congresses 1983 2005 in addition to the standing co mmittees data on permanent select committees with legislative jurisdiction are also included sources and method assignment data for each senate committee for the 98th through the 108th congresses were taken from the official committee assignment lists issued by the secretary of the senate after assignments were made in each congress1 data for the 107th congress reflect committee ratios established after the senate reorganization in june 2001as result of th switch in party control2 the numbers on overall party strength in the senate for each congress are taken from the same lists issued by the secretary of the senate the tables at the end of the report provide data for each senate standing committee and permanent select committees with legislative jurisdictions table for each of the 11 congresses covered in this report reflects the committees ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32148crs2 3all percentages are calculated by computer and reflect rounding 4it is to be noted that these are not the only sources and methodologies available and that the use of alternate sources or methodologie s will yield different data and findingsestablished and titled in that congress the tables indicate the total number of seats on each committee as well as the number assigned to the majority and minority parties and where present to independents the majo rity and minority seats on each committee are also shown as percentages of the total which do not add to 100 when independents are present also include d are 1 the chambers majorityminority distribution 2 the total number of committ ee seats controlled by each party and 3 party strength on each individual committee the majority percentage of total committee seats is compared to the majo rity percentage of the full senate3 vacancies on committees as noted in the secretarys lists are counted in individual and overall committee totals for consistency the following statistical information and selected analyses are based on the tables to illustrate trends over time and to highlight varia tions from traditional practices4 comparative analysis of ratios the data shows that the majority pa rty has generally overrepresented itself slightly in making committee assignments in most congresses with the exception of the committee on ethics on which equal party strength is required and the select committee on intelligence which by rule has oneseat majority edge in nine of the 11 congresses the majority had s light overrepresentation as calculated in percentage points from the 98th to the 108th congresses the majority ratio in committee compared to its strength in th senate chamber ranged from an under representation of 037 per centage points in the 102nd congress to an over representation of 170 per centage points in the 108th congresses during five congresses of this period the majority party had substantial numerical advantage in two congresses 102nd and 103rd the majority was under represented on committees compared with its overall strength in the senate in the 102nd congress the majority was unde rrepresented on committees by 037 percentage points in the 103rd congress the majority was underrepresented on committees in which it was underrepresented by 009 percentage points these two congresses constitute two of the widest majorityminority seat margins in the period examined 12 seats in the 102nd congress and 14 seats in the 103rd in three other congresses 101st 105th and 106th when the majorityminority seat margin was 10 in each congress the majority overre presentation on committees was 005 019 and 016 respectively by comparison in the other six congresses where the senate party strengths have been closer majo rity party overrepresentation in committees has been greater httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32148crs3 108th congress and 107th congresses with 51 senate seats in the 108th congress the majority holds 5270 of the committee seats compared to the minority s 48 senate seats and 4622 of the committee seats the majority was overrepresented on committees in the 108th congress by 170 percentage points with 50 senate seats in the 107th congress after june 2001 the major ity held 5134 of the committee seats compared to the minoritys 49 senate seats and 4758 of the committee seats the majority was overrepresented on committees in the 107th congress by 134 percentage points from the 107th congress to the 108th congress the total number of committee seats dropped from 372 to 370 seats at th same time the majority gained two additional seats committee sizes the size of committees during the 11 congresses covered by this report ranged from six ethics to 29 appropriations the size of committee is factor in calculating ratios by percentage the smaller the size of the committee the greater percentage point difference change of one seat makes for example mathematically speaking in the current 51 to 49 majorityminority margin oneseat advantage for the majority at eight seats to the minoritys seven on committee of 15 members as on the committee of indian affairs in the 108th congress translates into majority overrepresen tation of 233 percentage points in contrast on the committee on appropriations the largest committee in the 108th congress the majoritys oneseat advantage over the minority 15 to 14 resulted in an over representation of 072 percentage points in the 100th congress when the majority had 54 seats compared to the minoritys 46 in the full chamber the aggregate majority committee seat percentage exceeded its strength in the chamber by 077 percentage point on the sixmember ethics committee which has equal representati on the majoritys ratio was calculated at 400 percentage points less than its strength in the senate in this same congress the majority was overrepresented by 850 percentage points on the committee on indian affairs then known as the speci committee on indian affairs the committee had total of eight seats with fi veto three majorityminority allocation this committee almost doubled in size to total of 15 seats in the 108th congress while the majority overrepresentation decr eased to 233 percentage points these examples illustrate the importance of taki ng into consideration the size of the committee and its impact on the percentage point calculations committee totals since the 98th congress the sizes of senate committees have generally increased as has the number of committee assignments senator typically receives total committee seats in the 11 congre sses covered ranged from 312 99th congress to 372 107th congress senate ru xxv paragraph 4 gene rally limits to three the number of standing committee assignments an individual senator may have the growth in overall committee assignments during the period covered shows 60httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32148crs4 additional seats added to senate committees the result is that senators now serve on average on nearly four standing committees each generally the growth in assignments reflects the interests of senators in serving on more committees and the need for party leaders to seek waivers of assignment limits to assure working control for the majority on critical committees committee seat margins over this period during these 11 cong resses the major ityminority party advantage in the full senate ranged from one seat the s econd half of the first session of the 107th congress to 14 102nd congress the data appear to indicate that the closer the majorityminority seat margin in the senate the greater the likelihood of majority overrepresentation on committees and the higher the percentage point difference between total committee and chamber ratios in the 108th congress with majorityminority margin of three seats 51 republicans 48 democrats and 1 independent the majority committee party ratio when compared with its strength in th chamber has an overrepresentation of 170 percentage points this was the major ity partys highest percentage point over representation during this period 98th 108th congresses in the closely divided 107th congress 50 democrats 49 republican s 1 independent after june 2001 reorganization the majority overrepr esentation was 134 percentage points conversely the greater advantage of th majority in the full senate the more likely it is to be underrepresented in co mmittee strength for example in the 102nd congress the majorityminority seat marg in in the senate was 14 the aggregate majority committee party ratio was less than its strength in the senate by 037 percentage points the majority was also underrepresented slightly at 009 percentage points in the 103rd congress when the majorityminority seat margin in the chamber was 12 during these two cong resses the majority was slightly under represented on nearly half of individual committees during the period surveyed the majo rityminority margins on individual committees with the exception of the ethics and intelligence committees and the unusual circumstances of the 107th congress ranged from one to three seats two seat margin on most committees regardless of the margin in the senate was more common in the congresses prior to the 107th congress when there were independent members in the 107th and 108th congresses most committees had oneseat majorityminority margin that reflected the very close margin in the party strength in the senate chamber prospects for the future an examination of the committee ratios surveyed shows trend the majority party ratios on committees roughly approximate majority party strength in the senate chamber regardless of which party is in control with very slight over representation on overall total committee seats the data further suggest that the narrower the majorityminority party margin in the chamber the tighter the controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32148crs5
