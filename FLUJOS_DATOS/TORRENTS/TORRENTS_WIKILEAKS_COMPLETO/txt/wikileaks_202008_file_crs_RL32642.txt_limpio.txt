jobbased and personbased employment and unemployment estimates october 19 2004 julie m whittaker analyst in applied microeconomics domestic social policy congressional research service the library of congress employment statistics differences and similarities in jobbased and personbased employment and unemployment estimates summary employment statistics are key indicators of the performance of the economy measuring how many jobs exist in the economy as well as how individuals fare in the labor market payroll employment estimates track the number of wage and salary jobs created and lost in the economy in comparison to this jobbased measure unemployment statistics measure the quantities and ratios of those individuals who are employed or unable to find employment despite actively seeking jobs this paper defines and distinguishes two commonly used groups of employment estimates payroll employment derived from jobbased survey and employment and unemployment derived primarily from personbased survey statistics third unemployment statistic derived from the unemployment compensation system the insured unemployment rate is less frequently used as it excludes many groups of workers the report then examines two somewhat counterintuitive situations how there may be aggregate job loss with decreased unemployment rates and how increased payroll employment does not necessarily imply decreased unemployment payroll employment figures are estimated from survey of employers in non farm industries these figures directly correspond to each individual job held within the economy and not to individual workers particular worker may hold more than one position and each of those jobs will be counted as separate position increasing the total number of jobs reported through the payroll employment estimates in comparison individual employment and unemployment statistics measures are based on individuals and their labor force status the individual statistics are derived from the noninstitutionalized civilian population the selfemployed those temporarily absent from work but who have job and certain farm workers are also counted as workers although their positions are not counted by payroll employment worker may have one or more jobs but will be counted only once as employed while worker without any job will be considered unemployed although it may seem reasonable to expect that as the number of payroll jobs increases there would be similar trend in the number of persons employed the job based measure of payroll employment does not require that the personbased

employment statistics are key indicators of the performance of the economy measuring how many jobspositions exist in the economy as well as how individuals fare in the labor market these estimates receive substantial congressional attention and are used in policy decisions in many areas including economic stimulus packages extending of unemployment compensation benefits and funding of employment and training programs typically these statistics are reported in one of two basic forms payroll employment statistics and individual unemployment statistics payroll statistics track the number of filled jobs in the economy and may be used to infer job creation and loss unemployment statistics measure the quantities and ratios of people in the labor market who are actively working or seeking jobs these statistics are used to estimate the unemployment rate as well third type of unemployment statistic derived from the unemployment compensation system the insured unemployment rate is less frequently used as it excludes many important groups of workers this report explains the data sources used to calculate payroll employment and individual employment and unemployment estimates the report also examines several somewhat counterintuitive situations explaining how there may be aggregate job loss with decreased unemployment rates and how increased payroll numbers do not necessarily imply decreased numbers of unemployed persons creation of payroll employment and unemployment statistics payroll employment statistics and unemployment statistics receive increased attention during and immediately after recessions occur1 these statistics are useful indicators of how the overall economy and how individuals within the economy are faring for example increasing unemployment rates imply that some of the labor input human capital available to the economy is not used suggesting production 1 calculations of the timing of the business cycle and subsequent designations of recessions or recoveries place substantial weight on output measures with only some weight on the payroll employment statistics see httpnberorgcyclesrecessionshtmlfaq for more information crs2 andor efficiency losses2 likewise measures of payroll employment and the unemployment numbers are important in quantifying the substantial costs experienced by workers and their families from the loss of job as well as associated losses experienced by society these worker and family costs include loss of income the scarring effect from prolonged periods of joblessness3 and potentially significant psychological and emotional costs societal costs include increased payments of unemployment compensation benefits and other pressures on the social welfare system and potential increases in crime drug use and incarceration data sources the unemployment compensation uc system measures the number of unemployed workers covered by the uc system4 however uc records which many people think are the source of total unemployment data relate only to persons who have applied for uc benefits since it is both impractical to actually count every unemployed person each month and equally impractical to measure the number of jobs in each firm the federal government conducts two monthly sample surveys the current population survey cps and the current employment statistics survey ces both of these data sources are survey based and therefore the statistics generated by these surveys are estimates from samples rather than actual counts cps5 the cps is monthly survey of households conducted by the bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics and designed to represent the civilian noninstitutional population of the united states the cps approximately 50000 households includes certain farm and domestic workers the selfemployed persons working 15 hours or more week as unpaid workers in familyoperated business employees of certain nonprofit organizations and railroad workers the cps also counts employees uncompensated because of temporary absence or strikes but excludes workers under 16 years old it provides comprehensive body of data on persons in the labor force their employment and unemployment and persons not in the labor force 2 okuns law is often used to estimate the size of economic loss from unemployment it estimates that for every one percentage point increase in unemployment gross domestic product drops by 2 see crs report rs21139 unemployment and economic growth by brian cashell 3 employers may regard long spells of unemployment as an indicator about workers potential productivity causing scarring effect workers may experience decreased chances of finding new jobs and ascending their career ladder maura sheehan and mike tomlinson unemployment duration in an unemployment blackspot labour 12 winter 1998 pp 64373 4 covered employment includes all positions where the employer pays federal and state unemployment taxes on the workers wages while almost all jobs are covered by the uc program not all workers qualify for uc benfits those who file for uc benefits are different from the general unemployed population see stephen wandner and andrew stettner why are many jobless workers not applying for benefits monthly labor review june 2000 pp 2132 most of those who do not file do so because they think they are not eligible or because they are optimistic about finding employment 5 see httpwwwblscensusgovcpscpsmainhtm crs3 ces6 the ces is monthly employer survey collected from payroll records by the bureau of labor statistics with the cooperation of state agencies the sample has approximately 160000 businesses and government agencies which have about 400000 separate sites the ces collects the number of jobs as reported by establishments the survey provides information on the employment hours and earnings of jobs that exist on nonfarm payrolls in the most basic terms statistics that count the number of jobs rely upon the ces and statistics that count the number of persons employed or unemployed rely upon the cps that is statistics reporting rates of employment unemployment or that report demographic characteristics of workers will generally be from the cps the number of jobs rather than the number of workers in the economy and information about these jobs by industry will typically be calculated from the ces the cps provides measures of all types of work done by the non institutionalized civilian population including parttime work selfemployment and some farm employment in comparison the ces does not differentiate between full or parttime employment does not measure selfemployment and excludes all agricultural jobs calculation of payroll employment and employment and unemployment statistics the rule of thumb that the ces measures the number of jobs and the cps measures both the employment of workers and estimates the unemployment rate is complicated by detailed analyses and demographic breakdowns in particular for smaller geographic areas or for monthly rather than annual information these two surveys are used in conjunction with each other and may be supplemented with information from other sources including administrative information from state uc systems and the decennial census national state and local payroll employment statistics these statistics are from the ces payroll survey which as noted earlier includes employment numbers employment by industry hours and earnings information is also available for smaller geographic regions states and certain metropolitan areas these survey data are used to calculate the net number of jobs created or lost in period the jobs tallied from this information are not linked to individuals but rather to firms and industries generally these data are released in the bls publication the employment situation in their preliminary form on the first friday of the following month national employment and unemployment statistics and unemployment rate national estimates of the number of employed and unemployed as well as the unemployment rate are calculated using data collected in the cps the cps is nationally representative household survey and includes employment and unemployment of the noninstitutionalized civilian population by age sex race and ethnicity the unemployment statistics are defined by individuals 6 see httpstatsblsgovceshomehtm crs4 who have responded to survey questions that indicate they have 1 searched for work in the previous four weeks and 2 were unable to find position generally these data are released in the bls publication the employment situation on the first friday of the following month state and local employment and unemployment local area unemployment statistics while survey information collected for the national unemployment rate cps includes information on geography these data may need to be supplemented with up to three other information sources the ces the census and state uc information in order to obtain statistical significance state and local employment and unemployment estimates are calculated from combination of these different sources depending on the size of the population of the particular area annual average data for all states the district of columbia new york city nyc and the angeleslong beach metropolitan areas are estimated directly from the cps monthly estimates for these areas are produced using estimating equations based on regression techniques these models combine current and historical data from the cps the ces and state uc data generally these data are released on the third friday of the following month estimates monthly and annual for smaller labor market areas below the state level including metropolitan statistical areas other than nyc or counties cities of at least 25000 and cities and towns in new england regardless of population are estimated by procedure that uses techniques based on inputs from the decennial census annual population estimates and current state uc data generally these data are released on the fourth wednesday of the next month the total unemployment rate tur and insured unemployment rate iur what is the total unemployment rate tur the total unemployment rate tur is simply another name for the unemployment rate derived from the cps data what does the insured unemployment rate iur measure statistics on insured unemployment in the united states are collected as byproduct of the unemployment compensation program workers who lose their jobs and are covered by the programs typically file claims which serve as notice that they are beginning period of unemployment those who qualify for benefits are counted in the insured unemployment statistic the insured unemployment rate iur what is the difference between the iur and the tur the iur is substantially different than the tur because it excludes several important groups selfemployed workers unpaid family workers workers in certain notforprofit organizations and several other primarily seasonal worker categories in addition to those unemployed workers whose last jobs were in the excluded kinds of employment the insured unemployed exclude the following those who have exhausted their uc benefits new entrants or reentrants to the labor force crs5 disqualified workers whose unemployment is considered to have resulted from their own actions rather than from economic conditions and eligible unemployed persons who do not file for benefits because of these and other limitations statistics on insured unemployment cannot be used as count of total unemployment in the united states in 1988 for example when there were virtually extended unemployment benefits paid to persons who had otherwise exhausted their benefits the number receiving uc benefits represented only 31 of the total unemployed in 1992 when extended uc benefits were in effect this proportion was 51 definitions of employment to better understand the various definitions used in calculating the payroll employment and unemployment statistics it is important to clearly define various employment concepts as they will have direct implications for the usefulness of the statistics table 1 below lists the manner in which the cps and ces define various employment concepts the first column lists the generally accepted title for the employment concept for the individualbased estimates the third column lists the titles for the jobbased estimates the second column lists the definition according to the cps and the fourth column lists the definition according to the ces in the labor force and out of the labor force the cps considers all noninstitutionalized civilian individuals 16 and older who either currently have job or who have looked for work in the previous four weeks to be in the labor force all others are considered to be out of the labor force the ces does not measure employment from the perspective of the individual but rather measures paid employment in certain industries all positions counted in the payroll survey may represent persons who according to the cps are in the labor force however not all persons in the labor force ie the unemployed or the self employed will be represented by the payroll statistics employed in the cps an individual who is paid for working at least 1 hour or who worked 15 hours without pay in familyowned business during the previous week is considered to be employed an individual is also counted as employed even if he or she is on vacation not at work due to temporary illness on temporary unpaid leave or involved in strike unlike the ces the cps counts individuals only one time even if they hold more than one job payroll employment in comparison the ces tallies each job that exists within each sampled firm toward estimating aggregate payroll employment statistics if the position paid worker for working any portion of the reference pay period the pay period that includes the 12th of the month position is omitted from this tally if the person did not receive pay for the entire reference pay period employees working at more than one job therefore appearing on more than one payroll would be counted separately for each appearance all positions counted by payroll employment have persons who may qualify as being employed according to the cps definition however not all employed persons as defined in the cps eg the self employed will have their positions counted in the payroll employment statistics crs6 unemployed the cps measures unemployment by defining those workers to be unemployed if they do not have job but have searched for work in the previous four weeks and are available to work the unemployment rate is the ratio of unemployed persons to the total number of persons in the labor force job loss and job gain the ces does not measure the number of unemployed persons instead the ces data from current and previous periods may be used to calculate the net job loss gain from one period to the next an increase in the unemployment rate generally would imply an expected decrease in the payroll employment numbers however this is not always true more detailed explanation of how this occurs appears later in this paper involuntarily parttime7 in the cps involuntary parttime workers are those who report working fewer hours than they wish either due to fewer hours allotted by the employer or because they were unable to find fulltime work since these workers have reported at least one hour of work in the survey week they are considered to be in the labor force and to be employed in the ces each paid position regardless of the number of hours is counted as payroll employment in effect the ces does not measure jobs that have persons who are working less hours than they wish involuntarily parttime any differently than other jobs within the survey sample discouraged workers8 in the cps these are people currently without job but who have expressed desire to work and have searched for work in the past year however they have made effort to find job in the past four weeks due to either perceived lack of jobs or perceived inability to get job due to some personal factor such as lack of skills or education these persons are considered to be out of the labor force and are not included in calculations of unemployment statistics the us bureau of labor statistics does however calculate alternatives to the official unemployment rate which do include discouraged workers among others in their measures as these workers do not hold paid position the ces data do not include them 7 see crs report 98695 parttime job growth and the labor effects of policy responses by linda levine 8 see crs report rl322292 offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity among us workers by linda levine there is often some misunderstanding surrounding the difference between discouraged and

8 2004 notice that the number of employed persons 139480000 was greater than the number of jobs reported by the ces 131567000 the p indicates that the number is preliminary and is subject to revision since agricultural workers estimated seasonally unadjusted to be 2374000 selfemployed workers 9616000 and unpaid family members 90000 work in jobs that are not included in the ces estimates but are considered to be crs8 workers by the cps it is reasonable to find that the ces number of jobs is less than the number of employed workers according to the cps from august 2004 to september 2004 the number of persons who were employed was estimated to have dropped by 19000 in comparison the net number of jobs added to the economy according to the ces increased by 96000 table 2 example the

employment statistics as reported by the cps and ces in general the cps accounts for more persons working than the ces calculates for the number of jobs in the economy this is in part attributable to inclusion in the cps of selfemployed workers and few other types of workers whose jobs are not measured by the ces while the overall pattern between the cps and ces employment estimates has been fairly consistent the difference between the two surveys narrowed in the late 1990s but has been increasing in the 2000s in particular while the cps consistently has estimated job growth during this period this trend is not reflected with the same consistency in the ces9 9 for information on the path of payroll employment following the 2001 recession see crs report rl32047 the jobless recovery

labor statistics data from the current population survey cps and current employment statistics ces crs10 how falling employment and growing payroll employment may coexist it may be confusing when economic indicators such as payroll employment statistics employment numbers and unemployment rates seem to suggest opposite trends tables 3 and 4 below demonstrate how this outcome occurs because of the underlying definitions of the unemployment rate and payroll employment that measure employment in very different ways in any given economy it is possible for both the number of employed persons and the unemployment rate to increase at the same time within the same household survey the cps an interesting case to illuminate this point can be found in studying the growth of hispanic employment shown in table 3 below table 3 hispanic employment and unemployment rate 2000 and 2003 labor force employed unemployed unemployment year thousands thousands thousands rate 2000 16689 15735 954 57 2003 18813 17372 1441 77 difference 2124 1637 487 20 percentage 127 104 510 351 change source crs table created using bls statistics calculated from the cps hispanic employment increased by 1637000 persons between 2000 and 2003 but the hispanic rate of unemployment increased from 57 to 77 the explanation is that at the same time as 1637000 new jobs filled by hispanics were added to the economy approximately 2124000 hispanics entered the workforce the growth in employment was more than offset by the number of new job seekers entering or returning to the labor market on average the labor force grows at approximately 1 per year as result employment must grow at least at that same rate 1 to prevent an increase in the unemployment rate it is typical for the unemployment rate to continue to rise after recessions end such as occurred after november 2001 this may be because some persons reenter the labor force with the belief that job prospects have improved and thus are less willing to accept certain jobs it may also be due to other unemployed workers who are unable to find new work in substantially reconfigured labor market where their skills are longer in demand crs11 table 4 the

calculated from the cps and the ces just as table 3 demonstrated how the number of employed and the unemployment rate can increase at the same time within the same household survey table 4 delineates how the ces may have nominally increasing payroll employment while the cps has substantial decrease in number of employed persons and at the same time decreased unemployment rate in december 2003 the national unemployment rate was 57 statistically significant decrease from 59 in november 2003 at the same time the estimated number of employed decreased by approximately 54000 individuals from 138533000 to 138479000 the unemployment rate was able to decrease despite the drop in persons reporting employment because approximately 309000 persons reported that they left the labor force10 payroll employment on the other hand remained essentially the same increasing by an estimated 1000 positions 10 the number of individuals identifying themselves as discouraged workers decreased from 457000 in november to 433000 in december this decline however does not take into account any expected seasonal variations in this statistic and should be viewed with caution for other versions of this
