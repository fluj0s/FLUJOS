direction of the president and in accordance with rules prescribed by congress for most of the 19th century us law included language explicitly assigning the secretary of the navy the task of naming new navy ships1 the reference to the secretary of the navy disappeared from the us code in 19252 the code today 10 usc 7292 is silent on the issue of who has the authority to name new navy ships3 but the secretary of the navy arguably retains implicit authority given the location of 7292 in subtitle c of title 10 which covers the navy and marine corps

its nameselection process the navy cites the abovementioned laws and states as with many other things the procedures and practices involved in navy ship naming are as much if not more products of evolution and tradition than of legislation as we have seen the names for new ships are personally decided by the secretary of the navy the secretary can rely on many sources to help him reach his decisions each year the naval historical center compiles primary and alternate ship name recommendations and forwards these to the chief of naval operations by way of the chain of command these recommendations are the result of research into the history of the navy and by suggestions submitted by service members navy veterans and the public ship name source records at the historical center reflect the wide variety of name sources that have been used in the past particularly since world war i ship name recommendations are conditioned by such factors as the name categories for ship types now being built as approved by the secretary of the navy the distribution of geographic names of ships of the fleet names borne by previous ships which 1 law approved in 1819 res of march 3 1819 1 3 stat 538 7 stated that all of the ships of the navy of the united states now building or hereafter to be built shall be named by the secretary of the navy under the direction of the president of the united states in accordance with rules specifying that ships of the first class were to be named after states of the union and second and third class ships were to be named respectively after rivers and principal cities and towns law approved in 1858 act of june 12 1858 c 153 5 11 stat 319 provided similar rule for steamships of the navy except that thirdclass vessels those with fewer than twenty guns were to be named by the secretary of the navy as the president may direct taking care that two vessels in the navy shall bear the same name section 1531 of the revised statutes of 18731874 citing the 1819 and 1858 laws states the vessels of the navy shall be named by the secretary of the navy under the direction of the president in accordance with rules similar to those above varying slightly depending on wh ether the vessel was sailing sh ip or steamship in 1898 congress passed law act of may 4 1898 c 234 30 stat 390 appropriations for the naval services prescribing rules for the naming of firstclass battle ships and monitors which specified that these were to be named after states and shall not be named for any city place or persons until the names of the states shall have been exhausted the provision did not explicitly state whose dut it would be to assign names to vessels congress repealed this provision in 1908 as it pertained to monitors permitting those vessels to be named as the president may direct act of may 13 1908 c 166 35 stat 159 2 the reference to the secretary of the navy found in 1531 of the revised statutes of 18731874 see previous footnote is absent from the us code of 1925 which covers navy vessel names in title 34 461463 3 34 usc 461463 of the 1925 us code see previous footnote were later recodified as 10 usc 7292 10 usc 7292 provides that battleships are to be named for state however if the names of all the states are in use battleship may be named for city place or person it specifi cally authorizes the secretary of the navy to change the name of any vessel bought for the navy 7292c but does not explicitly assign responsibility for ensuring that two vessels have the same name 7292a or for naming battleships 7292b

and groups and names of naval leaders national figures and deceased members of the navy and marine corps who have been honored for heroism in war or for extraordinary achievement in peace in its final form after consideration at the various levels of command the chief of naval operations signs the memorandum recommending names for the current years building program and sends it to the secretary of the navy the secretary considers these nominations along with others he receives as well as his own thoughts in this matter at appropriate times he selects names for specific ships and announces them while there is set time for assigning name it is customarily done before the ship is christened 4

types of navy ships have evolved over time attack submarines for example were once named for fish then later for cities and most recently for states while cruisers were once named for cities then later for states and most recently for battles the navy states that while it has attempted to be systematic in naming its ships like all institutions it has been subject to evolutionary change and the name sources of the navys ships have not been immune to this change 5 there have been exceptions to the navys shipnaming rules particularly for the purpose of naming ship for person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else6 some observers in recent years have perceived breakdown in or corruption of the rules for naming navy ships7 for example the threeship seawolf ssn21 class of attack submarinesseawolf ssn21 connecticut ssn22 nd jimmy carter ssn 23were named for fish state and president respectively reflecting apparent rule for ship types now being procured for the navy current naming practices can be summarized as follows the 10 most recently named aircraft carriers have been named for us presidents 8 ships and members of congress 2 ships

relatives participated or for people they admire citizens with such an interest sometimes contact the navy the department of defense or congress seeking support for their proposals an october 2008

long maintained an in terest in how navy ships are named9 and has influenced the naming of certain navy ships for example one source states that the aircraft carriers cvn 72 and cvn 73 were named prior to their start of construction in part to preempt potential congressional pressure to name one of those ships for admiral hg rickover instead the attack submarine ssn 709 was named for the admiral 10 another example was rivalry of sorts in congress between those who supported naming the aircraft carrier cvn76 for president truman and those who supported naming it for president reagan the issue was effectively resolved by decision announced by president clinton in february 1995 to name one carrier cvn75 for truman and another cvn76 for reagan 11 one press report suggests that the decision to name cvn77 for president george h w bush may have been influenced by congressional suggestion12 section 1012 of the fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122pl 109364 of october 17 2006 expressed the sense of the congress that the aircraft carrier cvn78 should be named for president gerald r ford and the navy announced on january 16 2007 that cvn78 would be so name d the navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name navy ship for specific person place or thing contact the office of the secretary of the navy to make their support known congress may also pass legislation relating to ship names 8 dean lohmeyer students who helped name the navys newest sub tour states namesake navy news service october 25 2008 9 for example the 1819 and 1858 laws cited in footnote 1 set forth naming rules for certain kinds of ships today 10 usc 7292b still requires that battleships which the united states has not built since world war ii be
