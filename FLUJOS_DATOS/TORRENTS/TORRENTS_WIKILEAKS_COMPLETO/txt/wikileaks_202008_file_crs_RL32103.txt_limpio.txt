108th congress updated january 25 2005 jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress comparison of tax incentives for domestic manufacturing 108th congress summary several tax bills were introduced in the 108th congress to eliminate the extraterritorial income eti provision of the us tax code that has been found to contravene trade agreement restrictions against export subsidies by the world trade organization wto these bills contained different types of offsetting tax cuts for domestic manufacturing an early bill hr 1769 crane and rangel would have allowed percentage reduction of the corporate tax rate proportional to the domestic share of total output similar bill s 970 was sponsored by senator hollings an initial version of hr 2896 sponsored by ways and means chairman thomas would have provided accelerated depreciation for manufacturing equipment similar bill s 1475 was sponsored by senator hatch although that provision was replaced by reduction in the top corporate tax rate on manufacturing in later version of the bill the tax rate reduction is in hr 4520 the current bill passed by the house on june 17 2004 s 1637 originally sponsored by senate finance committee chairman grassley and ranking member baucus and passed by the senate on may 11 2004 would have provided rate cut similar to that in hr 1769 it would have incorporated but then phased out the provision adjusting the cut for the share of production that is domestic this bill also contained number of other provisions hr 4250 as enacted followed the senate version but with the houses expanded definition of manufacturing although the overall revenue cost of the rate cuts was larger than the effect of accelerated depreciation initially proposed in hr 2896 the provisions would have had about the same magnitude of effects on manufacturing tax burdens on new investment reducing them by about 4 the small revenue cost of accelerated depreciation could have produced similar incentive effect because it would not benefit the return to existing capital these incentive effects would have more than offset the lost benefit from the repeal of eti however the approach in hr 1769 would have had more certain and larger effect on encouraging domestic investment in manufacturing additional domestic investment would have had both direct tax benefit effect and an indirect effect through increasing the ratio of domestic to world production within manufacturing accelerated depreciation tends to introduce distortions across asset type while rate reductions particularly if confined to corporate rates reduce distortions between debt and equity and corporate and noncorporate investment accelerated depreciation and rate cuts have quite different implications for tax administration and compliance although any provision that singles out an activity to favor will encounter administrative costs in ascertaining the qualified activities accelerated depreciation applied to manufacturing assets was probably feasible to administer without great deal of additional cost however rate reduction for specific activity potentially could have led to significant increases in these costs as firms that operate in many different activities attempt to claim manufacturing status and to transfer taxable income into their manufacturing activities through distortions in withincompany transfer prices and misallocations of deductions and passive income this report will not be updated

administration and compliance 7 conclusion 9 appendix 10 comparison of tax incentives for domestic manufacturing 108th congress several bills were introduced in the 108th congress which would have eliminated the extraterritorial income tax eti provision that has been found to contravene trade agreement restrictions against export subsidies by the world trade 0rganization wto each bill included other provisions in some cases to offset the revenue gain from the provision with tax cut and in others to go beyond the offset to provide an overall net tax reduction1 each bill had provision that was specifically focused on manufacturing and was either explicitly limited to or would in effect be largely focused on domestic manufacturing the argument for providing an offsetting benefit to manufacturing was that the burden of the repeal of the eti largely falls on the manufacture of goods in the united states and in some ways the provision of benefits to domestic manufacturing was the closest way to provide general tax cuts to the firms that lose benefits in addition arguments were made that losing the export subsidy would discourage domestic production and this incentive was needed to offset the effects of eliminating the eti the enacted provision of this legislation hr 4520 following the passage of the senates version then s 1637 and the house bill hr 4520 followed the senate version which allowed deduction and would cover unincorporated firms as well as corporations however the proposal contained the broader definition of manufacturing in the house bill which included oil and gas extraction utilities construction and electricity the remainder of this report discusses the provisions in these two versions of the subsidy as well as some of the issues surrounding alternative methods of providing manufacturing subsidy in the case of the cranerangel bill hr 1769 the grassleybaucus bill s 1637 which was reported out of the senate finance committee on october 1 and the second version of hr 2896 thomas reported out of the ways and means committee on october 28 this tax benefit was provided through rate reduction in the form of deduction in hr 1769 and s 1637 through cut in the top corporate rate in hr 2896 hr 4520 passed by the house also contained the manufacturing rate cut in the case of the initial version of thomas bill hr 2896 the manufacturing tax benefit was provided via depreciation deduction the hollings s 970 bill was identical to hr 1769 and the hatch s 1475 bill was similar in many respects to the initial version of hr 2896 however the president did not include such proposal in his budget proposals 1 see crs report rl32066 taxes exports and international investment proposals in the 108th congress by david brumbaugh for additional analysis of these proposals crs2 floor amendment during consideration of s 1637 that proposed to allow credit for wages in manufacturing rather than rate reduction was defeated on may 5 2004 the final legislation followed s 1637 this report focuses on comparing the manufacturing provisions it begins with brief description of the provisions in each of the four bills and proceeds with an analysis of the general magnitude of the effect on investment incentives the allocational effects across types of investment and issues of administration and compliance descriptions of the proposals while hr 1769 focused on repealing the eti and offsetting the gain with manufacturers subsidy hr 2869 s 1637 and hr 4520 were much broader with the eti repeal and the manufacturing tax benefit only part of the bill while this paper focuses on comparing the domestic manufacturing provisions this section briefly discusses other provisions that will be referred to in the discussion of allocational effects hr 1769 hr 1769 proposed to offset the revenue loss from the repeal of eti with deduction of up to 10 of taxable income from domestic production the deduction would be multiplied by the share of the total business that is domestic thus if the capital output ratio were the same in the united states as abroad the deduction for total income would be multiplied by the share domestic squared if firm had 50 of its output domestic the effective deduction rate for domestic income would be 5 and the effective deduction overall would be 25 10 x052 hr 2896 an earlier version of hr 2896 contained provision to allow accelerated depreciation for manufacturing equipment and did not contain manufacturing tax reduction2 2 the initial version of hr 2896 proposed series of temporary and permanent provisions to offset the repeal of eti which gained 49 billion the depreciation provision cost 35 billion other provisions would have limited benefits for domestic manufacturing or are temporary the largest set of tax cuts was series of provisions benefitting earnings from foreign investment which amount to 80 to 90 billion the higher number includes an 113 billion expansion of the alternative minimum tax that would significantly benefit foreign source income all provisions were permanent with the exception of temporary provision costing 3 billion to provide tax holiday for the repatriation of earnings from abroad the bill also contained 24 billion in provisions that benefitted smaller and medium sized businesses with 2 billion temporary provision expanding equipment expensing most of the cost 195 billion would reduce corporate tax rates for smaller firms the remaining continued crs3 hr 2896 proposed series of temporary and permanent provisions to offset the phased out repeal of eti which would gain 431 billion over 20042013 all revenue estimates mentioned in this report refer to 10year period unless otherwise noted for domestic manufacturing and certain other production activities the top corporate tax rate would have been lowered from 35 to initially 34 and then 32 in 2006 and after this provision would have cost 611 billion there were number of other tax cuts and tax increases in the bill but most of them would have had limited benefits for domestic manufacturing or are temporary the largest set of tax cuts in the bill was series of provisions benefitting earnings from foreign investment which would have amounted to 392 billion including 3 billion provision to allow more complete offset of foreign tax credits losses against the alternative minimum tax amt these provisions could have provided tax cuts for firms that manufacture in the us and also manufacture abroad but their incentive effects would have been to discourage domestic production another 47 billion was associated with allowing more net operating losses against the amt and 1 billion in exempting smaller firms the bill also contained some additional provisions that would have benefitted smaller and medium sized businesses amounting to 184 billion with 2 billion temporary provision expanding equipment expensing most of the cost would have reduced corporate tax rates on taxable income initially on income below 1 million and eventually below 20 million benefits for subchapter s corporations incorporated firms treated as partnerships for tax purposes would have amounted to 13 billion since most manufacturing is carried out by large firms these benefits were unlikely to be very important to the industry provision providing more rapid depreciation for leasehold improvements and restaurants for temporary period amounting to about 21 billion would have benefitted smaller firms and would not have benefitted domestic manufacturing 11 billion was associated with employee benefits and about 1 billion was associated with series of miscellaneous business provisions the bill also would have raised about 9 billion from tax shelter provisions and 16 billion from customs fees hr 4520 hr 4520 proposed series of temporary and permanent provisions to offset the phased out repeal of eti which would gain 496 billion over 20042014 all revenue estimates in this section refer to that 11year period for domestic manufacturing and certain other production activities the top corporate tax rate 2 continued provisions involve removing more small firms from coverage of the amt and benefits for subchapter s corporations incorporated firms treated as partnerships for tax purposes provision providing more rapid depreciation for leasehold improvements and restaurants about 8 billion oneyear extension of bonus depreciation 12 billion an extension of the rd credit 23 billion an extension of net operating loss carryforwards 5 billion general provision expanding depreciation for purposes of the amt and tax provisions that raise revenues by about 9 billion by addressing tax shelters about 12 billion is raised by customs fees many of these provisions were retained in the revised version of the bill crs4 would have been lowered from 35 to initially 34 and then 32 in 2007 and after this provision would have cost 636 billion there were number of other tax cuts and tax increases in the bill but most of them would have limited benefits for domestic manufacturing or are temporary many of the other provisions of hr 4520 were similar to those in hr 2896 provisions affecting earnings on foreign source income were smaller 331 billion including 34 billion offset for the foreign tax credit against the alternative minimum tax the bill also included 35 billion cost to allow temporary lower tax on repatriation of foreign dividends there was general net operating provision although there was one for small business for small firms extension of expensing for small firms 1 billion other rate cuts 149 billion and provisions for subchapter s firms 13 billion were retained as was depreciation for leaseholds and restaurants 23 billion the bill also contained 09 billion of miscellaneous reductions 05 billion excise tax reductions and 61 billion benefit for alcohol fuels hr 4520 also extended expiring provisions 14 billion and allowed temporary deduction for state and local sales taxes 36 billion for 2005 and 2006 tax shelter provisions were much more extensive 407 billion due largely to the inclusion of leasing provisions and increasing expectations of revenue gains from restricting leasing although an earnings stripping provision was dropped customs fees would have raised 186 billion s 1637 this bill would have provided repeal of the eti raising 557 billion in revenue which would have been offset by approximately 10 billion in transition relief it would have been offset by deduction of 9 of the profits from us domestic manufacturing production costing 456 billion this deduction would have reduced the rate from 35 to 3185 this deduction would have been phased in and initially would have been affected by the domestic share of worldwide production as in hr 1769 but that effect would have been eliminated in the long run the initial bill also contained some benefits for income from overseas investment but in much smaller amount of 71 billion which included 38 billion for temporary provision allowing tax free repatriation of foreign source income additional provisions added prior to markup raised the total from 7 billion to 255 billion with an additional 113 billion added during markup for total of 38 billion thus the permanent provisions for foreign investment were about the same size as in hr 2896 but considerably smaller than the provisions in the initial version there were also numerous provisions to raise revenue including some that addressed tax shelters and in some cases these tax shelters were related to foreign activities these amounted to 25 billion before markup with another 30 billion added during markup additional provisions added before markup expanded the manufacturing deduction largely by extending it to unincorporated businesses and to oil refining and timber at cost of 141 billion and including mixture of other minor tax benefits crs5 including benefits for films and timber costing about 3 billion 14 billion of other tax cuts were added during markup number of amendments were considered during the debate on the senate floor one that would have replaced the rate reduction for manufacturing with wage credit was defeated on may 5 2004 on the senate floor the manufacturers provision was extended to filmmaking number of other provisions were adopted relating largely to tax shelter provisions the final bill as enacted into law hr 4520 followed the approach in s 1637 but expanded coverage to more types of production including property manufactured produced grown or extracted within the united states domestic film energy and construction and engineering and architectural services are specifically included although the services must be produced in the united states for construction projects located in the united states the law specifically excludes the sale of food and beverages prepared at retail establishment transmission and distribution of electricity gas and water and receipts from property leased licensed or rented to related party the deduction is limited to 50 of wages and therefore is not available to sole proprietors magnitude of effects on domestic manufacturing investment this section compares the rate reductions with each other and with accelerated depreciation while the revenue costs discussed above provide some notion of the magnitude of effects of the tax provisions they cannot easily be compared rate reductions occur each year in about the same amounts but accelerated depreciation confers its benefits primarily in timing effects the rate reductions in s 1637 and hr 4520 were phased in at the same time the initial years of the accelerated depreciation deductions in the original version of hr 2896 occurred in periods when bonus depreciation would have been in effect the revenue cost was larger without bonus depreciation than with it overall however the rate reduction in s 1637 provided larger tax benefit during the 10 year revenue estimating period and beyond than the accelerated depreciation deduction the rate reduction in s 1637 compensated for the effect of the loss of the export subsidy in manufacturing as whole although not necessarily for very export intensive firms the repeal of eti should have reduced exports which were largely manufacturing and the domestic manufacturing subsidies that offset it probably would have increased overall domestic manufacturing in the long run since the annual revenue cost in the last year for the manufacturing deduction was larger than the revenue gain from repealing eti gain in 2013 of 7 billion compared to loss from 10 billion from the original bill and another 2 billion from the additions since both the export deduction and the manufacturing deduction were of the same type reduction in current income taxes the larger size of the manufacturing crs6 incentive suggested that it more than compensated for the additional burdens the rate reduction in hr 2896 was slightly smaller at 9 billion but still larger than the eti repeal the composition of manufacturing will shift somewhat however because firms with lot of export business will suffer relative to firms with little export business the size of the cash flow effects does not mean that the overall incentive to invest in domestic manufacturing is smaller than the original accelerated depreciation provisions rate reductions reduce the return to the existing stock of assets while accelerated depreciation benefits only investment net and replacement to have the same incentive effect rate reduction would cost more in present value terms than accelerated depreciation there is way however to assess the general magnitude of the effects of these provisions at least in terms of the incentives provided to domestic investment calculations in crs report3 indicate that the initial depreciation provision in hr 2896 and the rate reductions in manufacturing in s 1637 and hr 1769 would have had about the same overall magnitude of benefits for manufacturing reducing the effective tax rate overall by about 15 percentage points assuming bonus depreciation since corporate investment is subject to current rate of around 40 this reduction is about 4 reduction it is small but so is the overall effect of repealing eti the provisions of hr 1769 would have had more pronounced effect on the provision of incentives to invest in domestic manufacturing than the other two bills for two reasons first because the subsidy is dependent on the domestic share of value added an increase in domestic investment has two effects on the tax benefit the direct effect of increase in domestic taxable income and the indirect effect of increasing the domestic share see appendix for discussion moreover there is disincentive to invest abroad there is temporary effect in s 1637 of this type as well making an incentive dependent on the domestic share of output is more feasible with rate reduction than with accelerated depreciation this analysis looks at the manufacturing subsidy in isolation the relative effect of hr 1769 on encouraging substitution of domestic for foreign investment compared to the other bills could be greater when considering the benefits for foreign source investment in s 1637 and hr 2896 indeed judging from revenue losses associated with foreign source income while hr 1769 would offset and perhaps slightly more than offset the discouraging of domestic production from the export subsidies s 1637 and hr 2896 could have encouraged an outflow of capital some of the foreign provisions however because of the way they are structured encourage domestic investment so that conclusion is unclear note also that these calculations assume bonus depreciation the independent effects of accelerated depreciation with bonus depreciation already in 3 crs report rl32099 corporate income tax revisions and effective tax rates by jane g gravelle crs7 place are about 60 as large the effects are also slightly smaller for the rate reductions while bonus depreciation has expired it is possible that such provisions could be reinstated in the presidents proposed fundamental tax reform plan of course there is an additional policy question whether it is desirable to subsidize domestic or foreign production under common standard used by economists to judge world wide economic efficiency which suggests that us owned capital is allocated most efficiently when rates of return are equated in both places the direction of change to increase economic efficiency depends on the extent to which foreign source income is undertaxed relative to us income as it is in low tax countries or overtaxed as it is in high tax countries if the objective is to maximize us economic welfare it is better to encourage domestic investment in large part because taxes on returns to domestic investment accrue to the us treasury while taxes on returns to foreign source investment may largely accrue to foreign governments this analysis assumes that foreign governments do not retaliate against us policies to discourage capital outflow there is also distributional effect while tax subsidies benefit owners of capital in general inducing investment in the united states tends to benefit domestic workers but reduces earnings of foreign workers while the opposite occurs when investment is encouraged to move abroad other effects on the allocation of capital the alternative approaches accelerated depreciation vs rate reduction would have other effects as well the accelerated depreciation provisions were restricted to equipment and were available for both debt and equity therefore within the manufacturing sector they introduced distortions in the allocation of the capital stock without reducing distortions between debt and equity finance rate cuts also reduced distortions between corporate and noncorporate sectors although there is relatively little noncorporate manufacturing the rate reduction in hr 1769 which is limited to corporations would reduce this distortion more thus based on more neutral taxation of types of investments and finance within the manufacturing sector the rate reduction is more neutral than accelerated depreciation accelerated depreciation however reduced effective tax rates more per dollar of revenue loss and therefore was more effective method of reducing the overall distortion between present and future consumption because it did not benefit existing capital issues of administration and compliance carving out special tax provision for particular industry will create some significant administrative costs both in the definition of the favored activity and the allocation of income for diversified firms crs8 definition of the favored activity can be drawn that will not give rise to some disputes about what activities are or are not manufacturing state experience with manufacturing exemptions is instructive in showing the types of disputes that may arise for example recent cases dealt with whether the mixing of paint in retail store was manufacturing how to determine the extent to which newspapers involve manufacturing the printing of the paper is manufacturing but what about the gathering and processing of content and the extent to which activities such as broadcasting onsite pizza dough making in restaurant brewing beer for brew pub and blending sand qualified as manufacturing4 these problems occur with both accelerated depreciation for manufacturing equipment and with special tax rate on manufacturing profits although they would probably be somewhat more troubling with rate reduction because capital intensity in machinery use is probably more associated with traditional manufacturing activities where little dispute would arise second and perhaps more serious problem arises with the special rate reduction many firms operate in manufacturing and in other types of business as well they may be firms with some amount of vertical integration eg operating related wholesale and retail sales or finance businesses firms may also operate different types of businesses an approach that reduces risk and some activities may have manufacturing and nonmanufacturing element such as the newspaper example discussed above these different businesses may be branches of the same entity or may be separately incorporated affiliates because of the variety of activities one cannot simply allow any firm that engages in manufacturing to take deduction for its taxable income without allocating income to the manufacturing activity in many cases neither firms nor the irs have existing experience in allocation of income and deductions across activities this problem of allocation of income has been serious and longstanding problem in our international tax system where because we do not currently tax foreign source income and do not allow unlimited foreign tax credits firms have an incentive to allocate income to the areas that minimize their tax liability two methods are used to achieve this effect first when domestic and foreign entities buy products from each other taxable income will be affected by the intercompany price charged an issue referred to as transfer pricing tax rules require an arms length price the price that would be charged by related parties but this arms length price is observable only if the items are traded in general market and in many cases such comparables do not exist secondly the firm can attempt to allocate deductions and other payments such as interest rents royalties and overhead costs in way to minimize taxable income in high tax jurisdictions great deal of time and effort on the part of taxpayers the internal revenue service and the courts is devoted to adjudicating these issues there is contrast between the complexity of accelerated depreciation versus rate reduction therefore with respect to administrative costs while carving out special depreciation rule is somewhat complicated the present depreciation system is actually linked to more detailed underlying depreciation schedule where many assets are differentiated not according to type but according to the industry in which 4 these cases were provided by matt tomalis of the federation of tax administrators crs9 they are used moreover for manufacturing equipment its use is relatively clear in most cases there are assets used across industries eg computers furniture and fixtures which were not classified by industry but by type often part of overhead costs that could present problem in the case of deduction for taxable income however all of the issues associated with transfer pricing and the allocation of passive income and deductions that have created such administrative difficulties in the international tax system would occur in the domestic us economy the rate reduction approach therefore would be more costly to administer and comply with than the accelerated depreciation deductions conclusion this analysis suggests that the rate reduction for manufacturing approach in s 1637 and the current version of hr 2896 while costing more revenue than the accelerated depreciation for manufacturing equipment in the initial version of hr 2896 and other bills has about the same effect on the overall cost of capital and the incentive to invest abroad the rate reduction in hr 1769 has the larger effect because it is multiplied by the ratio of domestic to total output feature that can be added to rate reduction approach easily but not to an accelerated depreciation approach within the manufacturing sector the rate reduction approach is more neutral and reduces other distortions particularly if confined to corporate rate reduction however the rate reduction raises much more serious issues with respect to administration and compliance than does the accelerated depreciation provision crs10 appendix the benefit b of the tax rate provision is in the case of s 1637 1 b grtkd where g is the percentage deduction t is the tax rate r is the rate of return and kd is the capital stock for purposes of small change we can hold the return fixed one could also derive the effects by expressing benefits as b gtqdwld where qd is output and ld is the labor supply and the last term in parentheses is profits this example ignores debt finance in the case of hr 1769 the benefit is 2 b grtkd dfd where d is the amount of domestic production and f is foreign production converting to logs and differentiating these equations which produces percentage changes holding g r and t constant in the case of s 1637 and with hat denoting percentage change 3 b kd the magnitude of the effects in hr 1769 depend on two issues first does the analysis involve examining the substitution of capital between domestic and foreign uses holding the total capital stock fixed or instead simply involve an additional amount of capital added secondly is the addition of capital accompanied by the same percentage addition of other inputs such as labor referred to as fixed technology case or are other factors fixed the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle in the case of hr 1769 and assuming that fixed technology of production so that percentage change in capital stock leads to percentage change in output and also assuming that capital invested in the united states is shifted from abroad total capital stock is fixed 4 b kd d 2kd in this case the effect is twice as large for hr 1769 if the domestic investment adds to the total capital stock the effect is 5 b kd d ffd kd1ffd in this case the incentive to invest domestically is actually greater for firms with large amount of foreign activity crs11 an investment abroad in isolation denoting foreign capital as kf will lead to reduction in the benefit 6 b ffd kf and if we measure the change in foreign capital as percent of domestic capital the multiplicative term in 6 will be dfd if capital expands with matching expansion of other inputs such as labor the additional effects will multiplied by the capital share of income that is substitution will lead to new version of equation 4 7 b kd ad 1akd where is the share of capital income since is typically about third the effect of the exclusion which is multiplied by the share domestic is to provide an incentive about 33 larger there are similar modifications of the effects in the other equations 5 8 b kd d ffd kd1affd and 6 9 b ffd kf for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32103
