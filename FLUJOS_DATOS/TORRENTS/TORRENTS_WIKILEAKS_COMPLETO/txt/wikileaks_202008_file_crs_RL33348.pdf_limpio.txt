policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33348the tip credit provisions of the fair labor standards act summary the fair labor standards act flsa is the primary federal statute dealing with wages hours and conditions of employment one aspect of wage policy is the question of tip income closely related to the issue of tip income is the ability of employers under the flsa to em ploy certain youth workers at subminimum wages during the 1960s the flsa was expanded to include certain areas of work that had been omitted from the 1938 statute am ong them were workers engaged in the service and retail trades since many such workers received tips in the normal course of their work some of them substantia l amount of tips the question arose as to how they were to be treated in the c ontext of federal minimum wage structure there had been some discussion of the tip question prior to 1938 but since the initial enactment really did not cover many workers in tipped occupations it was not made part of the act in the 1960s however the issue became somewhat more controversial did tips flow almost nece ssarily from the ambience of the restaurant or club the nature of hotel or inn if so were tips really the product of employer contributions and should they belong to the employer if they should not actually become the property of the employer shoul d an offset be made against the minimum wage workers were adamant that employment should bring wage and also that the wage was to be paid by the employer steady wage and consistent wage not just gratuity voluntarily given by third party the rationale was that an employee could assist in development of business by his or her graciousness or on the other hand could contribute to decline in bus iness were he or she to render shoddy service or make customer feel unc omfortable or unwelcome from this perspective the tip should be the property of the employee gift from the served to the server but what about the other employees of the establishment those who are unseen by the customer indifference in the kitchen could diminish tip meanwhile expert assistance from support staff could nhance tip income and encourage client to return should some consid eration be given to the invi sible but vitally important backofthehouse staff perhaps pooling of tips might be useful aside from the federal wagehour law th ere exist multiple state standards that govern tips and tip income how are they to be meshed with the federal flsa this report discusses the tip system unde r the flsa its application under state standards and the status of the related subminimum wage worker given the history of the act it seems likely that some furthe r discussion of these issues will take place as that discussion develops the report will be

technically is that portion of the wage of minimum wage employee that the employer is allowed to retain as an ffset presumably for his or her contribution to receipt of gratuity or viewed from another perspective it can be seen as reduction in the minimum wage for tipped employee however all otherwise covered employees receive the minimum wage some from his or her employer others in combination of an employer contribution and gratuities from c onsumer the process through which the tip credit is calculated can be termed the tip credit provision of the fair labor standards act 2 in 1996 congress divided the thencurrent mini mum wage 425 in half establishing the tip credit at onehalf of the minimum wage 213 per hour and then having locked in the tip credit provisions congress in separate action increased the minimum wage to 515 per hour but for purposes of calculating the tip credit the 425 figure remains the base rate ie 213 for the employer and 213 for the workerthe tip credit provisions of the fair labor standards act during the 1960s with amendment to th fair labor standards act flsa congress included provision for tip credit under the federal minimum wage for employers of tipped employees through the years although the tip credit has been altered it remains part of the act1 under the flsa tipped employee one who earns at least 30 month in tips may have his or her fede ral minimum wage reduced to 213 per hour cash paid by the employer assuming that the combination of tips and cash income from the employer collectively equals the federal minimum wage ie 515 per hour thus all covered workers earn at least th federal minimum wage of 515 per hour except for subminimum wage earners for nontipped worker the entire amount of the minimum wage derives from cash wages from the employer for the tipped employee less than 213 comes from the employer in cash with the remainder accountable in tips assuming that he or she actually earns sufficient amount to equal the minimum wage if ther is deficiency the remainder must be made up by the employer2 there were employer qualifications involved in establishing the 213per hour tipbased figure though proponents of the tip credit assert that there is and indeed from their perspective there may be it is the employer who creates the ambience the environment in which the employee works and in which the customer determines the tip the 213 some would argue may be attributable to ambience or to other similar factors speaking generally organized labor and tipped employees may be said to have preferred zero tip credit whatever income was derived from tips they suggest should be the property of the tipped empl oyee gratuity from the person being served to the server payment for empl oyment some argue should

labor the act has undergone general revi sion on eight separate occasions with other more specific amendments as determined to be needed minimum wage initiatives began with the states during the first decade of the 20th century but were generally declared unconstitutional by the courts where they had effect in 1937 in the washington state case of west coast hotel co v parrish the supreme court reversed its longstanding antipathy toward minimum wages affirming the right of states to intervene in wagehour policy thereafter both the states and the federal government move d to enact laws governing minimum wages and associated patterns of employment3 during the summer of 1938 congress adopted the flsa beginning with relatively modest coverage initially persons in the retail and services trades among many others were exclude d from coverage though so of those excluded may have been significantly disa dvantaged in economic terms4 very gradually first one segment of the

opposition the 1966 amendments to the flsa however were not total loss to industry first tipped employee was defined as anyone who customarily and regularly receives more than 20 dollars month in

had been shortchanged in the process an appeal could be ma to the department of labor showing to the satisfaction of th secretary that the actual amount of tips received by him was less that the amount determined by the employer and his wage would be increased accordingly though minimum wage coverage however modified had been extended to the service industries inter alia hotels motels restaurants there was another offsetting provision built into the act in 1966 histor ically the secretary of labor had been given the option of applying subminimum wage to the extent necessary in

student subminimum rate had by this point become standard policy something of tradition and one that industry wanted to see strengthened both in the house and in the senate during floor consideration of the 1977 flsa amendments proposals were ffered to allow under differi ng circumstances for the employment of youth workers and students provisions varied as did the nuances of the plan usually it called for fulltime students working parttime but without regard to age duties or training some urged more allenco mpassing youth rate organized labor strongly opposed more general subminimum wage as did many members of congress the concept was rejected in each house of the congress though by exceedingly close margins14 the 1989 amendments in 1989 congress essentially reversed the 1977 flsa tip credit amendments the new amendments provided that the tip credit would rise to 45 as of april 1 1990 and to 50 after march 31 199115 the 1989 amendments also provided another offset that industry had long urged what had been termed youth subminimum wage in the 1960s and youth opportunity wage during parts of the 1970s and early 1980s now became training wage industry had long argued for different minimum wage for youth workers notably with respect to fulltime students who worked parttime the theory of that period though some disputed it was that students because of scheduling problems with classes and sports woul d be disadvantaged in the worldofwork and would find it more difficult to secure employment than nonstudent workers thus if they were cheaper to hire by paying them at subminimum rate their employment might more readily be ensured16 as minimum wage legislation moved through the 101st congress major issue in each house had been training wage fo r youth the legislation that was initially adopted did not include such provision however president george h w bush was convinced of the utility of traini ng wage and in midjune 1989 vetoed the minimum wage bill

credit was extended but with difference the bill provided that the credit due to employers would remain at 50 of the minimum wage ie 213 per hour or 50 of the th statutory rate of 42519 then with the minimum cash wage for tipped employees locked into place congress raised the general minimum wage in steps to 515 per hour the re sult was that the cash wage remained at 213 per hour while the minimum

complications the tip credit system can become complex instead of having single tip and tax st ructure most states appear to have system that differs from one state to the ne xt and from the federal

small does busin ess necessity require such differences in compensation patterns ie saving few cents on the minimum wage but with variety of confusions does the syst em really make nse economically for the worker performing minimum wage labor coping with the system could be daunting is he in fact subject to the tip credit system as important does his employer come under one of the exemptions built into the act or state standard that precludes the necessity of paying minimum wage at all eg an exemption based upon volume of receipts since the minimum wage worker is somewhat more likely to be parttime empl oyee andor itinerant is he in position to assess the volume of receipts of his or her employer where the worker has moved through two or three jobs during single year he may be treated di fferently and with justification for wagehour purposes by each of his employers if so can he really be sure that he is being treated fairly from the perspective of the wagehour inspector the system may mean just one more federally mandated requirement in terms of compliance the inspector will need to insure that tips are counted accu rately can he eff ectively document
