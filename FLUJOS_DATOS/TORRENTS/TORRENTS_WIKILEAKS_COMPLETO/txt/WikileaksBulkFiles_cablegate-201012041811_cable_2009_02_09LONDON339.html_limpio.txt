during the transition to the obama administration london think tanks have been active in discussing usg and hmg priorities in africa poloff took the opportunity to poll opinions among africa specialists at chatham house rusi the royal africa society africa confidential the commonwealth policy studies unit and international crisis group please protect the following are issuebyissue consensus summaries from those discussions hmgs africa policy lacks focus and is unable to internally prioritize its africa policy zimbabwe shouldwill remain priority for the uk for historical reasons but the usgs focus is surprising as it is largely contained crisis that should be treated as regional issue tough and quiet approach should be considered somalia should be more of priority for hmg given the uks history with the region the large number of somali diaspora in the uk and the real security threats that community may present to the uk nigeria especially the niger delta and corruption issues should be greater hmg priority because of nigerias financial links to the uk large ukbased diaspora community and energy potential sudan including the comprehensive peace agreement and the darfur crisis should remain top usg and hmg priorities because of the regional impact destabilization would have on the horn south africas desire for permanent unsc seat should be the leverage point for the usg and hmg to actively improve relations with south africa the global economic downturn will have greater affect on africa than the imf and world bank are predicting engaging african diaspora communities should be key usg and hmg focus as africa is the most politically globalized continent engaging muslims in africa may be mechanism to also improve relations with the middle east and south asia end summary uk africa policy lacks direction unable to prioritize 2 sbunf most londonbased think tank africa specialists thought hmg had lost its ability to prioritize on africa especially since the october 2008 departure of prime ministers special advisor on africa and development justin forsyth hmgs creation of an interagency defenseforeign officeinternational development cabinet subcommittee on africa they thought had not succeeded in resolving internal hmg disputes over priorities in africa given the uks credit crunch and diminishing international influence the chatham house africa specialist asserted hmg should be trying to burden share on africa with the french and the eu hmg however has not done that effectively and is therefore spreading itself too thin resulting in lack of tangible impact in areas of strategic british interest 3 cnf embassy comment forsyth while hitormiss on follow through was generally able to corral uk government departments into setting african priorities sudan zimbabwe and nigeria fco minister for africa mark mallochbrown has tried to provide direction ref but his nice guy approach of dealing directly with african leaders through his wellestablished network of contacts coupled with the lackluster direction of the new fco africa director adam london 00000339 002 of 003 wood ref b has meant serious consideration of the uks priorities in africa the uks national security strategy also failed to provide any direction though efforts are underway to improve the document ref c brendan cox former crisis action head is due to replace forsyth at 10 in midfebruary but many of those with whom we spoke questioned if he will have the political capital to make any real impact on the uks africa policy given prime minister browns standing in the domestic polls and need to focus on the global economic situation end comment zimbabwe 4 sbunf several think tank analysts thought that zimbabwe should and will remain top priority for the uk but that hmgs history of bombastic statements has only served to solidify president mugabes status as colonial liberation leader and rallied south africas unwavering support from strategic perspective these analysts termed the usgs focus on zimbabwe as surprising because zimbabwe is not threat but largely contained crisis they said that zimbabwes crisis should be treated as regional issue not an international one and that the usg should not sacrifice its relations with south africa the more strategic partner over zimbabwe even if the political events in zimbabwe run contrary to the usgs democracy agenda they recommended the international community take tough and quiet approach to mugabe and zanupf sanctioning and obstructing their personal freedoms but without commenting publicly they asserted that the international communitys concern about zimbabwe being regional destabilizer is largely unfounded as most of the southern africa development community sadc especially south africa can take of themselves somalia 5 sbunf given the uks history the large number of somali diaspora in the uk and the real security threats that community may present to the uk think tank security specialists thought somalia should be more of priority for hmg hmg they argued should be more innovative on somalia policy focusing on local community engagement and finding humanitarian and social initiatives where material benefit can be derived without deployment of an excessively large peacekeeping force the rusi africa specialist said hmg and the usgs previous entry point to somalia was through ethiopia with the withdrawal of ethiopian troops new entry point should be found quickly he thought both igad and the au could serve in this capacity he also asserted that recognition of somaliland should be considered to allow it access to international mechanisms for development and capacity support as well as to support its democratic development in the face of increasing islamic militant pressures 6 cnf embassy comment cabinet office officials have told us that they consider somalia serious security concern but they have not been able to induce other hmg departments to move on it in large part because of the failure of the hmg process to set africa priorities hmgs budget crunch also seems to be hindering the decisionmaking process ref d end comment nigeria 7 sbunf think tank west africa specialists citing nigerias significant financial links to the uk large diaspora community and energy potential said that the country especially the niger delta and corruption issues should be clear hmg priority but it has not been hmgs capacity for political analysis on nigeria they thought was both weak and shallow the rusi security specialist said nigeria as well as africa as whole needs better maritime security and should be able to secure its ports weak land and maritime security combined with fragile state and government institutions is an integrated problem in nigeria he asserted 8 cnf embassy comment although the foreign office appears interested in developing more focused and strategic policy on nigeria the home offices drive to conclude london 00000339 003 of 003 prisoner transfer agreement has prevented hmg from moving forward on any other meaningful issues refs f and g end comment sudan 9 sbunf all the think tank analysts consulted agreed that sudan including implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement cpa and finding political solution to the darfur crisis should remain top hmg and usg priorities because of the regional impact destabilization of sudan would have on the entire horn of africa south africa 10 sbunf these analysts also all agreed that now was the time for both hmg and the usg to improve relations with south africa it is time to mend fences especially for the uk and south africas desire for permanent security council seat as part of unsc reform should be the leverage point they asserted south africa they assessed has the potential to break up unhelpful african voting blocks in the in spite of its diplomatically difficult time during its recent rotation on the security council the global economic downturn and africa 11 sbunf royal african society specialists thought the global economic downturn would affect africa significantly much more than the imf and world bank have been reporting because of falling commodity prices increased unemployment they thought would likely increase urban unrest and destabilize individual nations security engaging the diaspora 12 sbunf several think tank specialists noted the importance of the african diaspora with the global credit crunch they thought the african diasporas role will be increasingly important both economically and politically they asserted that africa is the most politically globalized continent even if it is not economically globalized they indicated that hmg and the usg should find ways for the diaspora to constructively engage on the continent which will influence african governments in favor of western values as most large affluent african diaspora communities are based in the west islam 13 sbunf the rusi africa specialist suggested that hmg and the usg should do more to engage muslims in africa as it is an easier entry point for fostering goodwill that may transmit to more difficult geographic areas like the
