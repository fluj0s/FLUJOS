from stores to memory by adding register base to an immediate offset branches are based on comparisons between registers rather than flags and are therefore easy to relocate optional links following jump or branch instructions assist with subroutine programming the mips unaligned load and store instructions are not supported because they represent poor price performance tradeoff for embedded applications their absence does not affect the software programming model pipeline lx4189 instructions are executed by sixstage pipeline that has been designed so that all transactions internal to the

agentsthatdrivethebusdosoasearlyaspossibleaftertherisingedgeofthebusclockthere is some time to perform some combinational logic after the bus clock goes high but the amount of time is determined by the speed of the bus clock and the number of devices on the bus 2 agents sample signals on the bus at the rising edge of the bus clock 3 all bus signals must be driven at all times if the bus is not
