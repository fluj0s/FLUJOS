initiating formal review of vietnams eligibility for gsp benefits and would accept public comments on the application until augu st 4 2008 vietnam has already been accepted into several othe r developedcountry gsp programs around the world including canada the europ ean union eu and japan the gsp statute provides the president with the authority to designate any country beneficiary devel oping country provided the c ountry complies with various trade policy and labor conditions congre ss does not need to act to approve gsp status for vietnam the president is however required to notify congress of his intention the inclusion of vietnam into the gsp program is generally viewed as another step in the development of closer bilateral relations most of the public comments submitte d to the ustr were supportive of approving vietnams applicati on however there were some issues raised that could cause problems in accepting vietnam into the gsp program in particular vietnams record on workers rights in addition vietnams record on human rights may also have an impact on its applicati on even though the president is not legally required to consider this issue wh evaluating vietnams application if accepted into the gsp program up to 3400 different types of exports from vietnam could potentially enter into the united states dutyfree while vietnams leading exports to the united states knitted and nonknitted clothing are deemed import sensitive and therefore excluded from gsp eligibility some of its fastest growing exports are eligible for dut yfree status under the gsp these exports include electrical machinery fruits and coffee preparations imports of these commodities would likely increase if vietnam is granted beneficiary developing country bdc status this coul d lead to an increase in the us bilateral trade deficit with vietnam and shift in the mix of us imports from vietnam it might also foster relocation of some assembly operations from china to vietnam thereby reducing the us bilateral trade deficit with china oneyear extension of the generalized system of preferences program was included in hr 7222 which was passed in the house sep tember 29 2008 and

states the european union and other developed countries implemented such programs in the 1 970s in order to promote economic growth in developing countries by stimulating their ex ports the us program was established by title v of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 for 10year period since then congress has extended the pr ogram nine times most recently through december 31 2008 in section 8002 of pl 1094324 the house and senate recently passed one year extension of gsp in section 4 of hr 7222 and the measure is awaiting the presidents signature the basic principle behind the gsp is to provide certain goods originating in developing countries with preferential market access usually in the form of lower tariff rates or dutyfree status to deve loped country markets in order to spur economic growth the program was first adopted intern ationally in 1968 by the united nations conference on trade and development unctad at the unctad ii conference in general the us gsp program authorizes the president to grant dutyfree treatment under the gsp for any eligible product from any beneficiary developing country bdc or l eastdeveloped beneficiary developing country ldbdc the statute provides the president with specifi c political and economic criteria to use when designating eligible countries and products5 country eligibility under the gsp eligibility criteria there are certain mandatory factors that may not be waived first cer tain developed countries are specifically excluded6 other mandatory criteria require excl usion of any country that is communist unless it has normal trade

such designation will be in the na tional economic intere st of the united states and reports such determination to the congress with the reasons therefor these criteria preclude countries that have nationalized or expropriated the property of us citizens or companies have failed to acknowledge or enforce arbitral awards that are inus favor aided or abetted individuals or groups that have engaged in international terrorism have not taken steps to provide its workers with internationally recognized worker rights or have not taken steps to eliminate the worst forms of child labor7 other discretionary factors that the president may consider when deciding to confer bdc status are 1 the desire of th country to be designated 2 the level of economic development of the country in cluding gross national product gnp and living standards 3 whether other devel oped countries offer similar tariff benefits to the country 4 the degree to which the country has agreed to provide equitable and

morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34702crs5 17 for more information see crs report rl33316 usvietnam relations background and issues for congress by mark manyin specifically whether or not it is cont rolled or dominated by international communism for the waivable criteria the most likely source of challenges is vietnams record in providing workers with internationally recognized workers rights is vietnam communist country us federal law does not currently include specific definition of what constitutes comm unist country the concept of communism has two distinct common definitions one political and one economic the political definition typically hinges on the domination of societys political system by single and selfper petuating party the economic definition is usually based on the holding of all property in common with the ownership being ascribed to the community as whole or to the state politically the vietnamese government does not refer to itself as communist country but as socialist republic however vietnam is oneparty state controlled by the communist party of vietnam vcp since the mid1990s the vcp appears to have followed strategy of permitting most forms of personal and religious expression while selectively repressing individuals and organizations that it deems threat to the partys monopoly on power economically vietnam has been steadily transforming its centrally planned economy into market economy and has allo wed the creation and growth of private enterprise vietnams constitution and civil code recognize and protect private property rights yet government influe nce and control over vietnams economy still remains comparatively high17 even if vietnam were determined to be communist country gsp statutory provisions specify that it can still qualify for gsp status if it is member of the wto and imf received ntr status from the united states and is found to be not dominated or controlled by international communism vietnam is recent member of the wto date of accession january 11 2007 and member of longstanding in the imf since september 1956 in december 2006 vietnam was conferred permanent ntr status by the united states in addition given that the soviet union and its council for mutual economic assi stance comecon longer exist it is unclear how to define what constitutes domination or control by international communism workers rights among the five mandatory but waivable criteria vietnams recognition of internationallyac cepted workers rights may prove to be the most controversial prior to the 1986 advent of doi moi vietnams process of marketoriented economic re novati on there were many alle gations about substandard working conditions in vietnam including sweatshop working conditions the use of child labor and

statement of support for gsp signation the vietnamese government focused on its partnership with the inte rnational labor organization ilo and its ratification of severa l of the ilos conventions as demonstrating its commitment to comply with international labor rights standards vietnam rejoined the ilo as member state in 1992 and has worked w ith the ilo in drafting new labor laws including the 1994 labor code in addition vietnam has ratified five of the eight fundamental ilo conventions covering compulsory labor income inequality discrimination minimum age and the worst fo rms of child labor and an additional 12 other ilo conventions viet nam reported it is considering ratification of two more conventions concerning the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining

to the government of vietnam strikes are not uncommon in vietnam and the labor code was amended in late 2006 in order to clarify the cases in which strike may occur ie after legally mandated dispute

retribution against strikers23 there reportedly were nearly 400 strikes in vietnam in the first eight months of 2008 mostly spontaneous industrial actions taken without trade union leadership24 in

of labor activists or of individuals wh write speak or otherwise disseminate information on labor rights others in congress see the granting of gsp status to vietnam as an important foreign policy tool much like the us grant of pntr status to vietnam and us support of its wto accession first some see the value in continuing to expand relations with country that continues to have an ambivale nt relationship with china26 second many also believe that continued engagement with vietnam in the commercial policy arena can serve as an i ndirect encouragement for the government to promote increased pluralism accountability and adherence to the rule of law27 some believe that continued normalization of relations with vietnam is also symbolically important because it places greater distance between the usvietnam relationship and the legacy of the vietnam war28 public comments on gsp status for vietnam as part of the process of assessing vietnams suitability for the gsp program the ustr

of the gsp program the supporters also pointed to vietnams doi moi policies as evidence of its compliance with the gsp eligibility and then indicated that acceptance into the gsp program would help pr

adding vietnam to the program the aflcios criticisms focused on its assessment that much more needs to be done to bring its vietnams labor laws and practices in line with internationally recognized worker rights29 in particular the aflcio cited continuing problems with vietnamese work ers freedom of association their right to organize and bargain collectively restrictions on the ability to strike and problems in working conditions minimum wage enfo rcement excessive working hours and unsafe working conditions the iipas comments centered on vietnams compliance with the intellectual

and child labor working conditions and compensation requirements the cpvw concluded their comments with list of seven specific conditions to be met before granting gsp eligibility to vietnam the comments in opposition by the us producers of polyethylene carrier bags focused on the reputed damage to their industry from the recent rapid increase in plastic bag imports from china malays ia and thailand according to their submission antidumping duties on plastic bag imports from those three countries have slowed import growth but have so led to relocation of operations to vietnam based on their reported experi ence the us producers requested that vietnam be precluded from seeking gsp treatment for polyethylene carrier bags human rights in vietnam legally the human rights conditions of country do not have to be considered by the president when making decision on its application for gsp eligibility however the issue of human rights in vietnam has been an important factor in every previous case when the united states has considered strengthening bilateral trade relations it is difficult to make countrywide ge neralizations about the state of human rights in vietnam on the one hand the vcp has permitted the growth of an independent press so long as its criticism of the government is limited to issues such as corruption economic policy nature conservation and envi ronmental pollution similarly the vietnamese government has generally allowed the freedom of worship regardless of faith so long as the religious organization registers with the authorities as of 2006 vietnam was longer listed as country of particular concern cpc in the state departments international religious freedom report on the other hand the vcp regularly represses groups nd individuals it perceives

that vietnams exports to the united states w ill increase if it becomes bdc the impact on us exports to vietnam is less certain scholarly studies have also come to c onflicting conclusions of the impact of the gsp program on intern ational trade flows dependi ng on the methodology used and the assumptions made the studies have estimated the trade effect for gspeligible products as ranging from being neg ligible to increasing by over 6038 for example 2006 study of eu trade preference progra ms estimated that the eu gsp program does not significantly increase ex ports for beneficiary countries39 most of the studies calculated less than 20 incr ease in gspeligible product exports although studies may differ on the trade effects of gsp programs r ecent bilateral trade figures provide some evidence that the liberalization of us trade relations with vietnam does foster greater trade flows particularly an increase in us imports following the december 10 2001 grant of ntr status to vietnam official us trade statistics indicate that us total merchandise trade with vietnam doubled from 15 billion in 2001 to 30 billion in 2002 see figure 1 during that same time period us

increasing by less than 120 million comparable amount to the increase between 2000 and 2001 while acceptance into the us gsp prog ram is not as dramatic shift in trade status as ntr the growth in

international trade commission determining which vietnamese exports will increase if the united states approves vietnams gsp application is also difficult it would logical to assume that most of

machinery 84 and electrical machinery 85 comparison of these six product categories to the 2007 list of gspeligible items reveals that three of these product categories soaps plastics and articles of plastic machinery and electrical machinery are generally gspeligible implying greater likelihood of growth paper and paper products as well as headgear are not typically eligible for gsp benefits so there is little chance of trade gains in these product categories the possibility of gsp eligibility may have the greatest implication for vietnams machinery and ectrical machinery industr ies since the vietnamese government has been actively promoting its nation to overseas investors as good location for machinery and electrical machinery operati ons in addition rising production costs in other parts of asia especially in china are leading manufacturers to explore alternative locations for their asian operations chinese companies in particular facing rising labor costs and the strengthening of the renminbi rmb against the us dollar may find the added bonus of gsp eligibility an incentive to relocate their final assembly operations to vietnam such shift could partially offset the general rise in the us bilateral trade deficit with china but would also increase the us bilateral trade deficit with vietnam however all of these trade effects would be limited in size by the competitive need limits cnls vietnams designation as bdc under the gsp is likely to ve little effect on us producers of importcompeting pr oducts because domestic producers are largely shielded from seve re economic impact under the preference due to the cnls and other restrictions furt hermore if us manufacturer s of product are adversely impacted by imports under gsp they may petition that the product be removed from gsp eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34702crs14 41 under the provisions of 19 usc 2462f1 the president must notify congress 60 days prior to the designation of leastdevel oped bdc time period is specified for bdc designationus exports to vietnam may increase if vietnam is designated as bdc but not as quickly as imports since the gsp is nonreciprocal program acceptance of vietnam as bdc will not provide similar dutyfree treatment for us exporters in 2007 the united states exported about 2 billion in goods to vietnam up from approximately 368 milli on in 2000 leading us exports to vietnam in 2007 included passenger motor vehicles cott on polypropylene leather and wheat however many us manufacturers us imports under gsp such as wiring harnesses brake and ignition parts spectacle lenses and insulated electrical conductors as inputs for finished products that could later be exported to vietnam and other gsp beneficiaries issues for congress the gsp statute provides the president with the authority to designate any country beneficiary developing country provided the country complies with the conditions described in the statute th erefore congress does not need to act to approve gsp status for vietnam the pres ident is required to notify congress of his intention however41 the generalized system of preferences program was set to expire on december 31 2008 but was granted oneyear extension in sec 4 of hr 7222 passed house september 29 2008 and october 3 2008 passed senate oc tober 2 2008 the legislation is awaiting the presiden ts signature as of this writing congress could also decide to authorize or instruct the president to designate or not to designate vietnam as bdc either as part of the legislation to extend the gsp program or in parate legislation for ex ample s 3678 the vietnam human rights act of 2008 would prohibit the grant of gsp status unless the president certifies that vietnam has met certain human rights conditions in addition congress could pass legislation stipulating additional criteria for the president to consider when deciding to confer bdc stat us to vietnam such legislation could also include specific restrictions on gsp eligible products for vietnam andor the size of cnls over the past decade congress has deba ted number of issues with respect to usvietnam relations particularly vietnams growing and increasingly liberalized economy and its human rights record the united states also has sizeable and growing foreign assistance program in viet nam and the two countries are expanding their strategic relations all these issues may factor into the debate over gsp membership
