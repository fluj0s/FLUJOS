the first omnibus energy legislation enacted in more than decade major provisions include tax incentives for domestic energy production and energy efficiency mandate to double the nations use of biofuels faster procedures for energy production on federal lands and authorization of numerous federal energy research and development programs this report describes the electricity provisions title xii electricity sec 1201 short title this title may be cited as the electric reliability act of 2005 subtitle reliability standards summary of provisions this subtitle is intended to provide federal jurisdiction over activities that are required to support reliability of the us bulk power system clarifying the federal energy regulatory commissions ferc authority to establish and regulate an electric reliability organization ero is intended to improve reliability as restructuring of the us bulk power system proceeds electric reliability standards sec 1211 this section requires ferc to promulgate rules within 180 days of enactment to create ferccertified ero the north american electric reliability council nerc currently has responsibility for reliability of the bulk power system nerc has established reliability guidelines but has enforcement authority before enactment of pl 10958 the federal power act1 gave ferc jurisdiction over unbundled transmission and authority to regulate wholesale rates however authority was provided to regulate reliability under this section the ero will develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system including cybersecurity protection all ero standards will be approved by ferc under this title the ero can impose penalties on user owner or operator of bulk power system that violates any fercapproved reliability standard in addition ferc can order compliance with reliability standard and can impose penalty if ferc finds that user owner or operator of bulk power 1 16 usc 791a et seq crs2 system has engaged in or is about to engage in violation of reliability standard this provision does not give an ero or ferc authorization to order construction of additional generation or transmission capacity this provision also requires that ferc establish regional advisory body if requested by at least twothirds of the states within region that have more than half of their electric load served within that region the advisory body will be composed of one member from each participating state in the region appointed by the governor of each state and is able to provide advice to the ero or ferc on reliability standards proposed regional entities proposed fees and any other responsibilities requested by ferc the entire reliability provision does not apply to alaska or hawaii the state of new york is authorized to develop rules that would result in greater reliability for new york as long as those rules do not result in lower reliability for neighboring states if the penalties employed by the ero are not successful then ferc has the authority to enforce penalties for entities that do not comply with reliability standards establishing this new relationship between ferc and the ero could have the potential to improve coordination between market functions and reliability functions subtitle b transmission infrastructure modernization siting of interstate electric transmission facilities sec 1221 the secretary of energy is required to conduct study of electric transmission congestion every three years based on the findings the secretary of energy may designate geographic area as being congested under certain conditions ferc is authorized to issue construction permits under new section 216d of the federal power act fpa affected states federal agencies indian tribes property owners and other interested parties will have an opportunity to present their views and recommendations with respect to the need for and impact of proposed construction permit however there is requirement for specific comment period new fpa section 216e will allow permit holders to petition in us district court to acquire rightsofway through the exercise of the right of eminent domain any exercise of eminent domain authority would be considered to be takings of private property for which just compensation is due new fpa section 216g does not state whether property owners would be required to reimburse compensation if the rightsofway were transferred back to the owner an applicant for federal authorization to site transmission facilities on federal lands could request that the department of energy be the lead agency to coordinate environmental review and other federal authorization once completed application is submitted all related environmental reviews are required to be completed within one year unless another federal law makes that impossible fpa section 216h gives the department of energy doe new authority to prepare environmental documents and appears to give doe additional decisionmaking authority for rights ofway and siting on federal lands this would appear to give doe input into the decision process for creating rightsofway review under section 503 of the federal crs3 land policy and management act2 could be streamlined by relying on prior analyses if federal agency has denied an authorization required by transmission or distribution facility the denial could be appealed by the applicant or relevant state to the president the president is required to issue decision within 90 days of the appeals filing with congressional approval states may enter into interstate compacts for the purposes of siting transmission facilities and the secretary of energy could provide technical assistance this section does not apply to the electric reliability council of texas ercot thirdparty finance sec 1222 the western area power administration wapa and the southwestern power administration swpa are able either to continue to design develop construct operate maintain or own transmission facilities within their regions or to participate with other entities for the same purposes if the secretary of energy designates the area as national interest electric transmission corridor and if the facility will reduce congestion or is needed to accommodate projected increases in demand for transmission capacity the project is required to be consistent with the needs identified by the appropriate regional transmission organization or independent system operator under certain circumstances the secretary of energy acting through wapa andor swpa may design develop construct operate maintain or own an electric power transmission facility in the wapa and swpa region more than 100 million from third party financing may be used during fiscal years 2006 through 2015 before enactment the enabling statutes for power marketing administrations could have restricted thirdparty financing construction operation and maintenance of transmission facilities3 advanced transmission technologies sec 1223 ferc is directed to encourage deployment of advanced transmission technologies advanced power system technology incentive program sec 1224 program is established to provide incentive payments to owners or operators of advanced power generation systems subject to the availability of funds 18 cents per kilowatthour will be paid to the owner or operator of qualifying advanced power system technology facility for facilities that the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of energy determine are qualifying security and assured power facilities an additional 07 cents per kilowatthour will be paid to the owner or operator of such facility under the incentive program the first 10000000 kilowatthours produced in any facility in fiscal year are eligible for the incentives eligible systems include advanced fuel cells turbines or hybrid power systems for fy2006 through fy2012 an annual appropriation of 10 million is authorized 2 43 usc 1763 3 16 usc 460 swpa and 43 usc 485 wapa crs4 subtitle c transmission operation improvements open nondiscriminatory access sec 1231 ferc is authorized to require by rule or order unregulated transmitting utilities power marketing administrations state entities and rural electric cooperatives to charge rates comparable to what they charge themselves and require that the terms and conditions of the sales be comparable to those required of other utilities before enactment of pl 10958 under the federal power act section 201f federal power marketing administrations state entities and rural electric cooperatives were not subject to fercs ratemaking under this provision exemptions are established for utilities selling less than 4 million megawatthours of electricity per year for distribution utilities and for utilities that own or operate transmission facilities that are not necessary to facilitate nationwide interconnected transmission system this exemption can be revoked to maintain transmission system reliability ferc is not authorized to order states or municipalities to take action under this section if such action would constitute private use under section 141 of the internal revenue code of 1986 ferc may remand transmission rates to an unregulated transmitting utility if the rates do not comply with this section ferc is not authorized to order an unregulated transmitting utility to join regional transmission organization or other fercapproved independent transmission organization this section is often referred to as ferclite federal utility participation in regional transmission organizations sec 1232 federal utilities power marketing administrations or the tennessee valley authority are authorized to participate in regional transmission organizations law allowing federal utilities to study formation and operation of regional transmission organization is repealed 16 usc 824n native load service obligation sec 1233 this section amends the federal power act to clarify that loadserving entity is entitled to use its transmission facilities or firm transmission rights to serve its existing customers before it is obligated to make its transmission capacity available for other uses ferc is not able to change any approved allocation of transmission rights by an regional transmission organization rto or independent system operator iso approved prior to january 1 2005 government entity that owns transmission facilities used predominantly to support its own water pumping facilities is provided protections for transmission service to such facilities comparable to protections provided to loadserving entities this section does not apply to ercot and does apply to loadserving entities located within the service area of the tennessee valley authority within one year of enactment ferc is required to issue rule or order on longterm transmission rights and organized markets section 201 of the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce section 205 of the federal power act prohibits utilities from granting undue preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage 16 usc 824 the new language of this section is intended to clarify that reserving transmission for existing customers native load is not considered unduly discriminatory crs5 study on the benefits of economic dispatch sec 1234 the secretary of energy in consultation with the states is required to issue an annual report to congress and the states on the current status of economic dispatch economic dispatch is defined as the operation of generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost to reliably serve consumers recognizing any operational limits of generation and transmission facilities protection of transmission contracts in the pacific northwest sec 1235 ferc does not have the authority to require electric utilities in the pacific northwest to convert firm transmission rights to tradable or financial rights the area of the pacific northwest is the region defined in section 3 of the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act 16 usc839a or portion of state included in the geographic area proposed for regional transmission organization in ferc docket rt0135 sense of congress regarding locational installed capacity mechanism sec 1236 it is the sense of congress that ferc should carefully consider the objections of the states to proposed locational installed capacity mechanism in new england the objections include that locational installed capacity mechanism would not provide adequate assurance that necessary electric generation capacity or reliability will be provided and it would impose high cost on consumers subtitle d transmission rate reform transmission infrastructure investment sec 1241 within one year of enactment ferc is required to establish rule to create incentivebased including performancebased transmission rates the rule is to promote reliable and economically efficient electric transmission and generation provide for return on equity that attracts new investment in transmission encourage use of technologies that increase the transfer capacity of existing transmission facilities and allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs that are necessary to comply with mandatory reliability standards and those that would result from transmission siting and construction on national interest electric transmission corridor ferc is directed to implement incentive ratemaking for utilities that join regional transmission organization funding new interconnection and transmission upgrades sec 1242 ferc may approve participant funding plan for new transmission or for new generator interconnection if the plan results in rates that are just and reasonable not unduly discriminatory or preferential and otherwise consistent with sections 205 and 206 of the federal power act crs6 subtitle amendments to the public utility regulatory policies act purpa4 net metering and additional standards sec 1251 for states that have not considered implementation and adoption of net metering standards within two years of enactment state regulatory authorities are required to begin considering whether to implement net metering this process must be completed within three years of enactment net metering service is defined as service to an electric consumer under which electric energy generated by that electric consumer from an eligible onsite generating facility eg solar or small generator and delivered to local distribution facilities may be used to offset electric energy provided by the electric utility to the electric consumer during the applicable billing period during the same time frame states must consider whether to implement standard to require electric utilities to develop plan to minimize dependence on one fuel source in addition states must consider whether to implement requirement that electric utilities develop and implement 10year plan to increase the efficiency of fossil fuel generation smart metering sec 1252 for states that have not considered implementation and adoption of smart metering standard state regulatory authorities are required issue decision within 18 months of enactment on whether to implement standard for timebased rate schedules for electric utility customers customers using timebased rate schedules must be provided with timebased meter capable of allowing utility customer to receive the timebased rate this section amends the public utility regulatory policies act of 19785 purpa and requires the secretary of energy to provide consumer education on advanced metering and communications technologies to identify and address barriers to adoption of demand response programs and to issue report to congress not later than 180 days after enactment that identifies and quantifies the benefits of demand response the secretary of energy must provide technical assistance to regional organizations to identify demand response potential and to develop demand response programs to respond to peak demand or emergency needs ferc is directed to issue an annual report by region to assess demand response resources cogeneration and small power production purchase and sale requirements sec 1253 section 210 of purpa required utilities to purchase power from qualifying facilities and small power producers at rate based on the utilities avoided cost the cost they would have incurred to generate the additional power themselves as determined by utility regulators6 this section repeals the mandatory purchase requirement under section 210 of purpa for new contracts if ferc finds that competitive electricity market exists and qualifying facility has access to independently administered auctionbased dayahead realtime wholesale markets and longterm wholesale markets qualifying facilities also need to have access to transmission and interconnection services provided by fercapproved 4 pl 95617 5 pl 95617 6 16 usc 824a3 crs7 regional transmission entity that provides nondiscriminatory treatment for all customers ownership limitations under purpa are repealed background and analysis the oil embargoes of the 1970s created concerns about the security of the nations electricity supply and led to enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 for the first time utilities were required to purchase power from outside sources or qualifying facilities the purchase price was set at the utilities avoided cost purpa was established in part to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electric consumers in addition to purpa the fuel use act of 1978 fua helped qualifying facilities qfs become established7 under fua utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel new generating facilities qfs which are by definition not utilities were able to take advantage of thenabundant natural gas as well as new generating technology such as combinedcycle plants that use hot gases from combustion turbines to generate additional power these technologies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the electricity generation business and shortened the lead time for constructing new plants fua was repealed in 1987 but by that time qfs and small power producers had gained portion of the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before implementation of purpa ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power because nonutility generators typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge ferc began approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketoriented approach to electricity supply following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further change whether to encourage nonutility generation and whether to permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities the energy policy act of 1992 epact8 removed several regulatory barriers for entry into electricity generation to increase competition of electricity supply however epact does not permit ferc to mandate that utilities transmit exempt wholesale generator ewg power to retail consumers commonly called retail wheeling or retail competition an activity that remains under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions purpa began to shift more regulatory responsibilities to the federal government and epact continued that shift away from the states by creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand 7 pl 95620 8 pl 102486 crs8 proponents of the purpa repeal primarily investorowned utilities ious located in the northeast and in california argued that their state regulators misguided implementation of purpa in the early 1980s had forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they did not need they argued that given the current environment for costconscious competition purpa was outdated investor owned utility interests strongly supported the repeal of section 210 of purpa contending that purpas mandatory purchase obligation was anticompetitive and anticonsumer9 opponents of mandatory purchase requirement repeal independent power producers industrial power customers most segments of the natural gas industry the renewable energy industry and environmental groups had many reasons to support purpa as it stood mainly their argument was that purpa introduced competition in the electric generating sector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electricgenerating sector is not yet fully competitive they argued repealing purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry additionally opponents of the purpa repeal argued that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopoly control over the electric industry some state regulators had expressed concern that repealing section 210 would prevent them from deciding matters currently under their jurisdiction interconnection sec 1254 each state regulatory authority if it has not already done so and each nonregulated utility must consider establishing an interconnection standard for onsite generating facilities that request to be connected to the local distribution facilities interconnection services will be offered according to the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee standard 1547 for interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems consideration of the standard is to commence not later than one year after enactment and be completed not later than two years after the date of enactment subtitle f repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 puhca10 short title sec 1261 this subtitle is to be cited as the public utility holding company act of 2005 definitions sec 1262 this section establishes definitions for the following terms affiliate associate company commission company electric utility company exempt wholesale generator and foreign utility company gas utility company holding company holding company system jurisdictional rates natural gas company person public utility publicutility company state commission subsidiary company and voting security 9 us congress house of representatives the energy policy act of 2005 hearings before the committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on energy and air quality serial 1091 february 10 and february 16 2005 10 15 usc 79 et seq crs9 repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 sec 1263 the public utility holding company act of 1935 puhca is repealed background and analysis in general puhca set forth the structure of holding companies by prohibiting all holding companies that were more than twice removed from the operating subsidiaries it also federally regulated holding companies of investorowned utilities and provided for securities and exchange commission sec regulation of mergers and diversification proposals registered holding companies of subsidiaries were required to have sec approval prior to issuing securities all loans in intercompany financial transactions were regulated by the sec holding company could have been exempt from puhca if its business operations and those of its subsidiaries occurred within one state or with contiguous state historically electricity service was defined as natural monopoly meaning that the industry has 1 an inherent tendency toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technological conditions that limit the number of potential entrants in addition many regulators have considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evolved however there has been growing belief that the historic classification of electric utilities as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating facilities primarily cooperatives and publicly owned utilities has provided evidence that vertical integration has not been necessary for providing efficient electric service moreover recent changes in electric utility regulation and improved technologies have allowed additional generating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company act and the federal power act of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act established regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government regulatory bargain was made between the government and utilities in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities including wholesale and retail ratemaking state authority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates and often over investment and debt at the other end of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many facets of utility operation despite this diversity the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will be permitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among the various customer classes residential commercial and industrial crs10 under the fpa federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power flowing in interstate commerce federal regulation follows state regulation and is premised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of states to regulate interstate commerce in this bifurcation of regulatory jurisdiction federal regulation is limited and conceived to supplement state regulation ferc has the principal functions at the federal level for the economic regulation of the electric utility industry including financial transactions wholesale rate regulation transactions involving transmission of unbundled retail electricity interconnection and wheeling of wholesale electricity and ensuring adequate and reliable service before enactment of pl 10958 in order to prevent recurrence of the abusive practices of the 1920s eg crosssubsidization selfdealing pyramiding sec regulated utilities corporate structure and business ventures under puhca the electric utility industry has been in the process of transformation during the past two decades there has been major change in direction concerning generation first improved technologies have reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities prior preference for largescale often nuclear or coalfired powerplants has been supplanted by preference for smallscale production facilities that can be brought online more quickly and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediments second technological advances have lowered the entry barrier to electricity generation and permitted nonutility entities to build profitable facilities one argument for additional puhca change was made by electric utilities that wanted to further diversify their assets under puhca holding company could acquire securities or utility assets only if the sec found that such purchase would improve the economic efficiency and service of an integrated public utility system it was argued that reform to allow diversification would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities also argued that diversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources due to the seasonal nature of electric demand utility holding companies that were exempt from sec regulation argued that puhca discouraged diversification because the sec could have repealed their exempt status if exemption would be detrimental to the public interest11 state regulators expressed concerns that increased diversification could lead to abuses including crosssubsidization regulated company subsidizing an unregulated affiliate crosssubsidization was major argument against the creation of exempt wholesale generators ewgs and reemerged as an argument against further puhca change in the case of electric and gas companies nonutility ventures that are undertaken as result of diversification may benefit from the regulated utilities allowed rate of return moneymaking nonutility enterprises would contribute to the overall financial health of holding company however 11 us congress house of representatives the energy policy act of 2005 hearings before the committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on energy and air quality serial 1091 february 10 and february 16 2005 crs11 unsuccessful ventures could harm the entire holding company including utility subsidiaries in this situation opponents feared that utilities would not be penalized for failure in terms of reduced access to new capital because they could increase retail rates several consumer and environmental public interest groups as well as state legislators expressed concerns about the puhca repeal such groups argued that the repeal could only exacerbate market power abuses in what they viewed as monopolistic industry where true competition does not yet exist federal access to books and records sec 1264 holding companies and their affiliates are required to make available to ferc books and records of affiliate transactions that ferc determines are relevant to costs incurred by public utility or natural gas company within the holding company system to protect ratepayers with respect to ferc jurisdictional rates federal officials are required to maintain confidentiality of such books and records before enactment registered holding companies and subsidiary companies were required to preserve accounts costaccounting procedures correspondence memoranda papers and books that the sec deemed necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consumers state access to books and records sec 1265 jurisdictional state commission may make reasonably detailed written request to holding company or any associate company for access to specific books and records the states must safeguard against unwarranted disclosure to the public of any trade secrets or sensitive commercial information response to such request is mandatory compliance with this section is enforceable in us district court this section does not apply to an entity that is considered to be holding company solely by reason of ownership of one or more qualifying facilities before enactment the federal power act allowed state commissions to examine the books accounts memoranda contracts and records of jurisdictional electric utility company an exempt wholesale generator that sells to such electric utility and an electric utility company or holding company that is an associate company or affiliate of an exempt wholesale generator in issuing such an order for information state commission was not required to specify which books accounts memoranda contracts and records it was requesting exemption authority sec 1266 ferc is directed to promulgate rules within 90 days from the effective date of this section to exempt qualifying facilities exempt wholesale generators and foreign utilities from the federal access to books and records provision section 1264 ferc is also required to exempt books accounts memoranda and other records that are not relevant to the jurisdictional rates of public utility or natural gas company any class of transactions that is not relevant to the jurisdictional rates of public utility or natural gas company is also exempt affiliate transactions sec 1267 ferc retains the authority to prevent crosssubsidization and to assure that jurisdictional rates are just and reasonable ferc and state commissions retain jurisdiction to determine whether associate crs12 company activities could be recovered in rates before enactment of the new energy law the federal power act required that jurisdictional rates were just and reasonable and prohibited crosssubsidization12 applicability sec 1268 except as specifically noted this subtitle does not apply to the us government state or any political subdivision of the state or foreign governmental authority operating outside the united states effect on other regulations sec 1269 ferc or state commissions are not precluded from exercising their jurisdiction under otherwise applicable laws to protect utility customers enforcement sec 1270 ferc is given the authority to enforce provisions under sections 306317 of the federal power act before enactment the securities and exchange commission had the authority to investigate and enforce provisions of the public utility holding company act of 1935 savings provisions sec 1271 persons may continue to participate in legal activities in which they have been engaged or are authorized to engage in on the effective date of this act this subtitle would not limit the authority of ferc under the federal power act or the natural gas act13 tax treatment for exchanges of stock or securities under section 1081 of the internal revenue service code nonrecognition of gain or loss on exchanges or distributions in obedience to orders of the sec is not affected due to the repeal of puhca implementation sec 1272 not later than four months after enactment ferc is required to promulgate regulations necessary to implement this subtitle excluding section 1265 which relates to state access to books and records and submit to congress recommendations for technical or conforming amendments to federal law necessary to carry out this subtitle transfer of resources sec 1273 the securities and exchange commission is required to transfer all applicable books and records to ferc effective date sec 1274 six months after enactment this subtitle will take effect this effective date does not apply to section 1282 implementation if any ferc rulemaking that modifies the standards of conduct governing entities that own operate or control facilities for transmission of electricity in interstate commerce or transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce takes effect prior to the effective date of this section any action taken by public utility company or utility holding company to comply with the ferc requirements will not subject these companies to any regulatory requirement under puhca service allocation sec 1275 ferc is required to review and authorize cost allocations for nonpower goods or administrative or management services provided by an associate company that was organized specifically for the purpose of 12 16 usc 791a et seq 13 15 usc 717 et seq crs13 providing such goods or services this section does not preclude ferc or state commissions from exercising their jurisdiction under other applicable laws with respect to review or authorization of any costs ferc is required to issue rules within four months of enactment to exempt from the section any company and holding company system if operations are confined substantially to single state authorization of appropriations sec 1276 necessary funds to carry out this subtitle are authorized to be appropriated conforming amendments to the federal power act sec 1277 the federal power act is amended to reflect the changes to the public utility holding company act of 1935 subtitle g market transparency enforcement and consumer protection electricity market transparency sec 1281 ferc is directed to facilitate price transparency in wholesale electric markets ferc may prescribe rules to provide on timely basis information about the availability and prices of wholesale electric energy and transmission service to ferc state commissions buyers and sellers of wholesale electric energy users of transmission services and the
