infrastructure has increased significantly however iraqi ministries have had difficulty spending their budget for capital projects such as roads schools and oil production according to us officials only about 23 of the 2006 capital budget of about 62 billion was spent in that year and only 3 of 35 billion capital budget available to the oil ministry was spent in 2006 funds not spent in 2006 were being utilized in 2007 delaying expenditure of 2007 capital funds and later 2008 among the reasons offered for this situation has been rapid turnover in personnel security concerns preventing construction lack of personnel skilled in contracting and managing projects and fear by government employees of being accused of corrupt practices the latter concern led the finance minister in january 2008 to call for the abolition of the commission on public integrity key public watchdog group 12 complementing the administrations new strategy for iraq the iraqi government approved 2007

data by various agencies which more recent data has done little to alleviate for instance while march 2008 dod report page 9 noted that 45 of iraqs 2007 capital budget was spent through october 2007 june 2008 gao report said that total capital spending rose from 23 in 2006 to 28 in 2007 often in reporting on the iraqi ability to utilize its resources there is little distinction made between commitment of funding and spending of those funds despite the discrepancies in reported data it appears that some improvement has been made in iraqs ability to utilize its resources especially in view of the significant annual growth in the budget that must be executed according to dod the iraqi government spent 118 more on capital projects in the first five months of 2008 than in the same period in the preceding year 14 both us embassy and prt assistance are par tly aimed at helping ministries and local government respectively develop the capacity to efficiently utilize these iraqiowned resources see capacity development section below according to us officials since 2007 the government of iraq has taken significant steps to facilitate execution of its capital budget including

iraq match us economic aid appropriations on dollarfordollar basis alt hough the iraqi government budget on paper has provided funding for capital investments equivalent to the us reconstruction

announced at 72 billion of which 21 billion was for capital projects it has subsequently been lowered to 67 billion due to the fall in oil prices nonetheless it is clear that the iraqi 2008 budget for

invasion iraqs debt both public and private was estimated at 125 billion current total debt is estimated at 74 billion16 since 2003 the united states has argued that any new iraqi government should not be burdened with debts associated with the policies of its previous ruler and has supported near total forgiveness of debt some large holders of iraqi debtfrance germany and russia for instancewere more inclined to reschedule debt th an to forgive it arguing that as an oil rich country iraq could afford someday to pay its debts 17 several steps led to partial resolution of the debt issue series of meetings in early 2004 between the presidents personal envoy for iraq debt reduction former secretary of state james baker iii and the leaders of debt holding countries led to statements of support but firm commitment for varying levels of relief by september 2004 iraq had both assumed sovereignty and cleared its overdue financial obligations to the imf making it easier for iraq to negotiate an agreement with private and government creditors further congress authorized 360 million pl 108309 to cover the costs of cancelling the roughly 4 billion iraqi debt obligation owed the united states these factors culminated in an agreement by the 19 paris club government creditors on november 20 2004 to write off roughl 32 billion in iraqi debt 80 of what it owed to this group

principal military adviser to the us ambassador with the policy guidance of the ambassador lt general james dubik is the officer immediately in charge of overseeing the training and support of all iraqi security forces although the state department had assumed control of technical assistance provided to the different iraq ministries in october 2005 it ceded responsibility to dod for the two ministries most closely involved in security mattersinterior and defense among reasons given for this switch are that dod has greater resources at its disposal and that state has had difficulty filling advisor positions in these ministries the latter point disputed by some in most other countries state has responsibility for training police forces 28 third major us actor in the

assistance program came from the iraq relief and reconstruction fund irrf the nearly 21 billion provided through that account supported the entire range of economic and security programs although fy2004 irrf funding levels were initially established in 10 categories of assistance reconstruction priorities changed over time and allocations mirrored shifting events on the ground for example in november 2003 when the cpa decided to accelerate the handover of sovereignty it immediately revised the allocation of fy2004 irrf appropriations that had been legislatively mandated only weeks previously in order to increase substantially the democratization effortfrom 100 million to 458 million after the state department took charge in june 2004 the new us embassy country team reallocated fy2004 irrf resources emphasizing security needs increased oil production greater employment and democracy as th highest priorities at the expense of many largescale economic infrastructure projectsin particular water and sanitation and electricity that were viewed as too slow and dependent on an improved security situation to have an immediate impact although these and later reallocations were pragmatic responses to new events on the ground their cumulative impact was to divert funds from previously planned programs as result water and sanitation projects were cut by half from 43 billion to 21 billion and electric power programs lost quarter of their original funding from 56 to 42 billion in the end nearly quarter of the irrf 5 billion s gone to the training and equipping of iraqi security forces nearly half roughly 10 billion to economic infrastructurethe construction of water oil electric and other facilitiesand another quarter to range of more traditional assistance in health education policy reform and other areas these reconstruction programs have shown mixed results 30 there have been many positive outputs among achievements of the us reconstruction program more than 1200 security facilitiespolice stations border forts fire stations courts etcwere completed nearly half million police and military security forces have been trained and equipped as of october 23

production largely stagnant in the first few years has risen to near prewar levels yet along with the accomplishments have come less than satisfactory outcomes in the critical sectors of electric

overruns although the airports and seaport have shown considerable activity only tiny percentage of iraqi trains run because of security concerns but numbers have been improving in re cent months despite democratization efforts halting progress has been made on achieving national reconciliation including amending the iraqi constitution and holding longpromised local elections moreover the impact of us projects on iraq is hard to estimate and the extent to which they and otherdonor contributions meet the total needs of iraq has not been fully assessed while the us water and sanitation contribution has been significant the international committee of the red cross estimates that more than 40 of iraqis do not have access to clean water despite us efforts in the health sector oxfam reports that 90 of iraqs 180 hospitals lack basic medical and surgical supplies 32 us transport assistance is said to have repaired only 8 bridges of 1156 in poor condition or destroyed although mismanagement and corruption play large role in diminishing returns from reconstruction efforts it has been the lack of stability and the effects of the insurgency that have most affected the course of reconstruction to date see security section more peaceful environment in the past year has set the stage for noteworthy improvements in the electric and oil sectors

us programs including institution of 18 provincial procurement assistance teams several procurement assistance centers two in baghdad and one in erbil and range of training programs in public administration appear to have led to improvement over the previous years performance in this regard although the extent of that improvement has been subject to some dispute see oil revenue corruption and the iraqi capital budget section39 in 2005 and 2006 the sigir highlighted problems wi th us implementation and coordination of capacity development programs pointing out that as there was single organization responsible for the reconstruction effort the capacity building program had gone without an integrated plan providing coordination and priorities to the multiple organizations responsible for it these points were reiterated in an october 2007 gao report on the effort perhaps responding to the sigirs concerns in early 2007 the newly appointed coordinator for economic transition began leading an embassy budget execution initiative this initiative established an interagency task force to coordinate us activities including those of usaid and the us senior consultants assigned to each ministry the gao findings suggested that this and parallel efforts had not resolved coordination issues and that only in late 2007 had us officials begun to develop capacity development strategy 40

they work together with local community and iraqi government representativesforming provincial reconstruction development councils prdcsto identify projects that can be implemented and carried out with us financing it is anticipated that as result of this collaboration local governments may be strengthened while us projects achieve more lasting support the prts also work closely with provincial

addition to economic projects directly handled by the prts usaid runs several programs often in conjunction with the prts that address locallevel concerns the community action program cap funds projects identified by local representative associations stimulating democratic participation while meeting local needs and creating shortterm employment the community stabilization program csp addresses economic needs in specific strategic cities providing youth programs micro and small enterprise support and vocational training the local governance program lgp helps build management and

available to pacify the local population where prts reside large proportion of cerp projects support local smallscale infrastructure construction especially in the water and sanitation and electrical power sectors one problem with these multiple assistance programs is that they are implemented by different agencies with different funding sources and different authorities raising concerns regarding coordination of program coherence among other criticisms of the prts are that they lack clear lines of authority agreed missions and measurable objectives 45 security constraints may have negatively

originally reluctant to divert the necessary manpower from its other responsibilities the department of defense finally agreed to provide protection to the prts and memorandum of understanding to this effect was signed in november 2006 however according to an october 2006 sigir report minimum movement by prt personnel required three armored vehicles and eight shooters normal business was therefore difficult the sigir reported that ma ny prt members could not regularly meet with local government officials to carry out their capacitybuilding chores46 further former prt diplomat who left in january 2007 suggested that cal iraqis were too intimidated to meet with us staff and that training sessions had been cancelled due to security concerns47 in january 2007 congressional testimony however secretary rice indicated that civilian staff were able to meet regularly with local government personnel and ambassador satterfield claimed in february 2007 that the sigirs views on this issue did not reflect current reality but march 2007 article based on prt foreign service officer reports indicated that the security problem had persisted48 the october 2007 sigir report continued to find that prt performance was impeded by security concerns and its draft version even recommended that personnel be reassigned to better functioning prts until security improved according to the sigir the embassy and military promised new efforts to ensure that prts were not hindered by lack of appropriate security49 the march 2007 article mentioned above also raised the concern that security obstacles facing prts might increase as us troops protecting prt staff hand responsibility for security over to iraqi forces in september 2007 testimony to congress sigir official noted that there was little coordination between the prts and us military in those cases where security has been handed to the iraqis as result the official suggested that us civilians would be unable to move about freely and consequently prts might be unable to function in those areas where the us military steps down 50 whether the eprts are to be dissolved or redeployed elsewhere following the draw down on surge forces is not yet apparent the fy20082009 supplemental withheld all prt operating expenses and program funds until the state department reported on strategy for winding down and closing out the prts that strategy issued on september 7 2008 reportedly envisions that the mission currently carried out by prts will evolve into traditional usaid program at some point51 as of july 2008 there were about 450 us agency personnel in the prts counting temporary government employees and contractors52 up to mid2008 the availability of qualified us government civilian staff had been concern early reports of its

g8g152g155g140g142g561 one facet of the us reconstruction effort has been an attempt to encourage economic growth and decrease unemployment by trying to utilize iraqis in the implementation of projects in 20032004 this involved making iraqi businessmen awar of contract opportunities and encouraging us contractors to employ iraqi firms although us government requirements could be waived for iraqi contractors most work for iraqi business came in the form of subcontracts under us prime contractors when the state department took over reconstruction in july 2004 however greater efforts were made to contract project work directly with ir aqis by 2005 the sigir estimated that about 70 80 of new contracting was directly with iraqis 54 contributing factor in this effort was the deleterious impact of security on the activities of the largescale contractors in january 2005 contrack international holder of 325 million roads and bridges construction contract announced its withdrawal55 consequently many bridge and road projects were then implemented directly with the ministry of construction wi th estimated savings of between 30 and 4056 as some us contractors were shown to perform inadequate work they were replaced by iraqi contractors unfortunately increasing the use of iraqi contractors may have unintentionally increased opportunities for the diversion of us assistance for corrupt purposes while hundreds of iraqi firms were working on usfunded reconstruction projects at one time these numbers have fallen significantly as construction projects have been completed cerp and usaid community action program grants are often designed to directly employ large numbers of iraqis many at the village level about 118691 iraqis were reported to be employed under all usfunded

appropriationshas been made available for this purpose in april 2008 the iraqi government allocated 300 million to establish an iraqi cerp to be managed by the us military in addition to the dolls tee shirts sheep and other items reportedly provided to win popular support the cerp supports wide variety of reconstruction activities at the local level from provision of microgrants to businesses to digging wells to painting schools provided in the form of small grants 61 cerp also funds infrastructure efforts such as repair or provision of electric generators and construction of water and sewer systems roads and schools commanders identify local needs and dispense aid with few bureaucratic encumbrances major subordinate commanders have authority to approve grants up to 500000 the grants have been credited with helping the military better exercise their security missions while at the same time meeting immediate neighborhood development needs often much more quickly than equivalent efforts of the civilian reconstruction program in addition to reconstruction cerp funds are used for compensation payments to the families of killed or injured iraqis 62 the cerp has also been used to pay the salaries of the socalled sons of iraq formerly known as the concerned local citizens this effort accounts for more than one third of total fy2008 cerp obligations transition of responsibility for the sons of iraq to the iraqi government began on october 1 200863 as the irrf program has declined the cerp progra m has grown as major spigot of us aid in iraq from its beginnings as smallscale village programthe average grant in fy2004 was 67000it is now the major source of us infrastructure construction aid with an average grant in fy2006 of 140000 the most recent sigir report however indicates that in fy2008 the number of largescale projects has declined the 2009 defense authorization pl 110417 sec 1214 sets the maximum cost of cerp projects at 2 million unless waived by the secretary of defense and requires certification of any project over 1 million as an urgent need the sigir and others have raised some concerns regarding the cerp most derived from the essentially different security and reconstruction objectives of military and civilian efforts respectively among the sigirs concerns is that there is mechanism to measure the outputs and outcomes of cerp projects secondly the high turnover of military personnel in iraq means that there is little continuity in management and oversight of the projects third little weight has been given to the handingover of projects to iraqis and insuring their sustainability other observers have noted that civil affairs officers and others allocating cerp grants are not development specialists and have been provided little or training on the selection and management of reconstruction activities the programs early rationalethat the military were the only ones able to conduct smallscale reconstruction in places where civilian us officials and ngo aid personnel were unable to goappears less strong now that civilian eprt personnel are embedded in combat battalions further the october 2007 sigir report on the prts points to cases where the use of cerp funds to meet local needs conflicted with prt efforts to make local government assume responsibility for provision of local services and work with the provincial and national government instead of the us military to address problems 64 61 money as weapon washington post august 11 2008 62 sigir report to congress january 30 2007 appendix g 63 state department

reconstruction work is contingent on an environment of order and stability although in the past year there has been lessening of violence the cumulative effect on the reconstruction effort of years of continued instability has been manifold implementation of reconstruction projects was hindered security threats prevented prt personnel from communicating directly with local governments construction workers from appearing at their jobs and project managers from monitoring project work65 completed reconstruction projects and preexisting infrastructure were destroyed for instance in june 2007 eight of the twelve 400kv transmission lines were out of service greatly reducing the electricity supply to baghdad major pipelines were sabotaged shutting down oil exports along with criminal activity and poor equipment insurgent attacks are estimated to be responsible for the loss of 16 billion in oil revenue during two year period from 2005200666 reconstruction costs rose substantially due to the need to provide for security and insurance for personnel estimates of the portion of project costs devoted to security have varied widelya 2006 sigir survey of major us contractors found security costs to range from low of 76 to high of 167 unanticipated security costs as well as the related need to shift 18 billion from water and power projects to the training and equipping of iraqi forces meant that infrastructure programs could accomplish less than originally anticipated 67 fearing for their safety many aid implementors were withdrawn from the country with and some bilateral aid donors forced to run programs from jordan or kuwait utilizing iraqi personnel to the extent possible68 with implementors not able to meet with local people and design and monitor projects as they would in other countries the quality of aid has likely been negatively affected the pool of foreign expertise available to offer technical assistance has been restricted to those few willing to endure the countrys hardships us agency personnel stay only short time usually one year and therefore institutional knowledge is not maintained among the 24 million iraqis who have fled the country are professionals necessary to successful reconstruction in 2006 more than 300 teachers and ministry of education staff were killed since 2003 an estimated 8000 doctors fled the country thereby hindering the ability to open new health facilities notable signs of the decrease in violence in the past year are reports of the return of many foreign aid staff and the reappearance of 800 iraqi doctors 69

not yet been subject to program audits or project assessments including many traditional assistance programs such as those in democracy governance education agriculture nd economic growth sectors the expansion of sigir authority beyond the irrf will likely facilitate increased oversight of the esf and isff accounts that now compose the majority of us assistance to iraq some of the most egregious examples of misconduct found to date appear to center on the cpas use of iraqi funds during the yearlong occupation for instance january 2005 sigir audit found that the cpa provided less than adequate controls for 88 billion of dfi resources it moved through iraqi ministries an april 2005 audi t concluded that cpa managers of dfi funds distributed in the southcentral region of iraq could not account for more than 966 million in cash and receipts an october 2005 audit found that southcentral personnel could not account for more than 205 million in rapid regional response program funds and made 26 million in excessive payments in late 2005 several us citizens were criminally charged with respect to the handling of these fundsand have since pled guilty in february 2007 five more were indicted 76 while some investigations of reconstruction pr ograms utilizing usappropriated funds have raised the possibility of criminal activity many more have produced evidence of poor project implementation and questionable management and oversight of projects large proportion of these the responsibility of the army corps of engineers which runs the embassys project and contracting office sigir auditors and project assessment teams with engineering audit and investigative experience have traveled to major usfunded irrf project sites to see if work is being performed properly although most conclude that projects were either carried out as intended or point out correctable quality control and structural deficiencies the sigir has found some projects to be especially problematic including the following the basrah childrens hospital expected to cost 50 million will run to at least 98 million and nearly year behind schedule bechtel the project contractor was removed and the project will be completed using local contractors usaid the agency responsible failed to report the cost and delays in part because it had only one contracting officer and one technical officer to oversee 20 projects worth 14 billion 77 in september 2006 the sigir reported that the baghdad police college 75 million construction project implemented by parsons was riddled with deficiencies including improperly fabricated wastewater plumbing which poses health and structural hazard press reports in november 2007 indicate that the problems have still not been fixed by the contractor

under the tigris river failed amidst warnings from geologist that the subsoil was not conducive to drilling demonstrating lack of appropriate oversight by the army corps of engineers nearly 76 million in dfi funds were wasted82 an examination of task force shield program to train and manage an oil and electricity infrastructure protection force found it had been unsuccessful after the expenditure of 147 million in part this outcome was due to the absence of clear management structure for the various us agencies involved further auditors reportedly could not determine how many iraqis were trained or how many weapons were purchased83 an audit of designbuild contracts that characterize many of the infrastructure projects found very high administrative co sts in some cases about 55 of kbr work on the rio project and 43 of parsons oil project were consumed by overhead costs security is likely one factor in the high level of overhead found here and enforced idleness while awaiting government direction to begin work is another however the audit also found inadequate accounting and billing systems to capture administrative costs in four of five contracts examined84 roughly 370000 weapons purchased with 133 million in irrf funds for the use of iraqi security forces were not accompanied by spare parts or technical repair manuals and were not registered to insure accountability

many infrastructure projects are being started and completedamounts of kilowatt hours produced and oil pumped how many smallscale grants are being provid ed and how many people are being trained but there is little detail regarding to what degree the overall national need for drinking water schools health care electricity employment and other requirements is being met by the expenditure of billions of dollars in us resourcesnot to mention iraqi and other donor resourcestargeted at these needs when such data have been gathered they suggest that the needs are not being addressed to the extent required for example the gao has estimated that it will take 50 billion in infrastructure investments to meet needs in the electricity and oil production sectors alone 98 the extent to which specific iraqi needs are met is one way of assessing an assistance program the extent to which us policy objectives have been met is another with the exception of brief moment when what some would call an idealist ic administration appears to have sought to transform iraq into modern western nation the purpose of the us assistance program has at the very least been to create minimal level of stability in which minimally functioning iraq could take care of its own affairs the strategies to accomplish this end have changed over time while the strategy governing security assistance shifted from classroom military training to ever greater levels of cooperative usiraqi troop operations the strategy for economic assistance has moved from the construction of largescale infrastructure which chiefly characterized the period from 2004 through 2006 to technical assistance provided to encourage ministerial and local government capacities to manage and administer their own programs smallscale employment initiatives and hundreds of communitybased projects meant to supplement and supplant the stabilization activities of the us and iraqi security forces the impact of these economic aid efforts many underway on smaller scale since 2003 is much more difficult to weigh than for the infrastructure programs the seemingly most accessible potential measurement of success for the effort to enhance ministerial and local government capacities has been the rate of contracting and expenditure of capital investmentbudget execution in september 2007 the administration touted much improved level of budget execution over the previous year however january 2008 gao report suggested that figures employed to make that judgment were flawed and that the level of spending could not be established with thencurrent conflicting data 99 new data suggest an incremental improvement in iraqi budget execution capabilities but the picture remains fuzzy continued growth in size to assumption of lead roles and independent planningit also found the increase in the number of iraqi security forces being capable of operating independently of us troops to be unsatisfactory the gao pointing out that the number of independent units declined between march and july 2007 bluntly chose to describe the objective as not being met and the iraqi security forces independent assessment commission led by general james jones found that while the iraqi army is capable of taking over an increasing amount of daytoday combat responsibilities the iraqi forces would be unable to fulfill their essential
