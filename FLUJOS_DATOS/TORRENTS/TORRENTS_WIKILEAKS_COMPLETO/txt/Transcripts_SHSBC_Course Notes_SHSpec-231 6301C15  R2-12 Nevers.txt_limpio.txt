6301c15 shspec231 r212 nevers never represent rockslamming item ie anything that ever rockslammed because rockslamming item comes from some source and if you dont know what the source is it could be wrong an arbitrary source is dangerous this is the most dangerous point in r212 never use an arbitrary list dont try to oppose some rockslamming word that just comes from nowhere never abandon r212 nothing else will patch up r212 if it gets fouled up r212 is an ultimate process ie process that repairs itself never try to patch up r212 with something else because it will fail never let someone lose records or keep records inaccurately there is way to straighten out case whose records are lost however using the meter find when the pcs case caved in the session in which it occurred and put midruds in on that session this will get the pcs memory improved to the point where he can give you data about the list or whatever but this is very arduous approach never attribute violent arc break to anything but wrong item or an incomplete list it is not caused by missed withhold except in the sense that the missed item is the withhold this datum applies in the workaday world as well as it does in session somebody has missed an item on the us government probably the arc break is from noauditing and missing all their items never run pc darker and massier he wont get lighter come off it at once never give pc an item and then do something else at once this is very distracting to the pc and if it is wrong item the arc break will be compounded you must allow minute or two of observation just put the meter aside and make little routine of it and say well apparently your item is _______ watch him like hawk does his face get dark does mass come in if so dont let it go any longer tell the pc that you want to continue listing never lead pc to believe that you are giving him an item when you are not there can be funny condition where all the indicators look right but after the pc cognites the rock slam will vanish as the lock blows after which the wrongitem indicators start to show up so dont shift the pcs attention this will save lots of trouble the longer you let pc keep wrong item the more trouble it will be to patch it up never persist with wrong action that is worsening the case just because you dont know what to do it is far better to end off or take break to straighten things out it is good sense to know what you are doing before you do it this does not mean somatics thats not sign of the pcs getting worse at all never let case errors accumulate or multiply when you are aware of an error on the case fix it without forgetting that it is an error to fail to complete cycle of action on the case but also dont interrupt pc that is doing well if the case isnt running ok repair earlier mistakes all lists stem from some arbitrary point it cant be helped the three universes from which you list are 1 the pcs pt session environment 2 his pt nonsession life and livingness environment 3 the parts of existence each of these can be listed positive or negative oppterm or and terminal or thus you have twelve sources one way to make auditing with these less risky is when clearing the command to test it for rock slams this can include testing words or segments within the command for rock slams never represent it if it rockslams clear the command and vary it around until it makes sense to the pc until its real to him never try to list list question that the pc cannot answer ie clear it with him and get his agreement to answer it choosing the wrong universe to list will get you missed withhold phenomena including arc breaks because the pcs attention is fixated on the universe that you are not asking him about never in your anxiety to clear someone or pacify someone fail to get his ptps and hidden standards out of the way that is all in general that has been wrong with clearing
