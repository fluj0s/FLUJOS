establishment and functioning of the wassenaar arrangement it will be updated only if warranted by notable events related to the arrangement background for some 45 years the primary intern ational organizati on for coordinating restrictions on dualuse exports was cocom the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls1 cocom was formed in 1949 to limit militaryrelated transfers to communist countries at the time of its termination at the end of march 1994 it consisted of 17 industr ial countries including all members of nato except iceland and japan and aust ralia cocom operated on the basis of consensus and functioned without the existence of treaty or specific internationa l legal authorization in reality cocom consensus gave any member and that member was most likely to be the united states veto over the export by any other member of controlled good or technology the daytoday operations of cocom involve d meetings of secretariat in paris at which the members agreed upon the technical specifications of the dualuse items that were being considered for export to easter n europe the former soviet union and the peoples republic of china the secretariat also decided whether to allow exceptions tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20517crs2 2 this section is based on testimony of clin ton administration witnesses before the senate banking subcommittee on

restrictions irregular cocom high level meetings set or enunciated overall policy for the members to provide guidance cocom created three lists of controlled items an internationa l industrial list an internati onal atomic energy list and an international munitions list the ex port control organizations of the member countries then incorporated some variant of the listed items in the united states the export administration regulations containe d the us version of the items on the cocom lists since cocom had indepe ndent legal existence implementation of cocom decisions depended upon the eff ectiveness of the export c ontrol laws and bureaucracies of each of the individual members it was the responsibility of cocom member countries to pass and enforce adequate laws and regulations to control exports the comprehensiveness of the member countries export control regimes the degree of high level attention given to expor t controls and the effectiv eness of the export control bureaucracies varied considerably in almost every instance the united states was the most active in pursuing cocom limitations on exports while its major trading partners especially france the united kingdom and west germany often seemed more concerned about facilitating ex ports after the dissolution of the soviet union cocom members agreed in november 1993 to disb and cocom replace it with new entity and to move to national di scretion in export licensing decisions as of january 1994 national discretion meant that each country not cocom as an entity would determine what should be exported and country coul d veto the export decisions of another the wassenaar arrangement2 beginning in november 1993 clinton ad ministration representatives undertook major effort to create broadly based replacement accord for cocom which as initially conceived would include the former ly cocomproscribed countries it was initially hoped that this successor accord woul d be in place by the time that cocom was disbanded on march 31 1994 that deadline was not met this effort resulted in the establishment of initial elements of the wassenaar arrangement by 28 nations at the hague on december 19 1995 subject to the pproval of their governments after meetings in early april and midjuly 1996 the secretariat of the arrangement was established in vienna in 19963 initially called the new forum the

accord as the centerpiece of its efforts to promote multilateral restraint in conventional arms sales and transfers of sens itive military technologies4 the clinton conventional arms transfer policy set out in february 1995 was restatement of policy approach that has guided us arms transfers since the reagan administration the wassenaar arrangement formally titled the wassenaar arrangement on export controls for conventional arms and dualu goods and technolog ies does not appear to break any new ground in the multilateral conventional arms cont rol area previous attempts to achieve regional conventional arms sales agr eements most notably the effort in 19911992 by the george hw bush administration aimed at securing restraint on middle east arms sales by the five perm anent members of the security council failed due to the lack of consensus among the parties regardin g which weapons could be sold and to whom elements of the wasse naar arrangement dealing with conventional weapons transfers depend for their success on securing the agreement of other weapons suppliers to forego activities that might otherwise be to their political or financial benefit there are four major areas of policy concern within the wassenaar arrangement these areas are membership target count ries materials to be controlled and organizationoperati onal procedures membership the initial negotiations on the successor accord among the 17 cocom members were expanded to include in addition to the original members several new european countries and new zealand as participants then at the january 1994 moscow summit secretary of state christophe r and russian foreign minister kozyrev issued joint statement welcoming the decision to establish new multilateral regime and indicating russias wish to join in the sp ring of 1994 state depar tment officials stated that they would oppose the accession of russia to the new regime as long as it continued weapons sales to iran the russian decision to sell nuclear power reactors to iran further complicated matters by early 1995 the united states still was unwilling to agree to russian participation in the formation of the new regime while other members of cocom were unwilling to start the new regime without the russians the matter was resolved in june 1995 at gorechernomyrdi n meeting when the russians agreed not to make any new weapons contracts with iran or to sell nuclear re processing equipment the agreed membership criteria under the wassenaar arrangement are that participants have ade quate export controls adhere to the major existing nonproliferation regimes the missile technology cont rol regime australia group and nuclear suppliers group and have responsible expor t control policies to ward the socalled pariah countries iran iraq libya and north korea according to clinton administration officials china has not been invited to join the new regime because of concerns by the united states and its allies regarding chinese weapons exports to ira n pakistan and other shortcomings in meeting membership criteria5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20517crs4 5 continued international finance and monetary

statement washington post and lynn davis statement op citclosely related to the question of russian participation has been the participation of the other members of the fo rmer soviet union the export control system that existed in the soviet union was centralized in moscow the countries that had been part of the soviet union had few responsibilities for c ontrolling exports since 1991 the amount of attention paid by these newl independent countries to developing adequate export controls has varied greatly even now high level of uncertainty continues to exist as to the export control capabilities and the willin gness of leaders of these countries to support export controls generally and an association such as the wassenaar arrangement specifically6 target countries second major area of polic concern relates to countries against which the new arrangement is to be targeted from the outset the united states has wanted to target countries of concern specifically identif ied as iran iraq libya and north korea however most of the count ries participating in the negotiations have preferred setting general objective of promoting security and stability and then letting each member country determine its export c ontrol policies and target countries as currently constructed wassenaar will not however be directed against any state or group of states impede bona fide civil transactions nor interfere with the rights of states to acquire legitimate means with which to defend themselves france germany and russia in particular are opposed to us proposal to require advance notification of arms sales to regions of cern however former under secretary of state lynn davis noted that participants in the wassenaar rrangement have nationa l policies banning arms and related exports to iran li bya iraq and north korea secretary davis also noted the us will continue to insist that prospective new members adhere to such policies7 based on discussions at the december 1996 plenar session secretary davis said that participating country was curre ntly transferring arms or ammunition to afghanistan in keeping with recent security council resolution materials to be controlled under the wassenaar arrangement member states have agreed to control exports or retransf ers of items and tec hnologies contained on an agreed basic list of dualuse goods and t echnologies and sepa rate munitions list information on transfers of more than 100 sensitive dualuse goods and technologies on the agreed list are to be shared by members of the arrangement arms transfer

adopted by the plenary of 1112 july 1996 and final version of the initial elements list of dualuse goods and technologies and munitions list the latter dated august 1 1996 is 194page document detailing all dualuse and munitions items covered by the arrangement these key documents which are updated as changes occur in the lists can also be found at the continuedregime organizati on and operations related to the questions concerning which items should be controlled is the i ssue of regime organi zation and operations none of the participants in the process appear s to favor the types of strong controls and us dominance that existed under cocom national discreti on with coordination is the most rigorous procedural option that emerged from the negotiations indeed american officials have publicly acknowledged that only the united states favors prior notification of transfers and th is procedure is not part of th new regime during plenary sessions and working group discussions unde r wassenaar member governments are to share information on potential threats to peace and stability they are to examine closely dubious weapons or technology acquisition tre nds specific information regarding global transfers to nonparticip ating countries of arms in the seven categories including model and type and technology is to be made available in this manne r as are notices of denials of transfers of specific items on the lists established by the wassenaar arrangement members will regularly review the dualuse and munitions li st to reflect technological advancements and experience gained8 the arrangement envisions more intens ive consultations and more intrusive information sharing among 6 major weapons suppliers the united kingdom the us france russia germany and italy throug h transparency of na tional activities involving weapons and technology transfers it is hope d that dangerous acquisition patterns can be detected and halted before they become problematic at the july 1112 1996 meeting in vienna the 33 wassenaar states approved the initial elements to govern the arrangemen t and set november 1 1996 as the date to launch both the control aspects of the agreem ent and the information exchange under the arrangement twice year participating states report all transfers or licenses issued for sensitive dualuse goods or tec hnology items in annex 1 which is subset of the dual use list currently for transfers in the seven categories in the case of conventional arms transfers biannual data exchange among participants gives details of arms deliveries twice year participating states also report denials of licenses to transfer items on the dualuse list to nonme mber states when participating state denies an export license for sensitive dualuse items it is to notify other participants on an early and timely basis preferably within 30 days but definitely within 60 days the arrangement does not prohibit participa ting country from making an export to particular destination that s been denied by another par ticipant this practice is called undercutting but participan ts are required to notify other participants within 60 days and preferably within 30 days after they approve license for an export of sensitive dual use goods that are essentially identical to those that have been denied by another participant during the previous three years9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20517crs6 9 continued internet site for the wassenaar arrangement which provides current official news releases and other background material relating to

2000 pp 17 19 details of decisions at all annual mee tings are found at h ttpwwwwa ssenaarorgat the december 1999 plenary session of wassenaar arrangement members the us team proposed reporting on specific ex ports rather than aggregated reporting reporting on exports of all listed items not just the sensitive and very sensitive items extensive preexport reporting and unde rcut rule which would ban exports by wassenaar partner of goods already denied by another partner russian and ukrainian delegates reportedly blocked these reforms and the primary accomplishment was joint statement of the importance of strong enforcement based on national laws10 beginning with the december 2000 plenary meeting memb er states continued to reaffirm their concern regarding the threats posed by the illicit possession and use of man portable airdefence systems manpads and agreed on elements of export controls on such weapons in subsequent december plenary meetings of the wassenaar arrangement through 2005 member states have also r eaffirmed their commitment to prevent the acquisition of conventional ar ms and dualuse goods and t echnologies by terrorist groups and organizations and by individual terrorists agreed to document setting out detailed best practice guidelines and criteria for sm all arms and light weapons salw exports and agreed to impose strict controls on the activities of those who engage in the brokering of conventional arms by in troducing nd implementing adequate laws and regulations based on agreed elements for eff ective legislation on arms brokering issues for congress compliance with memb ership criteria the agreed membership criteria of the wassenaar arrangement basically rely upon statements by members that they will abide by fairly general standards since the russian export control system and those of other nis countries lack substantial tran sparency what steps can be taken to ensure that the membership criteria will be complied with by these states and others with traditions of weak export control systems mechanisms to induce highe r standards of evaluation is there an effective means by which the united states can induce acceptance of higher standards for evaluating sensitive technology transfers by other participating st ates is legislation sanctioning nations that tinue to transfer weapons and technology to aggressive nations in regions of tension such mech anism would greater emphasis on use of oversight mechanisms in us law such as the arms export control act or the reauthorization of the export administrati on act provide the united states with more effective means of achieving some of the fundamental goals it has been pursuing through the wassenaar arrangement
