amount of damages required for federal court jurisdiction which must exceed 15000000 per person under hr 860 2 one reason opponents may have objected to the xpansion of the district courts

accident cases differs from that of hr 860 in three respects first it is limited to accidents involving the death or injury of 75 individuals rather than 25 casualties that served as threshold for hr 860 second it drops hr 860s requirement that each injured plainti ff have sustained damages of more than 150000 third it makes mention of ame ndments to 28 usc 1407 under which hr 860 would direct transfer from one federa l district court to another of cases arising under the act in this last regard hr 860 would have added new subsection j1 to 1407 which would have allowed the transferee court to retain jurisdiction over the case for determination of liab ility and punitive damages the tr ansferee court would remand the case to the district court from which it was transferred or to the state court from which the case was removed for the determination of damages other than punitive damages unless the transferee court found for the convenience of partie s and witnesses and in the
