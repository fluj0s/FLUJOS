include weighing the potential effectiven ess of policy options assessing threat reduction approaches to specific agents and serving as resource for developing other specialized frameworks defense against chemical and biological ag ents is high on the list of the nations priorities clear consensus exists with respect to which agents pose the greatest threat previous analyses of the chemical and biological threat have largely revolved around historical and compara tive treatments or been ba sed in military framework examination of the chemical and biological threat to civilians is more complicated agents whose characteristics make them poor military weapons ma still be powerful if deployed as weapons of terror chemical and biological weapons used in the past have not always been chosen for the highest potential fatalities but rather for other reasons some chemical and biological agents are closely regulated both domestically and internationally expansion or further refinement of policies controlling these agents may lower the threat posed by terrorist use of them domestic policy options to reduce the threat posed by these agen ts include methods to prevent their use consequence management after their use and methods for protecting the public from them specific policies to implement these goals include improving the general public health system increasing prophylaxi s research developm ent of new medical countermeasures treatments increasing intelligence gathering and increasing regulation of dualuse technology intern ational policy options include development of new biosecurity agreements and increasing participation in current non proliferation organizations it is impossible to eliminate the risk of chemical or biological terrorism important issues facing policymakers include balancing the need for increased security with the potential economic costs associated with increased regulation and redirected federal resources determining the relative ratio between general and specific countermeasures against chemical and biological terrorism and assessing the success of federal efforts at reducing chemical and biological terrorism

introduction public concern about the na tions vulnerability to chemi cal and biological cb terrorism was amplified by the consequences of the anthrax mailings that sickened 22 people and killed 5 betw een september and novemb er 2001 subsequent cb terrorism events such as the ricin mailings to the white house in 2003 and to the senate in 2004 have served to highlight the potential for future terrorist attacks using cb agents cb weapons previously consid ered to be of inte rest mainly to military planners are now topic of public and c ongressional interest compared with most conventional weapons cb w eapons are less well underst ood and have the potential to cause mass casualties even if used in smaller attacks c b weapons have the potential to cause mass terror potential effects of cb terrorist event vary widely depending on the agent used the effectivene ss of its dissemination the target struck and the public reaction to the event this report addresses the potential terrorist use of cb agents including toxins the focus of this report is on smallscale targeted chemical and biological attacks in this framework manufact ure and dissemination of m odest amounts of material able to cause significant casualties in building subway station or other enclosed space rather than on citywide scale are discussed this approach attempts to analyze the threat posed by various agen ts if used by small nonstatesponsored terrorist groups that may lack the technolog expertise or logistical capability to mount large masscasualty attack to provide policymakers with background and analysis for prioritization of federal resources this framework summarizes the characteristics of each agent into broad categories with coarse scale rather than highly differentiated multidimensional ranking it is likely that policymakers will find more detailed analysis than that presented here helpful when refining policy alternatives reports that discuss chemical and biol ogical agents must be careful not to provide terrorist groups with information or opportunities that are not already known to them this report follows the precedent set by other publications in this field by not providing

designed to be used as potential springboard to assess and prioritize responses to the various cb agents that mig ht be used by terrorist it provides potential policy framework for use by congress as it considers legislative issues associated with the potential use of such agents by terrorists some previous assessments of the cb th reat have highlighted the difficulty of developing and producing agents but th assessments may ignore significant advances in the areas of dualuse technology2 such technology may significantly ease cb agent production by small groups additionally concerns have been raised about the applicability of previous assessm ents especially those developed using military framework to civilian settings and casualties the classification of cb weaponry into the catchall category of w eapons of mass destru ction wmd has led to consideration of cb use primarily on masscasualty scale3 this treatment may misstate the potential civilian vulnerability to smallscale terrorist cb attack treatment of terrorist attacks on masscasualty scale has produced many worstcase scenarios but few assessments of the wide spectrum of potential cb agents the merging of all unconventional hi ghconsequencelow probabilityofuse weapons into single category is advant ageous for some military planning but can obfuscate assessment of each weapon type or individual agent all of the weapons of mass destruction differ from each other significantly in effect effort required for development and production and dissemination while th impact of nuclear and radiological devices varies largely depending on the si ze of the device the impact of different chemical and biolog ical agents has wider varia tion for example the agent used can determine if the result is temporary

wmd to better address the threat posed by individual cb agents addressing events with smallscale casualties generally has been outside the purview of previous assessments though smallscale terrorism is noted as being more likely than masscasualty events4 after the events of october 2001 smallscale terror events also concern the public it is concern for policymakers that analyses on and preparations against largescale chemical and bi ological attacks may not be widely applicable to events occurring on smaller scales this concern was expressed in the first annual report of the advisory panel to assess the domestic response capabilities of the govern ment for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction also known as the gilmo re commission looking at lower probabilityhigher consequence scenarios it stated such scenarios however are at odds with the focus of current policy and preparedness efforts which have been based on less than comprehensive information and analysis which seem to emphasize the lowerprobabilityhigherconsequence attacks at the expense of higherprobabilitylowerconsequence incidents the guiding assumption has been that smallerscale nonmasscasualty events are lesserincluded contingency that can be addressed adequately by preparations for the higherend mass casualty attacks this is by means axiomatic 5 to address these concerns this report focuses on smallerscale targeted terror attacks rather than addressing cb weapons in masscasualty framework this report establishes an assessment framework for cb agents to help policymakers develop riskmanagement based policies to counter terrorist use of cb agents vulnerability threat and risk are related terms vulnerability represents the impact an event could have and contains measures of protec tion and preparedness threat represents the probability that given event will occur and contains measures of both capability and intention risk is th combination of vulnerability with threat risk management approaches rely on reducing vulnerability threat or both to lower the overall risk of attack the assessment framework presented here is generic in the sense that it does not incorporate the motivations or capability of specific terrorist organization risk assessment of sp ecific terrorist organizations likelihood of using cb weapons would incorporate these factors independent think tanks nd federal government agen cies have developed and modeled scenarios through exercises includi ng federal and local officials to assess the potential impact of cb attack these exercises provide vulnerability assessment rather than threat or risk assessment the potential public threat posedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs4 6 the johns hopkins center for

rs21021 terrorism and related terms in stat ute and regulation selected language by elizabeth martinby cb terrorism is not accurately assessed through the development of worstcase scenario exercises such as dark winter topoff topoff 2 and others67 these exercises are instructive in establishing the united states current cb vulnerability but they do not assess many factors needed to understand the cb risk for example it is unclear whether the pathogens chosen for the exercises smallpox and pneumonic plague respectively represent agen ts likely to be chosen by terrorist without understanding the range of likely cb agents rather than the range of possible cb agents it is difficult to convert vulnerability assessments into threat assessments therefore it is difficult to make effective policy based strictly on vulnerability assessments the genera l accounting office gao has advocated using riskmanagement approach rather than vulnerability assessments to limit the potential damage done by cb attack8 background definition of cb terrorism there are several federal definitions of terrorism9 for example the us department of defense dod defines terrorism as the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally politicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs5 10 us department of defens dod dictionary of military and associated terms joint publication 102 as amended through december 17 2003 11 28 cfr 085 also see us department of justice terrorism in the united states federal bureau of investigation 1999 12 the definition used here closely follows that used by w seth carus in bioterrorism and biocrimes the illicit use of biological agents since 1900 center for counterproliferation research washington dc nati onal defense university 2001 13 this definition is not the broadest definiti on for terrorism as it excludes actions taken by nationstates and does not require that th victims of terrorism be noncombatants 14 for an overview of the aum shinrikyo use of sarin in the tokyo subway system see david

terror the implications of terrorism motivated by religious imperative rand document p7834 1993religious or ideological10 the us department of justice doj defines terrorism as the unlawful use of force and violen ce against persons or property to intimidate or coerce government the civilian population or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives11 because of differences in federal definitions of terrorism especially in the areas of threatened use and articulation of goals this report uses more encompassi ng definition for cb terrorism for the purposes of this report cb terrorism refe rs to the use of chemical or biological agents by individuals or groups motivated by ideology but not necessarily accompanied by stated po litical or social agenda12 by using this definition attacks which have large apparently random component to them may be included as terrorist events13 this definition includes several cb terrorist events to date such as the ricin mailings in 2003 and 2004 the anthrax ma ilings in 20 01 the aum shinrikyo sarin gas attack in tokyo in 199514 and the rajneeshees use of salmonella poisoning in oregon in 198415 probability of cb weapon attack most experts agree that the probability of cb attack on domestic target remains much smaller than that of comp arably damaging att ack with conventional arms the instantaneous consequence of greater access to and relative ease of using conventional weapons all c ontribute to the likelihood of conventional weapon use additionally terrorist organi zations have historically chosen to use proven attack methods rather than attempt attacks with less wellestab lished technologies16 experts debate whether cb agents have become weapons with special value to potential terrorists due to their psychological effect on the public some experts havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs6 17 see for example jeffrey d simon the growing threat of bioterrorism in the age of super

attacks with biological weapons ce nter for strategic and international studies february 12 2001asserted that terrorist groups will continue to escalate the level of violence employed including cb agents so that reaction nd attention is drawn to their actions17 some experts feel that it is simply matter of time until terrorists begin using cb weapons in earnest in 1999 washington post opinion article then defense secretary cohen stated also looming is the chance that these rror weapons will find their way into the hands of individuals and independent groups fanatical terrorists and religious zealots beyond our borders brooding l oners and selfproclaimed apocalyptic prophets at home this is not hyperbole it is reality18 in may 2002 defense secretary rumsfe ld told the senate appropriations committee they terrorists inevitabl will get their hands on them weapons of mass destruction and they will not hesitate to use them19 experts holding this view believe it is matter of when rather than if terrorists will use cb or other wmd technology against civilian targets other experts believe that the histori cal record shows few successful attempts at cb terrorism and that past trends ar relevant to future assessments for example milton leitenberg senior fellow at the center for international and security studies at the university of ma ryland has written the threat assessment most particularly regarding bw terrorism the potential for bw use by nonstate actors has been greatly exaggerated20 some experts claim that the ease of using conventional weapons so heavily outweighs the potential benef its of using more challe nging unconventional method that it makes cb terrorism unlikely anthony h cordesman arleigh burke chair in strategy at the center for strategic and international studies stated most terroristextremist attacks to date on americans inside and outside the us have used conventional explosives and the 1993 world trade center and oklahoma city bombings show that such attacks can be very costly21 the publics response to highly visible acts of property dest ruction may provide disincentive for cb agent usage groups accustomed to shocking the populacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs7 22 another possibility is the use of chemical or biological agents in conjunction with conventional weapons the combination of these two attack types presents additional policy challenges and considerations which are beyond the scope of this report 23 for an overview of the different factors potentially motivating terrorist groups towards cb use

this topic see crs report rs21422 dualuse biological equipment difficulties in domestic regulation by dana sheathrough infrastructure destruction may c hoose to use conventional weapons rather than unconventional arms because of th greater visual display of property destruction also cb agent developm ent requires greater time and financial investment than development of conventional explosives and it demands higher degree of training groups may not be able or willing to invest such high proportion of resources in unconventiona l weapons given the relative ease of obtaining and using conventional weapons finally the effects of cb agents are more unpredictable than conventional wea pons nd may be delayed in time this uncertainty may make them less likely to be chosen by terrorist group especially group with limited resources or opportunity22 in contrast some analysts point out that the changing nature of terrorist organizations may lower the barriers for t hose groups who wish to use chemical or biological agents23 historically terrorist groups tended to possess clear defined political aims and easily identified c onstituents these groups activities were constrained by the cultural and moral beliefs of their constituents including the general aversion to the use of chemical or biological agents additionally the potential for disease transmission from an infected terrorist target to terrorist supporter was viewed as barrier to biol ogical terrorism recently terrorist groups bearing fundamentalist ex tremist view lacking clear political goals and having diffuse less easily identif ied constituency have b ecome more common many analysts suspect that the taboo against use of cb agents has weakened since these groups may be less susceptible to traditi onal deterrents and ma be less concerned with maintaining high level of legitimacy to their constituents changes in political makeup of these groups also may result in reassessment of the terrorists choice between conventional nd unconventional arms24 recent advances in dualuse technology may reduce the tec hnological barriers for terrorist groups who wish to engage in cbrelated attacks industries and academia especially in the area of microbi ology increasingly employ technologies that can be converted to c b agent producti on with moderate to low effort these dualuse technologies provide prospective terrorists with equipment that can be obtained by theft or purchase policym akers may be require d to reassess the likelihood of terrorists using cb agents as technical barriers to cb agent development may become less of hindrance25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs8 26 the russian federation and the united states have ratified the chemical weapon convention which went into force in

various times also developed their own biological and chemical programs though some of these programs are longer supported27 chemical and biological weapons were initially deve loped in military

researching potential chemical and biologi cal weapon use it has been reported that some known terrorist groups have an in terest in acquiring such weapons36 cb assessments assessments by government agencies an assessment of terrorist threat is difficult to quantify since many of the variables involved are not reliably known some of these variables include the skill level of various terrorist groups the location and size of terrorist assets and the possession of any particular cb agent as consequence the exact threat faced is indeter minable from the open literature and the risk involved can only be estimate d vulnerability can be assessed through the development of scenarios including worstcase scenarios vulnerability studies do not address the likelihood of an att ack occurring they only assess possible outcomes if an attack very similar to the one modeled occurs it is commonly thought that worstcase scenario is likely to occur since many lowprobability events must occur for the worst to happen however given the nature of some cb agents even nonwors tcase events could have huge psychological effects public health impacts and economic costs for the

past events is difficult and perhaps misleading to assess the threat from other nations the us intelligence community has prepared several national intelligence estimates on the biological and chemical capabilities of foreign states37 within these classified estimates reportedly the cb agents that have the highest relative probability of use have been described but these reports are not available in the open literature38 presumably the directorate for information analysis and infrastructure protection in the department of homeland security and the terrorist threat integration center

potential use of biological weapons discussion of possibilities rand corporation december 1989weapons and battlefield casualties these an alyses may inadequately address terrorist use of cb agents against civilian populations several key factor s cited as necessary conditions for military use would not be required in smallerscale assault on civilian targets using limited dispersal of cb agents for example military assessments include factors such as stab ilization of the cb agent for storage and transport purposes dispersal technologie s for maximum airborne dissemination timeliness of agent effectivene ss and integration within th battle plan additionally many of the military assessments especially those relating to chemical agents are made specifically in relation to use by an opposing military with considerations of chemical prophylaxis and pr otective equipment being included finally recurring theme in military assessments is the diffi culties involved in disseminating an agent against target in the open tactic requiri ng training in meteorology and engineering in addition to chemical and or biological training concerns of storage stability and mass dissemination are examples of why military assessment may differ from one using terrorism framework while it is likely true that only statefunded biolog ical or chemical weapons program could successfully develop the technology necessa ry to make bulk cb agents that are stable under longterm storage in munition fo rm terrorist who wishes to make gram quantities of cb agent and disseminate it for example with modified pesticide sprayer would be unconstrained by thes criteria this underscores the gilmore commissions concern that largescale wmd analysis may be inappropriate when applied to terrorist events44 agents whose characteristics make them poor military weapons may still be pow erful if deployed as weapons of terror how difficult is it to develop cb agents for terrorist use experts disagree on the difficulty of cb agent manuf acture many experts believe that it is relatively easy to manufacture some chemical agents45 while others point to the apparent difficulties that st ate actors have had in veloping chemical weapons programs some experts cl aim that development of w eaponized biological agents presents remarkably high hurdles partic ularly in mass disse mination which would require teams of scientists w ith state backing to overcome46 other experts believe that single moderately well funded individual could velop biological weapon in home basement47 richard danzig while he wa s under

pr ocess very primitive pro cess that could let you get trillion spores in one gram49 other experts dispute this assertion50 one explanation for some of the differences among expert views lies in assumptions of event size experts who opi ne that terrorist use of biological and chemical weapons is difficult tend to consid er such agents in the framework of mass destruction with fata lities numbering in the thousands and casualties in the tens of thousands of people which would requi re mass production of agents and the independent development of efficient effective distribution systems51 in contrast others argue that the small batches require d for targeted lowcasualty attack would be relatively ease to produce the aum shin rikyo sarin gas attack in tokyo and the anthrax mailings demonstrated that an attack utilizing either chemical or biological agent need not inflict mass casualties to cause widespread disruption figure 1 provides comparison between the steps necessary to develop mass casualty chemical weapon and those require d for the same agent to be used on smaller scale in terrorist attack figure 2 shows similar comparison for biological weapons while the exact crite ria needed to develop cb agent vary with the agent the primary difference between the two flowcharts is that for terrorist distribution of cb agent many steps considered to have high practical difficulties may be nonexistent in the case of terrorist groups that wish to launch only small scale attack and that have low regard for their personal safety52 such steps include developing agents that have long storage shelf life optimizing largescale dissemination device developing rigo rous prophylaxis and optimizing the manufacturing process so as to make mass quantities of the cb agent these steps indicated by italics in the flowchart for milita ry use are not necessarily required for terrorist group use and therefore have been removed from the flowchart for terrorist programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs13 experts contend that for large scale attacks these steps represent barriers of comparable importance to terrorist or ganization if terrorist groups focus on smaller scale distribution of cb agents the amount of agent necessary to inflict dozens to thousands of casualties can be ma using only research scale rather than massproduction facilitie s if terrorist group decide s that smallscale distribution is acceptable disseminating agents either as crude aerosol or solution through the use of converted industrial equipment w ould become viable if inefficient distribution method the problem of long term agent storage is bypassed if only enough material for each use is prepared shortly before being used these compromises reduce the effec tive lethality of given am ount of agent as several nonoptimized steps are involved but this could be addressed through production of more agent these compromises result in removing many of the hurdles cited as being

agent analysis cb agents are presented in matrix fra mework in this section with the agents ranked by number of barriers to their use in small scale terrorist attacks rather than use in masscasualty attacks or military use because of the differences among the agents they are divided into three categories chemical agents biological agents and toxins toxins are separated from biolog ical agents because they do not reproduce in host and are separated from chemical agents because of their biological origin each cb agent type is analyzed according to criteria specific to its category negative sign denotes an aspect that poses si gnificant barrier to terrorist use or that is negative influence to terrorist use positive sign refers to an aspect that does not pose significant barrier to terrorist use or that is positive influence to terrorist use the rank represents an intermediate state the matrices present agents for comparison within category but agents should not be compared across different matrices as the criteria used vary for each matrix appendix contains detailed description of the methodology used to develop these matrices the successful development of cb agent requires certain level of individual competence and training53 the analysis here applies only to cases where terrorist groups possess such levels of skill als reasonable financial means on the part of the terrorist is assumed since this report focuses on the ability of groups or individuals to develop sma llscale production capacity it is also assumed that there is overt statesponsorship of the terrori st group and as consequence there has been documented technology transfer to the terrorist group from national biological or chemical wea pons program in order to compare the impact of different cb agents the target is assumed to be the same in each case mediumsized enclosed space such as an office building or subway sta tion the effect of changing these assumptions is explored in the discussion section chemical agent comparison most chemical agents unlike biological or toxin agents do not naturally occur typically larger amount of chemical agent is required for equivalent effect than biological or toxin agent some chemical agents were discovered during research in chemical warfare and others in civilian research areas such as pesticide development chemical agents have widely varying effects and forms some chemical agents are toxic or corrosive gases commonl found in industrial processes54 other chemical agents are not used in manufacturing pr ocesses and are used only as weapon finally some chemical wea pons have found civilian appli cations in other areas and are manufactured for those purposes for ex ample nitrogen mustard has been used for cancer

agents require artificial synthesis and manufacture so prospective terrorist w ould be concerned with their relative ease of production while dualuse chemical agen ts are potentially available by theft or purchase in large quantity many chemical agents require dedicated synthetic effort to acquire in bulk in some cases precurs or chemicals required to synthesize agents can be purchased on research scale without undue difficulty61 the technology necessary to manufactur most chemical agents is known through the open literature the safety and efficiency of chemical synthesis and manufacturing practices have increased substantially since the early manufacture of chemical agents while the equipment necessary for largescale manufacture of these agents is regulated through export

inhaled for ffect single scale of impact such as lethality would strongly underreport the imp act of blister agent which requires relatively large quantities to kill but little to cause intense pain and disfigurement on the other hand using lethality as th only scale would overreport the impact of nerve agent which can be lethal but generally causes much less harm at sublethal dosages because of

are generally grown suspende d in liquid solutions they are more difficult than chemical agents to effectively disseminate in the air they may be disseminated via other media see below so biological agents can be dried and ground into small particles whic h can be released as aerosols but this is fairly advanced technique because of the natura l filtering capacity of the human airways there is an optimal range of particle size that will deeply penetrate the lungs many experts cite the difficulty of preparing or disseminating biological agents in such particle size range as primary barrier to terrorist use othe r experts counter that commercial disseminati on equipment namely technol ogies similar to yard foggers and crop dusters can be adapted to provide aerosols that while not optimal in size will still be infectious additionally not all biological agents must be lodged deep in the lungs to cause infection some biological agents are contagi ous from person to person each person infected with biological agent which is contagious by casual contact can become new dissemination vector these highly contagious agents might be viewed by terrorists as more useful than other types of biological agents as people not in the original exposed area may fall ill through such contact all other factors being equal contagious agents that require close contact may be viewed by terrorist as less useful than those needing only casual contact due to the lower probability of secondary infection another common infectious pathway is through ingestion via contaminated water beverages or food but some pathogens are less virulent by this route than by inhalation it is logistically complex to affect large numbers of people with significantly lethal pathogen through cont aminating the food or

much more lethal than that caused by flea bites the victims require isolation nd intensive hospital care therefore plague receives for public health impact there is vaccine against plague but it has not been shown to be effective against pneumonic plague if an outbreak is detected antibiotics can be taken prophylactically to prevent infection thus plague receives for prophylaxis because pneumonic plague re sponds well to antibiotics only within the first 24 hours after symptom onset it receives for resistance to medical treatment in contrast to the type of plague transmitted by fleas pneumonic plague is contagious through casua l persontoperson contact86 therefore each in itially infected individual could eventually inf ect several others this would allow terrorist to bypass the technically challeng ing development of an aerosolizing device each infected person becomes potential vector for the spread of the disease because of this plague receives for ease of dissemination plague was reportedly studied by both the us and former ussr weapons programs87 the formerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs29 88 ken alibek biohazard the chilling true story of the largest covert biological weapons program in the world told from inside by the man who ran it op cit ussr reportedly successf ully weaponized plague and is rumored to have developed antibioticresistant strains88 anthrax is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis this bacterium occurs naturally in many locations around the world therefore in table 2 anthrax receives for ease of acquisition untr eated inhalational anthrax is nearly always fatal the aggressive medical trea tment victims received during the 2001 anthrax outbreak reduced the mortality rate to approximately 50 five of eleven because of the high mortality rate and the need for hospitalization for treatment inhalational anthrax rates for public health impact because the anthrax vaccine and antibiotics work prophylactically anthrax receives in the prophylaxis category antibiotics are used against anthrax but the success of this treatment depends on diagnosis shortly after onset of symptoms therefore anthrax receives for resistance to medical treatment in table 2 traditionally it is considered difficult to produce the very fine particle size necessary to inflict mass casualties however to inflict causalities on more modest scale tens to hundreds cruder preparation with nonoptimal particle size distribution may be sufficient therefore for smallscale attack anthrax receives for ease of dissemination an thrax was reportedly successfully weaponized by both the us and former u ssr programs antibiotic resistant strains could be deve loped while this would increase the public health impact the technical ability required to do this would decrease the ease of acquisition in 1984 the rajneeshee cult successfully employed salmonella typhimurium in oregon restaurants sickening 751 people this bacterium is ubiquitous causing an estimated 40000 cases of food poisoning in the united states each year therefore salmonella receives for ease of acquisition in table 2 because salmonella usually doe s not require hospita lization it receives for public health impact there is vaccine for salmonella because of the lack of vaccine salmonella receives for prophylaxis si nce antibiotic treatme nt for salmonella is well established salm onella receives under resist ance to medical treatment salmonella needs to be ingested so the only effective route for dissemination would be through deliberate food beverage or water cont amination therefore salmonella typhimurium receives for ease of dissemination toxin agents comparison toxins are poisonous substances that are produced by living organisms including plants animals algae and bacter ia these substances cause damage when introduced into the body often toxin is the lethal agent in bacterial infection rather than the bacteria themselves for example intestinal infection with clostridium botulinum is lethal due to the toxins that are exuded into the body not simply because of the presence of bacteria in some cases these toxins can be produced in sufficient quantities and isolat ed from the organisms that produce them unlike living pathogens toxins do not replicate the human body is capable of developing antibodies to neutralize many toxinshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs30 89 the rolling text for the draft bwc protocol from february 2001 was used it can be found online at http wwwfasorgbwc papersfebannexihtmaann 90 the select

casualties through catastrophic terrorism in this vi ew cb agents that can be mass produced are contagious or are markedly stabile are identified as the greatest threats therefore government policy towards cb terrorism has b een designed to reduce the impact of cb agents such as nerve agents smallpox and anthrax that possess these specific qualities while some of these agents have been used in terror attacks this analysis of the potential for smallscale use leads to different assessment of cb agent threat cb agents that were considered high threats in other frameworks appear to present lesser threat when viewed in the small scale attack context conversely cb agents that were considered of lesser th reat when considering mass casualty attacks may be ranked more highly in the small scale context as barriers to mass use may be missing when the agent is used on small scale because of these differences policies designed to protect against catastrophic cb attack may not provide equivalent pr otection against small scale cb attack potential use for the above framework is to help prioritize approaches to address the threat presented by small scale use of cb agents this analysis provideshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs36 information relevant to the formation of ge neral approaches to reduce the threat from terrorist use of different cb agents as well as information that may allow policymakers to reduce the dangers from speci fic agents for example policymakers may wish to develop specific remedies vi research targeted towards developing cures prophylaxis and detection equipm ent or more effi cient public health mechanisms for detecting and treating the agents towards the tops of these matrices because the agents analyzed in this framework are those which appear in preponderance of past assessments they re present subset of potential cb agents other dangerous agents which may be amenable to similar analysis have not been included for example newly emerging di seases such as nipah virus and sars may pose future threat but have not been included in past ssessments therefore while policymakers may find this framework useful in formulating policy more detailed analysis may be required when refining policy alternatives another potential use of this framework is to qualitatively highlight the effects that different policies may have in reducing cb vulnerability this overview indicates which agents of concern might be amenable to partic ular countermeasures for example policymakers may wish to focus on prophylaxis of toxins to reduce the threat that their use by terrorists would present by reviewing the data presented in this assessment framework policymakers might identify toxins for which approved vaccine exists this might aid in prioritizing regulatory review or directing research funds to develop new toxoid vaccines similarly by weighing and considering the ease of acquisition of cb agents for example it may become apparent which agents are susceptible to regulatory control perhaps because of their development for industrial use and which agents might not be perhaps because of their endemic nature this may aid in developing additional policy against cb terrorism another application for this framework might be to develop threatreduction approaches for specific agents depending on the agent funding for research and development regulation or di rected advances in public health may lower the threat posed for example regulation regarding th sale of the source of the toxin abrin might be considered an effective appro ach to reducing its ease of access thereby lowering the threat posed by this toxin the data presented in this framework and in the appendices may also serve as resource to develop other more specialized frameworks policymakers might reorder agents based on specific criteria fo r example response to medical treatment based on the data provided in this report some may wish to emphasize certain criteria over others providing nonequivale nt weighting to the different criteria these manipulations might provide legislators with more tailored matrices for use in exploring policy options for example while the agents in this assessment have been sorted by considering the difficulties terrorist group might encounter in developing an agent sorting according to specific priorities might present different final product especially in the cases wh ere specific knowledge is held about criteria presented here sorting the agents while excluding cer tain criteria would provide other insights for example marburg hemorrhag ic fever is ranked lower on table 2 because of the difficulty in obtaining the causative virus in the current sorting algorithm thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs37 105 see us congress office of technology assessment technologies underlying weapons of mass destruction op citsignificant disadvantage to its use determin its ranking below other agents which lack any comparable disadvantage if for reasons outside the confines of this assessment it was known that marburg virus was available to terrorist organization resorting this matrix without regard to the ease of acquisition would place marburg hemorrhagic fever at the top of this ma trix thus the risk posed by marburg hemorrhagic fever would be in creased under those conditions whether an agent has been weaponized or was the target of weapons program was not used as primary ranking factor rather it was used to adjust the relative ranking of agents that are comparably ra ted thus two agents that have the same relative numbers of and in the matrix would be equally rated if one of these agents was known to be successfully weaponized while the other was never studied then the agent known to be weaponized would be ranked higher on the matrix the exclusion of weaponization st atus as an independent category might be seen as inappropriate if there are credib reports of inform ation or technology transfer from bioweapons program to rrorist group in such an event it might be more appropriate to dir ectly include the weaponization status into the ranking and sorting procedure deviations from assumptions several assumptions main ly about the resources and skills of the groups attempting to develop cb ag ents have been made in developing this framework if these assumptions are invalid then the results of this report will be less applicable for example if terrorist group is unable to recruit or train members to the degree necessary to reproducibly and repeatedly sy nthesize or grow cb agents then the effort expended in acquiring sufficient amounts of the cb agent may be much higher than estimated through this framework if terrorist group lacks financial means similar increase in the difficulty of manufacture might occur this could cause the criteria to have distinctly unequal weig hts where the ease of acquisition would dominate all other criteria if terrorist group is sponsored by nationstate then the capabilities of the terrorist group may be much greater than those assumed here for instance ease of acquisition and ease of dissemin ation could be drastically different as technology transfer from the sponsor to the terrorist group could remove these barriers and thus remove the influence of these criteria fro m the ranking terrorist group planning mass citywide assault using cb agent might face difficulties in the scale of material and logistics necessary and the threat might more closely parallel previous assessments of massdissemination105 one policy issue regarding cb defense is that threat assessments rely on probability estimates this means that wh ile analysts may speak of likelihood of an agent being used one besides rrorists who use them can speak with authority about the agents that will be us ed terrorists may act opportunistically if presented with an agent either purchased or stolen they may use that agent even ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs38 106 for more on this topic see crs report rl31831 terrorist motivations for chemical and biological weapons use placi ng the threat

trends 2015 dialogue about the future with nongovernment experts december 2002 109 another factor involved in the rajneeshee attack was their reported wish to influence local elections by incapacitating rather than killing the electorate w seth carus the rajneeshees 1984 in toxic terror assessing terrorist use of chemical and biological weapons op citit is not optimal for their purposes purchase or theft of cb agent alters relative threat assessments as many of the factors contributing to the relative threat are weighted differently consequently while relative threat assessment is useful framework for rational discu ssion it cannot be used as definitive statement on the likelihood of future cb use terrorist motivationspecific factors the above analysis assumes terrorist group has decided to use chemical biological or toxin weapon and is consider ing the relative potential of all of these agents equally however this analysis does not necessarily reflect all factors that may contribute to the choice of particular agent the following section explores other factors that specifi c terrorist group might consid er based on its objectives or motivations106 potential for covert deployment some experts claim that it is increasin gly likely that terrorist group would not claim responsibility for cb attack107 the incidence of catastrophic anonymous terrorist attacks is projected to increase as terrorist groups organize around issues that have less local concrete political goals but instead are more ideologically driven108 this tendency complicates analysis of the bioterror threat as terrorists may successfully covertly attack using diseas found within the united states with small outbreak lack of any claim of responsibility could raise the question of whether the outbreak was terro rist act or simply an unus ual natural epidemic for example releasing ebola virus in building in new york city would immediately be treated as terrorist attack re gardless of whether any group claimed responsibility on the other hand the sa lmonella attacks perpetrated by the rajneeshees were not identified as deliberate release until over year after the event when member of the cult confessed to the crime one of the factors that led the cult leaders to choose salmonella was th at it was less traceable agent in the hopes that their act w ould remain undiscovered109 since the probability that terrorist group will opt for covert rather than open deployment may not be known it is difficult to factor this choice into an analysis terrorist group could choose to deploy biological agent covertly because of the advantages the group would gain an agent release disguised as naturalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs39 110

attack as was done by the rajneeshees such trials could test the government response to an apparently natural outbreak possibly allowi ng terrorists to further refi ne attack plans to exploit weaknesses uncovered during th trials by using local pathogen there may be serious though reasonable disagreement be tween public health and law enforcement officials with respect to the outbreaks origin leading to over or underreaction to the outbreak finally during smalls cale outbreak questions over the magnitude of local state or federal response may arise to the pot ential advantage of terrorist wishing to instill confusion at low cost110 the department of homela nd security has developed and deployed system of biological weapon det ectors called biowatch111 the biowatch program has installed detectors in more than thirty citie s they are primarily designed to detect the catastrophic release of bi ological weapons not the release of small amounts of biological weapons in october 2003 the bi owatch system in houston tx detected aerosols of francisella tularensis subsequent analysis revealed that this signal arose from detection of naturally occurring bacteria112 considering the apparent sensitivity of this detection system it is possible that smallscale releases might be detected determining whether such signal was from naturally occurring bacteria or from smallscale act of terrorism may be challenging since the federal response to an act of terrorism will likely be substantially different than to detection of naturally occurring bacteria quickly differentiatin g between the two events is important range of lethality and impact the media attention given to civilian deat hs may induce terrorist to prefer an agent with high fatalities over agents that inflict high number of casualties but low fatalities if they be lieved that this would garner mo re media attention terrorists may believe that such media coverage of terror events may further recognition of their cause or increase the impact of their actions potential cb agent user is also faced with the possibility that the cb agent may kill the user either during an accide nt in the preparation stage or during dissemination the events of septem ber 11 2001 have shown that there are individuals motivated enough to die for thei r beliefs who wish to strike at assets within the united states113 consequently the idea that cb agent might be toohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs40 113 continued likely to commit an act of chemical or biol ogical terrorism cultural and religious norms regarding chemical or biological weapons us as well as the potential for significant suffering from selfinfection or exposure may limit the number of individuals willing to engage in chemical or biological terrorism 114 this case study shows the importance of deve loping further refined risk assessment based on the known goals motivations and capab ilities of specific terrorist organizationslethal or too toxic to be used belief held in some previous treatments of this subject should be reexamined if one ssumes that the user of the cb agent is willing to die during its use casualties and fatalities from an agents dissemination can be maximized because an agent lack ing both treatment and prophylaxis can be used similarly an organization with supply of members willing to be placed at risk during the manufacture of biological agent can produce large amounts of an incurable pathogen by training members in the specific techniques necessary to grow that agent the threat of selfinfection combined with the need for advanced technical knowledge is often cited as another barrier to terrorist development of biological agents the us of trained technicians w illing to die would allow production of agents under impr ovised safety conditions by training others to act as technicians terrorist organization could reduce the danger to its knowledgeable scientists distribute the techniques for veloping pathogen program among the members of the organization and incr ease the rate of pathogen production it is not necessary for members of terro rist group to be without regard for their lives to develop cb agents terrorist groups with access to prophylaxis especially prophylaxis with l imited distribution could develop biol ogical agents at less personal risk alternately effective mechanical protection might guard terrorists manufacturing chemical agents even if the civilian population has some access to the vaccine or other prophylaxis the impact of dissemination woul d still be very high if these materials are uncommon some bi ological and toxin agents have vaccines available to select individuals such as troops or research scientists but not the general public therefore some terrorists may find highly lethal incurable agents to be most effective in achieving their objectives however as seen in the salmonella attack not all terrorists choose the most lethal agent available the cult leaders chose salmonella because nonlethal agent was d eemed sufficient to achieve the desired outcome of decreasing voter turnout in local election114 contagious dissemination pathogens contagious through casual contact may be preferred by some terrorists one scenario could involve dissemination of contagious pathogen through selfinfection selfinfection is pecially important to consider because it is lowtechnology method for highly sel ective targeting of in itial infection points terrorist who is contagious could choose to fly through multiple airports in

method of distribution could be hig h some experts claim that the progression of the illness would prevent the terroris t from being well enough to proceed with such plan other experts have c ited historical natural outbreaks on public transportation such as trains as evidence that individuals with diseases in the contagious stage have been able to travel and infect others115 the lack of controllability of contagious pathogens in comparison to other biological agents may serve as deterrent to groups unwilling to engage in indiscriminate infection for example rrorist groups that have constituency in or near the exposure area might not be willing to risk infection of their constituents alternately apocalyptic groups or terrori st groups acting geographically distant from their support may not view the lack of c ontrollability as significant drawback previous use of cb agents some terrorists lacking knowledge of potential agents may choose cb agents because they have been used in the past terrorists may look to previous attacks to learn which cb agents were effective and how the cb agents were dispersed the difficulties in performing successful cb ttack are illustrated through the examples of the rajneeshees 1984 salmonella attack and aum shinrikyos 1995 sarin attack both groups attempted to develop several different cb agents before being successful116 terrorist could view past examples as decreasing the need to extensively test their cb agent since successful use had already been previously demonstrated significant media attention may influence cb agent choice in the case where the media has reported widely on cb ag ent more information is available regarding the strengths and weaknesses of an agents use while the cb agent may not be optimal for the terrorist groups pur pose easily available information may provide lower barrier than that provide d by the group investing its resources in independent research for more optimal cb agent thus there may be bias towards choosing those cb agents which receive publicity some cb agents have garnered reput ation among extremist groups such reputation regardless of its basis in fact may influence choice of agents for example ricin has been promoted by dom estic paramilitary groups as silent tool of justice117 one of the factors that led memb ers of the minnesota patriots council to choose ricin over other alternativ was apparently such promotion118 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs42 119 public comments of jonathan b tucker at the case for biosecurity treaty briefing for congressional

chemical plant security by lindajo schierow from natural source the ease with which naturally occurring pathogens and toxins can be recovered from nature is topic of much debate their natural prevalence is one of the most important cr iteria in determining the relative threat there are strong differences in opinion regarding how easy it is to isolate microbial pathogens from nature because many biological agents are widely found in nature covertly collecting these agents is not viewed as difficult however some experts claim that it is difficult to isolate pathogens with high virulence from these environmental samples disease epidemics either among humans or animals may also be sources for pathogens some experts assert that obtaining pathogens from disease outbreak would be difficult they point to the efforts public health officials exert to identify the source of the disease during an outbreak119 other experts contend that the availability of pathogens during an outbreak is high as any victim of the epidemic is plentiful source of pathogens not just the initial case further complicating debate on the topic is the prevalence of viral outbreaks in countries with limited health care systems in 2002 an outbreak of crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever on the afghanistaniran border occurred over threemonth period with multiple outbreaks among humans and animals120 epidemics such as this could be an ample source of pathogenic materi provided that the terrori st group was international in scope or had support among hospital staff in the outbreak region terrorist

the purchase of small amounts of microbial pathogens on the ot her hand the availability of toxinproducing agents such as aflatoxinproducing mold stra ins through such collection would raise concerns similar to those surrounding culture collections 122 the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 p l 104132 requires the secretary of health and human services to create the select agent

oversight and regulation of the transfer of pathogens122 this higher level of oversight has not been duplicated worldwide the world federation of culture collections an international organization that indexes culture collections has established member guidelines to adopt best practices and follow domestic nd international regula tion with respect to pathogens123 however approximately twothirds of the world culture collections are not members of this federation124 additionally many culture collections are not financially secure this s ituation may provide the opport unity for wealthy terrorist group to acquire seed microbes from culture collection which has well characterized pathogens manufacture and prepar ation of cb agents most experts agree that terrorist gr oups lacking specialized training and knowledge in the weaponization of cb agents will likely produce suboptimal quality agents these cb agents may be more likely to degrade during storage than cb weapons produced by nationstates th is degradation may lead terrorist groups to produce the agent immediately before the attack or to plan smaller scale attacks so as to minimize agent loss the preparation of cb agents for dissemination will also play significant role in the effectiveness of terror attack terrorist groups l acking experience and specialized knowledge will likely be unable to generate weaponized cb agents and instead will be forced to utilize cruder less refined mixtures of cb agent and other material such as nonviable pathogens and media or residual solv ent dissemination of cb agents using

options some experts advocate as means of controlling cb terror biosecurity treaty to further enhance the transparency of national biodefe nse and industrial biotechnology programs133 one aspect of this proposed evolving framework is harmonization of internal na tional standards to regulate the handling storage and transfer of biological pathogens sign atories would determin list of covered pathogens and set general guidelines ach signatory would then develop specific methods to implement the guidelines in theory this would lower the probability that terrorist could acquire dangerous pathogen from foreign germ bank for use in the united states proponents of such treaty point to the largely successful use of regulatory inspections and control of raw starting materials in stemming transfer of radiological and nuclear materials from nation states to terrorist groups they also cite the short travel time between distant points as factor which requires international coope ration and attention to comb at potential bioterrorism134 it is not clear whether regulation on the nationstate level could provide significant barriers to smallscale produc tion nationstatelevel mechanisms have been relatively successful at stemming nucl ear proliferation because of the technical difficulties involved in developing an in frastructure capable of manufacturing nuclear bomb combined with the need for localized easily detected and tracked nuclear material howeve r revelations regarding the dissemination of nuclear weapon technology from pakistan highlight so of the difficulties in this approach even with nuclear weapons pr oliferation of chemical and biological agents is not as limited by required technology as nuclear w eapons and source material is much more readily available also

which inspectors shoul d be allowed to document and access commercial sites because of concerns over protecting pr oprietary information and the practicality of challenge inspection system135 there is also concern that multinational regulation would not adequately address the cb terrorist threat some analysts point out that export and import controls prevent only the transfer of such items or technology over intern ational borders and do little to address cb agent development within the country they contend that domestic terrorist groups or international groups which tablish themselves within the united states would be unaffected by enhanced multinati onal cooperation and transparency prevention versus consequence management law enforcement options the approach that us law enforcement agencies take towards counter terrorism is still evolving fbi director mueller has stated that the fbi is shifting its count erterrorism efforts from reactive philosophy to proactive one136 as examples of this shift di rector mueller pointed to efforts to restrict fundraising efforts of terro rist groups and increased counterterrorism intelligence gathering this approach is based

chose not to use the che mical biological and toxin weapons in its possession it has been argu ed that iraq was deterred from using these weapons by veiled threat of massive retaliation138 it is less clear that deterrence would be effective against terrorist group in particular inte rnational agreements and threats of massive retaliation are unlikely to deter terrorist group that is willing to

countermeasures research act sen lieberman would provide tax and market based incen tives to encourage companies to develop treatments for bioterror agentssome policymakers may suggest increasing the resources devoted to investigating the incidents and prosecutin g the perpetrators this approach of deterrence on an individual scale is common in law enforcement in the case of bank robberies for example it is widely believe d that identifying arresting and punishing bank robbers is effective at deterring others who might be contemplating similar crime criminal prosecution derives its deterrence value from the wish of the assailant to succeed at the event and escape this approach may be adequate against some terrorist groups however it is unlik ely to deter groups with members willing to die during action or groups that insula the leaders and planners from those carrying out the attack hence normal forms of policing may be inadequate to deal with those terrorists who choose suicide or place low value on escape proactive measures such as intelligence gathering or infiltration of terrori st groups may be the more effective approach to prevent suicide attacks health care options policymakers may want to address whether to focus on prophylaxis against specific diseases or to address the bioterror threat through broader approach the targeted approach is illustrated by secretary of health and human services thompson who is reported as saying that the governments position with respect to smallpox vaccine is that every man woman and child will have vaccine they can say has their name on it139 vaccines for many diseases are available under investigationa l new drug protocols and there has been legislative interest in spurring private sector research into the development of new vaccines and treatments140 with development and largescale availability of vaccines for bioterror agents the threat posed by those specific agents is diminished proponents of targeted approach claim that additional vaccines will appreciably lower the global threat as fewer pathogens become viable masscasualty agents critics argue that the vul nerability to agents lacking v accine would be fundamentally unchanged under the targeted approach fu rthermore the decision of what agents to protect against may refl ect the ease of vaccine production or other factors rather than the risk an agent will be used it is not certain that vaccine can be produced in timely manner for the highest threat agents further criticism of the specific vaccine approach is the logistical effort required to vaccinate the population the cost of repeatedly vacci nating large populations may offset the economic benefit of pr oviding specific prophylaxis for many agents finally as seen in the smallpox vaccination efforts the perceived risk from vaccination must be weighed against the potential ri sk of biological attackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs49 141 for example see greg seigle feds could make bioterror impossible expert says global security newswire april 9 2002 142 see crs report rl32152 the biowatch program tection of bioterrorism by dana shea and sarah listera broader approach is advocated by ot her experts who claim that the best defense against bioterror attack is to in crease the capacity of the public health sector to treat ill people track emerging diseases and provide care to those made ill during bioterror attack proponents of an incr ease in public health advocate that this approach provides an equa l and general application to most naturally occurring diseases and accidents141 yet critics contend that increasing the nationwide quality of public health care would be too expensiv to implement at the required level and to sustain indefinitely furthermore the threat posed by untreatable agents would remain unchanged as this approach w ould not attempt to discover new specific treatments separating assessments of chem ical and biol ogical agents the concept of wmd while useful in military framework may obscure some dangers of terrorist threat policymaker s may want to consider whether continuing attempts to treat all non conventional weapons within the same framework is adequate for the terrorist threat an alternative is to treat the different threats in separate frameworks methods for controlling proliferation nd production of cb agents are often assumed to be equally applicable to both types of agents policymakers may want to determine whether it is valid to regulate biological including toxins and chemical agents jointly since inhibition of cb proliferation involves similar issues namely large volumes of dualuse machinery s imilar educational and financial component and sliding production scale combined regulatory approach may be reasonable solution it may provide for clear unifor m standards and simplify the regulatory process alternatively policymakers may wish to regulate chemical and biological agents separately focusing on areas where they differ technically for example biological agents lack signatures which can be det ected from distance while chemical agents have signatures unique to these agents laser remote sensing has been used to determine if clouds contain nerve agents detecting biologi cal agents requires sensitive agentspecific detectors and this difficulty in detecting biological agents complicates remote monitoring of potential biological agent laboratories also since most biological agents unlike most chemical agents are available in nature preventing access to seed stocks of biological material is more difficult than blocking access to chemical precursors detection thods for biological agents need to be able to differentiate between naturally occurring and anthropogenic pathogens142 for example to find hidden terrorist anth rax laboratory sensor would need to distinguish between the background naturally occurring levels of anthrax spores

rigorous control of these agents acceptable level of cb terrorism risk further issue policymakers may consider is how to balance an acceptable degree of risk from cb terrorism against th amount of security required to address this risk viewed from statutory and regu latory perspective the cb terrorism risk appears to be reduced from the 2001 level current laws limit access to record possession of and limit the transfer of pathogens on the select agent list144 congress has allocated funding to improve aspects of the public health system including research into agent detectors and epidemiological surveillance to reduce the vulnerability level increased law enforcement efforts designed to reduce the general terrorist threat also reduce the probability of cb terror attack there appears to be concerted attempt to significantly lower the risk of cb terrorism complete removal of domestic cb vulnerability is probably impossible maximum effort would likely require among other measures indepth searches of all materials entering the country stri ct purchasing controls on all dualuse technologies and industria l controls such as registration increased security procedures and regular insp ection of sites engaged in chemical or biological manufacture the cost of such program could be high both in economic terms and civil liberties policymakers may likely consider the

stark examples of how advances in relevant research can potentially change fundamental assu mptions underlying an analysis conclusions this report is designed to provide framework for legislators to use in developing riskmanagementbased policies rather than vulnerabilitybased policies to protect against chemical biological and toxin attacks this analysis addresses relatively smallscale attacks that coul d be accomplished by determined nonstate sponsored terrorists the analysis presented in this report is consistent with the findings of the gilmore commission which stated that prep aration against rgescale chemical or biological attack woul d not necessarily simultaneously protect against smaller scale attacks this analysis suggests that agents that are effective for smallscale attacks are not necessarily the agents of choice for massivescale attacks this is in part explained by the higher availability of commercial equipment to prepare store and disseminate an agent and in part explained by the less restrictive safety and logistical requirements of small attack in comparison to large attack small attacks require amounts of equipment and supplies that are less likely to trigger regulatory notice the presence of dualuse equipment in industrial ttings may mean that obtaining the re quired technology for cb pr oduction may be less difficult than previously thought another potential use for this analysis is to determine possible priority with which the threat presented by specific ag ents should be addressed this analysis provides information on the general approaches to reduce the threat from terrorist use of different cb agents as well as information that may allow policymakers to reduce the dangers from specific agents the analys is could be useful in

225appendix methodology how criteria were chosen the matrix approach is derived from that used by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in prioritizing potential biological terrorism agents152 it should be emphasized that there are many different ways to develop an assessmen t framework for terror agents the approach taken here is not the only valid approac h and different results may ccur if different criteria and weighting systems are chosen military assessment public health assessment and an assessment focusing on terrorist us may have different criteria and relative weighting depending on the assumptions and needs of each assessment type the cdc assessed biological agents in public health framework using criteria appropriate for considering public health response these criteria included the public health impact the dissemination potentia l public perception and special public health preparedness needs this report contains modified criteria to address qualities that terrorist groups planning small scal attack might consider for example more general criterion than used by the cdc of public health impact was developed for use in this report as defined for this report public health impact refers to more general impact on the health care system incorporating both casualties and fatalities this criterion allows for example more direct comparison of agents which are lethal with those that predominantly injure in contrast to the cdc approach this report provides framewo rk that separates ease in making and disseminating into sepa rate criteria ease of acquisition and ease of dissemination since both acquisition and dissemination may pose significant barrier to the use of cb agent it was deemed important to separate these two criteria additionally the persontoper contagiousness of pathogen was not considered as distinct category in contrast to the cdc assessment from public health perspective massive attack using contagious pathogens could quickly overwhelm the surge capacity of the public health system however in assessing distribution of such an agent contagiousne ss may be considered as making the agents easier to disseminate contagion may levera ge the dissemination of pathogen for example the initial release may need only to successfully infect single individual to be effective this infected indivi dual might now further disseminate the pathogen inadvertently infecting others for this reason this report considers contagion as positive in terms of ease of dissemination if pathogen is transmissible through casual contact in contrast agents that are contagious only th rough close contact or by exchange of bodily fluids may be less effective means of dissemination this report addresses smallscale terror attacks and so does not postulate any enhanced requirements for prep aration the number of casua lties and fatalities arising from smallscale attack may have large public health impact but the mechanisms already in place to provide rush pharmaceuticals if available track and locate affected people nd perform required diagnostic s should be sufficient forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs54 events of this scale consequently th cdc assessment of special preparation has been reduced to two remaining component s the response to medical treatment of various agents and the preevent prophy laxis which may be available to the population to ameliorate the impact of the ev ent these two criteria may have equal weight to terrorist as either would reduce the effects of terror agent dissemination the final criterion used in this report is the degree to which various agents have been investigated by military weapons programs agents which reportedly have been weaponized or were research targets for weapons program may be available for purchase or theft by terrorist groups additionally records of the weaponization process information about successful or unsuccessful research routes and knowledge of optimized processes for these agents may be available while there are few data available in the open literature about the level of inform ation available to terrorist groups from these weapons programs the po ssibility that there could be technology transfer from state program to terrorist group factors into the relative threat analysis additionally the fact that an agent may not be explicitly cited as being part of weapons program does not preclude its presence in one instead this merely means that it is unknown from open sources whether any weaponsrelated research has been performed regarding it these criteria were originally developed for pathogens and since this report also considers chemical and toxin agents the criteria were further adapted for use with toxin and chemical agents since the chemical agents considered in this report have been considered as chemical weapons for many years chemical agents status in weapons program seemed superfluous and was omitted from the assessment also prophylaxis for chemical agents in general refers to physical protection comprised of impermeable suits and barri ers to personal exposure since this report focuses on the threat to an unprepared civilian population it was considered unlikely that prophylaxis would be available for such surprise attack consequently this criterion was removed the weighting system between criteria in this analysis each individual criterion is given equal weighting this was done to imply that each of the criteria can be viewed from generic perspective of use to have roughly equal importance as discussed elsewhere in this report some terrorist groups because of specific aims ideology or expertise may place more importance on some categories than on others for example group with extensive practical experience in dissemination technology may place much less importance on this category than group l acking this specialized knowledge by weighting all the criteria equally this limited analysis attempts to rate the domestic risk of potential terrorist use of these agen ts to first approximation the criteria have been made equivalent in the absence of information requiring different weighting other weighting systems usin g these data may be useful for other purposes within criteria each criterion was divided into three segments to develop relative scale of influence consequently refers to an aspect that is negative influence to terrorist use while refers to an aspect that is positive influence tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs55 terrorist use the rank represents an intermediate state for example in the prophylaxis criterion denotes licensed prophylaxis while denotes prophylaxis at all denotes an experimental pr ophylaxis lacking food and drug administration approval in defining the scale within criteria an effort was made to logically group the range of possibilities into three segments the separation between segments is more distinct in some categories than in others because of the coarseness of this scale agents that receive the same symbol within criterion do not necessarily possess the same exact properties but instead should be considered roughly comparable the full scale of potential response may not be pr esented in these categories as the agents presented here are those agents which have been identified as having the potential to be used as bioweapon these agents ve generally been preselected to possess appropriate characteristics for use as consequence the definitions developed address the characteristics of bioweapons rather than cb agents in general the full spectrum of potential agents is not represented in these matrices the selection process for agents described in the text requires that potential agents be identified by multiple lists of agents of concern this process removes many agents which appear to have low terrorism potential and agents not considered threat to the populace at large because of this trunca tion there are few examples of very poor cb agents found on the matrices ranking agents were ranked based on the symbols assigned within each criterion agents were first sorted by the number of barriers to their successful terrorist use the incidence of symbols for given agent initially determined the ranking of an agent agents with equivalent numbers of symbols were then sorted according to the number of symbols present in the case of further equivalency the number of symbols were considered if equivalent rankings result agents which have been successfully w eaponized are presented above those which have been research targets agents wh ich are fully equivalent in ranking and weaponization status are pres ented in alphabetical order agents are presented in the matrices in inverse order to the number of barriers to their successful terrorist use thus agents which possess the greatest number of barriers are presented at the bottom of the matrix agents with equivalent ranking are presented grouped together within the ma trices this type of analysis is not designed to produce highly differentiated ranking of agents but qualitative understanding of relative dangers th erefore this list does not attempt to discriminate agents of roughly equal ranking the sorting mechanism used here is not the only mechanism which might be applied to this framework but it was felt that sorting according to the number of barriers would more properly address criteria which might block successful use of given agent this implies that terrorist may use an agent which is less wellsuited but lacks significant barriers rather than an highly effective agent which has significant barrier to its use further refinement of the range of characteristics involved in given symbol or criterion or reranking agents using other methods may lead to different assessment of each agent and its relative threat for examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391crs56 some may wish to sort this framework acco rding to positive factors this changes the order of some agents although the overa ll ordering of the ma trix remains similarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32391 crs57 appendix b
