combination as the severity of the problem warrants the first type is the conventional macroeconomic policy tools of monetary and fiscal policy used with the aim of broadly supporting bank liquidity and aggregate spending monetary policy having greater flexibility than fiscal policy will usually play the prominent role the second type of policy for responding to credit crisis is the feds traditional role of lender of last resort typically involving some expanded use of the feds discount window the facility the fed uses to make short term loans to banks that need to bridge shortrun shortage of liquidity these policies will be more narrowly focused on the needs of troubled institutions the third type of policy response is the use of extraordinary measures involving direct interventions by the federal government to restore confidence in financial markets forcing credit to flow broadly and at greater volume

functioning modern economy banks and other financial institutions channel the economys savings toward variety of current productive uses by borrowing shortterm and lending longterm fina ncial institutions create flow of credit that passes liquidity from savers to investors and which transforms liquid shortrun assets into less liquid longterm assets these longterm assets are created by credit financed current spending by households on housing consumer durables and education and current spending by businesses on new plants and equipment in highly developed financial system this flow of credit will not only be to households and nonfinancial businesses but also to other financial institutions to meet occasional shortterm needs for liquidity that serves to minimize disruptions in the flow of credit to the nonfinancial economy this act of borrowing shortterm and lending longterm however makes financial institutions less liquid and therefore inherently vulnerable to crisis it is sustainable situation however so long as there is widespread confidence particularly among lending institutions themselves in the quality of the assets being created specifically it requires confidence in the ability of those assets to sustain flow of earnings sufficient at minimum to meet the lending institutions shortterm borrowing costs liabilities the current turmoil in us financial markets is the result of breakdown in that necessary confidence in an environment of distrust financial institutions are less willing or able to lend longterm while still willing to borrow shortterm in the face of great uncertainty they will tend to also lend shortterm in an attempt to enhance their own liquidity they prefer to hold riskless treasury securities that offer almost return rather than lend to business or consumer who presents even moderate risk the move toward s hortterm lending diminishes the flow of long term credit to the nonfinancial economy and dampens the economic activities of households and businesses that are dependent on borrowing the breakdown of confidence in us financial markets is an outgrowth of the end of the housing boom in 2006 and the subsequent fall of home prices as home prices fell sharply in many areas of the country surge in delinquencies and foreclosures on mortgage loans occurred reducing the flow of earnings to lenders who held thes nonperforming mortgages as the fall in earnings grew larger it became increasingly evident by the late summer of 2007 that an unusually high percentage of the mortgages and mortgage backed securities mbss created during the housing boom were of lower quality then originally estimated the initial overvaluing of these assets has been attributed to an adverse interaction between lax underwriting practices by the originators of the loans and deficient evaluations by credit rating companies of the mbss created with those loans these shortcomings were easily overlooked so long as home prices were rising but became evident once home prices fell the fall in the value of these mortgages and mortgage related assets translated into growing losses for the financial institutions who held them as their balance sheets deteriorated so did their ability to lend to each other and to lend to the nonfinancial economy the financial market disruptions escalated during 2008 because of the wide distribution and complex structure of many mbss it became very difficult for potential lender to confidently appraise the quality of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40007g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561

the borrower defaulting on the loan thus even well capitalized banks became reluctant to lend as research by psychologists has shown fear of loss is often stronger motivator than the prospect of gain explaining why in crisis financial institutions concern for preserving wealth overrides the desire to increase wealth the rational choice for any one burdened financial institution is to reduce its debt by selling assets but as many similarly burdened institutions attempt to reduce debt by simultaneously selling assets the price of assets is driven sharply down deteriorating their balance sheets further rather than improving them the constriction of the flow of credit is accordingly magnified and that in turn increases the drag on economic activity in the credit dependent nonfinancial sectors left to market forces alone this systemic failure would arguably only resolve it self slowly and at great cost to the wider economy the great depression is seen by many economists as an example of the perils of leaving the resolution of major financial crisis to the markets themselves recent research shows that fire sales driven by sharp increase in investors preference for liquidity can push asset prices below their fair market value and be very costly to the financial system by forcing the inefficient liquidation of longterm investments and to the wider economy by reducing the availability of credit for productive endeavors 1 therefore mainstream economists today argue that economic policy measures are needed to get credit flowing smoothly again and to mitigate the damage incurred by households and nonfinancial businesses the form and scope of such policy initiatives can nevertheless vary further because of the substantial interdependence of the global financial system coordinated policy response by the affected countries could be needed 2

in the cost of credit and decrease in the flow of credit to the nonfinancial sectors of the us economy these include despite the feds lowering the federal funds rate by 425 percentage points between september 2007 and october 2008 the added liquidity did not cause most mortgage interest rates to ease the rates on nonconforming jumbo loans have risen substantially despite the feds efforts to bolster the interbank loan market the growing turmoil has caused the socalled ted spread the difference between what banks and the treasury pay to borrow money to rise to exceptional heights usually this spread would be 5070 basis points by october 2008 it soared to 464 basis points 3 such large spread suggests huge increase in perceived risk and great reluctance of banks to make shortterm loans

loan officers for sample of banks most banks are tightening lending standards for residential mortgages consumer loans and business loans the change of standards were decreased loan size decreased loan term increased level of collateral required and an increased spread of the loan rate above the banks cost of funds new issues of speculative grade bonds have fallen and the interest rate on lower grade corporate bonds has increased credit extended by banks has fallen from about 11 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2007 to only 211 billion in the second quarter of 20084 credit flows will reflect the interaction of supply and demand in financial markets all of the above indicators of tighter credit conditions have emerged at time when economic activity for reasons separate from events in financial markets has been slowing an event that would weaken the demand for credit and otherwise tend to loosen credit conditions this configuration of economic forces suggests that it is diminished supply of credit that is causing the tightening of credit conditions in us financial markets

of credit supplied to borrowers in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy it is expected that higher price of credit higher interest rates will dampen credit supported spending by households and businesses it is perhaps less obvious that changes in the quantity of credit offered credit rationing to nonfinancial borrowers can have an effect on their spending apart from the effect of increased price in financial crisis banks and other lending institutions can become so illiquid or risk averse that even at higher interest rates little credit will be made available to longterm borrowersand true credit crunch emerges reduced flow of credit will tend to dampen economic activity highly dependent on borrowing such as residential investment spending purchasing new homes by households business investment spending purchasing new plant and eq uipment and consumer spending purchases of autos appliances and higher education by households in situation where the prices of assets owned by households are falling there are likely to be two primary channels of negative effect on consumer spending the direct dampening effect of tighter credit conditions and the indirect dampening effect on spending caused by decrease in household wealth due to declining prices of homes and of financial assets held by consumers slower spending by households and businesses sl ows the growth of real gdp

2006 real gdp increased 28 pace generally considered close to the economys sustainable longterm rate of growth in 2007 the pace of real growth slowed to 20 as the weakness of the housing sector became significant drag on economic activity more deceleration has occurred during 2008 with an outright decline of real gdp of 05 in the third quarter the third quarter gdp number is preliminary estimate and subject to revision much of the economic weakening in 2008 is attributable to sizable loss in real purchasing power caused by sharply higher energy and food prices which has slowed several categories of aggregate spending but it is also possible that the further weakening of economic activity in the third quarter of 2008 reflects the added dampening effects of the turmoil in financial markets beginning to spread to the broader economy if so such negative effects would likely be evident in the most creditsensitive categories of aggregate spending

the effect of progressively tighter credit conditions in 2007 and 2008 has been most evident on real residential spending which is highly sensitive to changes in the price and quantity of mortgage lending the inventory of unsold hom was reported to be around 45 million units or equivalent to about an eleven month supply5 similarly housing starts have fallen precipitously from over 2 million units in 2006 to an annual rate of about 800 thousand units through september 2008 or total decline in housing starts of about 60 6 in terms of gdp growth real residential invest ment spending has fallen over 40 between the fourth quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2008 and on average has subtracted about 10 percentage points from real gdp growth in each of those six quarters because residential investment spending typically accounts for only about 5 to 6 of gdp in normal circumstances economic weakness in the housing sector by it self may slow the economy but is unlikely to cause it to stall if other spending categories remain strong7 significant factor in the sizable decrease of residential investment has likely been sharp slowing of the flow of mortgage credit from lenders as recently as the fourth quarter of 2007 mortgage lending to households occurred at an annual rate of 635 billion but that flow had diminished to 81 billion by july 2008 8 the recovery of residential investment spending will likely require recovery of the flow of mortgage credit however even if there is relatively quick improvement in credit conditions the large inventory of unsold homes suggests that residential investment will continue to be drag on the economy well into 2009 5 national association of realtors existing home sa httpwwwrealtororgresearchresearchehsdata 6 housing start data

advancing 75 in 2006 the pace of spending by businesses on new plant and equipment slowed to 50 in 2007 and through the second quarter of 2008 that pace had slowed to about 23 in the third quarter of 2008 however real nonresidential investment declined 01 9 it is likely that recent history of substantial profits reduced the need for corporations to use external sources of funds to finance investment spending that insulation has so far allowed this category of spending to largely avoid the dampening effect of deteriorating credit conditions however over the four quarters ending in june 2008 nonfinancial corporate profits advanced only 08 in slowing economy further weaken ing of profit performance can be expected this prospect makes it unlikely that businesses can continue to use internal funds to finance such large share of investment spending the fall of real nonresidential investment in the third quarter of 2008 although small suggests to some that for many businesses point as been reached where dwindling flow of credit becomes significant constraint on nonresidential investment spending for most corporations the primary credit constraint is not likely to be lack of bank credit but the inability to issue bonds on affordable terms beyond the cost of borrowing businesses willingn ess to undertake investment spending will be strongly influenced by their expectation of the future demand for their products in anticipation of meeting strong demand in the future businesses increase current investment spending to add production capacity needed to meet future demand if on the other hand there is an anticipation of weak demand businesses are likely to reduce their current investment spending that expectation will be contingent on the expected spending by consumers sizable slowing of consumer spending is likely to deteriorate businesses expectations of future consumer spending inducing slowing of nonresidential business investment

largest component of gdp accounting for about 70 of total aggregate spending in addition consumer spending tends to be relatively stable generally free of wide swings and decreasing in only the most severe economic downturns nevertheless given its great size even modest swings in consumption spending will have strong influence on the growth of gdp through both its direct effect and its indirect effect on business investment spending as discussed above business investment spending will slow if the expectation for the growth of demand for their products is downgr aded following signs of slower consumer spending real consumption expenditures had been increasing but steadily decelerating their rate of advance in 2007 and the first half of 2008 after increasing about 30 in 2006 that pace

sharply down 3110 thats large enough to subtract 225 percentage points from the growth rate of real gdp in the third quarter and could indicate that the economy is in the midst of sizable down turn the deceleration of consumer spending over the past year is substantially the result of lost purchasing power due to the sharp rise in energy and food prices only in the third quarter of 2008 has there been mounting evidence of tight credit conditions dampening consumer spending until recently the flow of credit to households other than mortgage lending was not greatly diminished as recently as the fourth quarter of 2007 bank loans to households increased at an annual rate of nearly 63 billion by the second quarter of 2008 however bank loans to households decreased at 52 billion annual rate this dimi nished flow of bank credit could constrain many types of consumer purchases such as autos major appliances and higher education in contrast the flow of consumer credit largely credit cards has remained relatively strong through the second quarter of 2008 down from an annual pace of 136 billion in 2007 but still increasing at 114 billion annual rate in the second quarter of 2008 this pattern of borrowing probably indicates that households have been running up their credit card balances to sustain their spending if so consumer spending may weaken fu rther since such pattern of spending cannot be sustained indefinitely the effect of tighter credit on consumer spending is likely to be more evident in the subcategory of consumer durable goods these are expenditures that are typically financed by borrowing and are also purchases that can be postponed unti l economic conditions improve real consumer durable spending began to decline in late 2007 decreasing 43 and 28 in the first two quarters of 2008 respectively the third quarter spending drop was much greater down 141 resulting in 1 percentage point decrement from the third quarters real gdp growth rate the biggest contributor to the decline of consumer durable goods purchases is sharp fall in automobile sales in 2008 down from about 16 million units in 2007 to an annual rate of less than 13 million units over nine months of 2008 in addition to tighter credit conditions record high gasoline prices likely contributed to the weak automobile sales over the whole period as has the steady fall in household wealth caused by falling home prices see next sections discussion of this effect nevertheless the sharpness of the third quarter fall is also probably manifestation of the abrupt further deterioration of credit conditions that occurred around midyear

dampening effect caused by falling asset prices reducing household wealth falling prices for stocks and bonds decreases the value of households retirement and investment portfolios inducing consumers to spend less and save more in an attempt to replenish lost wealth in addition falling home prices erase accumulated equity decreasing ready source of liquidity for households to finance current

remaining wealth equity into liquidity cash economic research indicates that for every 100 billion decrease in household wealth consumer spending tends to fall 4 billion to 10 billion with the change emerging over one to twoyear period11 over the last year household net worth declined nearly 3 trillion if past relationships continue to hold that decrease in wealth could cause cumulative decrease in consumer spending of between 120 billion and 300 billion spending change of that size would translate into drag on economic growth equivalent to 10 to 25 of gdp that spending reduction could grow

moderate real gdp growth over the last two years despite the sharp fall of the housing sector and unprecedented disruptions in financial markets is largely explained by the strong growth of real net exports since mid2006 the strength of net exports has been consequence of relatively stronger economic growth among major us trading partners and of more competitively priced american goods resulting from the over 30 decline in the dollars real tradeweighted exchange rate from 2002 through 2007 in 2007 real export sales increased 84 whil import purchases increased only 22 through the first half of 2008 export sales have remained strong and import purchases have actually decreased this pattern was strongly evident in the second quarter of 2008 when net exports generated nearly all of that quarters annualized gdp growth rate of 28 in the third quarter real export sales fell off their second quarter pace but were still strong and imports continued to decline overall net exports contributed 11 percentage points to the third quarters real gnp growth continuing as source of economic strength but not strong enough to offset the quarters sharp fall in consumer spending 12 whether this pattern of strong net export growth can continue is open to question the pace of economic growth in foreign economies is slowing due to combination of reduced purchasing power caused by high energy and food prices credit constraints as result of the spread of the negative effects of the us credit crisis to many industrial economies with closely linked financial markets and less accommodative policy responses by foreign governments the prospect of slower economic growth abroad is likely to weaken the demand for us exports and reduce their positive impulse on real growth in the united states over the near term 11 see christopher d carol misuzu otsuka and jirka slacalek how large is the housing wealth effect new approach nber working paper 12746 cambridge ma national

2002 has been animated by slow but steady weakening of the demand for dollardenominated assets on the part of foreign investors reducing the inflow of foreign capital this gradual ebbing of the foreign inflow of capital is equivalent to reduction in the inflow of foreign credit lending but it has not over this period been disruptive or caused any abrupt increase in us interest rates nevertheless capital outflows are likely to have heightened significance in the current state of financial turmoil and diminished credit flows to the domestic economy the negative effect on domestic credit conditions would be more substantial if the inflow of capital slows sharply that could happen if foreig n investors faced with the financial turmoil in the united states suddenly decide that dollar assets are too risky an abrupt fall in capital inflows would be an added decrement to the supply of credit exerting stronger upward pressure on us interest rates exacerbating the negative effects already affecting the credit and interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy for the 12 months through june 2008 the us treasury reports that the us economy received net foreign inflow of foreign capital of 270 billion down from 879 billion during the preceding twelve months this overall inflow was largely sust ained by official purchases inflows of capital from foreign central banks more than offsetting net outflows of capital by foreign private investors however in july 2008 there was net capital outflow of 75 billion reflecting the joint effect of net outflow of 92 billion by private investors and net inflow of 18 billion from other foreign central banks 13 if this pattern of large reductions of foreign capital inflows continues along with weakening demand for us exports the nearterm negative effects of this capital outflow on credit sensitive economic activity risk offsetting any concurrent positive effects from net exports if however economic conditions abroad deteriorate greatly flight to quality towards dollar assets particularly lowrisk treasury securities may have positive effect on credit conditions in the united states the recent strength of the dollar suggests that this move into highly liquid dollar assets is occurring but it is an open question whether it will be sustained

g9g6g18g561 recent study contains an estimate of the potential overall effect of reduced credit flows on real gdp14 it examines the linkage running from home prices falling to mortgage credit losses and reduced capitalization of leveraged financial institutions to reduced supply of credit flowing to households and nonfinancial business this study is not presented as the last word on this subject but it is carefully constructed and presents plausible estimates of gross magnitudes of effect and has the added advantage of being timely the study focuses on the supply of credit provided by three sets of financial institutions 1 on balancesheet lending by banks and other leveraged financial institutions 2 offbalance sheet lending by the asset backed securities abs market and 3 lending by governmentsponsored enterprises gses the study estimates the dampening effect of the reduced flow of credit from these three sources on the rate of growth of real gdp the central projection of the study is based on the assumption that home prices fall 10 from their mid2008 level mortgage credit losses are projected to accumulate to 636 billion through 2012 given series of assumptions about tax rates recapitalization rates and leverage ratios credit loss of that size is projected to cause decrement to the us economys supply of credit of about 1 trillion and lead to drag on real gdp of about 18 percentage points for two years for an economy that is likely already growing significantly below its trend rate of near 3 this degree of drag from deteriorating credit flows has the potential to halt real economic growth over the next two years particularly critical assumption for this outcome is that fannie mae and freddie mac the main gses continue to expand credit growth at their recent pace over the past year despite decline in the market value of their equity capital the gses have accelerated their contribution to credit growth adding almost 620 billion of lending over the year ending in june 2008 the studys central projection of credit growth has the gses continuing to expand their lending at 750 billion annual rate this outcome is more plausible now that the gses are controlled by the government however if the gses should stop expanding their lending the study estimates that the decrement to total credit growth would increase to 17 tr illion and the estimated drag on real gdp would increase to 32 percentage points over the next two years that would be substantial blow to overall economic activity and probably other factors constant has the potential to generate deep recession these estimates do not include other negative effects of the housing downturn on overall economic activity such as the wealth related dampening of consumer spending nor does it reflect

policy contain or mitigate the potentially large negative economywide effects of major credit crisis in general there are three types of policy response to be applied separately or in combination as the severity of the problem warrants the first type comprises the conventional macroeconomic policy tools of monetary and fiscal policy used with the aim of broadly supporting bank liquidity and aggregate spending monetary policy having greater flexibility and precision than fiscal policy will usually cause it to play the prominent role the second type of policy for responding to credit crisis is greater use of the feds traditional role of lender of last resort this policy will typically involve expanded use of the feds discount window the facility the fed uses to make short term loans to banks that need to bridge shortrun shortage of liquidity theses policies will be more narrowly focused on the needs of troubled institutions and deal more directly with unblocking the flow of credit than would conventional macroeconomic policy the third type of policy response is the use of extraordinary measures involving direct interventions by the federal government to restore confidence in financial markets and the remove impediments to credit to flowing broadly and at greater volume this extraordinary intervention may involve restructuring of the debt of troubled financial institutions and significant changes in the regulation of financial markets it is also argued that to be effective government most often will need to apply extraordinary measures quickly and decisively so that the actions clearly remove all uncertainty about profit and loss in the financial sector the us government to date has employed all three types of policy responses to the current credit market crisis g5g152g151g159g142g151g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g15g138g140g155g152g142g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561

activity so as to achieve full employment and price stability us monetary policy is implemented by targeting raising or lowering the shortterm federal funds rate marketdetermined interest rate that banks charge each other for shortterm loans the targeting of the federal funds rate is accomplished with open market operations whereby the fed buys or sells treasury securities for cash to increase or decrease liquidity in the financial markets increase or decrease real borrowing costs and thereby increase or decrease investment and other credit sensitive spending 15 15 see crs report rl34427

banks in exchange for cash the infusion of cash increases the reserves liquidity of the banking system ex erting downward pressure on interest rates the effect on interest rates is likely to be reflected quickly and most fully on shortterm interest rates and then hopefully spread to longerterm interest rates beginning in september 2007 in response to continuing evidence that disruptions in financial markets could have adverse effects on the wider economy the fed aggressively applied successive injections of monetary stimulus as it added reserves and pushed down the federal funds rate from 525 to its current level of 10 16 however the stimulative effects of much lower federal funds rate to the wider economy seem to be substantially muted as evidenced by the failure of longterm interest rates to fall this lack of stimulative effect is occurring because banks still lacking the needed degree of confidence have been content to increase reserves and liqui dity but not increase their lending activity they are still not willing to borrow shortterm and lend longterm the behavior needed to keep an adequate flow of credit liquidity moving to the nonfinancial sectors the phrase often used to describe this lack of effect on real economic activity is that monetary policy can not get traction in the economic literature the extreme form of this phenomenon is called liquidity trap situation where the financial systems seemingly limitless appetite for shortterm liquidity keeps the economy stuck in suboptimal equilibrium of slow economic growth that monetary policy alone cannot push it out of at this extreme monetary policys attempt to move the economy is likened to pushing on string in the current situation the economy may not have fallen into liquidity trap and getting the economy back to its trend rate of growth may only be matter of applying more monetary stimulus but there may be some restrictions on the feds ability to apply more stimulus for one the federal funds rate is approaching the zero bound when the shortterm policy rate is at or near zero the conventional approach for conducting stimulative monetary policy is not possible however there are alternative means that the fed could employ to provide stimulus in this situation first the fed could try to change financial market s interest rate expectations the current interest rate on longterm assets depends on the entire expected future path of shortterm interest rates including the zero rate for the federal funds rate if the central bank can persuade the public that it will hold the shortterm rate at zero for longer than had been expected interest rates across the whole termstructure should also fall stimulating spending such an outcome would hinge on whether the feds policy commitments are taken as credible by the public second the fed could alter the composition of its balance sheet the feds asset holdings are primarily of treasury securities of different maturities ranging from one month to 30 years but because its targeted interest rate for the conduct of monetary policy has been the shortterm 16 see the minutes of the feds open market committee from september

shortterm securities the average maturity of its assets is typically around one year if the fed were to shift the composition of its balance sheet toward longterm assets by selling shortterm treasuries and buying longterm treasuries it could possibly lower longterm yields to provide stimulus to economic activity17 third option for implementing monetary policy at the zero bound is to expand the size of the fed s balance sheet this of course is the conventional means of conducting stimulative monetary policy of buying securities to increase the supply of reserves in the banking system the policy focus however is shifted from the price of reserves interest rates to the quantity of reserves this process of increasing reserves above the level consistent with keeping the policy interest rate at zero was used by japan during its financial crisis of the 1990s and is often called quantitative easing18 stimulative monetary policy at the zero bound was the major part of japans initial response to its financial crisis in the 1990s that policy for the reasons just discussed had very difficult time getting traction and was not by itself able to push the japanese economy out of crisis nevertheless operation of monetary policy at the zero bound for the federal funds rate would be passage through uncharted waters for us monetary policy there remains substantial uncertainty about how well the alternative operating procedures might work particularly given the important role often volatile investor expectations would play in the alternative procedures ability to stimulate economic activity another important constraint on the feds ability to conduct stimulative monetary policy is the risk of inflation after 2006 inflation began to accelerate the consumer price index cpi increased 25 in 2006 but through july 2008 the cpi was rising at about 54 rate much of the upward pressure on the price level was the consequence was sharp rise in energy and other commodity prices in addition the falling dollar had increased the domestic price of many imports in august and september of 2008 inflation slowed substantially perhaps indicating that economic growth has slowed enough to remove much of the upward pressure on energy and food prices if so this apparent abatement of supplyside generated inflation may allow the fed to worry less about near term inflation effects of large scale monetary stimulus to counter the dampening effect on economic activity of the current financial market crisis 17 for this process to work however investors must treat treasury securities of different maturities as imperfect substitutes otherwise an increase in the supply of shortterm securities coupled with likesize decrease in the supply of longterm in public hands would not cause significant d ecrease in longterm interest rates the evidence is limited but it would tend to indicate that the public sees only small degree of imperfect subs titutability between shortterm and longterm treasury securities raising doubt about the fficacy of altering the composition of the feds balance sheet to generate stimulative monetary policy 18 quantitative easing is thought to affect real economic activity through three channels first it induces shift in investor portfolios away from cash and toward other financial assets so it would tend to push up asset prices and push down yields second by altering investor expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate by demonstrating willingness to keep reserves high it could as already di scussed above induce decrease in interest rates third quantitative easing could generate stimulative fiscal effect as the swapping of noninterest bearing currency and reserves for interest bearing treasury debt leads to reduction of the current and future interest cost of the federal government and lowering of the associated tax burden on the public

current monetary stimulus the fed has injected large amounts of liquidity into the economy that could pose an inflation problem once the economy returns to normal rate of growth however measures of

both changes in discretionary spending and changes in the automatic stabilizers policy of fiscal stimulus would involve tax cuts or spending increases or some combination of the two unlike monetary policy which must transmit its stimulative impact to economic activity indirectly through financial markets fiscal policy has relatively direct impact on economic activity increased government spending is direct addition to aggregate spending tax cut is less direct because it must first pass through household income before it boosts spending and there is always the possibility that all or part of the tax cut is saved rather than spent by households in addition to its effect on aggregate spending fiscal stimulus may have an indirect positive effect on the condition of financial institutions balance sheets as the salutary effect on economic activity also exerts upward pressure on asset prices 20 to be most effective fiscal policy initiatives would occur in conjunction with stimulative monetary policy the economic stimulus act of 200821 provided tax rebates to households and accelerated depreciation rules for business that amounted to an increase in private sector income of about 120 billion in 2008 22 taking potential multiplier effects into consideration the rebate could generate an even larger stimulus to total economic activity23 history and economic theory however indicate that onetime tax cuts often do not stimulate consumer spending nevertheless evidence from the 2001 federal tax rebate showed that households eventually spent about 23 of that rebate the bureau of economic analysiss estimate of personal saving increased substantially in the second and third quarters of 2008 suggesting that substantial portion of the 2008 rebate has been saved so

because unemployment benefits tend to get spent quickly they usually give timely and direct stimulus to economic activity25 total real federal spending over the four quarters ending mid2008 has increased about 5 and contributed an estimated 04 to the growth of real gdp over this period26 however to correctly gauge governments effect on aggregate spending its revenue and spending actions need to be evaluated the generally accepted way of determining whether the influence of the government budget on aggregate spending and real gdp is positive or negative is the direction of change of the standardized budget measure the standardized measure excludes the effect of cyclical fluctuations and factors that are short lived and unlikely to affect aggregate spending in the shortrun the congressional budget office cbo projected in october that the standardized budget deficit increased from 11 of potential gdp in 2007 to 28 of potential gdp in 2008 which suggests that government fiscal actions are expected to provide stimulative impulse to the economy equal to 17 of potential gdp in 2009 however the standard budget deficit is projected to fall to 16 of potential gdp which signals reduction of the government budgets st imulative effect on aggregate spending this estimate predates legislation that is discussed below that provides major increase in government expenditures

last resort the fed offers credit to solvent but temporarily illiquid financial institutions these are financial institutions that are solvent because the value of their assets exceed the value of their liabilities but because their debts tend to be shortterm and liquid while their assets are longterm and illiquid they are in need of shortterm funds to meet short term debt obligations the expectation is that with improved access to shortterm liquidity financial institutions will be more willing and able to lend to each other and to the nonfinancial sectors of the economy and thereby remove excess volatility in financial markets the feds discount window is its facility for making loans to financial institutions with short term liquidity problems and the discount rate is the interest rate charged for these loans 28 financial institutions are often reluctant to use the discount window out of concern that financial market participants will draw negative inference about their financial condition if their borrowing from the fed becomes known in conjunction with conventional monetary stimulus discussed above the fed beginning in august 2007 has taken number of steps to make use of the discount window more attractive it has broadened the group of eligible participants it has extended the term of loans and it has lowered the discount rate enhancements to the feds lender of last resort function have included the creation of the primary dealer credit facility which opened the discount window to nonmember financial institutions the term auction facility to make loans to member banks based on broader range of collateral 25 for further discussion see crs report 92939 countercyclical job creation programs by linda levine 26 see bea us economic accounts 27

securities in exchange for some asset backed securities the fed has also entered into asset swaps with the european central bank and several other foreign central banks to increase dollar liquidity in foreign financial markets these direct loans to the financial sector are typically sterilized by the fed through the purchase of treasury securities so as to keep the total value of its asset holdings steady and avoid generating any inflationary pressure maintaining market confidence in the financial sector also involves ensuring that any exit of firms from the sector occurs in an orderly way to this end the fed in march 2008 facilitated with loans the purchase of troubled investment bank bear stearns by jp morgan the fed judged that given the severe illiquidity of the financial system at that time bankruptcy filing by bear stearns would have led to much broader liquidity problems the fed argued that lending support for the sale of bear stearns was necessary to avoid the systemic risk of disorderly exit the feds enhanced discount window initiatives have pumped large volume of liquidity into the us financial system for the two month period ending october 1 2008 the fed increased systemwide reserve funds by over 800 billion increasing total reserve funds to over 15 trillion for comparison reserve funds increased only about 27 billion over the twelve months ending june 2008 29 despite their size the feds lenderoflastresort initiatives along with conventional monetary stimulus have not yet resulted in renewed credit flows at precrisis levels as financial institutions have accumulated reserves but remained reluctant to generate new longterm lending this lack of effect has suggested to some that the problem goes beyond matter of shortrun illiquidity and involves longterm solvency issues longterm inso lvency means that the true market value of some financial institutions assets is not sufficient cover their liabilities the feds ability to continue pursuing large lenderof lastresort activities may eventually be constrained by the changing risk profile of the central banks balancesheet its recent lender of last resort initiatives have meant that the fed has exchanged sizeable portion of its holdings of lowrisk treasury securities for highrisk collateral although the fed is able to hedge some of this risk the average level of risk carried in the feds total asset holdings has increased more lending by the fed could potentially increase the level of risk in its asset holdings to point beyond which it is not willing to go

devastating to the whole financial system took control of the mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac and the insurance giant aig nevertheless despite these efforts the financial turmoil persisted credit flows remained anemic risk spreads remained at record size and the threat of more widespread bankruptcies of financial institutions increased the prospect of collapse of the entire financial system with large negative repercussions on the wider economy prompted the federal government to initiate massive intervention into the financial system to restore confidence and resume the flow of credit hence the troubled asset relief program tarp was initiated with variety of features but the heart of the program is that it gives the secretary of the treasury up to 700 billion to either buy mortgages and other troubled assets or directly recapitalize selected financial institutions 30 g10g152g160g561g25g146g149g149g561g22g3g20g18g561g25g152g155g148g501g561 the details of how the program will be fully implemented are still being developed central objective however is to increase demand relative to supply for risky assets in order to stabilize their price arguably the government will now targ et as it does the federal funds rate the price of risk in the economy stabilizing the price of risk may reduce the incentive of financial institutions to hoard liquidity and induce them to return to their conventional role of borrowing shortterm and lending longterm and begin to pass larger flow of liquidity to the nonfinancial sectors to support credit dependent spending in general there are at least two ways for tarp to stop the price of risky assets from falling first the treasury can reduce the supply of risky assets by buying them or guaranteeing them guarantee reduces the supply because it transforms risky asset into not risky asset second the treasury can recapitalize the financial system either through inducing it to capitalize itself or through the government taking some level of equity position in troubled financial institutions with recapitalization the demand for risky assets is expected to recover exerting upward pressure on asset prices the initial spending of tarp funds has been for recapitalization within this general framework critical decisions therefore must be made about what assets to buy or guarantee whole mortgages and mortgage pools mortgage backed securities or other assets deemed important to promote financial market stability in addition decisions will be made about what price to pay for the troubled assets the treasury could either buy at market price to protect taxpayers or it could buy at bove market price to provide recapitalization of the assisted institution conferring significant benefit to that institution but none to many others g25g146g149g149g561g22g3g20g18g561g21g152g149g159g142g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g139g149g142g150g501g561 tarp takes the us economy into uncharted waters and it is uniquely difficult to predict what the outcome of the program will be many economists argue that some initiative broadly like this was probably needed to stave off an economic catastrophe that would have extended far

quickly and decisively in restructuring financial sector debt was an important reason why japan emerged from its financial crisis so slowly enduring decade of lost economic growth if such large and extraordinary intervention into us financial markets is needed to assure their smooth functioning it raises the longer term stion of whether the management of risk can largely be left to financial markets themselves some argue that permanent public guarantee of risk could be necessary to avoid overly volatile asset markets to ensure the ability to issue debt and to preserve an adequate flow of credit to the nonfinancial economy sceptics counter that large scale government support and guarantee of risk may induce moral hazard that is if financial markets come to believe that government will come to the rescue any time problems occur then those markets will have less incentive to prudently manage risk and more incentive to take on imprudent risk to resolve the moral hazard problem posed

economic situation are judged to be on the downside one important risk is that the constraint on credit flows from the deleveraging of financial institutions could be deeper and more protracted than
