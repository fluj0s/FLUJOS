attorney american law division congressional research service the library of congress medicare provisions in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 summary medicare is nationwide health insurance program now covering 38 million aged and disabled persons total program outlays in fy1998 are estimated at 2301 billion net medicare outlays after deduction of beneficiary premiums are estimated at 2086 billion medicare consists of two parts the part program covers hospital services skilled nursing facility snf services and home health care part b covers physicians services laboratory tests durable medical equipment outpatient hospital services and other medical services the ability of medicares current financing structure to adequately fund program growth has been of concern for many years the part trust fund had been projected to become insolvent in 2001 in that year revenues coming into the trust fund primarily payroll taxes together with any balance carried over from prior years would have been insufficient to cover the payment for part benefits in that year unlike part because of the way it is financed medicare part b has not faced insolvency however policymakers have also been concerned with the rapid growth in part b payments and the impact of this growth on general revenue spending and the federal budget deficit further compounding the funding problems is the fact that the large babyboom population will start to become eligible for medicare in 2011 on may 15 1997 the president and congressional leaders agreed to bipartisan budget agreement designed to reduce the budget deficit to zero by 2002 the agreement subsequently included in the fy1998 budget resolution provided for medicare savings of 115 billion over the fy1998fy2002 period on june 25 1997 the house and senate each passed bills the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 which included these savings the conference agreement passed the house july 30 1997 and the senate july 31 1997 it was signed into law as pl 10533 on august 5 1997 the bba 97 achieves the target savings by slowing the rate of growth in payments to hospitals physicians and other providers and by establishing new payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities home health agencies and other service categories these savings reduce the average annual rate of growth in net medicare spending from 88 to 55 for the period fy1997fy2002 the measure also provides coverage for additional preventive benefits it further extends the solvency of the part trust fund through fy2009 the proposed senate plans to introduce means testing into the part b program and to increase the eligibility age were not included in the final package the bba 1997 establishes the medicarechoice program which expands private plan options to include preferred provider organizations ppos provider sponsored organizations psos and private feeforservice plans it modifies the way payments are made to health maintenance organizations hmos further under demonstration program limited number of beneficiaries would also be able to establish medical savings accounts msas in conjunction with high deductible

balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 introduction overview of medicare coverage medicare is the nations health insurance program for the elderly and disabled it is nonmeans tested program there are income or assets tests for coverage medicare consists of two parts part hospital insurance program and part b supplementary medical insurance program almost all persons over age 65 are automatically entitled to medicare part part also provides coverage after 24 month waiting period for persons under age 65 who are receiving social security cash benefits on the basis of disability most persons who need kidney transplant or renal dialysis may also be covered regardless of age in fy1997 part will cover an estimated 381 million aged and disabled persons including those with chronic kidney disease medicare part b is voluntary all persons over age 65 and all persons enrolled in part may enroll in part b by paying monthly premium 4380 in 1997 in fy1997 part b will cover an estimated 366 million aged and disabled persons benefits part provides coverage for inpatient hospital services up to 100 days of post hospital skilled nursing facility snf care home health services and hospice care patients must pay deductible 760 in 1997 each time their hospital admission begins benefit period benefit period begins when patient enters hospital and ends when he or she has not been in hospital or snf for 60 days medicare pays the remaining costs for the first 60 days of hospital care the limited number of beneficiaries requiring care beyond 60 days are subject to additional charges patients requiring snf care are subject to daily coinsurance charge for the 21st through the 100th day 95 in 1997 there are costsharing charges for home health care and limited charges for hospice care part b provides coverage for complimentary set of health services including physicians services laboratory services durable medical equipment outpatient hospital services and other medical services the program generally pays 80 of medicares fee schedule or other approved payment amount after the beneficiary has met the annual 100 deductible the beneficiary is liable for the remaining 20 crs2 payments for services the majority of medicare enrollees obtain services under feeforservice system under feeforservice beneficiaries obtain covered services through providers of their choice and medicare makes payments for each service rendered the amount of payment per service is generally subject to certain limits taken together spending for inpatient hospital and physicians services account for close to 70 of medicare benefit payments medicare makes payments for inpatient hospital services under prospective payment system pps predetermined rate is paid for each inpatient stay based on the patients admitting diagnosis payments for physicians services are made on the basis of fee schedule specific payment rules are also used for other services1 medicare and managed care managed care encompasses wide variety of arrangements including health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos typically managed care plans control costs by restricting an enrollees choice of provider or by giving enrollees strong financial incentives to choose particular providers they also reduce costs by managing enrollees use of services they may reduce unnecessary hospitalizations diagnostic tests or specialty referrals either by giving participating physicians financial stake in the cost of the services they order or through programs that review the use of services managed care plans may also select lowcost providers of services or negotiate discounted rates from providers hmos are the oldest type of managed care organization like traditional insurers an hmo accepts financial responsibility for defined set of health care benefits in return for fixed monthly per capita premium paid by or on behalf of each enrolled member unlike other insurers an hmo directly provides or arranges for services through affiliated physicians hospitals and other network providers instead of simply paying bills generally an hmo controls access to covered benefits through primary care gatekeeper medicare has been authorized to contract with hmos since 1972 but the major managed care program the medicare risk contract program dates to 1982 with the passage of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra this is why risk contracts are also known as tefra risk contracts the intent of tefra was to enable beneficiaries to enroll in managed care organizations as an alternative to traditional feeforservice medicare and also to capture efficiencies of hmos and thus save medicare money enrollment of beneficiaries in medicare managed care has grown significantly from about 4 in 1985 to over 13 of medicare beneficiaries by the end of 1996 most medicare managed care enrollment is in risk contract plans the remainder are 1 for additional information on these rules see us library of congress congressional research service medicare reimbursement policies crs report 97602 by celinda franco et may 28 1997 washington 1997 crs3 enrolled in hmos that are paid on the basis of actual costs or are in hmos or other types of managed care organization participating in medicare demonstration programs each risk hmo is paid predetermined monthly amount called the adjusted average per capita cost or aapcc for each medicare enrollee regardless of the amount of medicare covered services the enrollee uses the hmo is at risk for providing any necessary services to the enrollee which may exceed the medicare payment with certain exceptions medicare beneficiary who enrolls in risk contract plan must obtain all medicare covered services through that plan the beneficiary may be charged the usual costsharing charges or pay the equivalent in the form of monthly premium to the organization beneficiaries share in any projected savings to the risk contract hmo through the provision of benefits in addition to those included in the medicare benefit package administration medicare is administered by the health care financing administration hcfa within the department of health and human services hhs much of the daytoday work of reviewing claims and making payments is done by intermediaries for part and carriers for part b these are commercial insurers or blue cross and blue shield plans financing medicare part is financed primarily through payroll tax levied on current workers and their employers in 1997 employers and employees each pay tax of 145 on all earnings the selfemployed pay single tax of 29 on earnings part b is financed through combination of monthly premiums levied on program beneficiaries and federal general revenues in 1997 the premium is 4380 beneficiary premiums have generally represented about 25 of part b costs federal general revenues ie tax dollars account for the remaining 75 outlays in fy1996 total medicare outlays were 1943 billion net medicare outlays ie net of premiums beneficiaries pay for enrollment largely for part b were 1742 billion table 1 provides historical spending data for medicare the congressional budget office cbo estimates using its january 1997 baseline that under current law medicare outlays would total 2301 billion in fy1998 estimated net medicare outlays

welfare program in the federal budget exceeded only by the social security program it is an openended entitlement program that pays for as many medical services as the eligible population needs between 1980 and 1996 spending increased at an average annual rate of 112 and its share of the federal budget increased from 54 to 112 net medicare outlays represented about 54 of total federal spending on health programs of various kinds in fy1996 medicare is expected to continue to grow at rapid pace cbo estimated using its january 1997 baseline that under the law in effect prior to the enactment of bba net medicare outlays would increase at an average rate of 86 over the fy1997fy2007 period the ability of medicares current financing mechanisms to adequately fund program growth has been of concern for many years since 1970 the medicare trustees have been predicting the impending insolvency of the part trust fund however 1995 was the first year that the insolvency of the trust fund became major part of the budget debate the trust fund was projected to become insolvent in 2001 in that year revenues coming into the trust fund primarily payroll taxes together with any balance carried over from prior years would have been insufficient to cover the payment for part benefits in that year2 unlike part medicare part b has not faced insolvency because of the way it is financed however policymakers have also been concerned with the rapid growth in part b payments and the impact of this growth on general revenue spending and the federal budget deficit addressing the part insolvency issue has been only one of the concerns facing medicare beginning in 2011 medicare will begin to experience the impact of major demographic changes first babyboomers persons born between 1946 and 1964 begin turning age 65 second there is shift in the number of workers supporting persons receiving benefits under part in 1996 there were 39 workers per beneficiary the ratio is expected to decline to 23 by 2030 because of its rapid growth both in terms of aggregate dollars and as share of the federal budget the medicare program has been major focus of deficit reduction legislation passed by the congress since 1980 with few exceptions reductions in program spending have been achieved largely through reductions in payments to providers primarily hospitals and physicians these reductions stemmed but did not eliminate the yeartoyear increases in medicare outlays the 104th congress also considered but did not enact legislation which would have achieved significant medicare savings through reductions in the rate of growth in payments to providers and cap on spending3 during the debate considerable attention was also given to expanding the options available to beneficiaries for obtaining covered services 2 for further discussion of part financing issues see us library of congress congressional research service medicare financing the part hospital insurance

insurance market4 the bba 97 achieves medicare savings by slowing the rate of growth in payments to hospitals physicians and other providers and by establishing new payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities home health agencies and other service categories it further extends the solvency of the part trust fund through 2006 bba 97 also includes provisions to increase the private plan options available to beneficiaries while these new options will include feeforservice arrangements they will also include managed care plans such as preferred provider organizations and provider sponsored organizations the agreement also changes the methodology used to pay such plans the government will continue to set rates for plans such rates however should better reflect the actual cost of delivering health care in local areas than is the case today the conference agreement largely reflects perspective that increased managed care enrollment for medicare will help slow the rate of growth in medicare expenditures this perspective is in part encouraged by the experiences of the private sector where the rapid movement of large group health plans from fee forservice into managed care has helped to slow the rate of medical care inflation in 1987 only 27 of participants in employer plans were enrolled in managed care plans by 1996 74 of participants in such plans were enrolled in managed care plans5 while this change is not regarded by everyone as positive concerns exist for example that the growth of managed care has reduced access to services for lower income populations the bba 1997 shows that substantial support exists for trying to restructure medicare to make it work more like the large group private insurance market while the bba 97 achieves significant savings it does not address the longer term funding problems that will be exacerbated when the baby boom generation begins to receive program benefits the question of how to address these issues including the possibility of significant structural reforms will be considered by new national commission bipartisan commission on the future of medicare this commission authorized under bba 97 is required to report its recommendations by march 1 1999 4 for further discussion of medicare restructuring issues see us library of congress congressional research service medicare the restructuring debate in the

transmitted the fy1998 budget to congress on february 6 1997 at that time the administration estimated that the medicare provisions would save 100 billion over the 5year period fy1998 fy2002 in march the administration made few modifications to its plan and reestimated the savings at 1061 billion cbo estimated the savings at 816 billion the proposed savings would be achieved by slowing the rate of growth in payments to hospitals physicians and other providers establishing new payment methodologies for snfs and home health agencies and providing flexibility to medicare to enable it to be more prudent purchaser of certain services and supplies significant savings would also be achieved by making changes in medicares payments to hmos the budget also provided coverage for additional preventive benefits6 6 for further discussion of the presidents fy1998 budget see us library of congress congressional research service medicare presidents fy1998 budget crs report 95650 by jennifer

congressional leaders agreed to bipartisan budget agreement designed to reduce the budget deficit to zero by 2002 the agreement provided for medicare savings of 115 billion over the fy1998fy2002 period while most of the specifics would be developed by the congressional authorizing committees namely the house ways and means and commerce committees and the senate finance committee it did include several specific elements these included 1 extension of the solvency of the part trust fund for 10 years through combination of savings and structural reform including the reallocation of some home health spending from part to part b 2 giving beneficiaries more choices among competing health plans such as psos and ppos 3 providing beneficiaries with comparative information about their options 4 maintaining the part b premium at 25 of program costs and phasingin over 7 years the inclusion of the new home health spending in the calculation of the premium 5 reforming the managed care payment methodology to address geographic disparities 6 establishing prospective payment methodologies for such services as home health snf and hospital outpatient services and 7 providing funding for new health benefits including iexpanding mammography coverage ii coverage for colorectal screenings iii coverage for diabetes selfmanagement and iv higher payments to providers for preventive vaccinations to the extent it will lead to greater use by beneficiaries further the agreement called for 4 billion investment over 5 years and 20 billion over 10 years to limit beneficiary copayments for outpatient services unless there is more costeffective way to provide such services to beneficiaries as mutually agreed on june 5 1997 the house and senate gave final agreement to the conference report on the fy1998 budget resolution hconres 84 this measure incorporated the bipartisan budget agreement it also set out the level of spending reductions that the various congressional committees were required to meet the committees were required to develop specific legislation to meet these reconciliation instructions and to transmit the legislation to the house and senate budget committees

medicare provisions of bba 97 the following sections summarize the major medicare provisions of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 as enacted into law table 7 and figure 1 at the end of this report shows that most of the estimated savings from the law come from reductions in payments to providers table 8 shows the impact of these savings on the annual rate of growth in medicare spending bba 97 lowers the average annual rate of growth in net medicare spending from 884 to 555 over the fy1997fy2002 period part hospitals annual hospital payment updates current law medicare pays most acute care hospitals under pps fixed predetermined amount is paid according to the patients diagnosis payments to pps hospitals are updated annually using an update factor which is determined in part by the projected increase in the hospital market basket index mbi which measures the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals bba 97 the bba 97 includes 0 update for fy1998 the mbi minus 19 percentage points for fy1999 the mbi minus 18 percentage points for fy2000 the mbi minus 11 percentage points for fy2001 and fy2002 and for fy2003 and each subsequent fiscal year the mbi percentage increase for all hospitals in all areas the bba 97 also includes provision which sets higher update for certain nonteaching nondsh and nonmedicare dependent hospitals to provide these hospitals with temporary relief in fy1998 these hospitals will receive payment update equal to the update provided that year for all other hospitals plus 05 percentage points for fy1999 payment update equal to the update for that year provided for all other hospitals plus 03 percentage points hospital capital payments current law medicare pays its proportionate share of certain hospital capital related costs capitalrelated costs primarily include interest and depreciation related to construction of facilities and purchase of equipment 10year transition to fully prospective payments for capital costs began in fy1992 during which capital payments are paid prospectively based on average capital costs per case in fy1989 updated for inflation and other cost changes from fy1992 through fy1995 hcfa updated base payment rates using moving average of capital cost increases in previous years during this period the congress required hcfa to adjust the payment rates in each year so that anticipated aggregate capital payments would equal 90 of anticipated aggregate costs this provision expired on september 30 1995 resulting in 206 increase in the federal capital payment rate for fy1996 under current law medicare provides for establishing an appropriate allowance for depreciation and interest on capital indebtedness and return on equity capital crs11 when hospital or snf has undergone change of ownership the valuation of the asset is the lesser of the allowable acquisition costs of the asset to the owner of record or the acquisition cost of such asset to the new owner bba 97 the bba 97 requires the secretary to rebase the capital payment rates for discharges occurring on or after october 1 1997 by the actual rates in effect in fy1995 so that aggregate capital payments will equal 90 of what payments would have been under reasonable cost payments with an additional reduction in the capital payment rate of 21 the bba 97 eliminates the allowance for return on equity capital in addition when facility undergoes change of ownership the bba 97 provides for depreciation adjustment of the historical cost of the asset recognized by medicare less depreciation allowed to the owner of record as of the date of enactment or to the first owner of record of the asset in the case of an asset not in existence as of the date of enactment definition of hospital transfer current law pps hospitals that move patients to ppsexempt hospitals and distinctpart units or skilled nursing facilities snfs are currently considered to have discharged the patient and receive full diagnosis related group drg payment in the case of hospital transferring patient to another hospital the drg payment to the hospital sending patient to second hospital is reduced and the hospital is paid per diem rate while payment in full is made to the second hospital which completes the patients hospital care and discharges the patient the transfer policy is applicable only when an acute care hospital transfers patient to another acute care hospital bba 97 the bba 97 provides that for discharges occurring on or after october 1 1998 discharges that fall within specified group of 10 drgs selected by the secretary with the greatest number of cases and that have lengths of stays below the average will be treated as transfer for payment purposes the provision applies to patients transferred from pps hospital to ppsexempt hospital or unit snf discharges with subsequent home health care provided within an appropriate period as defined by the secretary and for discharges occurring on or after october 1 2000 additional post discharge services included by the secretary payments to pps hospitals will be fully or partially based on medicares current payment policies applicable to patients transferred from one pps hospital to another pps hospital per diem rates for cases where substantial portion of the cost of care is incurred in the early days of hospital stay the secretary may not pay provider more than the sum of 50 of the transfer per diem payment amount and 50 of the total drg payment amount for fy2001 the secretary is required to publish proposed rule which includes

consultation via telecommunications system by later than january 1 1999 for services provided to medicare beneficiaries residing in rural county that is not adjacent to metropolitan statistical area new demonstration project on informatics telemedicine and education is also authorized the bba 97 does not however include provision allowing schs the option of choosing an alternative target amount based on operating costs in fy1994 or fy1995 graduate medical education gme payments current law medicare pays teaching hospitals for its share of the costs of providing gme direct graduate medical education direct gme payments are based on hospitals per resident costs ie resident and faculty salaries and fringe benefits and overhead costs related to teaching activities and the number of full timeequivalent residents the hospital employs the indirect costs are reimbursed through the indirect medical education ime adjustment this adjustment is designed to compensate teaching hospitals for their relatively higher costs attributable to the involvement of residents in patient care and the patients requiring specialized services available only in teaching hospitals the ime adjustment currently increases medicares hospital payments by approximately 77 for each 10 increase in hospitals ratio of interns and residents to beds bba 97 the bba 97 includes reduction in the ime adjustment

payments to hospitals for beneficiaries whose care has been exceptionally costly or required an unusually long hospital stay when calculating hospitals cost when it exceeds the threshold the outlier formula subtracts the portion of costs attributed to the hospitals level of teaching and service to lowincome patients when the hospital receives any ime and dsh payments these payments are determined as percentage of the combined amount of the drg and the outlier payment bba 97 the bba 97 eliminates the increased ime and dsh payments that are attributable to cost outlier payments but allows hospitals to count ime and dsh as part of costs that trigger outlier payments effective in fy1998 crs14 floor on the area wage index current law as part of the process for determining payments to hospitals under medicare pps the secretary is required to adjust portion of the standardized amounts for area differences in hospital wage levels by factor reflecting the relative hospital wage level

the payment limitations and incentives established in tefra of 1982 each provider is paid on the basis of reasonable cost subject to rate of increase ceiling on inpatient operating costs the ceiling is based on target amount per discharge the target amount for cost reporting period is equal to the hospitals allowable inpatient operating costs excluding capital and medical education costs per discharge in base year increased by applicable update factors for subsequent years this amount is then multiplied by medicare discharges to yield the ceiling or upper limit on operating costs obra 93 provided that the applicable rate of increase percentage or update would be equal to the mbi minus 10 for fy1994fy1997 bba 97 the bba 97 sets the fy1998 update to 0 and for fy1999 through fy2002 the update factor is set to vary depending on hospitals target amount and costs for hospitals 1 with costs that equal or exceed their target amounts by 10 or more the update is equal to the market basket

target amounts for hospitals for cost reporting periods ending during fy1996 and then update the amount up to the first cost reporting period beginning on or after october 1 1997 by factor equal to the market basket percentage increase for cost reporting periods beginning during each of fy1999 through fy2002 the secretary is required to update the amount by factor equal to the market basket increase crs16 change in bonus payments for pps exempt hospitals current law medicare provides for bonus payments for hospitals whose operating costs are less than or equal to the target amount as well as making relief payments to hospitals whose costs exceed their target amount if the hospitals costs are less than or equal to the target amount for that period the hospital receives bonus payment equal to 50 of the amount by which the target amount exceeds the amount of the operating costs or 5 of the target amount whichever is less if hospitals operating costs are greater than the target amount the amount of the payment is equal to 1 the target amount plus 2 an additional amount equal to 50 of the amount by which the operating costs exceed the target amount but not more than 10

for the first 2 cost reporting periods for which the hospital has settled cost report are equal to the lesser of the amount of operating costs for the period or 110 of the national median of the target amount for hospitals in the same class of hospital for cost reporting periods ending during fy1996 updated by the hospital market basket increase percentage to the fiscal year in which the hospital first received payments for determining national median operating costs for hospitals in the same class the secretary is required to provide for an appropriate adjustment to the laborrelated portion of the amount determined to take into account differences between average wagerelated costs in the area the hospital was located in and the national average of such costs within the same class of hospital the secretary is also required to create subclasses of longterm care hospitals based on differences in the case mix and patient severity in calculating and applying the 110 of the national median cost limits rebasing current law provision bba 97 the bba 97 provides ppsexempt hospitals and distinct units of hospitals that received medicare payments for services furnished before january 1 1990 the option of rebasing the hospitals target amount for the 12month cost reporting period beginning during fy1998 the rebased target amount is equal to an average determined by the secretary as follows 1 the secretary is required to crs17 determine the allowable operating cost for inpatient hospital services for the hospital unit for each of the five cost reporting periods for which the secretary has settled cost reports as of the date of enactment 2 the secretary is required to increase the amount determined for the five cost reporting periods by the applicable percentage increase used to update costs for each of the cost reporting periods up to fy1998 3 the secretary is required to identify among the five cost reporting periods the periods for which the updated cost amount is the highest and the lowest and 4 the secretary is required to compute the averages of the updated cost report amounts for the three cost reporting periods that are not the highest or the lowest amounts the bba 97 also allows qualified longterm care hospitals that elect to do so to apply for rebasing of their target amount beginning during fy1998 the provision defines qualified longterm care hospital as ppsexempt hospital that receives medicare payments during each of the two most recent cost reporting periods during which the hospitals medicare allowable operating costs exceeds 115 of the hospitals target amount and that has disproportionate patient percentage of at least 70 if the hospital were pps hospital the target amount for the hospitals 12 month cost reporting period is equal to the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services recognized by medicare for the 12month cost reporting periods beginning during fy1996 increased by the applicable percentage increase for the cost reporting period beginning during fy1997 treatment of certain longterm care hospitals located within other hospitals current law provision bba 97 the bba 97 extends the classification of hospital that was classified by the secretary on or before september 30 1995 as longterm care hospital notwithstanding that it is located in the same building as or on the same campus as another hospital the provision applies to discharges occurring on or after october 1 1995 certain cancer hospitals current law certain special categories of hospitals including cancer hospitals are exempt from medicare inpatient hospital pps and are paid on the basis of reasonable costs subject to certain limits bba 97 the bba 97 amends the definition of longterm care hospitals to include longterm care hospitals that first received medicare payment in 1986 with an average inpatient length of stay of more than 20 days and that had 80 or more of its annual total inpatient discharges with diagnosis that reflects finding of neoplastic disease for the 12month cost reporting period ending in fy1997 prospective payment system pps for inpatient rehabilitation services current law rehabilitation hospitals are one of the categories of hospitals not paid by the medicare pps for hospitals and are known as ppsexempt hospitals bba 97 the bba 97 requires the secretary to establish casemix adjusted pps for rehabilitation hospitals and distinctpart units effective beginning in fy2001 the secretary is required to establish 1 classes of discharges of rehabilitation crs18 facilities by patient casemix groups based on impairment age related prior hospitalization comorbidities and functional capability of the discharged individual and other appropriate factors and 2 method of classifying specific discharges from rehabilitation facilities within these groups the secretary is required to assign each case mix group an appropriate weighting which reflects the relative facility resources used by discharge group the secretary is required to adjust the classifications and weighting factors to correct for forecast errors and to reflect changes in treatment patterns technology case mix number of discharges paid for under medicare and other factors which might affect the relative use of resources the secretary is authorized to require rehabilitation facilities providing inpatient hospital services to submit data on discharges classified according to casemix group or other rehabilitation impairment groups measurement of functional disability and other patient assessment factors necessary to establish and administer the pps the secretary is required to determine prospective payment rate for each rehabilitation facility discharge payable under medicare prospective payment rates are to be phasedin between october 1 2000 and before october 1 2002 by blending the prospective rate with the tefra percentage of the hospitals target amount that would have been paid under part if this provision did not apply and the prospective payment percentage of the per discharge payment rate established by the secretary payments during the transition period will be based on tefra and prospective payment percentage amounts equal to 66 23 and 33 13 respectively for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 2000 and before october 1 2001 and 33 13 and 66 23 respectively for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 2001 and before october 1 2002 for fy2001 and fy 2002 the secretary is required to establish prospective payment amounts that are budget neutral so that total payments for rehabilitation hospitals equal 98 of the amount of payments that would have been made if the prospective payment system had not been enacted the prospective system will be fully implemented by october 1 2002 study and report on payments for longterm care hospitals current law provision bba 97 the bba 97 requires the secretary to collect data to develop establish administer and evaluate casemix adjusted prospective payment system for longterm care hospitals the secretary is required to develop legislative proposal for establishing and administering payment system that includes an adequate patient classification system that reflected differences in patient resource use the secretary is required to submit the proposal to the appropriate committees of congress by later than october 1 1999 skilled nursing facilities snfs payment reform current law currently medicare reimburses the great bulk of snf care on retrospective costbased basis this means that snfs are paid after services are delivered for the reasonable costs as defined by the program they have incurred for crs19 the care they provide for medicare reimbursement purposes the costs snfs incur for providing services to beneficiaries can be divided into three major categories 1 routine services costs that include nursing room and board administration and other overhead 2 ancillary services such as physical and occupational therapy and speech language pathology laboratory services drugs supplies and other equipment and 3 capitalrelated costs including net depreciation expense taxes lease and rental payments improvements that extend the life or increase the productivity of assets net interest expense etc routine costs are subject to national average per diem limits separate per diem routine cost limits are established for freestanding and hospitalbased snfs by urban or rural area freestanding snf routine limits are set at 112 of the average per diem laborrelated and nonlaborrelated costs hospitalbased snf limits are set at the limit for freestanding snfs plus 50 of the difference between the freestanding limits and 112 of the average per diem routine services costs of hospitalbased snfs routine cost limits for snf care are required to be updated every 2 years in the interim the secretary applies snf market basket developed by hcfa to reflect changes in the price of goods and services purchased by snfs obra93 eliminated updates in snf routine cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning in fy1994 and fy1995 ancillary service and capital costs are both paid on the basis of reasonable costs and neither are subject to limits snfs providing less than 1500 days of care per year to medicare patients in the preceding year have the option of being paid prospective payment rate set at 105 of the regional mean for all snfs in the region the rate covers routine and capital related costs but not ancillary services and is calculated separately for urban and rural areas adjusted to reflect differences in wage levels prospective rates can not exceed the routine service costs limits that would be applicable to the facility adjusted to take into account average capitalrelated costs with respect to the type and location of the facility congress on number of occasions has required the secretary to develop alternative methods for paying for snf care on prospective basis in response hcfa has conducted research to develop pps that uses patient classification system known as resource utilization groups rugs that will account for variations in resource use among medicare snf patients costbased reimbursement has been cited as one of the reasons for significant growth in snf spending since 1989 spending has increased from 35 billion in 1989 to 117 billion in 1996 for an average annual rate of growth of 19 growth in snf spending can be explained largely by the increasing number of persons qualifying for the benefit and increases in reimbursements per day of care numbers of persons served has nearly doubled since 1989 reaching 115 million persons in 1996 average payments for care have grown from 117 per day in 1989 to 292 per day in 1996 increases in ancillary service reimbursements explain much of this per diem payment growth crs20 bba 97 bba 97 phases in prospective payment system for snf care that will pay federal per diem rate for covered snf services covered services will include part snf benefits as well as all services for which payment may be made under part b during the period when the beneficiary is provided covered snf care excluding however physician services certain nurse practitioner and physician assistant services certified nursemidwife services qualified psychologist services services of certified registered nurse anesthetist certain dialysis services and drugs and in 1998 only the transportation costs of electrocardiogram equipment the federal per diem payment will cover routine service costs ancillary and capitalrelated costs but will not include costs associated with approved educational activities the actual per diem rate received by facility will include adjustments for casemix based on resident classification system established by the secretary to account for relative resource utilization of different patient types the laborrelated portion of the rate will also include budget neutral adjustments to reflect the relative level of wages and wagerelated costs for the geographic area in which the facility is located in the explanatory statement of the conference report on bba 97 conferees included intent language that the secretary develop for the new snf prospective payment system casemix adjusters that reflect the medication therapy needs of snf patients in developing these adjusters the secretary should consider the results of studies conducted by independent organizations including those which examine appropriate payment mechanisms for medication therapy under the snf prospective payment system note that intent language generally provides guidance on specific provisions and issues raised by statutory provisions in bills it does not have the force of law during transition period lasting through the three cost reporting periods beginning on or after july 1 1998 portion of the per diem payment to snf will be based on facilityspecific rate and the remaining portion on the federal rate for the first cost reporting period the facility specific percentage will be 75 and federal per diem percentage will be 25 for the second cost reporting period the facility specific percentage will be 50 and the federal 50 for the last period the facility specific percentage will be 25 and the federal 75 for beneficiary residing in snf or part of facility that includes snf but longer eligible for part snf care payments for part b covered services will have to be made to the facility whether or not the item or service was furnished by the facility by others under arrangement or under any other contracting or consulting arrangement this requirement is often referred to as the consolidated billing provision of the new law payments for part b services will be based on existing fee schedules for such services claims for part b items and services must include code identifying the items or services delivered in addition bills submitted by physicians must include the snfs provider number hospice care updates in payments and other amendments current law medicare covers hospice care in lieu of most other medicare benefits for terminally ill beneficiaries persons electing medicares hospice benefit are covered for four benefit periods two 90day periods subsequent 30day crs21 period and final period of unlimited duration payment for hospice care is based on one of four prospectively determined rates which correspond to four different levels of care hospices receive one of these rates for each day beneficiary is under the care of the hospice the four rate categories are routine home care continuous home care inpatient respite care and general inpatient care the prospective payment rates are updated annually by the hospital market basket mb covered hospice services include nursing care physical and occupational therapy and speech language pathology services medical social services home health aide services homemaker services medical supplies including drugs and biologicals and medical appliances physician services shortterm inpatient care including both respite care and procedures necessary for pain control and acute and chronic symptom management and counseling beneficiaries electing hospice waive coverage to most medicare services when the services they need are related to the terminal illness bba 97 bba 97 reduces the hospice payment update to market basket minus 1 percentage point for each of fy1998 through fy2002 the secretary is required to collect data from participating hospices on the costs of care they provide for each fiscal year beginning with fy1999 in addition effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 1997 hospices are required to submit claims on the basis of the location where service is actually furnished effective april 1 1998 bba 97 amends the definition for hospice care to include those services enumerated in current law as well as any other item or service which is specified in patients plan of care and which medicare may pay for effective on enactment bba 97 also 1 restructures hospice benefit periods to include two 90day periods followed by an unlimited number of 60day periods the medical director or physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary team will re certify at the beginning of the 60day periods that the beneficiary is terminally ill 2 deletes physician services from hospices core services and allows hospices to employ or contract with physicians for their services 3 allows the secretary to waive requirements with regard to hospices having to provide certain services so long as they are not located in urbanized areas and can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the secretary that they have been unable despite diligent efforts to recruit appropriate personnel for these hospices the secretary can waive specifically the provision of physical or occupational therapy or speechlanguage pathology services and dietary counseling 4 extends the limitation of liability protection to determinations that an individual is not terminally ill and 5 eliminates the specific time frame specified in statute for completion of physicians certifications for admission to hospice to require only that physicians certify that beneficiary is terminally ill at the beginning of the initial 90day period state and local government employees reduction in part medicare premium for certain public retirees current law almost all persons age 65 or over are

on the organizations past practices part b physicians and other practitioners establish single conversion factor and reform method for updating physician fees current law medicare pays for physicians services on the basis of fee schedule the fee schedule assigns relative values to services relative values reflect three factors physician work time skill and intensity involved in the service practice expenses and malpractice costs these relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in the costs of practicing medicine geographicallyadjusted relative values are converted into dollar payment amount by dollar figure known as the conversion factor there are three conversion factors one for surgical services one for primary care services and one for other services the conversion factors in 1997 are 4096 for surgical services 3577 for primary care services and 3385 for other services the conversion factors are updated each year by formula specified in the law the update equals inflation plus or minus actual spending growth in prior period crs24 compared to target known as the medicare volume performance standard mvps for example fy1995 data were used in calculating the calendar 1997 update however regardless of actual performance during base period there is 5 percentage point limit on the amount of the reduction there is limit on the amount of the

use actual data on equipment utilization and other key crs25 assumptions the secretary is required to transmit report to congress by march 1 1998 which will include an explanation of the data used and the methodology proposed rulemaking would have to be published by may 1 1998 hcfa is also directed to develop and implement resourcebased methodology for malpractice expenses by january 2000 dissemination of hospitalspecific peradmission relative values current law in general the law does not include specific limit on the number or mix of physicians services provided in connection with an inpatient hospital stay however the law does require that certain services provided in connection with surgery be included in global surgical package and not billed for separately bba 97 the secretary during 1999 and 2001 is required to determine for each hospital the hospitalspecific per admission relative value for the following year and whether this amount is projected to be excessive based on the 1998 national median of such values the secretary is required to notify the medical executive committee of subset of hospitals having been identified as having an excessive hospitalspecific relative value this would serve as notification only reduction in payments will be made direct payment to physician assistants nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists current law separate payments are made for nurse practitioner np services provided in collaboration with physician which are furnished in nursing facility recognized payments equal 85 of the physician fee schedule amount nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists cnss are paid directly for services provided in collaboration with physician in rural area payment equals 75 of the physician fee schedule amount for

pa may be in an independent contractor relationship with the physician the provisions are effective january 1 1998 crs26 chiropractic services current law medicare covers chiropractic treatment services however the coverage is limited to treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine in addition chiropractors services are covered only if the treatment is to correct subluxation ie misalignment demonstrated to exist by xray however program regulations do not permit medicare to pay for xrays either if performed by chiropractor or ordered by chiropractor bba 97 the xray requirement is eliminated effective january 1 2000 private contracts current law physicians are required to submit claims for services provided to their medicare patients and are subject to limits on amounts they can bill these patients the law has been interpreted to preclude situations under which physician or another health care professional who does not provide items and services under medicare could enter into private contract with medicare beneficiary for services for which medicare claim is to be submitted bba 97 bba permits private contracting under specified conditions contract must provide specified beneficiary protections it must be written and signed by the beneficiary before services are provided pursuant to the contract it can not be entered into at time when the beneficiary is facing an emergency or urgent health care situation the contract must also clearly indicate to the beneficiary that by signing the contract the beneficiary agrees not to submit medicare claim agrees to be responsible whether through insurance or otherwise for payments for services understands that medicare reimbursement will be provided acknowledges that medicare limiting charge limits apply understands that medigap plans do not and other supplemental insurance plans may elect not to make payments for such items and services and understands that the beneficiary has the right

to medicare beneficiary and will not receive any reimbursement for any such item or service for 2year period beginning on the date the affidavit is signed if physician or practitioner signing an affidavit knowingly and willfully submits medicare claim or receives medicare reimbursement for an item or service during such 2year period the ability to provide services under the private contract provision would not apply for the remainder of the period further the physician or practitioner could not receive medicare payments during such period payments for durable medical equipment updates in payments and other amendments current law durable medical equipment dme updates dme is reimbursed on the basis of fee schedule items are classified into five groups for purposes of determining the fee schedules and making payments 1 inexpensive or other crs27 routinely purchased equipment defined as items costing less than 150 or which are purchased at least 75 of the time 2 items requiring frequent and substantial servicing 3 customized items 4 oxygen and oxygen equipment and 5 other items referred to as capped rental items in general the fee schedules establish national payment limits for dme the limits have floors and ceilings the floor is equal to 85 of the weighted median of local payment amounts and the ceiling is equal to 100 of the weighted median of local payment amounts fee schedule amounts are updated annually by the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu medicare requires that the payment amount for covered dme be consistent with what is reasonable and medically necessary to serve the intended purpose additional expenses for upgraded or deluxe features or items which are rented or purchased for added convenience or other purposes do not meet the reasonableness test beneficiary wishing upgraded features must purchase the upgraded item and seek reimbursement from medicare for the basic item payment is based on the payment amount for the kind of item normally used to meet the intended purpose ie the standard item usually this is the least costly item b update for orthotics and prosthetics prosthetics and orthotics are paid according to fee schedule with principles similar to the dme fee schedule the fee schedule establishes regional payment limits for covered items the payment limits have floors and ceilings the floor is equal to 90 of the weighted average of regional payment amounts and the ceiling is 120 fee schedule amounts are updated annually by cpiu c payment freeze for parenteral and enteral nutrients pen supplies and equipment parenteral and enteral nutrients supplies and equipment are paid on the basis of the lowest reasonable charge levels at which items are widely and consistently available in the community bba 97 durable medical equipment dme updates bba 97 eliminates updates to the dme fee schedules for the period 1998 through 2002 in addition for oxygen and oxygen equipment the national payment limit is reduced by 25 in 1998 and an additional 5 in 1999 these reductions will continue to be reflected in payments for oxygen in subsequent years the secretary is authorized to create classes of oxygen equipment with differing payments so long as there is net increase in payments for home oxygen equipment the secretary is required to establish as soon as practicable service standards for home oxygen providers the secretary is also required to arrange with peer review organizations to evaluate access to and quality of home oxygen equipment gao is required to report to congress on access to oxygen equipment within 18 months of enactment in addition the secretary is authorized under bba 97 to issue regulations for upgraded dme under which an individual could purchase or rent upgraded dme suppliers of the upgraded item will be able to bill the medicare program for the basic or standard dme item and receive an additional payment from the beneficiary for the difference between the suppliers charge and medicares payment for the upgraded or enhanced feature purchases or rentals of upgraded items will not be effective until after the effective date of any regulations issued by the secretary crs28 b update for orthotics and prosthetics updates for prosthetics and orthotics are limited to 1 for each of the years 1998 through 2002 c payment freeze for parenteral and enteral nutrients pen supplies and equipment payments for pen are frozen at 1995 levels for the period 1998 through 2002 hospital outpatient departments opds payment for hospital outpatient departments opds current law medicares payment to hospital opds and hospitaloperated ambulatory surgical centers ascs for covered asc procedures is equal to the lesser of the following two amounts 1 the lower of the hospitals reasonable costs or customary charges less beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance or 2 blended amount comprised of cost portion and fee schedule portion net of beneficiary costsharing the cost portion of the blend is based on the lower of the hospitals costs or charges net of beneficiary cost sharing the fee schedule portion is based in part on ambulatory surgery center payment rates or the rates for radiology and diagnostic services in other settings net of beneficiary coinsurance for those settings the hospital cost portion and the fee schedule portion for surgical and radiology services are 42 and 58 respectively for diagnostic services the hospital cost portion is 50 and the fee schedule portion is 50 hospital may bill beneficiary for the coinsurance amount owed for the outpatient service provided the beneficiary coinsurance is based on 20 of the hospitals submitted charges for the outpatient service whereas medicare usually pays based on the blend of the hospitals costs and the amount paid in other settings for the same service this results in an anomaly whereby the amount beneficiary pays in coinsurance does not equal 20 of the programs payment and does not result in dollarfordollar decrease in medicare program payments on average beneficiaries pay 37 of the total payment hospital outpatient departments are paid for certain services on the basis of reasonable costs hospitals also receive payments for medicares share of capital costs associated with outpatient departments obra 93 extended 58 reduction for services paid on costrelated basis and 10 reduction in payments for capital costs through fy1998 bba 97 1 formula driven overpayment fdo for certain hospital outpatient services the bba 97 requires that beneficiary coinsurance amounts be deducted later in the reimbursement calculation for hospital outpatient services so that medicare payments for covered services are lower medicares payment for hospital outpatient services are equal to the blended amount less any amount the hospital may charge the beneficiary as coinsurance for services furnished during cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 1997 2 extension of reductions in payments for costs of hospital outpatient services the bba 97 extends the 58 reduction for those services paid on cost crs29 related basis and the 10 reduction for capitalrelated costs through fy1999 and during fy2000 before january 1 2000 3 prospective payment system pps for hospital outpatient department services the bba 97 requires the secretary to establish pps for covered opd services furnished beginning in 1999 the secretary is required to develop classification system for covered opd services so that services within each group are comparable clinically and with respect to the use of resources the secretary is required to establish relative payment rates for covered opd services using 1996 hospital claims and cost report data and to determine projections of the frequency of utilization of each service or group of services in 1999 the secretary is required to determine wage adjustment factor to adjust the portions of payment attributable to laborrelated costs for relative geographic differences in labor and laborrelated costs that are applied in budget neutral manner the secretary is required to establish other adjustments as necessary including adjustments to account for variations in coinsurance payments for procedures with similar resource costs and to ensure equitable payments under the system the secretary is also required to develop method for controlling unnecessary increases in the volume of covered opd services hospital opd coinsurance payments are limited to 20 of the national median of the charges for the service or services within the group furnished in 1996 updated to 1999 using the secretarys estimate of charge growth during this period the secretary is required to develop rules for the establishment of coinsurance payment amount for covered opd service not furnished during 1996 based on its classification within group of such services in addition the bba 97 provides for the entire fee schedule amount program payments plus beneficiary coinsurance payments to be updated by the market basket increase minus one percentage point for 2000 through 2002 and by the market basket percentage increase in subsequent years beneficiary coinsurance payments are to be subtracted from the fee schedule amount to determine medicare program payments these coinsurance payment provisions for covered opd services apply instead of the standard 20 coinsurance for other part b services the secretary is required to establish procedure under which hospital before the beginning of year starting with 1999 can elect to reduce the coinsurance payment for some or all covered opd services to an amount that is not less than 20 of the total medicare program plus beneficiary coinsurance payment amount for the service involved adjusted for relative differences in labor costs and other factors reduced coinsurance payment can not be further reduced or increased during the year involved and hospitals can disseminate information on the reduction of coinsurance amounts the secretary is authorized to periodically review and revise the groups relative payment weights wages and other adjustments to take into account changes in medical practice medical technology the addition of new services new cost data and other relevant information any adjustments made by the secretary must be made in budget neutral manner if the secretary determines that the volume of services paid for under this subsection increased beyond amounts established through those methodologies the secretary is authorized to adjust the update to the conversion factor otherwise applicable in subsequent year crs30 other providers ambulatory surgical centers ascs current law medicare pays for asc services on the basis of prospectively determined rates these rates are updated annually for inflation using the cpiu obra 1993 eliminated updates for ascs for fy1994 and fy1995 bba 97 the bba 97 reduces the annual update for asc fees by the cpiu minus 2 percentage points for each year between fy1998 and specifies that the update can not be less than zero payment for laboratory tests current law clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are paid on the basis of areawide fee schedules the law sets cap on payment amounts equal to 76 of the median of all fee schedules for the test the fee schedule amounts are updated by the percentage change in the cpi variations exist among carriers in rules governing requirements labs must meet in filing claims for payments bba 97 the law freezes the fee schedule update for the 1998 2002 period it lowers the cap to 74 of the median beginning in 1998 it also provides for study by the institute of medicine on medicare payments for lab services the study is to include review of the adequacy of the current methodology and recommendations regarding alternative payment systems bba 97 requires the secretary to divide the country into more than five regions and designate single carrier for each region to process lab claims excluding those for services provided to inpatients of hospitals and skilled nursing facilities later than july 1 1999 the allocation of claims to particular carrier would be based on whether the carrier serves the geographic area where the specimen is collected or other method selected by the secretary the requirement will not apply to those physicians office labs that the secretary determines would be unduly burdened by the application of billing responsibilities with respect to more than one carrier by january 1 1999 the secretary is required to adopt uniform coverage administration and payment policies for lab tests using negotiated rulemaking process the policies would be designed to eliminate variation among carriers and to simplify administrative requirements the provisions permit the use of interim regional policies in cases where uniform national policy has not been established payment for ambulance services current law payment for ambulance services provided by freestanding suppliers is based on reasonable charge screens while hospital or other providerbased ambulance services are paid on reasonable cost basis bba 97 bba 97 specifies that the reasonable cost and charge limits will apply through 1999 with annual increases equal to the cpi minus one percentage point fee schedule will be implemented january 1 2000 the aggregate amount of payments in 2000 can not exceed what would be paid if the interim reductions remained in effect in that year annual increases in subsequent years will equal the cpi increase except that in 2001 and 2002 there will be 1 percentage point crs31 reduction the secretary may require the use of uniform coding system assignment is mandated beginning january 1 2000 coverage is provided for advanced life support services provided by paramedic intercept service providers in rural areas under contract with one or more volunteer ambulance services payment for drugs current law medicare does not pay for most outpatient prescription drugs the program will however pay for certain drugs including drugs used in connection with home infusion or inhalation equipment drugs prescribed for dialysis or transplant patients and certain oral cancer drugs payment for drugs is based on the lower of the estimated acquisition cost or the national average wholesale price payment may also be made as part of reasonable cost or prospective payment bba 97 bba 97 provides that in any case where payment is not made on cost or prospective payment basis the payment will equal 95 of the average wholesale price the secretary is authorized to pay dispensing fee to pharmacies further the secretary is required to study the effect of the provision on average wholesale prices bba 97 authorizes coverage for an acute oral antiemetic antinausea drug used as part of an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen it would have to be administered by or as prescribed by physician for use immediately before at or within

clinic rhc services current law medicare establishes payment limits for rhc services provided by independent rhcs rhcs among other requirements must have appropriate procedures for utilization review of clinic services the secretary is required to waive the rhc requirement for certain staffing of health professionals if the clinic has been unable to hire physician assistant nurse practitioner or certified nursemidwife in the previous 90day period the secretary is prohibited from granting waiver to facility if the request for the waiver is made less than 6 months after the date of the expiration of previous waiver of the facility rhcs are required to be located in health professional shortage area for rhcs that are in operation and subsequently fail to meet the requirement of being located in health professional shortage area the secretary would be required to continue to consider the facility to meet the health professions shortage area requirement bba 97 the bba 97 applies pervisit payment limit to all rhcs other than such clinics in rural hospitals with less than 50 beds rhcs are required to have quality assessment and performance improvement program in addition to appropriate procedures for utilization review the waiver on the staffing requirement to provide waiver if the facility could not meet the requirement of having nurse practitioner physician assistant or certified nursemidwife available 50 of the time the clinic operates is only available to clinics once they are certified shortage designations for rhcs are required to be reviewed every 3 years in addition the shortage area requirement is amended to require that rhcs must be located in an area in which there are insufficient numbers of needed health care practitioners as determined by the secretary operating rhcs that subsequently fail to meet the requirement of being crs32 located in health professional shortage area can continue to be considered to meet the health professional shortage requirement but only when under criteria established by the secretary in regulations the rhcs are determined to be essential to the delivery of primary care services that are otherwise unavailable in the geographic area served by the clinic the secretary is required to issue final regulations implementing the grandfathered clinics that take effect later than january 1 1999 the bba 97 also provides for the direct payment to physician assistants pas for any pa services provided at an rhc that is principally owned as determined by the secretary by pa as of the date of enactment

premiums current law the 1997 part b premium is 4380 when medicare was established in 1965 the part b monthly premium was intended to equal 50 of program costs the remainder was to be financed by federal general revenues ie tax dollars legislation enacted in 1972 limited the annual percentage increase in the premium to the same percentage by which social security benefits were adjusted for the costofliving ie costofliving or cola adjustments as result revenues crs34 dropped to below 25 of program costs in the early 1980s since the early 1980s congress has regularly voted to set the premium equal to 25 of costs under current law the 25 provision is extended through 1998 the cola limitation would again apply in 1999 bba 97 the agreement permanently sets the part b premium at 25 of program

medigap enrollment current law medigap is the term used to describe individuallypurchased medicare supplement policies in 1990 congress provided for standardization of medigap policies the intention was to enable consumers to better understand policy choices implementing regulations generally limit the number of different types of medigap plans that can be sold in state to more than 10 standard benefit plans these are known as plans through j the plan standardized package covers basic benefits package each of the other nine plans includes the basic benefits plus different combination of additional benefits all insurers offering medigap policies are required to offer 6month open enrollment period for persons turning age 65 this is known as guaranteed open enrollment there is guaranteed open enrollment provision for the under65 disabled population at the time insurers sell medigap policy whether or not during an open enrollment period they are permitted to limit or exclude coverage for services related to preexisting health condition such exclusions cannot be imposed for more than 6 months an individual who has met the preexisting condition limitation in one medigap policy does not have to meet the requirement under new policy for previously covered benefits however an insurer could impose exclusions for newly covered benefits federal requirements for open enrollment and limits on preexisting condition exclusions are designed to insure beneficiaries have access to medigap protection however persons who disenroll or wish to disenroll from managed care plans and move back into feeforservice medicare may not have the same access to medigap coverage as those who join during the open enrollment period bba 97 the law guarantees issuance of specified medigap policies without preexisting condition exclusion for certain continuously enrolled individuals the insurer is prohibited from discriminating in the pricing of such policy on the basis of the individuals health status claims experience receipt of health care or medical condition the guaranteed issuance is extended to the following persons provided they enroll within 63 days of termination of other enrollment i an individual enrolled under an employee welfare benefit plan that provides benefits supplementing medicare and the plan terminates or ceases to provide such benefits ii person enrolled with medicarechoice organization who discontinues enrollment under circumstances permitting disenrollment other than during an annual election period these include 1 the termination of the entitys certification 2 the individual moves outside of the entitys service area or 3 the individual elects termination due to cause crs39 iii an individual enrolled with an hmo and enrollment ceases for the reasons noted above iv an individual enrolled under medigap policy and enrollment ceases because 1 of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the issuer or because of other involuntary termination of coverage and there is provision under applicable state law for the continuation of such coverage or 2 the issuer substantially violates material provision or 3 the issuer materially misrepresented the policys provisions v an individual who 1 was enrolled under medigap policy 2 subsequently terminates such enrollment and enrolls with medicarechoice organization risk or cost contract hmo similar organization operating under demonstration project authority or medicare select policy and 3 terminates such enrollment during any period within the first 12 months during which the individual is permitted to terminate enrollment but only if the individual was never previously enrolled with such an entity vi an individual who upon first becoming eligible for medicare at age 65 enrolls in medicarechoice plan and disenrolls from such plan within 12 months the guaranteed issue is generally for policy b c of f these four policy types account for an estimated threefourths of new medigap sales however 1 for persons described in v it refers to the same policy in which the person was previously enrolled and 2 for persons described in vi it is for any medigap policy at the time of the event which resulted in the cessation of enrollment or loss of coverage the organization insurer or plan administrator whichever was appropriate would have to notify the individual of his or her rights and the obligations of issuers of medigap policies bba 97 prohibits the imposition of preexisting exclusion period for persons who on the date of application have at least six months of creditable coverage specifically such an exclusion can not be imposed on an individual who on the date of application has continuous period of at least 6 months of health insurance coverage defined as creditable coverage under the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa if the individual has less than 6 months coverage the policy would have to reduce the period of any preexisting exclusion by the aggregate of periods of creditable coverage applicable to the individual as of the enrollment date the rules used to determine the reduction would be based on rules used under hipaa bba 97 provides for high deductible medigap plans specifically it adds 2 plan types to the current list of 10 standard medigap plans these will offer the benefit package of either plan f or plan j except for the high deductible feature the high deductible is 1500 in 1998 and 1999 increased by the cpi in subsequent years the beneficiary would be responsible for expenses up to this amount payments for persons receiving care at military facilities current law medicare generally is barred from making payments for services furnished paid for or authorized by governmental entity thus medicare does not pay for services provided to military retirees at department of defense dod facilities crs40 bba 97 bba 97 authorizes 3year demonstration project at six sites under which beneficiaries would be able to enroll in the dod tricare managed care program or continue to use military treatment facilities on space available basis beneficiaries could also receive services through medicarechoice plan payments will equal 95 of what would be paid to medicarechoice organization for that individual the agreement provides for detailed study by the gao bba 97 does not provide for veterans affairs va demonstration however it does require the secretary of hhs and va to jointly submit to congress detailed implementation plan for subvention demonstration project for veterans the plan must be submitted within 12 months of the start of the project for military retirees home health services payment reform current law medicare reimburses home health agencies on retrospective costbased basis this means that agencies are paid after services are delivered for the reasonable costs as defined by the program they have incurred for the care they provide to program beneficiaries up to certain limits cost limits are determined separately for each type of covered home health service skilled nursing care physical therapy speech pathology occupational therapy medical social services and home health aide and according to whether an agency is located in an urban or rural area cost limits however are applied to aggregate agency payments that is an aggregate cost limit is set for each agency that equals the agencys limit for each type of service multiplied by the number of visits of each type provided by the agency limits for the individual services are set at 112 of the mean laborrelated and nonlabor per visit costs for freestanding agencies ie agencies not affiliated with hospitals to reflect differences in wage levels from area to area the laborrelated portion of service limit is adjusted by the current hospital wage index cost limits are updated annually by applying mbi to base year data derived from home health agency cost reports costbased reimbursement for home health care has been criticized as providing few incentives for maximizing efficiency minimizing costs or controlling volume of services it is cited as one of the reasons for the significant growth in home health spending since 1989 spending has increased from 25 billion in 1989 to 181 billion in 1996 for an average annual rate of growth of 33 most of the growth in spending has been the result of an increasing volume of services being covered under the program both in terms of increases in the numbers of users as well as the number of covered visits per user in provisions contained in the orphan drug act of 1983 obra 87 and obra 90 congress required the secretary to develop alternative methods for paying for home health care on prospective basis in 1994 the office of research and demonstration in hcfa completed demonstration project that tested prospective payment on per visit basis preliminary analysis indicates that the per visit prospective payment methodology had effect on cost per visit or volume of visits hcfa has begun second project referred to as phase ii to test prospective payment on per episode basis and has also undertaken research to develop home crs41 health casemix adjustor that would translate patients varying service needs into specific reimbursement rates bba 97 the secretary is required to establish prospective payment system pps for home health and implement the system beginning october 1 1999 all services covered and paid on reasonable cost basis at the time of enactment of bba 97 including medical supplies must be paid on prospective basis for the new prospective system the secretary will consider an appropriate unit of service and the number type and duration of visits provided within that unit potential changes in the mix of services provided within that unit and their cost and general system design that provides for continued access to quality services all home health care agencies will be paid according to the pps in implementing the system the secretary can provide for transition of not longer than 4 years during which portion of the payment will be based on agencyspecific costs but only if aggregate payments are not greater than they would have been if transition had not occurred under the new system the secretary will compute standard prospective payment amount or amounts that will initially be based on the most current audited cost report data available to the secretary for fy2000 payment amounts under the prospective system must be computed in such way that total payments will equal amounts that would have been paid had the system not been in effect but will also reflect 15 reduction in cost limits and per beneficiary limits in effect september 30 1999 to assure savings from this reduction the secretary will be required to reduce cost limits and per beneficiary limits in effect september 30 1999 by 15 even if the secretary is not prepared to implement the new system on october 1 the payment amount for unit of home health service will be adjusted by case mix adjustor factor established by the secretary to explain significant amount of the variation in the cost of different units of service the laborrelated portion of the payment amount will be adjusted by an area wage adjustment factor that reflects the relative level of wages and wagerelated costs in particular geographic area as compared to the national average claims for home health services furnished on or after october 1 1998 will have to contain an appropriate identifier for the physician prescribing home health services or certifying the need for care claims will also be required to include information on the length of time of service unit as measured in 15 minute increments the categories of services for which time information must be included on claim are skilled nursing care therapies physical and occupational therapy and speech language pathology medical social services and home health aide services in order for home health services to be considered covered care home health care agencies will be required to submit claims for all services and all payments will have to be made to home health agency without regard to whether or not the item or service was furnished by the agency by others under arrangement or under any other contacting or consulting arrangement interim payments for home health services current law limits on reimbursements for home health exist only in terms of per visit cost limits that are applied to aggregate agency payments that is an crs42 aggregate cost limit is set for each agency that equals the agencys limit for each type of service multiplied by the number of visits of each type provided by the agency the per visit limits are set at 112 of the mean laborrelated and nonlabor per visit costs for freestanding agencies ie agencies not affiliated with hospitals the limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july 1 of given year and ending june 30 of the following year these limits do not constrain the volume of visits reimbursed home health agencies are paid for every medically necessary visit they provide up to their aggregate cost limit as noted above most of the growth in home health spending has been the result of an increasing volume of services covered by the program both in terms of increasing numbers of users and especially an increasing number of covered visits per person served the number of persons served with home health per 1000 enrollees almost doubled between 1989 and 1996 increasing from 50 in 1989 to 99 in 1996 average number of visits per person served increased from 27 in 1989 to 76 in 1996 an increase of 181 percent increasing costs for home health visits have accounted for comparatively little spending growth payments per visit increased at relatively low rate rising from 54 per visit in 1989 to 62 in 1996 15 percent increase for the period bba 97 prior to implementation of the new home health pps per visit cost limits will be reduced to 105 of the national median of laborrelated and nonlabor costs for freestanding home health agencies effective for costreporting periods beginning october 1 1997 in effect delaying the cycle for updating the limits in addition home health agencies for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 1997 and through september 30 1999 when the new home health pps should go into effect will be paid the lesser of 1 their actual costs ie allowable reasonable costs 2 the per visit limits reduced to 105 of the national median applied in the aggregate or 3 new blended agencyspecific per beneficiary annual limit applied to the agencys unduplicated census count of patients the blended per beneficiary limit will be based 75 on an agencys own costs per beneficiary and 25 on the average cost per beneficiary for agencies in the same census region adjusted for differences in labor costs these costs will be calculated from cost reports for cost reporting periods ending in fy1994 recognizing 98 of reasonable costs for that period and updating them by the home health market basket the costs associated with nonroutine medical supplies would be included in this calculation for new providers and those providers without 12month cost reporting period ending in fy1994 the per beneficiary limit will equal the median of these limits or the secretarys best estimates applied to home health agencies home health agencies that have altered their corporate structure or name will not be considered new providers for these purposes for beneficiaries using more than one home health agency the per beneficiary limitation will be prorated among the agencies with the per beneficiary limit home health agencies will for the first time face constraints on the volume of services they provide medicare beneficiaries the per beneficiary limit of given dollar amount eg 5000 represents in general sense the product of the average cost of all visits and the average number of visits provided to medicare beneficiaries the actual per beneficiary limit that applies to given crs43 agency of course will be blended amount of its own experience 75 and the regions experience 25 for cost reporting periods ending in fy1994 with costs updated by the home health market basket the 7525 blend is intended to decrease the cost experience disparity among agencies by slightly increasing the cap for agencies in each region with low historical costs and by slightly decreasing the cap for agencies in each region with high historical costs note that this per beneficiary limit eg 5000 is not applied to each individual beneficiary served by the home health agency but rather to its unduplicated count of medicare patients this means that the actual limit faced by the agency is determined by multiplying an agencys per beneficiary limit by the number of people served by that agency as result agencies can serve beneficiaries who cost more than the per beneficiary cap so long as they also serve persons who cost less to continue the example of an agency with per beneficiary cap of 5000 if this agency served 3 medicare beneficiaries in year and two beneficiaries cost 6000 each and the third 3000 the agency would not exceed its limit since the sum of its cost for these three patients 15000 is the same as its limit 3 x 5000 the secretary will be required to establish the per visit limits in effect for fy1998 by january 1 1998 and the per beneficiary limits by april 1 1998 for subsequent fiscal years beginning october 1 the secretary will be required to establish limits by the prior august 1 furthermore the secretary is required to expand research on pps for home health that ties prospective payments to unit of service including an intensive effort to develop reliable case mix adjuster that explains significant amount of variance in cost the secretary is authorized to require all home health agencies to submit additional information that is necessary for the development of reliable casemix system effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 1997 extend savings from home health cost limits freeze current law home health limits are updated annually the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 93 required that there be updates in home health cost limits including adjustments for changes in the wage index or other updates of data for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july 1 1994 and before july 1 1996 bba 97 the secretary in establishing home health limits for cost reporting periods beginning after september 30 1997 will be required to capture the savings stream resulting from the obra 93 freeze of home health limits by not allowing for the market basket updates to the limits that occurred during the cost reporting periods july 1 1994 through june 30 1996 in granting exemptions or exceptions to the cost limits the secretary can not consider the provision for recapturing savings from the obra 93 freeze clarification of parttime or intermittent nursing care current law both parts and b of medicare cover home health visits for persons who need skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis or physical therapy or speech therapy once beneficiaries qualify for the benefit the program covers part time or intermittent nursing care provided by or under the supervision of registered crs44 nurse and parttime or intermittent home health aide services among other services coverage guidelines issued by hcfa have defined parttime and intermittent bba 97 effective for services furnished on or after october 1 1997 medicare statute will include definitions for parttime and intermittent skilled nursing and home health aide services for purposes of receiving skilled nursing and home health aide services parttime or intermittent is defined as skilled nursing and home health aide services furnished any number of days per week as long as they were furnished combined less than 8 hours each day and 28 or fewer hours each week or subject to review on casebycase basis as to the need for care less than 8 hours each day and 35 or fewer hours per week for purposes of qualifying for medicares home health benefit because of need for intermittent skilled nursing care intermittent is defined as skilled nursing care that is either provided or needed on fewer than 7 days each week or less than 8 hours of each day for periods of 21 days or less with extensions in exceptional circumstances when the need for additional care was finite and predictable study on definition of homebound current law in order to be eligible for home health care medicare beneficiary must be confined to his or her home the law specifies that this homebound requirement is met when the beneficiary has condition that restricts the ability of the individual to leave home except with the assistance of another individual or with the aid of supportive device such as crutches cane wheelchair or walker or if the individual has condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated the law further specifies that while an individual does not have to be bedridden to be considered confined to home the condition of the individual should be such that there exists normal inability to leave home that leaving home requires considerable and taxing effort by the individual and that absences from home are infrequent or of relatively short duration or are attributable to the need to receive medical treatment bba 97 the secretary of health and human services is required to conduct study on the criteria that should be applied for determining whether an individual should be considered homebound for purposes of qualifying for medicares home health benefit the criteria should include the extent and circumstances under which person may be absent from the home but nonetheless qualify the secretary is required to report to congress by october 1 1998 and make specific recommendations on such criteria payment based on location where home health service is furnished current law some home health agencies are established with the home office in an urban area and branch offices in rural areas payment is based on where the service is billed in this case the urban area with its higher wage rate even if the service had been delivered in rural area bba 97 effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 1997 home health agencies will be required to submit claims on the basis of the location where service is actually furnished crs45 normative standards for home health claims denials current law as long as they remain eligible home health users are entitled to unlimited number of visits bba 97 effective for services furnished on or after october 1 1997 the secretary is required to establish normative guidelines for the frequency and duration of home health services payments will be denied for visits that exceed the normative standards the secretary is also authorized to establish process for notifying physician when the number of home health visits furnished according to prescription or certification of the physician significantly exceeds the threshold normative guidelines the secretary may adjust thresholds to reflect demonstrated differences in the need for home health services among different beneficiaries home health benefits based solely on drawing blood current law in order to qualify for medicares home health benefit person must be homebound and be in need of intermittent skilled nursing care or physical or speech therapy once person qualifies for home health they become entitled to all covered home health services in 1989 the health care financing administration published revised manual instructions that clarified the criteria which must be met for medicare coverage of home health services these instructions specified that skilled nursing services that qualified person for home health included among other things venipuncture the drawing of blood specimen bba 97 bba 97 clarifies that person can not qualify for medicares home health benefit on the basis of needing skilled nursing care for venipuncture for the purpose of obtaining blood sample note that for persons needing only blood draw medicare will pay clinical lab to travel to homebound beneficiarys home to obtain the specimen section 1833h3 this service is covered as clinical lab test as clinical lab test the blood draw does not entitle the beneficiary to any other service also note that persons who had been receiving home health services on the basis of needing blood draw may continue to qualify if they demonstrate need for other skilled nursing or therapy services transfer of some of the home health benefit to part b current law both parts and b of medicare cover home health neither part of the program applies deductibles or coinsurance to covered visits and beneficiaries are entitled to an unlimited number of visits as long as they meet eligibility criteria section 1833d of medicare law prohibits payments to be made under part b for covered services to the extent that individuals are also covered under part for the same services as result the comparatively few persons who have part coverage are the only beneficiaries for whom payments are made under part b bba 97 bba 97 gradually transfers from part to part b home health visits that are not part of the first 100 visits following beneficiarys stay in hospital or snf ie postinstitutional visits and during home health spell of illness the transfer will be phasedin over period of 6 years between 1998 and 2003 with the secretary transferring onesixth of the aggregate expenditures associated with transferred visits in 1998 twosixths in 1999 threesixths in 2000 foursixths in 2001 fivesixths in 2002 and sixsixths in 2003 beginning january 1 2003 part crs46 will cover only postinstitutional home health services for up to 100 visits during home health spell of illness except for those persons with part coverage only who will be covered for services without regard to the postinstitutional limitation the increase in the part b premium attributable to transferred expenditures will be phased in over period of 7 years between 1998 and 2004 for 1998 the part b premium will be increased by oneseventh of the extra costs due to the transfer for 1999 the part b premium will be increased by twosevenths of the extra costs for 2000 threesevenths for 2001 foursevenths for 2002 fivesevenths for 2003 six sevenths and for 2004 the total of the extra costs due to the transfer cbo has estimated that the extra monthly part b premium costs attributable to the transfer are 270 for 1999 410 for 2000 590 for 2001 810 for 2002 1040 for 2003 and 1270 for 2004 postinstitutional home health services are defined for these purposes as services furnished to medicare beneficiary 1 after an inpatient hospital or rural primary care hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days initiated within 14 days after discharge or 2 after stay in snf initiated within 14 days after discharge home health spell of illness is defined as the period beginning when patient first receives postinstitutional home health services and ending when the beneficiary had not received inpatient hospital snf or home health services for 60 days claims administration for transferred visits will continue to be done by part fiscal intermediaries in addition bba 97 lowers the hearing threshold from 500 to 100 for home health services covered under part b in related medicaid provisions states will receive allotments to cover under their medicaid programs that portion of the medicare part b premium attributable to the transfer of visits to part b for medicare beneficiaries with incomes between 135 and 175 of poverty the federal government will pay 100 of these costs just so long as state does not exceed its allotment see assistance for lowincome above bba 97 also includes provision requiring the secretary not later than october 1 1997 to report to the commerce ways and means and finance committees on an estimate of medicare home health outlays under parts and b during each of fy1998 through fy2002 not later than the end of each of the years 1999 through 2002 the secretary is also required to submit report that compares actual outlays with estimated outlays if the secretary finds for fiscal year that actual outlays were greater than estimated outlays the report is also required to include recommendations regarding beneficiary copayments or such other methods as will reduce the growth in outlays for medicare home health services integrated acute and longterm care programs extension of certain demonstration programs current law at various times over the years congress has required the secretary to grant waivers of certain medicare and medicaid requirements for certain demonstration programs one of these projects known as the programs of all inclusive care for the elderly or pace projects provide health and longterm care services on capitated basis to frail elderly persons at risk of institutionalization crs47 another demonstration social health maintenance organizations shmos provides integrated health and limited longterm care services on prepaid capitation basis to medicare beneficiaries its waivers expire at the end of 1997 two other projects the municipal health services demonstration project and the community nursing organization demonstration also have expiring waivers bba 97 bba 97 includes provisions to establish pace as permanent benefit category under medicare and an optional benefit under medicaid states are permitted to limit under their medicaid programs the number of persons enrolled in pace programs waivers for shmos are extended through december 31 2000 and the number of persons who can be served per site is expanded from 12000 to 36000 the municipal health services demonstration is extended through december 31 2000 and the community nursing organization demonstration for 2 years program administration management initiatives medicare secondary payer current law generally medicare is the primary payer that is it pays health claims first with an individuals private or other public plan filling in some or all of the coverage gaps in certain cases the individuals other coverage pays first while medicare is the secondary payer this is known as the medicare secondary payer msp program the msp provisions apply to group health plans for the working aged large group health plans for the disabled and employer health plans regardless of size for the endstage renal disease esrd population the msp provisions for the disabled expire october 1 1998 the msp provisions for the esrd population apply for 12 months except the period is extended to 18 months for the february 1 1991october 1 1998 period the law authorizes data match program which is intended to identify potential secondary payer situations medicare beneficiaries are matched against data contained in the social security administration and internal revenue service files to identify cases where working beneficiary or working spouse may have employerbased health insurance coverage recent court action has made recoveries more difficult in certain cases bba 97 the provisions relating to the disabled and the data match program are made permanent the application of the msp provisions for the esrd population is extended to 30months this will apply to items and services furnished on or after enactment with respect to periods beginning on or after the date that is 18 months prior to enactment the provision also clarifies medicares recovery authority it permits recovery of msp incorrect payments within 3 years of the date of service it also permits recovery of msp incorrect payments from thirdparty administrators of primary plans this recovery provision would not apply in cases where the thirdparty administrator would not be able to recover from the employer or plan due to insolvency or bankruptcy or where the thirdparty administrator is not employed by or under contract with the employer or group health plan at the time the recovery action is initiated crs48 competitive bidding current lawmedicare does not use competitive bidding for the selection of providers authorized to provide covered services to beneficiaries bba 97 the law requires the secretary to implement five competitive bidding demonstration projects under each project up to 3 competitive acquisition areas in each project are to be established for furnishing part b services except for physicians services different areas could be established for different classes of items and services at least one demonstration project will include oxygen and oxygen equipment the secretary will conduct competition among individuals and entities supplying items and services for each acquisition area the secretary can not award contract unless the secretary finds that the entity meets quality standards the secretary is authorized to limit the number of contractors in an area to the number needed to meet projected demand payment can not be made in competitive acquisition area to noncontracting entity unless the secretary finds that the expenses are incurred in case of urgent need or other circumstances specified by the secretary the secretary is required to evaluate the projects the secretary could expand project to additional competitive acquisition areas if the secretary determines based on the evaluations that there is clear evidence that project results in reduced federal expenditures and does not have an adverse impact on access diversity of product selection and quality commissions medicare payment advisory commission current law the prospective payment assessment commission propac is charged with reporting each year its recommendation of an update factor for pps hospital payment rates and for other changes in reimbursement policy it is also required each year to submit report to congress which provides background information on trends in health care delivery and financing the physician payment review commission pprc makes recommendations to congress concerning physician payments it is also charged with additional responsibilities relating to the medicare and medicaid programs as well as the health care system more generally bba 97 the law replaces propac and pprc with 15member medicare payment advisory commission medpac the commission is charged with specific review responsibilities for both medicarechoice and the feeforservice system ffs and is required to make recommendations to congress concerning payment policies under medicare establishment of commissions to address longterm issues current law provision bba 97 the law establishes 17member national bipartisan commission on the future of medicare four members are to be appointed by the president six members are to be appointed by the speaker of the house in consultation with the minority leader of whom more than 4 are of the same party six members are to be appointed by the majority leader of the senate in consultation with the minority leader of whom more than 4 are of the same party and one member crs49 who will serve as chairman will be jointly appointed by the president speaker and majority leader the commission is required to review the longterm financial condition of medicare identify problems that threaten the financial integrity of the trust funds including the financial impact of the increase in the number of beneficiaries that will occur with the baby boom and the extent to which current update indexes do not accurately reflect inflation and analyze potential solutions it is required to make recommendations concerning the following issues 1 restoring financial solvency and integrity 2 establishing an appropriate financial structure for the program as whole 3 establishing the appropriate balance of benefits and beneficiary contributions 4 financing graduate medical education gme 5 whether the eligibility age should be modified to conform to that applicable to social security 6 the feasibility of allowing those between age 62 and the medicare eligibility age to buy into the program 7 impact of chronic disease and disability trends on the future costs and quality of services under the current system and 8 time periods during which recommendations in 1 3 should be implemented it is further required to make recommendations concerning comprehensive approach to preserve the program the commission is to be appointed by december 1 1997 it is to submit report by march 1 1999 the report is to include only those detailed recommendations findings and conclusions of the commission that receive approval of at least 11 members of the commission fraud and abuse current law federal penalties for fraudulent activities in health care include civil and criminal penalties as well as permissive and mandatory exclusions from federal health care programs programrelated antifraud provisions are generally found in title xi of the social security act and these provisions are reinforced by general federal health care criminal provisions in title 18 of the united states code recent additions to antifraud efforts enacted by title ii of the health insurance portability and accountability act include new fraud and abuse control program to coordinate federal state and local law enforcement efforts against fraud in federal and private health care programs new medicare integrity program providing for contracting with private entities for audits and other provider review activities beneficiary incentive program to encourage individuals to report fraudulent activities against federal health care programs national health care fraud and abuse data collection program containing reports of final adverse actions against health care providers suppliers and practitioners and written advisory opinions to be issued by the secretary of hhs regarding whether proposed business transactions violate anti kickback restrictions bba 97 the bba 97 strengthens fraud and abuse civil and criminal penalties and increases efforts to combat fraud and abuse in several ways three strikes and youre out provision is added excluding provider from federal health care programs for 10 years for second fraudrelated offense and permanently excluding provider from federal heath care programs for third offense the secretary is given authority to bar felons from participation in federal health care programs and to exclude entities crs50 controlled by family member of sanctioned individual to impose new civil money penalties for persons who contract with an excluded provider to require surety bonds of at least 50000 for certain medicare providers such as home health care providers durable medical equipment providers and rehabilitation agencies as condition of participation in medicare after january 1 1998 to require surety bonds of at least 50000 for home health agencies and durable medical equipment suppliers under the medicaid program as of january 1 1998 and to impose civil money penalty on health plans that fail to report adverse actions under the health care data collection program in addition beneficiary may request an itemized bill for medicare services tollfree telephone number will be included in beneficiary explanation of benefits forms to report fraud and abuse written advisory opinions may be requested concerning whether certain physician selfreferrals are prohibited under federal law further hospital discharge planning evaluations must include information on the availability of medicare home health services as well as information on the hospitals financial interest in any such agencies the new provisions also require gao to submit its first report on the new medicare fraud and abuse control program 2 years earlier than scheduled and the definition of reasonable costs of medical services under medicare has been clarified medicarechoice under current law persons enrolling in medicare have two basic coverage options they may elect to obtain services through the traditional feeforservice system under which program payments are made for each service rendered under section 1876 of the social security act they may also elect to enroll with managed care organization which has entered into payment agreement with medicare three types of managed care organizations are authorized to contract with medicare an entity that has risk contract with medicare an entity that has cost contract with medicare or health care prepayment plan hcpp that has cost contract to provide medicare part b services riskcontracts are frequently referred to as tefra risk contracts and cost contracts are frequently referred to as tefra cost contracts tefra refers to the 1982 legislation the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 which established the rules governing these types of contracts beneficiary in an area served by an hmo or competitive medical plan cmp with medicare risk contract may voluntarily choose to enroll in the organization cmp is health plan that is not federally qualified hmo but that meets specific medicare requirements medicare makes single monthly capitation payment for each of its enrollees called the adjusted average per capita cost or aapcc discussed below in return the entity agrees to provide or arrange for the full range of medicare services through an organized system of affiliated physicians hospitals and other providers in general the beneficiary must obtain all covered services through the hmo or cmp except in emergencies the beneficiary may be charged the usual costsharing charges or pay the equivalent in the form of monthly premium to the organization in 1995 risk plans were authorized to offer pointofservice options pos in which enrollees can go out of plan for services with cost sharing responsibilities varying with the choice of provider the highest cost sharing associated with the use of nonnetwork providers crs51 beneficiaries are expected to share in any of the hmoscmps projected cost savings between medicares capitation payment and what it would cost the organization to provide medicare benefits to its commercial enrollees through the provision of additional benefits it could also return the savings to medicare beneficiaries may also enroll in organizations with tefra cost contracts these entities must meet essentially the same conditions of participation as risk contractors however they may have as few as 1500 enrollees rather than 5000 to qualify under cost contract medicare pays the actual cost the entity incurs in furnishing covered services less the estimated value of beneficiary costsharing third type of managed care arrangement is the hcpp hcpp arrangement is similar to tefra costcontract except that it provides only part b services further there are specific statutory conditions to qualify for hcpp contract any medicare beneficiary residing in the area served by an hmocmp may enroll with two exceptions the first exception applies to beneficiaries not enrolled in part b the second exception applies to persons qualifying for medicare on the basis of endstage renal disease esrd however persons already enrolled who later develop esrd may remain enrolled in the entity the hmocmp must have an annual open enrollment period of at least 30 days duration during this period it must accept beneficiaries in the order in which they apply up to the limits of its capacity unless to do so would lead to violation of the rule requiring hmos to have more than 50 of their enrollees as medicare medicaid beneficiaries or to an enrolled population unrepresentative of the population in the area served by the hmo an enrollee may request termination of his or her enrollment at any time an individual may file disenrollment requests directly with the hmo or at the local social security office disenrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following the month during which the request is filed the hmo may not disenroll or refuse to re enroll beneficiary on the basis of health status or need for health services the secretary is authorized to prescribe procedures and conditions under which eligible organizations contracting with medicare may inform beneficiaries about the organization brochures applications forms or other promotional or informational material may be distributed only after review and approval by the secretary of hhs hmos may not disenroll or refuse to reenroll beneficiary because of health status or need for health care services hmos must provide enrollees at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter an explanation of rights to benefits restrictions on services provided through nonaffiliated providers outofarea coverage coverage of emergency and urgently needed services and appeal rights terminating hmo must arrange for supplementary coverage for medicare enrollees for the duration of any preexisting condition exclusion under their successor coverage for the lesser of 6 months or the duration of the exclusion period provider sponsored organizations psos and preferred provider organizations ppos that are not organized under the laws of state and are neither federally qualified hmo or cmp are not eligible to contract with medicare under the risk contract program pso is generally cooperative venture of group of providers crs52 who control its delivery and financial arrangements ppos are generally groups of physicians and hospitals who contract with an insurer or employer to serve group of enrollees on feeforservice basis at negotiated rates that are lower than those charged to nonenrollees ppos do not traditionally have primary care gatekeepers enrollees in risk contract hmos have the same balance billing protections as beneficiaries under medicare ffs so long as they do not obtain unauthorized services from provider that is not part of the hmos network under current medicare ffs participating physicians agree to accept medicares payment amount as payment in full they can only bill patients for the coinsurance and any unmet deductible physicians who are not participating physicians in the medicare program and not accepting medicares payment as payment in full can bill beneficiaries only 15 above medicares recognized payment amount7 the amount in excess of medicares recognized payment amount in known as balance billing balance billing limits do not apply to certain services eg durable medical equipment as noted above risk contract hmo agrees to provide or arrange for the full scope of covered medicare services in return for single monthly capitation payment issued by medicare for each enrolled beneficiary the aapcc the aapcc is medicares estimate of 95 of the average per capita amount it would spend for given beneficiary classified by certain demographic characteristics and county of residence who was not enrolled in an hmo and who obtained services on the usual feeforservice basis the aapccs are calculated from medicares feeforservice expenditures in county as result the aapccs include amounts that medicare pays to hospitals in an area for indirect medical education ime and direct medical education dme costs and for providing care to disproportionate share of lowincome beneficiaries ie the disproportionate share adjustment or dsh these amounts may not correspond with actual risk plan costs however because not all such plans have medical education programs or use teaching or dsh hospitals medicarechoice plan options and enrollment the bba 97 amends medicare to establish new part c medicarechoice every individual entitled to medicare part and enrolled in part b will be able to elect the existing package of medicare

pointofservice plan ppo or pso ii private feefor service plan private ffs8 or iii combination of medical savings account msa 7 medicares recognized payment for these physicians is actually 95 of the fee schedule amount for the service 8 the private feeforservice plan is defined as plan that reimburses hospitals physicians and other providers at rate determined by the plan on feeforservice basis without placing the provider at financial risk does not vary rates for provider based on the utilization relating to the provider and does not restrict the selection of providers among those continued crs53 plan and contributions to medicarechoice msa up to 390000 individuals can enroll in msa plans the specific rules for msa plans are described below individuals with end stage renal disease esrd

elections will be made and changed only during an annual coordinated election period there will also be 3month period after making an election in which an individual can change their election additional election periods called special election periods will apply for newly eligible medicare beneficiaries and beneficiaries who experience certain events for example the individual is longer

limited exceptions are provided marketing rules medicarechoice organizations and the plans they offer to medicare beneficiaries will have to meet certain marketing rules they will have to submit marketing material to the secretary at least 45 days before distribution the material can then be distributed if it is not disapproved by the secretary the secretary is required to disapprove such material if it is materially inaccurate or misleading each organization will have to conform to fair marketing standards and crs55 will not be able to permit an organization to provide for cash or other monetary rebates as an inducement for enrollment or otherwise the secretary is permitted to prohibit an organization or its agent from completing any portion of any election form on behalf of any individual information to beneficiaries the secretary is required to provide for activities to disseminate broadly information on medicare ffs and medicarechoice plans to current and prospective medicare beneficiaries the information has to be comparative to help beneficiaries make informed choices among available options the secretary is required to conduct an educational and publicity campaign during november 1998 to inform medicarechoice individuals about the identity of medicarechoice plans and risk contract plans offered in different areas and the election process as shown in table 4 the secretary also is required to hold medicarechoice health information fair every november beginning with 1999 nondiscrimination medicarechoice organizations are required to accept eligible individuals without restriction during election periods election periods may also be referred to as open enrollment periods in general organizations and plans cannot deny enrollment on the basis of healthstatus related factors these include health status medical condition including both physical and mental illnesses claims experience receipt of health care medical history genetic information evidence of insurability including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence and disability these provisions do not apply if they will result in enrollment substantially misrepresentative of the medicare population in the service area organizations also cannot terminate an enrollees election except for failure to pay premiums on timely basis disruptive behavior or because the plan ends for all medicarechoice enrollees medicarechoice benefits and beneficiary costsharing each medicarechoice plan will have to provide the same benefits as required under medicare ffs it will also have to provide additional benefits and reduced costsharing if medicares payment to the plan is less than the plans cost of providing the basic medicare benefits to commercial enrollees plan will also be able to offer extra benefits known as supplemental benefits see msa description below for different requirements on msa plans all medicarechoice enrollees will pay the part b premium additional beneficiary outofpocket liabilities will differ depending on the type of medicarechoice plan the individual elects enrollees in medicarechoice coordinated care plans are likely to experience the least amount of outofpocket costs compared to other medicarechoice options for them the amount of cost sharing per enrollee including premium for covered services can be more than the actuarial value of the deductibles coinsurance and copayments under medicare ffs physician provider or other entity cannot impose balance billing charges on coordinated care enrollees coordinated care plans will have to pay noncontracting providers at least the same amount they would have received if the enrollee was in medicare ffs including allowed balancing billing amounts the rules for msa plans and private ffs plans are different as shown in table 5 the rules in table 5 apply to the basic benefit package and required additional benefits the basic benefit package includes benefits required under medicare ffs crs56 medicarechoice plans might also have to cover additional benefits as part of the basic package if their capitation payment exceeds the estimate of the amount it would cost them to cover medicares benefits for commercial population the term contract provider refers to providers who have entered into an explicit agreement with plan establishing payment amounts for services rendered to the plans enrollees provider can be deemed to have contract with medicarechoice private feefor service plan if before furnishing services to the enrollee of such plan the provider i received notice of the individuals enrollment in private feeforservice plan and had been informed of the terms and conditions of the plans payment or ii if the provider was given reasonable opportunity to obtain such information medicarechoice beneficiary protections each medicarechoice plan will have to provide specific information to enrollees at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter about plan features including information on quality of care utilization review and the specific procedures for grievances and appeals each plan will also have to ensure access to emergency services for emergency medical conditions the law uses the prudent layperson definition an emergency medical condition is one manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in i placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy and in case of pregnant women her health or that of her unborn child ii serious impairment to bodily functions or iii serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part medicarechoice organizations and plans will have to comply with specific quality assurance requirements all plans will have to have quality assurance program that stresses health outcomes and provides for data permitting measurement of outcomes and other indices of quality monitors and evaluates high volume and high risk services and the care of acute and chronic conditions evaluates the continuity and coordination of care that enrollees receive is evaluated on an ongoing basis as to its effectiveness includes measures of consumer satisfaction and provides the secretary with certain information to monitor and evaluate the plans quality only coordinated care plans and not private feeforservice and nonnetwork msa plans will have to comply with other quality assurance requirements such as providing for internal peer review establishing written protocols for utilization review and establishing mechanisms to detect under and over utilization in addition medicarechoice organizations will have to obtain external review of the quality of their inpatient and outpatient services and of their response to written complaints about poor quality of care from an independent quality review and improvement organization such as peer review organization however the secretary is required to ensure that the external review activities do not duplicate the review activities conducted as part of the accreditation process also the secretary may waive the external review requirement if she determines that the organization has consistently maintained an excellent record of quality assurance and compliance with other medicarechoice requirements crs57 table 5 beneficiary costsharing and provider reimbursement under medicarechoice plans for basic benefit package item coordinated care private

plans source table prepared by congressional research service and physician payment review commission grievances and appeals medicarechoice organization will have to have meaningful procedures for hearing and resolving grievances between the organization and enrollees it will also have to maintain process for making determinations regarding whether an individual enrolled within the plan is entitled to receive health service and the amount if any that the individual is required to pay with respect to the service these determinations will have to be made on timely basis depending on the urgency of the situation the explanation of the determination will have to be crs59 in understandable language and state the reasons for the denial description of the reconsideration and appeals processes will have to be provided upon request by the enrollee the organization generally will have to provide for reconsideration of determination the reconsideration will have to be done within time period specified by the secretary but except for those falling under expedited determinations and reconsiderations longer than 60 days after the date of the receipt of the request reconsideration relating to determination to deny coverage based on lack of medical necessity will have to be made by physician with appropriate expertise who is other than physician involved in the initial determination an enrollee in medicarechoice plan or physician will be able to request an expedited determination or an expedited reconsideration in the case of request for an expedited determination or reconsideration made by physician medicarechoice organization will be required to expedite the determination or reconsideration if the request indicates that the application of the normal time frame for making determination or reconsideration involving determination could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or the enrollees ability to regain maximum function the time limits for the organization to respond to the request will be established by the secretary generally but will have to be within 72 hours of the time of receipt of the request for determination or reconsideration medicarechoice provider protections and requirements each medicarechoice organization will be required to establish reasonable procedures relating to the participation of physicians under medicarechoice plan offered by the organization the procedures include i providing notice of the rules regarding participation ii providing written notice of adverse participation decisions and iii providing process for appealing adverse decisions the organization will have to consult with contracting physicians regarding the organizations medical policy quality and medical management procedures the use of gag clauses restricting communications between providers and their patients will be prohibited the use of physician financial incentive plans will be limited financial incentive plan is any compensation arrangement between the organization and physician or physician group that may directly or indirectly have the effect of reducing or limiting services provided to enrollees medicarechoice payments to plans the secretary will make monthly payments in advance to each organization for each covered individual in payment area typically county equal to 112 of the annual medicarechoice capitation rate with respect to that individual for that area the payment will be adjusted for age disability status gender institutional status and other such risk factors as the secretary determines to be appropriate so as to ensure actuarial equivalence by march 1 1999 the secretary will have to submit to congress report on method of risk adjustment of payment rates that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status by january 1 2000 the secretary will have to implement such risk adjustment methodology the secretary will be required to determine annually and announce before the calendar year crs60 concerned the annual medicarechoice capitation rate for each payment area and the risk and other factors to be used in adjusting such rates the major factors for determining medicares annual medicarechoice capitation rates are summarized in table 6 the annual medicarechoice capitation rate for payment area for contract for calendar year will equal the greatest of the following blended capitation rate defined as the sum of 1 percentage of the annual areaspecific medicarechoice capitation rate for the year for the payment area and 2 the national percentage of the inputprice adjusted annual national medicarechoice capitation rate for the year the areaspecific rate is based on the 1997 aapcc for the payment area rates are updated each year by the national per capita medicarechoice growth percentage described below the national rate is the weighted average of the areaspecific rates the percentage applied to the areaspecific rate will be reduced in increments over 6 years from 90 to 50 in 2003 the national component of the blend adjusted to reflect differences in certain input prices such as hospital labor costs will be increased over the same 6 years from 10 to 50 so that in 2003 the blended rate will be based on 50 areaspecific costs and 50 national inputprice adjusted costs budget neutrality adjustment will be

such payments in 1998 40 of such payments in 1999 60 of such crs61 payments in 2000 80 of such payments in 2001 and 100 of such payments in 2002 payments for disproportionate share hospitals dsh will not be carved out the national per capita medicarechoice growth percentage is defined as the per capita increase in medicare expenditures minus specific percentage for example in 1999 the medicarechoice growth percentage equals the per capita growth in medicare minus 05 percentage points over the period 19982002 the payments to the floor counties will increase by an average of about 5 annually medicarechoice payment area is defined as county or equivalent area specified by the secretary in the case of individuals determined to have esrd the medicarechoice payment area is each state or other payment areas as the secretary specifies upon request of state for contract year beginning after 1998 the secretary will redefine medicarechoice payment areas in all or portion of the state to 1 single statewide payment area 2 metropolitan system or 3 single payment area consolidating noncontiguous counties or equivalent areas within state special rules will apply for payments to msa plans if the monthly premium for an msa plan ie high deductible plan for medicarechoice payment area is less than 112 of the annual medicarechoice capitation rate for the area and year involved the secretary is required to deposit the difference in medicarechoice msa established by the individual for cases when an msa election was terminated before the end of the year the secretary will have to establish procedure to recover deposits attributable to the remaining months payments to medicarechoice organizations and payments to medicarechoice msas will be made from the medicare trust funds in such proportion as the secretary determines reflects the relative weights that benefits under parts and b represent of medicares actuarial value of the total benefits these provisions apply for contracts on or after january 1 1998 medicarechoice premiums later than may 1 of each year each medicarechoice organization will be required to submit to the secretary for each of its medicarechoice plans specific information about premiums costsharing and additional benefits if any and the enrollment capacity if any in relation to the plan and the area the secretary will be required to review this information and approve or disapprove the premiums cost sharing amounts and benefits the secretary will not have the authority to review the msa premiums or the premiums for the private feeforservice plans each medicarechoice organization will have to permit monthly payment of premiums an organization will be able to terminate election of individuals for medicarechoice plan for failure to make premium payments but only under specified conditions medicareplus organization will not be able to provide cash or other monetary rebates as an inducement for enrollment crs62 table 6

that the state imposed as condition of approval procedures or standards regarding solvency that were different from those applied under federal law waiver granted to pso will depend upon the organizations compliance with all state consumer protection and quality standards insofar as such standards i apply in the state to the organization if it were licensed under state law ii are crs63 generally applicable to other medicarechoice organizations and plans in the state and iii are consistent with the federal standards established under the act certain state standards described below will be preempted overridden as they apply to psos and medicarechoice plans more generally the secretary is required to establish on an expedited basis and using negotiated rulemaking process final standards related to financial solvency and capital adequacy of organizations seeking to qualify as psos the target date for publication of the resulting rules is april 1 1998 the negotiated rulemaking committee will be appointed by the secretary in establishing the standards for pso solvency the secretary is required to take into consideration any standards developed by the national association of insurance commissioners specifically for riskbased health care delivery organizations the secretary also is required to establish by regulation nonsolvency standards for medicarechoice organizations and plans by june 1 1998 the secretary will have to issue interim standards based on currently applicable standards for medicare hmoscmps these federal nonsolvency standards will preempt any state law or regulation including those about to be described with respect to medicarechoice plans to the extent such law or regulation was inconsistent with the federal standards state standards relating to the following will be preempted i benefit requirements ii requirements relating to inclusion or treatment by providers and iii coverage determinations including related appeals and grievance processes medicarechoice contracts contracts with medicarechoice organizations will be made for at least 1 year and will be automatically renewable in the absence of notice by either party of intention to terminate organizations will have to have at least 5000 individuals or 1500 in the case of pso who are receiving health benefits through the organization or at least 1500 individuals or 500 in the case of pso who are receiving health benefits if the organization primarily serves individuals residing outside of urbanized areas the secretary will be able to terminate contract at any time if the secretary determines that the organization i fails substantially to carry out the contract ii is carrying it out in manner substantially inconsistent with the efficient and effective administration of medicareplus or iii longer substantially meets medicarechoice conditions the secretary is authorized to carry out specific remedies in the event that medicarechoice organization i fails substantially to provide medically necessary items and services required to be provided if the failure adversely affects or has the substantial likelihood of adversely affecting the individual ii imposes premiums on individuals that are in excess of those allowed iii acts to expel or refuses to reenroll an individual in violation of federal requirements iv engages in any practice that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or discouraging enrollment except as permitted by law of eligible individuals whose medical condition or history indicates need for substantial future medical services v misrepresents or falsifies information to the secretary or others vi fails to comply crs64 with rules regarding physician participation or vii employs or contracts with any individual or entity that has been excluded from participation in medicare the remedies include civil money penalties and suspension of enrollment until the secretary is satisfied the deficiency has been corrected and is not likely to recur noncomplying contractor can also be terminated from participation in medicarechoice the bba 97 provides for the phasing out of risk cost and hcpp types of contracts medical savings account msa demonstration current law provision the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 authorized an msa demonstration for employed individuals who are not yet eligible for medicare bba97 the bba97 includes medicarechoice option that is combination of an msa plan providing health insurance annual deductible limited to 6000 indexed for inflation and medicarechoice msa msa plans will be limited to demonstration the initial year will be 1999 but new enrollments will not be allowed after 2002 or after the number of enrollees reaches 390000 msa plans will not be available to certain lowincome or disabled individuals among others when enrolled in an msa plan individuals will not be able to have other health insurance including medigap policies with some exceptions and they will have to reside in the united states for at least half the year individuals will be able to disenroll from an msa plan only during an annual election period or under special circumstances an msa plan will provide reimbursement for items and services covered under parts and b of medicare though only after the enrollee incurs countable expenses equal to the annual deductible limited to 6000 indexed for inflation countable expenses include at least those payable by medicare under parts and b as well as the deductibles coinsurance and copayments the enrollee would have paid under those parts at plans option other expenses such as prescription drugs may also be counted after the deductible is met the plan will have to reimburse at least 100 of parts and b expenses the provider charges or 100 of what medicare would have paid for these expenses without regard to deductibles or coinsurance whichever is less msa plans will not be subject to balance billing limitations nor will they have to pay balance billing charges though some might do so see table 5 contributions to medicarechoice msa will be made annually from the enrollees capitation rate after the msa plan insurance premium has been paid contributions to accounts will be exempt from taxes as will account earnings withdrawals will likewise not be taxed nor be subject to penalties if they are used to pay unreimbursed enrollee medical expenses that are deductible under the internal revenue code however qualified withdrawals cannot been made to pay insurance premiums other than for longterm care insurance continuation coverage such as cobra or coverage while an individual is receiving unemployment compensation nonqualified withdrawals will be included in the individuals gross income for tax purposes they would also be subject to an additional 50 penalty to the extent crs65 they exceed the amount by which the account balance on december 31st of the prior year is greater than 60 of the msa plan deductible for the year of withdrawal for example if the account balance on december 31st was 3500 and the plan deductible the next year was 5000 the amount that could be withdrawn for nonqualified purposes without the penalty is 500 ie 3500 minus 60 of 5000 the 50 penalty will not apply in cases of death or disability account balances at death will be subject to various tax treatments depending on their disposition if msa plan enrollees switch to another medicarechoice option or traditional medicare they will be able to maintain their account and use it to pay qualified medical expenses additional contributions will be allowable unless enrollees elect an msa plan again medicare competitive pricing demonstration current law under section 402 of the social security amendments of 1967 pl 90248 42 usc 1395b1 the secretary is authorized to develop and engage in experiments and demonstration projects for specified purposes one purpose is to determine whether and if so which changes in methods of payment or reimbursement for medicare services including change to methods based on negotiated rates would have the effect of increasing the efficiency and economy of such health services under this authority hcfa is seeking to demonstrate the application of competitive bidding as method for establishing payments for risk contract hmos in the denver area hcfas actions have been challenged in the courts and hcfa will not be allowed to pursue the demonstration in fy1997 bba97 the bba requires the secretary of hhs to establish demonstration project under which payments to medicarechoice organizations in medicare payment areas in which the project is being conducted are determined in accordance with one of the competitive pricing methodologies established in this provision the secretary is required to designate in accordance with recommendations of the competitive pricing advisory committee cpac up to 7 medicare payment areas in which the project would be conducted the provision spells out the composition and responsibilities of the cpac the cpac is required to recommend to the secretary the designation of 4 specific areas to be included such recommendations will be made to ensure that payments under the project in 2 areas begin january 1 1999 and in 2 areas on january 1 2000 of the 4 areas recommended 3 have to be in urban areas and 1 in rural area by december 31 2001 the committee could recommend to the secretary the designation of up to 3 additional payment areas to be included in the project the cpac will terminate on december 31 2004 for each medicare payment area to be included in the project the secretary will in accordance with recommendations of the cpac establish the

the major provisions which were dropped by the housesenate conferees incomerelated part b premium under current law all persons enrolled in part b pay premium equal to 25 of program costs federal general revenues account for the remaining 75 the senate bill would have provided for an incomerelated part b premium for individuals with incomes over 50000 and couples with incomes over 75000 individuals with incomes at 100000 and couples with incomes at 125000 would have paid 100 of program costs the federal subsidy would have been phasedout on straightline sliding scale for individuals the phaseout would have occurred over the 50000 to 100000 income range and for couples over the 75000 to 125000 income range for example the 1997 part b premium is 4380 per month 52560 per year which represents 25 of costs the federal subsidy is 13140 per month which represents 75 of costs over the year the federal subsidy is 157680 if the senate provision were in effect individuals with incomes over 100000 would be subject to part b premium of 210240 100 of costs those with incomes between 50000 and 100000 would have premium amount between 52560 and 210240 the congressional research service

the full retirement age the age at which one receives unreduced benefits for social security cash benefits from age 65 to 67 over the 20032027 period the senate bill would have raised the medicare eligibility age from age 65 to 67 according to the same schedule established in law for social security cash benefits copayment for home health medicares home health benefit is subject neither to deductibles nor coinsurance the senate bill would have established 5 per visit copayment for part b covered home health services capped annually at an amount equal to the part hospital deductible centers of excellence hcfa is conducting bundled payment demonstration project under which 10 facilities considered centers of excellence are paid flat fee to provide cataract crs75 surgery or coronary artery bypass cabg surgery the facilities were selected on the basis of their experience outcomes and efficiency in providing these services the house bill would have created new program the

procedures and for furnishing services unrelated to surgical procedures to hospital inpatients that the secretary determines to be appropriate medical malpractice there are uniform federal standards governing health care liability actions to date reforms of the medical malpractice system have occurred primarily at the state level and have generally involved changes in the rules governing tort

they would have established 250000 cap on noneconomic damages limited defendants liability for the amount of noneconomic damages attributable to that defendants proportionate share of fault limited punitive damages to 250000 or three times the amount of economic damages whichever was greater specified that punitive damages they could only be applied in egregious cases and provided for uniform
