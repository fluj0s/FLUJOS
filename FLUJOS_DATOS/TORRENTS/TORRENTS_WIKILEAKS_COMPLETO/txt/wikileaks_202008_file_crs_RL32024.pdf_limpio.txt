of the transportation equity act of the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 during the reauthorization process states reporte d to congress that the numerous federal environmental approvals and permits needed to build highway were inefficient and overly timeconsuming to address these concerns congress included section 1309 in tea21 it was intended to better coordinate federal agency involvement in the nepa process fhwa defines environmental streamlining as the timely delivery of federally funded transportation project s while protecting and nhancing the environment because major transportation projects may be affected by dozens of federal state and local environmental requirements administered by multiple agencies improved interagency cooperati on was identified by congress as critical

state or local significance when project uses such resources separate section 4f evaluation must be prepared and included with the appr opriate nepa documentation unlike nepa the significance of impacts to the resource is not necessarily relevant under the law any use of such resource for transportation project is prohibited unless there is prudent and feasible lternative to using such land and the project includes all possible pl anning to minimize harm to land to demonstrate that there is feasible and prudent alternative the section 4f evaluation must analyze alternatives and design

inclusion in the national register of historic places nhpa does not mandate preservation of such resources but requires all fe deral agencies to consider the impact of their actions on such properties and seek ways to avoid minimize or mitigate adverse impacts section 106 also requires the agency to seek comments on the project from the advisory council on historic preservation achp u nder

in 1994 directed every federal agency to make environmental justi ce part of its mission by iden tifying and addressing the effects of all programs policies and activities on minority populations and low income populations two executive orders issued in 1977 directed federal agencies to avoid to the extent possible long and short term adverse impacts to

construction on or modification to such resources is to be avoided wherever there is practical alternative compliance with each of the require ments listed above is required under separate statutory or executive aut hority apart from nepa however evidence of compliance with each of these requirements is required by fhwa to be contained in the appropriate nepa documentation of the legal requirements listed above fhwa identifies the endangered species act the clean water act section 4f of the dot act and the national historic preservation act as the statutes most likely to apply to all highway projects and most likely to affect highway project delivery unlike nepa which is essentially procedural requirement the big four statutes prohibit or limit activity depending upon the resource impacted appropriate nepa documentation fhwa regulations identify the following three classes of actions that will dictate the nepa documentation required for highway project15 actions with significant environmental impact such projects require the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis when an eis is approved record of d ecision rod is issued actions that have significant individual or cumulative environmental impacts such actions are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an eis whether and what types of documentation will be required depends upon the complexity of th project and resources impacted actions for which environmental impacts are initially uncertain such projects require the preparation of an environmental assessment ea to determine if an eis is necessary if eis is required finding of significant impact fonsi is issued as illustrated by the classes of actions listed above to termine the type of nepa documentation that is appropriate for any give n project it must first be determined if the projects impacts are significant almost every federal action has some impact on the environment ceq regu lations require federal agencies to determine the significance of those actions by considering the projects context and intensity16 determining the context of project i nvolves analyzing impacts to society as whole the affected region or the loca lity the degree of significance must be considered on projectbyproject basis and will depend upon factors such as the location and scope of the project for ex ample highway project that impacts onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs9 17 in determining projects significance th cost of the project is not an element of consideration 18 dinah bear nepa at 19 primer on an old law with

insignifi cant compared to project that impacts one acre of twoacre wetland the valu and function of the impacted wetlands would also be relevant the intensity of an impact refers to its severity factors used to assess intensity will differ from project to project factors to consider may include unique characteristics of the geographical area the degree to which the action adversely impacts endangered species or historic s ites or the degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety to adequately determine an impacts intensity more than one agency may need to be involved for example the department of agriculture may need to determine the intensity of impacts from project that would cut through prime farmland since degrees of impact with regard to both context and intensity must be evaluated to determine project significance such an evaluation may be highly subjective17 while court decisions have been rendered regarding most elements of nepa implementation few fe deral courts have attempted to specifically define significance most often court will determine whether the evidence for given project involved potentially significant environmental effects and then decide whether the agencys decision not to prepare an eis was reasonable under circumstances specific to that project18 documentation required when impacts are significant if it is determined that the impacts of proposed pr oject will likely be significant an eis must be prepared an eis is full disc losure document that provides description of the proposed project and the existing

process21 it is during the scoping process that the agency should determine which statutory re quirements or executive orders will apply ie the applicant will review all laws and executive orders listed in table 1 to determine which if any w ill apply to the project for example it should be determined early in the project whether property of historical significance is impacted or if the project will raise environmental justice issues once the initial scoping is complete eis preparation can begin significant elements of an eis include project purpose and need project alternatives

section of the eis to be devoted to clarifying the purpose and need for the project by virtue of the fact that an eis is being prepared transportation project is anticipated to have significant environmental social or economic impacts such project can be expected to require the expenditure of significant amount of funds the public and decisionmakers will require clear well supported explanation for why such project should be built when adverse environmental impacts are significant it is also important to justify why such impacts are acceptable in light of the transportation needs being met by the project the purpose and need section is the foundation upon which s ubsequent sections of the eis are built fhwa requires the di scussion to be clear specific and support the need for the project well defi ned and well justif ied purpose and need evaluation will facilitate the development of reasonable project alternatives for example if projects purpose involves addressing traffic capacity problem potential means of solving that problem will be considered in the proposed alternatives some of the common needs presented in fhwa eiss include safety improvements increased highway capacity urban transportation plan consistency and system linkage the clear delineation of project purpose and need is also necessary to meet the requirements under section 4f the execu tive orders on

from consideration ie mass transit alternative may not be reasonable for given project but may still need to be acknowledged reasonable alternatives incl ude those that are practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint and using common sense rather than simply desirable from the standpoint of the agency or potentially affected stakeholder23 fhwa regulations require that alternatives considered ensure that the project connects logical termini have independent utility and not restrict consideration of future transportation alternatives24 the alternatives section should begin with concise discussion of how and why the reas onable alternatives were selected for detailed study and explain why other alternatives were eliminated fhwa specifically requires the following range of alternatives to be considered when determining reasonable alternatives noaction alternative may include activities such as shortterm minorrestoration activities eg safety and maintenance improvements that maintain continuing operation of the existing roadway transportation system management tsm alternatives activities whichmaximize the efficiency of the present system possible subject areas to include in this alternative are options such as ridesharing the addition or designation of highoccupancy vehicl hov lanes on existing roadways andor traffic signal timing optimization mass transit alternatives reasonable and feasible transit options eg bussystems rail even though they may not be within fhwa funding authority when such an alternative is consider ed fhwa coordination with the urban mass transportation administration is necessary build alternatives construction activities such as the improvement of existinghighways or alterna tives in new location 25 discussion of the

of reasonable alternatives where this is the case ceq suggests that only representative number of the most reasonable examples covering the full range of alterna tives should be presented26 the determination of the number of reasonable alternatives in the draft eis therefore depends on the particular project and the facts and circumstances in each case identification of the affected environment ceq regulations require that one section of the eis be devoted to desc ribing the environment of the area affected by each alternative under consideration27 fhwa guidance suggests that

may include demographics of the general population served by the proposed pr oject as well as an identification of socially economically and environmentally sensitive loca tions or features in the proposed project area for example the eis should identify the pres ence of impacted minority or ethnic groups parks hazardous material sites historic resources or wetlands identification of environmental consequences one section of the eis must identify the specific environmental consequences ie impacts or effects of each alternative it is within this secti on that methods of compliance

based on data from the fhwa technical advisory t66408a agency comments and coordination nepa projects involve the participation of lead agency and c ooperating agencies the lead agency is defined as the federal agen cy that has taken responsib ility for preparing the nepa documentation31 for federally funded highway proj ects the lead agency will usually be fhwa state or local agencies such as state dots will likely act as joint lead agencies the project applicant will initially develop substantive portions of the environmental document while fhwa w ill be responsible for its scope and content32 fhwa requires that the draft and final eis demonstrat that appropriate comments and coordination we re solicited from relevant federal state and local cooperating agencies cooperating agencies required to provide input on an eis are those that are obligated to provide comments within th eir agencys jurisdiction expertise or authority this means that the federal agency with jurisdiction over or expertisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs14 33 40 cfr 15034regarding any identified environmental c onsequence is required to provide fhwa with the appropriate input for example if historical and arch eological preservation consequences are identified the adviso ry council on historic preservation will likely be included as one of the cooperating agencies during the nepa process if farmland impacts are identified the draf t eis should summarize the results of comments and coordination with the us department of agri culture usda and as appropriate state and local agriculture agencies if cooperating agency or any other federa l state or local agency participating in the nepa process comments on nepa document fhwa is required to assess and consider those comments and res pond in one of the following ways33 modify proposed alternatives develop and evaluate alternatives not previously considered supplement improve or modify its analyses make factual corrections to the eis explain why the comments do not warra nt further agency response from fhwa citing the sources authorities or reasons which support the agencys position and if appropr iate indicate those circumst ances which would trigger agency reappraisal or further response under ceq regulations lead agencies are required to invite comments cooperating agencies have duty to res pond to environmental documents and lead agencies are required to re spond to those comments however as illustrated in the choices listed above the lead agency is not precluded from moving forward with project if it explains why cooperating agencys comments do not warrant further response public involvement one of the primary goals of nepa is to allow the public meaningful opportunity to learn about and comment on the proposed actions of the federal government it is the intent of nepa that agencies encourage and facilitate public involvement in decisions that affect the quality of the human environment and make diligent effort to involve the public in preparing and implementing their nepa procedures to meet these goals agencies are required to provide public notice of neparelate d hearings public meetings and the availability of environm ental documents so as to inform public stakeholders that may be interested in or affected by proposed project any documentation related to the publics participation in the nepa proce ss ie comments or hearings transcripts must be included in the final eis stakeholders who may comment on rface transportation projects will vary according to the impacts of each project they may include individuals or groups expected to benefit from or be adversely impacted by the project or special interest groups with concerns about the projects impacts on certain affected environments for example consider hi ghway project that involves upgrading existing roadways the construction of which would impact adjacent homes or businesses such project may elicit comments from the local business community eg individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs15 34 see simmons v us army corps of engineers 120 f3d 664 1997businesses the chamber of commerce or local development organizations or area home owners project with impacts to sensitive environmental resources such as wetlands or endangered species may ge nerate comments from local or national environmental organizations if stakeholder has concerns about projects impacts their comments may be directed at virtually any element of the nepa process or related documentation while not an exhaustive list following are examples of topics on which stakeholder may comment purpose and need determination stak eholders may assert that projects purpose and need discussion was not fficiently broad meaning the scope of the purpose and need was so narrow that only limited number of alternatives could be chosen alternatives selection stakeholde rs may assert that all reasonable alternatives were not considered they may assert that additional alternatives exist that were not considered this may be the case particularly for controversial projects that are not welcomed by impacted communities or special interest groups alternatives analyses stakeholders may assert that pr oposed alternatives were not analyzed sufficiently to determine all potential environmental consequences issues with documentation stakeholder may assert that all regulatoryrequirements were not fulfilled for example they may assert that required findings were not documented eg proof of compliance with all applicable laws was not documented or that re quired evaluations or reviews were not sufficiently illustrated eg the presence of endangered species or impacts to historic sites was not properly evalua ted or consideration of social and economic impacts was not demonstrated issues regarding project significance stakeholders may disagree with the leadagencys determination of the projects significance for example they may assert that project for which an ea was prepared should have required an eis or they may feel that project approved as categorical exclusion was questionable and required the more indepth review of an ea any one of the topics listed above could be the subject of legal action and has been in the past for example fhwa pe rsonnel have indicated that recent court decision is now commonly used as the be nchmark in developi ng the appropriate purpose and need statement and resulting sc ope of project alte rnatives during the nepa process 34 plaintiffs in this case were affected landowners who brought suit against the us army corp of engineers in response to their issuance of permit to build dam in his decision the judge st ated one obvious way for an agency to slip past the strictures of nepa is to contrive purpose so slender as to define competing reasonable alternatives out of consideration and even out of existence if the agency constricts the definition of the projects purpose and thereby excludes what truly are reasonable alternativ the eis cannot fulfill its rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs16 35 23 cfr 771133 36 each group of potential ces is listed under 23 cfr 771117c and dto large degree the manner in which fhwa implements nepa is dictated by such judicial decisions to avoid conflict after project has reached an advanced stage of development fhwa recommends that continuous contact with nonagency stakeholders be maintained throughout the decisionmaking process from the earliest project planning stages as one or mo re transportation pr oblems are identified through defining purpose and need through the development of range of potential alternatives and up to the decision to select particular alternative record of decision not less than 30 days after publication of the final eis notice in the federal register record of decision rod is signed the rod will present the basis for the agencys fina l

purchase of construction materials or project construction ca nnot begin until the rod has been signed documentation required when impacts are not significant transportation projects that do not individua lly or cumulatively have significant social economic or envir onmental effect and which fhwa has determined from past experience have significant impact are excluded from the requirement to prepare an eis or environmental assessment discussed below such actions are processed as categorical exclusions ces and make up almost 91 of the projects processed by fhwa even if projects impacts are not significant ceq and fhwa regulations may require certain gree of documentation to prove that the highway project is undertaken in complia nce with all applicable environmental requirements see table 1 35 even though categorically excluded proj ects have insignificant environmental impacts depending upon the action some documentation may be required to prove that the ce determination is appropriate and that any required environmental review or analysis has occurred as discussed pr eviously statutory re quirements to conduct certain environmental reviews may still be required regardless of whether impacts are deemed significant under nepa for example any impacts to 4f resource must be evaluated also documentation regarding the assessment of impacts to endangered species bit may be required fhwa regulations specify two groups of activities that experience has shown would meet the definition of ce whether and what type of documentation will be required before the project could be approved by fhwa w ould depend on within which of the two groups the action falls36 the first group includes projects that call for or limited construction examples include the construction of bicy cle and pedestrian lanes paths and facilities landscaping the acquisition of scenic easements emergency repairs and the installation of fencing signs pavement markings small passenger shelters or traffic signals normally such project s do not require any further nepa approvalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs17 37 this guidance is provided in fhwa technical advisory t66408a 38 40 cfr 15089 39 see fhwa technical advisory t66408a section ii environmental assessmentsby fhwa however requirements of other laws may still apply for example construction of bicycle path or installation of traffic signals in historic district may require compliance with section 106 or section 4f while requirements under nepa indicate that such project s significant impact documentation of compliance with additional statutory requi rements may be required to approve the projects ce status the second group of projects consists of actions with higher potential for impacts than the first group but which s till meet the criteria for ce because environmental impacts are minor an example of such project is the modernization of highway through resurfacing rec onstruction adding s houlders or adding auxiliary lanes whether or not such actions will have significant impact on the environment depends largely on where they are located where adverse environmental impacts are likely fhwa recommends that the level of analysis be sufficient to define the extent of impact s identify appropriate mitigation measures and address known and foreseeable public and agency concerns at minimum documentation must include description of the proposed action and as appropriate its immediate surrounding area discussion of any specific areas of environmental concern eg historic sites or wetlands and list of ot her federal actions required if any for the proposal37 documentation required when the significance of impacts is uncertain an environmental assessment ea is prepared when it is uncertain whether projects impact will be signif icant the ea should briefly provide evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis ie whether the projects impacts are significant38 if at any time during preparation of the ea it is determined that projects impacts are si gnificant eis preparation should begin there is standard format for ea s required by either ceq or fhwa regulations fhwa suggests that the proce ss for developing an ea should be similar to developing an eis39 for example the applicant s hould consult interested agencies to scope the project to determine the poten tial for social economic or environmental impacts briefly discuss the projects purpos and need identify project alternatives and measures to mitigate adverse impacts and identify any other environmental review requirements applicable to the project ie section 4f or 404 permitting requirements the ea and other relevant document s eg public comments or hearing transcripts must be submitted to the fhwa with request for finding of significant impact fonsi fhwa requires that the basis for the fonsi request be clearly and adequately doc umented like an eis the ea or fonsi is required to clearly document compliance with nepa and all other applicable environmental laws executive orders and related require ments an approved fonsi serves the same purpose that rod serves with an eis similarly final design activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs18 figure 1 fhwa projects by class of action figure 2 fhwa project funding by class of actionproperty acquisition purchase of construction materials or project construction cannot begin until the fonsi has been approved fhwa estimates that projects requiring an ea and subsequent eis accounted for almost 7 of highway projects approved in 2001 coupled with categorically excluded projects discussed above this means that close to 97 of all projects approved by fhwa are determined to have significant impact on the environment figures 1 and 2 illustrate the percentage of fhwa projects by the threes classes of action discussed above and by funding amounts for 1998 through 2001 note that while projects requiring an eis are often the most complex and costly on average such projects still account for less than 10 percent of total fhwa project funding source fhwa available at

the process of both compliance with and documenting compliance with all environmental statutes regu lations executive orders nd court decisions potentially applicable to highway project is compli cated as has been discussed even those projects with or minor environmental impacts must demonstrate that potential impacts to certain types of resources ie public parkland histor ic sites land with threatened or endangered species or property in minority neighborhoods have been considered and that compliance with applicable requi rements documented the perception that nepa results in extensive delays and additional costs to the successful delivery of transportation projects can be magnified when compliance with multiple environmental laws and regulations is required as would likely be the case with large complex highway projects fhwa has asserted that many delayed projects or failed processes can be traced back to disintegrated and disconnected approach to meeting nepa and other re quirements fhwa asserts that their experience in administering nepa has shown that many practitioners do not fully understand or practice the approach to usin g the nepa process as an umbrella for integrating all required studies reviews or consultations40 the sometimes extensive reviews required by agencies such as the army corps of engineers the fish and wildlife service the coast guard or epa as well as various state regulatory and review agen cies add further to the perception that extensive delays are related to the nepa process such delays may actually be result of an agencys need to complete permitting processes or other analyses under separate statutory authority eg the clean water act or endangered species act over which fhwa has authority project with significant impacts would likely be large highprofile complex project costing millions of dollars dela ys of such projects are wellknown among transportation professionals nd have garnered significant public attention in the past for example in the washington dc area replacement of the woodrow wilson memorial bridge is wellknown fhwa project challenges to the nepa documentation for that project resulted in lays to the project however much of the delay was only indirectly related to th nepa process in that the project has highly visible and generated significant public interest often similar highprofile projects have been delayed by public challenges to elements of the nepa documentation however until recently there was only anecdotal information directly linking the nepa process to widespread highway project delays studies examining nepas ro in project delays federal and state governments do not routinely maintain information on the time it takes to complete highway projects therefore gathering accu rate data specific to the time it takes to prepare nepa documentation is difficult for example document preparation under nepa is generally done conc urrently with preliminary project design if project undergoes specification changes those ch anges may necessitate changes in nepa documentation consequently the time to complete the nepa process may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs20 41general

preliminary design and environmental review phase often overlapped with the final design and ri ghtofway acquisition phase federal and state officials reported that larg er more controversial projects were likely to take longer because they generally required compliance with more federal and state requirements and because of the pub lic interest they may generate federal and state transportation officials and transportation engineering organizations contacted by gao identified the timely resolution of environmental issues as providing the greatest opportunity for reducing the time it takes to complete highway projects those fficials generally stated that environmental reviews resulted in better project decisions but reaching those decisions was difficult and time consuming factors that could make the process more difficult included incomplete permit applications limited resources at environmental agencies and public opposition to projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs21 42 see

and cost of delivering completed transportation project the report is to be used to establish baseline against which progress on its streamlining initiatives will be gauged the study was also intended to provide better understanding of the impacts of the nepa process on the total time involved in completing fe deralaid highway or bridge project as well as individual factors influencing the time required to complete the nepa process in order to develop performan ce measures for future improvement in the baseline study fhwa acknowledged the perception that nepa is the cause of delays and additiona l cost to the delivery of transportation projects fhwa asserted that what was missing from the discussion was an analysis of the direct effect that compliance with the requirements of nepa has on the ultimate schedule and cost of delivering completed tr ansportation project the baseline study attempted to determine or define that connection following are significant conclusions drawn by the fhwa study for projects requiring an eis the mean time required for the entire project development process was approximately 131 years for projects requiring an eis the nepa process generally comprises approximately 27 to 28 of that total project development period from the time that either preliminary engineer ing or the nepa process begins whichever is first to the end of construction the time to prepare an eis has increased from mean of 22 years in the 1970s to mean of 50 years in the 1990s the time to prepare an eis increased by almost two years when section 404permit or section 4f pproval was also required eg the average time to complete an eis was 4 3 years when section 404 permit was involved but only about 2 4 years when section 404 permit was involved the increase when section 106 approval wa s required was negligible the length of time to prepare an eis varied between regions with the greatest time required in the northeast with dian value of 45 years and the least time required in the northwest with median value of 1 year43 during congressional oversight hearings on streamlining transportation stakeholders have noted the increase in time to complete an eis from the 1970s to the 1990s44 in its baseline study fhwa does not comment on the cause of thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs22 44continued the american council of engineering compan ies before the

contribute to lengthened reviews for example the process for completing an eis in the 70s differs substantially from the process undertaken in the 90s until november 1978 there were ceq regulations outlining eis requirements while an eis may have been completed relatively quickly during the 70s compared to the 90s it may not have withstood judicial review fhwa did not promulgate its own regulations until 1987 such regulations may have served to ma ke the process take longer but may have resulted in fewer overall project delays in situations where adherence to the regulations resulted in more legally sound eis also the complexity of projects in the 1970s are not comparable to those of the 1990s and public is more involved in the highway construction process in th 1990s than was the case in the 1970s the difference in time to complete projects from region to region may be attributed to differences in the types of pr ojects likely to occur in those regions for example projects in the northeast that simply expand or upgrade existing highway systems but occur in the heavilydevel oped regions may involve wide range of significant impacts while projects in the lessdeveloped northwest may generate fewer overall impacts and be easier to implement fhwa study of eis delays in september 2000 fhwa issued study that explored causes of delay of cer tain projects requiring an eis45 this study was done in response to question submitted by the house committee on transportation and infrastructure in march 2000 regarding causes of delay for highway projects that had not had rod approved after five years fhwa identified 89 projects that fit the specified criteria survey respondents were asked to provide brief assessment of the reasons that each project had taken more than five years to complete the nepa process in the study over 60 of project delays could be attributed to l ack of funding low priority local controversy or project complexity the results of this report were often quoted by interested stakeholders as evidence that neither nepa nor any environmental issues related to nepa compliance was significant cause of transportation delays at the request of representative d on young gao reviewed the fhwa studys methodology to determine the usefulness of its results46 in the report released in january 2003 gao determined that some elements of the studys

from by fhwa the center is intended to ssist its members in promoting innovative streamlining of the project delivery pro cess fhwa is also supporting individual states in implementing their own strea mlining initiatives by providing program funding and technical support challenges to streamlining late in the 107th congress hearings on the streamlining issue were held by the senate environment and public works committee and the house subcommittee on highways and transit of the committee on transportation and infrastructure in conjunction with those hearings two bills were introduced to address the streamlining issue but neither was enact ed representative don young introduced the expediting project delivery to improve transportation and the environment act hr 5455 on september 25 2002 sena tor baucus introduced the maximum economic growth for america through environmental streamlining act s 3031 on october 2 2002 both the hearings and proposed bills highlighted variety of streamlining issues that some members of congress felt needed further attention included among those issues was the need to better coordinate the nepa proce ss on nationwide basis as opposed to achieving varying levels of success from statetostate establish dot as the definitive decision maker when determining projectspurpose and need and project alternatives establish statute of limitations on judicial review of final agency actionsand delegate more power to the states house or senate versions of legislation reauthorizing surface transportation programs may include elements of some or all of the provisions listed above such provisions may serve to streamline the nepa process for certain projects for reasons presented below however challenges to streamlining highway projects may still exist establishing statutory environmental review process s m members of congress have expressed frustration that dot has not promulgated regulations to implement coordinated nvironmental review process as required under section 1309 of tea21 in lieu of regulations some mbers of congress have expressed the desire to create such process in statute the inherent variability among highway projects may make the cr eation of single environmental review process difficult to implement the more significant projects environmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs30 58 text of secretary minetas may 6 2003 letter and chairman connaughtons may 12 2003 response are available at http wwwfhwadotgovstewardsh ipeominetamay6htmimpacts the more complicated the environmental review process will likely be for any given highway project methods that are effective in streamlining one project may not be as effective in another for example one project may require minimal input from participating agencies and hence little coordination among agencies while another project may require assistance from variety of agencies in evaluating impacts to certain resources or co mmunities eg minority neighborhoods or endangered species habitat considering this variability between projects the establishment of provisions applicable to all highway projects such as the establishment of specific deadlines may be difficult to implement while remaining compliant with all applicable legal requirements also participating agency may be required to provide consent to allow certain activities to proceed ie th ey may be required to issue permits for certain activities or to specify how certain impacts must be mitigated such actions are required pursuant to sepa rate statutory authority over which the fhwa has control an environmental review proce ss that allows for flexibility to respond to these various legal requirements may allow for more efficient implementation of the nepa process finally any statutory changes that would result in changes to the way nepa is implemented would likely generate substantial attention from variety of stakeholders if coordinated envir onmental review process were implemented through the regulatory process the pub lic and interested st akeholders would be allowed to comment on the proposed process depended upon the changes suggested such process may genera significant opposition among affected stakeholders establishing lead agency authority nepa does not specify lead agency authority however ceq regulations implementing the nepa process do specify the authority and requirements applicable to both the lead agency and participating agencies in his capacity as the chairman of the interagency transportation infrastructure streamlining task force see discussion regarding executive order implementation on page 26 above transpor tation secretary norman mineta sought guidance from ceq chairman james connaug hton regarding one element of agency authority under current regulations the s ecretary asked for clar ification regarding the role of lead and cooperating agencies with regard to developing highway projects purpose and need58 secretary mineta referred to the sometimes extended interagency debates over pur pose and need statements as reason for delay in highway project development in his response chairman connaught on references current ceq regulations specifying that the lead agen cy has the authority for and responsibility to define the projects purpose and need further chairman connaughton referenced previous federal court decisions giving deference to the lead agency in determining projects purpose and need while not addressed in this corresponde nce ceq regulations alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs31 59 delegation of federal environmental responsibilities for highway projects prepared for aashto by transtech management inc april 2002specify the selection of reasonable alterna tives as within the authority of the lead agency the establishment of lead agency author ity in law may serve to reassert this authority to participating agencies howeve r since this is right already afforded dot under current regulations it may not significantly streamline the nepa process establishing statut of limitations it is generally the large complex highprofile projects that would benefit the most from an efficiently coordinated environmental review process however such large highway projects are also more likely to generate public in terest and possibly public oppos ition if members of the public or private interest group are adam antly opposed to project they may pursue all possible legal recourse to stop or change it nepa and the regulations implementing it currently contain expre ss provision for judicial review of agency action and hence deadline on petitions for review the absence of such limitation has resulted in some cases in courts recognizing the statute of limitations used for judicial review unde r the administrative procedure act that statute 28 usc section 2401 mandates broadly that civil actions against the united states must be filed within six years after the right of action first accrues if statute of limitations were established there is guarantee that special interest groups would not file suit within the newly specified period of time however establishment of statute of limitations may streamline the nepa process insofar as it would require judicial action to be taken earlier in the process when changes could be made more easily as oppos ed to further along in the construction process when changes may be more cos tly and take greater amount of time to address some environmenta l groups have argued that pr eviouslysuggested statutes of limitation ie as specified in hr 5455 107th congress were too restrictive and may in fact lead to preemptive suits in an effort to preserve their right to sue delegating authority to states one element of the nepa process that has been identified by some transportation stakeholders as potential cause for delay is the added step of obtaining fhwa approval of nepa documentation some transportation stakeholders argue that some federal envir onmental responsibilities should be delegated to states for ex ample aashto has sserted that project review may be quickened if states were give the authority to process categorical exclusions meet endangered species re quirements meet hi storic preservation requirements meet wetlands requirements and meet section 4f requirements59 such stakeholders argue that delegation of such authority to the states could speed up the environmental review process for highway projects by eliminating significant layer of bureaucracy that federal approval entails this approach is not endorsed by environmental stakeholders who have expressed concern that the delegation of authority to the states would create fox guarding the henhouse scenario they ar gue that if state which has vestedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32024crs32 interest in moving project forward is allowed to make certain determinations those determinations would not ve the level of scrutiny th at would be provided with federal oversight one potential challenge to state delegation of authority includes possible lack of staff qualified to proce ss potentially complex documenta tion as discussed in the may 2003 gao report regarding stakehol ders views on the time to conduct environmental reviews sta ff shortages have been identified by transportation improvement stakeholders as significant cau of highway project delays if state does not have sufficient staff to accommodate its needs the delegation of additional authority to state or local transportation department staff may serve to slow the nepa process instead of streamline it st aff at the state or local level may have difficulty determining all environmental requirements applicable to their project which could further slow the nepa process if it takes longer to ensure that nepa documentation is complete for example it may be difficult task for highway project sponsor to review and approve the documentation that will ultimately demonstrate that all environm ental requirements have been met in the past state may have had consultant to prepare ne pa documentation for an eis but it may have relied on fhwa oversight for mo re simple documentation such as ce determination documentation the issues above are not an exhaus tive discussion of the challenges to streamlining they are also not likely to be factors in all projects however these examples are intended to illustrate that there are many complexities inherent in the nepa process for highway projects
