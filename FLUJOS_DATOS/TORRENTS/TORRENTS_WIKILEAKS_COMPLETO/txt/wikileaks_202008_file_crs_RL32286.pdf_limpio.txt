divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286asbestos litigation prospects for legislative resolution summary large volume of litigation has been occasioned by occupational exposure to asbestos which may ultimately result in payments of 200 billion or more and has already bankrupted numerous companies this litigation explosion has led to number of innovations in legal process but some of the more comprehensive settlements were overturned by the supreme court with the court suggesting that the situation calls fo r national legislation one approach proposed in the 109th congress embodied in hr 1957 cannon et would conserve the resources of defendant corporations many of which have been bankrupted by asbestos cases so that funds could be applied first to workers who are already sick this would be done by establishi ng precise standards for proving the presence of asbestos dis ease for legal purposes and postponing the cases of those who might show evidences of exposure but are not yet impaired hr 1957 would also apply to the asbestos pr oblem number of principles known under the more general r ubric tort reform the bill receiving the most attention in the 109th congress s 3274 specter and leahy would also establish standards for proving injury but instead of taking the tort reform approach would remove the cases from the court system entirely in its place would be an administrative system nd special fund to pay claims s 3274 would define nine asbestos disease categories each with specified level of compensation ranging from 25000 to 11 million the fund from which claims would be paid would be financed by ssessments on defendant companies and their insurers each of the largest firms subj ect to assessment would be responsible for paying up to 275 million per year for up to 30 years with an overall funding goal of 140 billion the most debated points of s 3274 have included the adequacy of the funding scheme the levels of comp ensation medical criteria esp

as an insulation material friction product eg in brakes and clutches and textile reinforcement due to its unique combination of strength flexibility and resistance to heat and corrosion over the years scientific studies have increasingly implicated the material as cause of debilitating fatal lung diseases protective standards have been adopted and progre ssively tightened but human exposures continue to occur thr ough ongoing use and from legacy buildings and equipment1 moreover cases of asbestosis lung cancer and other diseases will be emerging for years to come because they occur after long latency although most cases of asbestosre lated disease have occurred from occupational exposure few of the affected workers have been able to obtain medical and financial assistance from their employ ers under state workers compensation law this was due to various legal hurdles such as time limitations and the difficulty of proving that lung cancer was caused by employment however many have successfully sued the manufacturers of asbe stos under claims of products liability to such an extent that many large firms have been forced into bankruptcy this litigation explosion has led to calls for legislation that would expedite the settlement process through administrative alternatives the legislation that has advanced the farthest is s 852 which was marked up by the judiciary committee on 26 may 2005 and debated in the sena during 7 to 14 february 20 06 budgetary point of order was raised by senator ensign and sustained by vote of 58 to 41 60 being needed to proceed further with the

litigation report insurance july 9 2002section explanation see crs report rs22081 s 852 the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of 2005 by nathan brooks scope of litigation it is estimated that at least 730 thous and people had brought asbestosrelated personal injury suits against more than 8000 defendants by the end of 2002 and the number of new claims each year appears to be still increasing2 typically each plaintiff sues dozens of defendants so the total volume of litigation is quite substantial the total amount spent on as bestos litigation award s and expenses has been on the order of 70 billion most of this expenditure being financed by defendant companies and their insurers the total ultimate bill may be on the order of 200 to 250 b illion the am ounts awarded in individual cases are difficult to estimate as most are resolved confidentially by settlements but among cases that have gone to trial and succeeded3 the average award has been about 18 million negotiated settlements tend to be considerably less however minus the legal expenses of both plaintiffs and defendant s about 42 of total spending has been reaching the claimants as their net recovery the resulting liabilities have forced some 73 companies into bankruptcy in the last 30 years 37 of them since january 1 2000 among the most prominent of these firms are armstrong world industries ba bcock wilcox federal mogul johns manville owenscorning us gypsum and w r grace bankruptcy is not desirable outcome for either the defendant fi rms or the claimants claims can be put on hold for five years or more and in some cases the trusts established to take care of victims have been able to pay only 5 to 10 of what was expected subsidiary question is the extent to which defendants can rely on their insurance companies to cover their liabilities an issue that is ccasioning substantial litigation of its own4 procedural improvisation the unprecedented scale of litigation has induced courts and the parties to develop new structures for resolution of cases whereas at first defendants vigorously contested such issues as whet her worker was injured whether the cause was asbestos exposure and which ma nufacturers asbestos was the particular asbestos at fault by the 1980s new court procedures and decisions were establishing clearer bases for liability some judges encouraged consolidation of cases for example by selecting few individual cases to go to trial as representative of the whole defendants f ound that their best opportunity was to negotiate settlementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs3 5 homepage httpwwwmantrustorg 6 section 111 of the bankruptcy reform act of 1994 pl 103394 also known as section 524g 7 stephen carroll et asbestos

and ortiz texas law review v 80 7 june 2002 pp 18991924through attorneys representing thousands of claims at time with the amounts for each individual to be determined by schedules of factors such as disease type by the 1990s the leading law firms representing cla imants had standing agreements with the major defendants for settling claims t hough that system has since lost much of its viability the bankruptcy courts have been notable forum for resolving cases masse beginning with the pathbreaking manville trust5 in 1988 after six years under court supervision johnsmanville corp emerge d from bankruptcy 50 owned by trust charged with compensating current and future asbestos liability claimants administrative procedures were developed to streamline claims handling the trusts operating expenditures are only 5 of be nefits paid and lawyers representing claimants cannot charge more than 25 thus claimants receive 70 of what the trust pays out unfortunately though the amounts paid are quite low since the assets of the trust have onl been adequate to pay 5 to 10 of full value the system became model for other solvent companies congress also codified the process for bankrupt firm to resolve its liability for all pending and future claims via such trusts6 in short some observers be lieve that through such innovations asbestos litigation was transf ormed in fact although not in form into quasi administrative regime7 much of the resulting concepts and language feed into the legislative measures discussed below most recently some corporations in cluding halliburton honeywell and the europeanbased manufacturer abb have pr esented plans by which claims are to be resolved by the bankruptcies of their subsid iaries rather than the parent corporation which would then be able to carry on freed of asbestos liabilities this would make use of the 1994 bankruptcy law amendment but leave the parent corporation solvent and still in control of its operations unlike the manville model which put control of the whole corporation under the trust8 finally many had expected eventually to come to final resolution of most cases by global settlements however the two prominent asbestos settlements that were fully litigated up to the supreme court were overturned there9 the key features of the georgine settlement were 1 definitive criteria for proving exposurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs4 and illness in simplified and expedited process 2 standardized compensation for actual illness only 3 preservation of the right to compensation later if disease or worsened disease occurs later 4 cap on attorney fees and 5 limited right to opt out and rely on ones ordinary right to sue these settlements were rejected for not meeting the requirements for establis hing class actions under federal rule of civil procedure 23 georgine was found wanting because various subgroups of claimants and potential claimants were in widely varying circumstances so that common elements did not predominate among their cases also adequate representation was not broadly enough ssured especially for those who might become aware of their injury only in the future these defects were not adequately overcome by the agreements provision allowi ng potential plaintiffs to opt out the ortiz class was established under differe nt subsection of rule 23 that did not require meeting such criteria but the court said it had not been demonstrated convincingly enough that the settlement qualif ied for this alternate rule subsection assets of defendants insufficient to meet liabilities what was notable about these cases is that members of the supreme court expressed discomfort with having to reject settlements with some merit for not meeting the detailed requirements of federa l court procedure whi ch of course has its own merits as stated by justice ginsburg in the georgine case rule 23 which must be applied with the interests of absent class members in close view cannot carry the large load heaped upon it more pointedly justice souter in ortiz commented that this litigation defies customary judicial administration and calls for national legislation thus each of several hopedfor routes toward resolution bankruptcy court class actions or consolidati on of individual cases in one court which is possible for federal court cases has run into significant impediments in recent years at the same time differences have emerged between claimants who are critically ill and others who may be less sick or show abnormal xra ys without apparent illness but who sue immediately either because of legal dead lines statutes of limitations or because they fear that funds ma not be available later policy alternatives status quo despite warnings that the asbestos pr oblem is reaching crisis proportions it could be argued that the current legal re gime has distinct advantages and should be allowed to proceed as it is or with minor improvements the current system is providing substantial assistance to large numbers of victims most of whom do not have to pay lawyers fees unless and until compensation is received from public policy perspective the fact that defendant companies are the ones financing the benefits may be considered broadly beneficial that is companies in all industries are being put on notice that allowing harm to occur to employees and the public can be fatal to their own financial wellbeinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs5 10 tort reform is discussed more generally in crs report 95797 federal tort reform legislation constitutiona lity and selected statutes by henry cohen 11 pleural plaques resemble calluses they are patches of tough sinewy tissue which form on the inside of the chest wall and show up in chest xrays they are generally thought of as an indicator of asbestos exposure rather than disease 12 hr 1957 notes in its findings section that the number of silicosis cases has been rising rapidly and that it is necessary to address silica legislation to avoid an asbestoslike litigation crisison the other side of the ledger the curre nt system is not likely to have adequate resources to fully compensate all claimants substantial portion of the resources that are available is used to run the system rather than directly benefit claimants it is also disorganized with oversight to assure that compensation is allocated primarily to those with the most compelling cases changes in tort law some observers see asbestos litigation as part and parcel of broader problems with personal injury litigation that justify more general tort reform especially in cases with thousands of plaintiffs many specific measures ve been suggested such as caps on punitive damages limitations on joint and several liability and more narrowly specifying the courts in which each plaintiff can bring hisher case10 tort innovation peculiar to asbestos is the pleural registry in number of states this device enables one to make tentative filing when one learns of ones injury often upon diagnosis of pleural plaques 11 and thus meet the legal deadline even though or minor impairment has yet occurred trial of the claim is delayed until serious symptoms occur and if nonmalignant case is established potential claim for cancer would be put aside until that disease becomes evident two disease rule the idea behind the postponing of cas many of whic h will never progress to debilitating disease is to allow immediate resources to be concentrated on those with the most serious immediate problems medical criteria building on the pleural registry concep t hr 1957 cannon et would hold in abeyance statutes of limitations and other time limits until such time as impairment may occur and be diagnosed then before plaintiffs can proceed further with an asbestos or silica12 suit they would first make prima facie case that they have physical impairment and that exposure to as bestos has been substantial contributing factor the bill specifies detailed medical criteria for establishing these claims factors to be considered include employ ment and smoking history xray evidence of abnormalities such as pleu ral thickening or opacities pathological evidence of lung scarring and impaired breathing show n by measures such as forced vital capacity hr 1957 also incorporates number of ge neral tort reform features as well as others to address the techniques of some lawyers and their medical associates whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs6 13 debate on cornyn amendment sa 2749 in congressional record

plaintiff resides or experienced the asbestos exposure consolidation of cases only with the consent of all parties burden of proof it must be shown that the conduct of each defendant and exposure to each defe ndants asbestos or silica was substantial contributing factor to the disease proportional liability on implication of this provision is that full damages would not be received if some potential defendants have not been sued or have become bankrupt cap on noneconomic losses 250 thousand 500 thousand in cases of mesothelioma also punitive damages not available similar measure though differing in particulars was introduced as substitute amendment during debate on s 852 see infra but tabled on vote of 70 27 the philosophy of medical criteria bills is that the court system ie the federal court system can handle the asbestos issue if cases are dealt with in an orderly reasonable way this means above all that awards be made if and when actual impairment occurs on the basis of reliable relevant evidence given these conditions it is held that there would be need for new governmental agencies and levies13 administrative system two bills in the 108th congress hr 1114 and s 2290 would have established administrative systems to settle claims along the lines of the georgine settlement their intent was to circumvent the see mingly insurmountable requirements of the federal rules of civil pro cedure while assuring reasonable measure of justice for all parties new versions of s 2290 have been introduced in the 109th congress and will be discussed extens ively in the next section like the other bills just discussed hr 1114 kirk would re quire all claimants to first establish that they have an eligible asbestosrelated medical condition failing that their right to future

debated in february 2006 failing test vote at th at time revised version s 3274 was introduced in may the house has not taken up the asbestos issue since 200014 for further explanation of sp ecific provisions see crs report rs22081 s 852 the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of 2005 by henry cohen s 3274 would facilitate the resolution of cases not only like the other bills by specifying medical eligibility criteria but also by establishing schedule of benefits ranging to over 1 million for mesoth elioma and fund financed by assessments on defendant co mpanies and their insurers through which all claims would be paid each of the largest firm s subject to assessment would be responsible for paying up to 275 million per year for as long as 30 years the funding target

essly excluded from any payment obligation in what follows we discuss s 3274 sp ecifically highlighting the particular points that have been most difficult andor still attract opposition to the bill they fall mostly under the headings of funding adequacy acceptability of the compensation schedule basis for the diag nostic categories and startup and close down issues most of these points it may be noted were addressed in the 2003 committee report on s 1125 108th congress which still constitutes useful overview despite subsequent changes in the details15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs8 15

obligations of insurers and reinsurers to each other and to defendant companiesfunding adequacy number of unknowns mean the bills stated funding capacity of 140 billion substantial sum by any measure may yet not suffice to pay all scheduled benefits the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the ultimate total claims would probably be in the range of 120 to 150 billion16 combined with administrative and financing costs reve nues of at most 140 billion might not be sufficient moreover some private estimates indicated that claims might be as much as double cbos figures17 the bill features fixed schedule of bene fits while the adequacy of funding is addressed through number of contingency measures eg guaranteed payment account the revenue side of the equation thus becomes bit complicated in any case it should be recognized that the h eadline figure of 140 billion is goal or estimate rather than fixed mandate actual assessments on defendant companies will be determined by their assignment into tiers and subtiers these being defined by the companies historical asbestos payments and recent 2002 sales revenue annual assessments for 30 years will range from 275 million company with historical asbestos paym ents greater than 75 million and falling within the top quintile of these companies by revenue down to the smallest assessment 100 thousand company with asbestos paym ents of 1 5 million and revenues in the smallest third of these companies there is blanket exemption for small businesses as defined by the small business act 15 usc 632 and various inequity adjustments the bill also requires 46 billion from the insurance industry but leaves the allocation am ong companies to special commission subtitle ii b18 on the expenditure side some flexibility could be provided by annual financial reviews which would lead to reevaluation and tightening of diagnostic criteria if the number of claims in any category differs greatly 25 from cbo projections the debate in the sena in february 2006 u ltimately turned on the financial question point of order wa s raised and sustained that cbos projections indicated at least the possibility of expenditures ex ceeding revenues in periods after the first 10 years of operation the bill provides how ever that if funding proves inadequate the program will be terminated and cases revert to the court system this question of sunset is dealt with in th final section of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs9 19 for general information about asbestosrelated diseases see httpwwwnlmnihgovmedlineplusasbest

adjusted for inflation in future years at least three types of considera tion have guided the development of these numbers 1 the pattern of awards given by courts or agreed in settlements 2 the

somewhat less than these amounts due to certain contingencies particularly attorney fees while program of assistance in filing claims including information about pro bono attorneys would be blished claimants could use their own feebased attorneys however the bill would limit fees to 5 of the benefit received collateral sources benefits would be reduced fo r collateral sources ie other payments received from defendants and insure rs however there would be offset for workers compensation or veterans benefits the case of railroad and maritime workers is complicated becau they are covered by th federal employers liability act fela 45 usc 51 et seq or jone s act 46 usc app 688 both of which have aspects both of workers compensation and of tort liability s 3274 subsection 131b4 deals with this complication by awarding in lieu of what they might have gotten by workers compensation an additional special adjustment equal to 110 of the average amount received by asbe stos victims at the claimants disease level in recent years diagnostic categories eligibility for benefits would require certain kinds of evidence including documentation of occupational exposure to asbestos preceding minimum 10year latency period smoking history physical examination pulmona ry function test x rays and possibly cat scans and pathology report20 with this evidence administrators are to apply the criteri in subsection 121d and determine the highest of the 10 disease levels to which each claimant belongs if any the goal is nonadversarial system that is prompt fficient and as accura as possible in field where there are substantial scientific uncertainties while in some respects the benefit of the doubt is given to claimants on the other hand the system is meant to eliminate screening mills that produce t housands of claims upon evidence that is fragmentary at best if not fraudulent21 disputed categories several of the disease categories have drawn criticism on the ground that they are not credibly li nked to asbestos exposure among these are as follows simple asbestosis level i it is agreed on all sides that claimants at level i are not impaired ill hence do not receive cash compensation only the right to monitoring if illness on other levels is subsequently found compensatio n can then be claimed somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs11 22 compare committee report pp 9899 and pp 212213 the bill also allocates 20 to 30 million per year for at least five years for sc reening program for individuals at high risk of asbestosrelated di sease sect 221c 23 the issue gained considerable attention in the wake of an unexpected court ruling in june 2005 glater jonathan the tort wars at turning point new york times october 9 2005 business p 17 the senate judiciary committee held hearing on the issue on february 2 2006 24 those who quit at least 12 years before diagnosisdispute the rationale for monitoring arguing that being at level i does not imply any higher probability of subsequent illness than for other workers who are not at level i on the other side it is argued that as done with many toxic substances all exposed workers should get screening regardless of whether they show symptoms22 other cancers level vi there is dispute here on whether asbestos causes nonlung cancers s uch as colorectal proponents of the provision note that the exis ting bankruptcy trusts compensate for nonlung cancers but opponents claim that this is due to quirks of bankruptcy bargaining dynamics at any rate an independent physician panel must determine in each level vi case that asbestos was substantial contributing factor to the cancer the bill would also mandate study by the institute of medicine the conclusions of which will be binding regarding the issue of causation at level vi lung cancer without evidence of asbestos disease previous versions of the bill included leve l for lung cancer without evidence of pleural disease or asbestosis but s 3274 has such level in effect accepting the argument that when asbestos causes lung cancer there is almost always identifiable asbestos damage mixed dust silicosis oftentimes asbestos exposure occurs in combination with silicosis cern about potential use of mixed dust lawsuits to circumvent the ending of asbestos suits23 led to new subsection 403b it requires in effect that anyone suing over silica disease must show that asbestos was not substantial contributing factor to ones impairment the tobacco question underlying most of thes disputes is the relevance of smoking history the committee report st ated that the fund is not intended to be compensation system for smokers which would otherwise overwhelm the fund leaving money for asbestos victims thus the compensation scheme discounts the awards to smokers in two ways first the three lung cancer levels two in the current version of the bill are distinguished by the degree of pathology or xray evidence linking the cancer to asbestos implicitly higher probability is attributed to other causes eg tobacco or radon wh ere the link to asbestos causation is less certain and third level wa s deleted altogether second levels are divided explicitly into sublevels for smokers former smokers24 and nonsmokershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs12 25 both sides were supported by expert witnesses the committee majority in favor of the bill relied particularly on testimony of dr james crapo of the university of colorado the dissenting minority claimed scientific consen for synergy as expressed by institutions such as the national toxicology program dep artment of health and human services and the international agency for research on cancer compare committee report pp 6466 with pp 200202 26 according to the bill text diagnoses of non malignant conditions levels i through v can be rendered by any physician however the committee report at p 39 expressed the intent that the documentation would be pr ovided by an appropriately boardcertified physician in occupational medicine or pulmona ry medicine while recognizing that access to same may not be feasible for all cl aimants due to geographical constraintsthe resulting scheme has b een criticized from both sides on the one hand as noted some claim that asbestos is almo st never the cause of cancer without also causing clinical asbestosis so there shou ld be level vii on the other side plaintiff advocates note that high percentage of the blue collar workers most exposed to asbestos were indeed smokers so that the widely publicized figure of up to 1 million for lung cancer would be received by very few key point of disagreemen t is whether there is synergy between tobacco and asbestos in causing cancer many believe that there is such synergistic effect ie when one is exposed to both asbestos and tobacco the risk of lung cancer is enhanced greatly beyond the sum of the two f actors independently if this is so then it could be argued that the awards to smoke rs should not be reduced very much visa vis nonsmokers however differing tes timony on the matter was received by the committee and consensus not reached25 diagnostic quality control in addition to the foregoing disagreements about defining eligible medi cal categories there is the issue of types of evidence to be deemed credible in the existing tort law system plaintiffs present evidence favorable to their case and fendants have an opportunity to challenge it since s 3274 would replace tort law with nona dversarial administrative system it explicitly defines what kinds of evidence are necessary and acceptable and requires auditing of the results subsection 121b sets genera l rules for expertise of those developing evidence thus 1 xray interpretations must be done by breaders certification overseen by the national institute for occupational safety and health 2 pulmonary function testing for asbestos levels iii to v is to be done in accordance with the standards of the american thoracic society and 3 diagnosis of malignancies levels vi through ix must be done by boardcertified pathologists26 furthermore guidelines are to be developed relating to ct scans in the

potentially caught between systems status of settlements and possible cash crunch in the first few years pending cases concern has been expresse d about claimants who may have their pending cases

was up and running but this was not included in subsequent vers ions of the bill rather s 852 contains certain deadlines for getting the process going first case processing is to begin immediately even before funding is estab lished exigent health claims eg cases of terminal illness are to be given prior ity and the administrator is to certify within nine months of enactment that the office is ready to review and pay exigent claims in cases of mesothelioma payment of 50 is to be made within 30 days of approval the rest in six months on another tr ack incentives are given subsection 106f2 to promptly reach negotiate d settlements for mesothelioma cases for participants in existing bankruptcy settlements the trusts are to set aside 1012 of their assets to continue making payments until the

until such time as the program does become operational pending settlements subsection 403c of s 3274 would terminate inventory or matrix agreements wh ich are openended st anding arrangements that pay specified amounts to claimants who qualify currently or in the future ones view on whether these or other agreemen ts should be terminated will probably correspond with ones overall ev aluation of the fairness of the proposed system visa vis the current tort system for example it is argued that some companies that have agreed to settlements will pay much less under the bills terms28 but as argued by the committee majority for passage 108th congress the pur ported unfairness ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs14 29 compare committee report pp 6971 with pp 206208 30 the administrator can extend the claim paymen t schedule to four years instead of three years if such action is warranted in order to preserve the overall solvency of the fund subsection 133a3 even so 50 of each award must be paid within two years 31 27 billion in years 1 and 2 5075 billion in years 3 through 5 32 repayment is not general government obligation but is limited solely to amounts available in the fund subsection 221b4preempting nonfinal settlement agreements etc rests on the faulty premise that the existing system is somehow fair29 funding schedule as noted large number of cases may be expected at the outset concern has been repeatedly expressed during the bate on an asbestos resolution fund about whether sufficient amounts would be available to promptly pay large expected number of claims in the first years final decisions in uncontested cases could possibly start comin g within 180 days of enactment and the first 40 installment on each claim is to be paid within one year of the award decision30 in anticipation of this demand the bill frontloads the collection of funds the stated goals of the funding program ar to collect 3 billion each year from defendant companies b collect more th an 20 billion from insurers over the first five years31 and c receive the assets of bankruptcy trusts within six months of enactment this would come to more than 35 billion within five years moreover the compensation fund could borrow both from the federal financing bank and the private sector the limits of borrowing authority are not specified numerically but defined in terms of what could be re paid from anticipated revenues over the subsequent 10 years subsection 221b332 the bill also authorizes surcharges for various contingencies in order to provide greater assurance to those claimants who are most ill there is lockboxtype mechanism section 221c under th is provision the administrator would estab lish separate accounts for each of the most serious diagnoses levels ix viii v and iv and reserve needed f unds to them first implicitly claimants in othe r levels would not be paid if sufficient funds are not available for the four protected levels sunset the ultimate guaranty that the program would not add to the federal deficit is that the funds fiscal status will be re gularly monitored and if insolvency is foreseeable and unavoidable the program will be wound up and cases be returned to the court system although the nominal lif of the program is 30 years it could be terminated earlier if the fund is found to be inadequate to meet all claims with each annual report the administrator is to analyz whether the fund will be able to pay all claims as due at any time within the next five years if such shortfall is projected the administer is to make recommendations for reform or termination recommendations are referred to special commission consisting of five cabinet members who will hold public hearings and forward its recommendations to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32286crs15 33 the phrase when needed would seem to allo w for the slowing of payments from three year to fouryear schedule as authorized by subsection 133a3congress however if the administrator at any time after claim processing has begun conducts an operational review and determines tha t if any additional claims are resolved the fund will not have sufficient resources when needed33 to pay 100 of all resolved claims while also meeting all other oblig ations then the program is to terminate 180 days thereafter thus the annual report with its fivey ear financial projec tions gives regular opportunities for deliberative mid course corrections but if insolvency inability to meet all currently assumed obligations ever becomes imminent the administrator is authorized to terminate the program in that case unresolved or new asbestos cases can be pursued in court albeit with certain restrictions in particular there would not be as wide choice of venue as at present the suits could be filed either in the federal courts or in state court where the claimant resides or experienced the asbestos exposure in the debate on the budget point of orde r critics of the bill disputed whether such scenario would ever be followed arguing that political pressures to save the program in the event of financial shor tfall would be irresistible thus they cautioned the acceptability of possible shortf all should be considered before going ahead with the program
