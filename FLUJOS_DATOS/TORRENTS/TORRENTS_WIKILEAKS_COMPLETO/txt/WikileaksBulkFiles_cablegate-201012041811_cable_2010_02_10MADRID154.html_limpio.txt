005 classified by polcouns william h duncan for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary and comment national court prosecutor jose pepe grinda gonzalez on january 14 gave detailed frank assessment of the activities and reach of organized crime oc in both eurasia and spain and spains strategy for how best to combat it in court as he did so he evaluated the levels of cooperation that spain receives from numerous countries grinda presented his remarks on january 13 at the new usspain counterterrorism and organized crime experts working group meeting in madrid see ref he provided 17page englishlanguage handout entitled the organized crime and the russian mafia which he used as the basis for his remarks which were more explicit than the document is note post will send copy of the handout to interested parties grindas comments are insightful and valuable given his indepth knowledge of the eurasian mafia and his key role in spains pioneering efforts to bring eurasian mafia leaders to justice end summary and comment bio info 2 snf grinda special prosecutor for corruption and organized crime in early december wrapped up his prosecution of the alleged oc network led by zahkar kalashov the georgianborn russian citizen who allegedly is vor v zakone thief in law the highest echelon of russian oc leadership and reportedly the most senior russian mafia figure jailed outside russia the defendants were arrested as part of operation avispa see refs b and c verdict is expected by early february according to belen suarez deputy prosecutor for corruption and organized crime and one of grindas superiors grinda is known to posts legat office as skilled and rigorous professional with deep subject matter expertise he is forwardleaning in his cooperation with the usg and grateful for usg assistance his work places him under considerable stress which make him suspicious of penetration attempts by intelligence services and causes him to have heightened sensitivities regarding his physical security grinda also will be the prosecutor in the trial for those arrested in operation troika see refs b and c nomenclature 3 c grindas was the first presentation at the january 13 meeting and his candor set the tone for an open exchange of ideas and information he began by urging those present to speak frankly with each other in this closed door session he said that what we are confronting is the russian mafia even if the term eurasian mafia is more socially acceptable and what the russians certainly prefer he acknowledged that the term russian mafia can be misnomer since these criminal groups sometimes involve ukrainians georgians belarusians madrid 00000154 0022 of 005 or chechens he nevertheless questioned the stigma surrounding the phrase russian mafia and noted it is acceptable to say sicilian mafia 4 cnf grinda stated that he considers belarus chechnya and russia to be virtual mafia states and said that ukraine is going to be one for each of those countries he alleged one cannot differentiate between the activities of the government and oc groups identifying the scope of the threat the russian mafia poses 5 c grinda suggested that there are two reasons to worry about the russian mafia first it exercises tremendous control over certain strategic sectors of the global economy such as aluminum he made passing remark that the usg has strategic problem in that the russian mafia is suspected of having sizable investment in xxxxxxxxxxxx 6 snf the second reason is the unanswered question regarding the extent to which russian pm putin is implicated in the russian mafia and whether he controls the mafias actions grinda cited thesis by alexander litvinenko the former russian intelligence official who worked on oc issues before he died in late 2006 in london from poisoning under mysterious circumstances that the russian intelligence and security services grinda cited the federal security service fsb the foreign intelligence service svr and military intelligence gru control oc in russia grinda stated that he believes this thesis is accurate comment see ref b on reported meeting between litvinenko and the spanish security services shortly before his death grinda said that he believes the fsb is absorbing the russian mafia but they can also eliminate them in two ways by killing oc leaders who do not do what the security services want them to do or by putting them behind bars to eliminate them as competitor for influence the crimelords can also be put in jail for their own protection 7 snf grinda said that according to information he has received from intelligence services witnesses and phone taps certain political parties in russia operate hand in hand with oc for example he argued that the liberal democratic party ldp was created by the kgb and its successor the svr and is home to many serious criminals grinda further alleged that there are proven ties between the russian political parties organized crime and arms trafficking without elaborating he cited the strange case of the arctic sea ship in mid2009 as clear example of arms trafficking 8 snf grinda said what he has read from 1012 years worth of investigations on oc has led him to believe that whereas terrorists aim to substitute the essence of the state itself oc seeks to be complement to state structures he summarized his views by asserting that the gors strategy is madrid 00000154 0032 of 005 to use oc groups to do whatever the gor cannot acceptably do as government as an example he cited kalashov whom he said worked for russian military intelligence to sell weapons to the kurds to destabilize turkey grinda claimed that the gor takes the relationship with oc leaders even further by granting them the privileges of politics in order to grant them immunity from racketeering charges the spanish strategy to combat the russian mafia follow the money 9 c grinda traced the history of the russian mafia in spain to the mid1990s when several vory v zakone began to enter spain he said that since 2004 spanish prosecutors have created formal strategy to behead the russian mafia in spain he explained that this has been topdown strategy done through extensive investigations of criminal actions by these vory v zakone living in spain these individuals have known jobs and unknown sources of income yet they live in large mansions spanish prosecutors have concluded that moneylaundering is likely involved and the challenge has been how to prove this grinda says that spains longtime experience in fighting drug traffickers use of money laundering has proven valuable in this regard 10 c grinda says the moneylaundering investigations have twofold objective to prevent the targets from profiting from the original crime and to prevent the targets from gaining enough clout to enjoy economic influence which grinda suggested sooner or later always reaches political power this is why spains attorney general has grouped together the prosecutors office for anticorruption and organized crime as part of this strategy to prevent mafiosos from enjoying economic influence spains strategy includes the seizure of businesses companies furniture and other assets 11 c grinda also addressed the challenges of combating oc when it enjoys political economic social and especially legal protection grinda applauded document provided by the us delegation which addressed the important role the media can play in warning the public of ocs activities and the threat that oc poses the media can create an environment in which politicians would be reluctant to be friends with and do favors for mafia leaders whom grinda argued need to be seen as shady figures to be feared regarding legal protection grinda stated that key factor in governments ability to combat oc depends on the extent to which the countrys best attorneys and law firms represent the mafia in this regard he asked rhetorically why is cuatrecases constantly defending russian mafia members comment cuatrecases is one of spains leading law firms its website available in english is wwwcuatrecasascom 12 c grinda stated that oc begins to accumulate both economic and political power when it begins to bid for contract tenders on civil works and infrastructure projects madrid 00000154 0042 of 005 he noted however that the vory v zakone do not engage in racketeering and murder preferring to distance themselves from this activity and focus on crimes that are further up in the hierarchy such as corruption of highlevel ministers the level of power that vory v zakone operate at is indicated by their level of interaction with these public servants because cabinetlevel officials do not spend time with unimportant people and cannot be tempted by those who do not have something important to offer grinda commented that gennadios petrov the chief target of spains operation troika see refs b and c was engaged in dangerously close level of contact with senior russian officials comment in surprise move spanish judges granted bail to petrov who is out on house arrest as of january 31 2010 end comment thoughts on international collaboration 13 snf grinda addressed the collaboration spain receives from other countries regarding the russian mafia early in his remarks he thanked the us delegation for washingtons assistance to his office on corruption and oc issues he said that it is important to have the doj fbi and posts legat office as collaborating partners and assessed that he and his us interlocutors collaborate in very efficient manner he added that the close level of usgos cooperation on oc issues is known in some circles and has led some to say that he and spain are the executing hand of the usg regarding the russian mafia he said that description is fine by him 14 snf grinda said that the spanish national police snp the civil guard gc spains financial intelligence unit sepblac and the surveillance division of the customs police together have compiled solid portfolio of information on the russian mafia in spain he added that germany switzerland austria belgium and the usg have been valuable partners in supplementing this information to further flesh out grindas offices understanding of the russian mafias activities he added that spain is beginning to collaborate with france on these issues but singled out the united kingdom for its lack of cooperation xxxxxxxxxxxx 15 snf grinda described oc as very powerful in georgia and claimed that the intertwined ties there between the government and oc began under former president shevardnadze when he alleges paramilitary group served as facto shadow presidency although grinda acknowledged improvements under current president saakashvili he said that there are still limitations in georgias efforts to combat oc citing his personal experience in trying to secure georgian assistance in the prosecution of kalashovs oc network in madrid 00000154 0052 of 005 spain see upcoming septel on the kalashov trial grinda said that he feels completely abandoned and betrayed by georgia and the explanations that he has received from georgia regarding its lack of cooperation are more pathetic than the betrayal itself 16 snf to illustrate his thoughts on the level of cooperation spain receives from russia grinda reviewed spains efforts to arrest tariel oniani as part of operation avispa see refs b c and d in june 2005 georgianborn oniani fled to russia hours before he was to be arrested in spain and russia gave him citizenship in april 2006 despite the fact that he had fled spanish justice grinda alleged that the granting of citizenship was neither innocent nor something done for free and was an example of russia putting crimelords to work on behalf of its interests grinda alleged that the russian ministry of interior and the fsb are closely protecting oniani in russia even in prison following onianis arrest in moscow in june 2009 spain requested his extradition for charges stemming from operation avispa to which russia replied that onianis russian citizenship prevented him from being extradited grinda said that russia always tells spain that it will take away onianis citizenship but it never does grinda said that from his experience virture of the russian government is that it will always say and do the same thing nothing 17 u the us delegation to usspain counterterrorism and organized crime experts working group cleared this cable solomont
