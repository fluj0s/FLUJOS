shsbc 79 how to security check lecture given on 2 november 1961 thank you well here we are at what date female voices november the 2nd two nov ad 11 its 11 year were being very covert this year all right im going to talk to you today about class ii skills in security checking and several new developments in this particular level and line that you ought to know about and if youre not up to the point at this stage of the game where you know how to read an emeter why there used to be an old gallows this was norman keep you know and well have to build it again and hang you but youve got time during the building to learn the worst thing about emeters is of course tr 0 tr 0 goes out if you havent had any tr 0 its not fairly flat you have trouble with emeters now an emeter is deadly weapon and you can slaughter pc with one by misreading it its not like rifle the only way you can do any damage with rifle is use it with great accuracy well of course you can also have backfiring sort of rifle and you can also look down the barrel and put your toe on the trigger experimentally but an emeter is not deadly at all unless its misused and if your tr 0 is out and youre looking at the pc and looking at the emeter and looking at the question and youve only got two eyes you see and you need three you can actually miss reads now the only read that is important is an instant read youre never worried about latent reads so you said the question and then you waited for while and then it finally sagged well youd just better go on to the next question because the thing is not there what all you want is an instant read you ask the question within tenth of second you get that needle reacting if youve got an instant read youve got read on the emeter if you havent got an instant read if it takes half second second or something like that providing of course youre using standard emeter of an approved pattern there are meters around by the way theyre corny stuff that has been brought around which have brought emeters into bad repute because they have second lag built into them have you ever seen one of these they used to be quite prevalent in england somebodyd go down to the dime store and buy bits of old tinware and hang it together with some electric light cord and they actually built lag into the meter so when you asked the question it wouldnt react for second we have some of them in here in the electrical shop ill have to show you sometime its how an electronics man can fix it up so that you dont get any results well that is an unexpected one and we cut that one out by saying you use an approved emeter and we know that emeter will react instantly and behave properly its not light thing to do work with bad emeter the british mark iv is the best of these meters it is not the least destructible it is little tenderer its better meter but it is more tender than the american meter the american meter can be dropped for three floors and go on working the british meter can be dropped one airmail flight and arrive at the other end with somebody having to look into it weve got most of those bugs out when we were originally sending these around the world by the way the extreme temperatures in cargo hold would crack the transistors quite interesting but we got that licked anyway with an approved meter you get an instant read and thats the only read youre interested in and youre not interested in latent read if you follow up latent reads your pc will start telling you what the other fellow did and what they have heard and that their aunt mamie had cat once that they think was stolen very valuable it does great deal for the case now the danger is you take too many of these things off the case you know i mean you get latent read and he says well aunt mamie had cat and this cat was in decayed state and i think it was stolen and i heard that and i thought at the time yap yap yap and if you go on like this youre going to wind up with needle getting more and more sluggish and more and more sluggish and more and more sluggish and dont you be puzzled after youve let somebody get off an awful lot of i heards and an awful lot of unkind thoughts and an awful lot of that sort of thing that you wind up at the other end of an emeter session with the tone arm not moving and the needle stuck and everything gummed up and the pc feeling like hell how come well you let him sit there and get off nothing but overts you let the session was an overt see i mean you let the man sit there or let the girl sit there and commit overts for ah hour all right so now theyve got all these new overts isnt that what it amounts to but your latent read when pursued winds you up in the middle of nowhere that works on all types of assessments whatever youre assessing pay attention to latent read read which takes place well be on the safe side takes place after half second now theres borderline in there the borderline in there some pcs have got sort of delayedbank effect and youll notice working on some pcs the sound itself takes moment to go through the circuit and if you really wanted to be absolutely safe you could space it out to three quarters of second but dont go any further than that comprehension is landing on the reactive bank which is instantaneous and those reads which are latent are landing on the analytical mind and the pc is figuring it out that works for all types of assessments so i say again if you want to be successful emeterer have your tr 0 flat so that you know what youre looking at you know dont watch the ceiling and watch the floor and then look back at the emeter to find out if its reacted because your instant read is the only important read and it is the one which of course you are going to miss naturally youll miss it you look at the pc and you say now have you stolen any lollipops today and then you look down at your emeter well its read and gone the reading is gone now this is why the emeter can be dangerous because we have learned that if you miss sec check question on somebody you can wind them up in ball not every time you miss sec check question does the pc burn down the house that is commentary on the psychoanalyst who says every time kleptomaniac fails to steal something he burns down the house i love that every time you see it classifies as type of remark of jewelers never go anyplace its just about as nonsensical it is not universal phenomenon that when an emeter read is missed and you miss the sec check and you leave the question and go on to the next sec check question with the last one unflat that the pc always burns down the house shoots the director of training or does something desperate this is not always true its just 99 percent there is still 1 percent of the time the pc does not do it your pc comes in to session next time natter natter natter natter unkind thought whooahnyapyapyapyap i wonder if scientology works and so forth and they go on and on and on and on and on and on and on you sit and listen to all this stuff when are you going to get smart enough to put them on the meter and say who missed sec check question on you and find out what it was and clean it up and the person says oh well this is very fascinating phenomenon that the fact of missing sec check question is apparently cross invalidation of everything that is going on if you couldnt nail them they now doubt its very funny i dont care how long or how often the fellow has been sec checked you miss sec check question on him he gets unhappy now thats very important thing because there resides the easiest way to get rid of new scientologists known so ill just lay it down there if anybody wants to go out on program of getting rid of every person they connect with that wants to have anything to do with scientology why the program would be to either audit with broken meter or squirrel meter or something that didnt react or to use type of tr 0 which confronts the back wall or your own eyeballs while you should be reading the emeter and miss sec check questions thats the first and foremost way of getting rid of people theyll blow theyll be very unhappy it messes them up i think some of you have little reality on that now and then why somebody has missed sec check question on you wildly and then you have found yourself sort of chewing your fingernails and nattering to yourself and not quite know what was wrong and then somebody fortunately comes along and says who missed sec check question or something like that and you get it off and straighten it out and all of sudden you feel better its quite mysterious its quite mysterious im not going into the mechanics of how this happens i can tell you the mechanics of how bank beefs up now ive studied that for two or three days and finally got the answer to that when you run the terminal which is not the terminal of the pc his attention is too bound up in his own terminal and goal to asis the collapsing mass so the auditor has being more in control of the pcs bank than the pc can of course push masses in on the pc but the pcs attention is so bound up in his own goal terminal that this new terminal which is being pushed in on him does not get asised and that is all there is to it in other words he hasnt enough attention to asis anything but the goals terminal which he is stuck in do you see that so his bank beefs up similarly your emeter starts up to the degree that the person is not asising what youre throwing in on him so you get high arm high arm high arm an arm goes way up an arm sticks the persons attention is too bound up in something else to asis what is being thrown in on him do you see this so you could sec check person into high arm as well as sec check person down from high arm now how would you sec check person into high arm well youd make sure all the rudiments were out youd very carefully make sure that all the rudiments were out before the security check was entered in on youd make sure that the pc was unhappy in the room had present time problem didnt want you to audit him had an arc break and had several withholds right in present time and then start security checking him on heavy questions and the pc cant confront the question cant give you the answer do you see the struggle which now ensues and he cant get his attention out of present time he cant remember the past and you actually could plunge him around until the arm would go high now it is not true that every arm going high during run must be avoided but you should understand why an arm is going high and why an arm hangs high during sec check or during any other kind of run an arm tone arm goes high and stays high if more is being thrown in on the pc than the pc can handle or asis period that is all there is to it let us say if pc were coal burner and he were able to generate enough flame to burn one piece one small cubic inch of coke per hour and you emptied the hod into the furnace youre going to get rising tone arm which of course is measuring the additional mass entered in on the pc which the pc isnt asising that make sense to you i studied it out the last couple of days to see what the mechanism exactly was here and what was happening and it becomes valuable so when pcs arm is high you can just make little side rule to go along with it that will serve you in good stead be very careful to do one of two things audit with the rudiments very well in or find where the pcs attention is stuck and audit that now that doesnt say that you should run an engram because the engram might have been the thing which was the hod of coal you see that might have been the upended coal hod the pcs attention was busily stuck gorgeously impinged upon flower youve been running process what flowers have you failed to withhold or something and all of sudden an engram comes up and you can ask too many questions about the engram and thats the same as throwing the mass in on the pc you see you can say whats the largest object in that engram all right now whats some other object in that engram now is there any masses in that engram of any character well of course that is understandably throwing heavy mass in on the pc but you know you can get the pc into the engram so the pc cant easily extricate himself simply by asking the pc too pointed and too direct question about the engram ill give you right wrong example of this this is the right pc says woo what an awfully big mountain i wonder whats going on here and so forth and the right thing to do is to say oh all right okay heres the next question and heres the wrong thing to do oh well what is going on around there see thats the same as upending the coal hod now dont be too surprised if the tone arm starts up right at the point you asked that question and stays up thereafter the auditor can push mass pictures circuits track in on the pc and move that track more easily than the pc this is one of the hardest things over the last eleven years this has been the hardest single point of instruction that the auditor can move the bank more easily than the pc can move the bank ive even given demonstrations and told the bank to go north east south west and somebody who was totally stuck on the track and couldnt possibly move on the track and all that sort of thing and i just said not even to the pc i said all right now it will change to the picture of theater it did you know the pc irrevocably stuck in this incident and cant possibly get out of it well all right the incident will now become the picture of theater bang it did he was longer stuck in the incident you can do things like this you can move the bank around more easily than the pc so your interrogation your interrogation of the pc can itself pin the pcs attention at various parts of the track where maybe it shouldnt be pinned its all right to get curious its all right to find out whats going on but there are times when you should restrain yourself just little bit the pc all of sudden starts looking very sad and you say what are you looking at well these pictures of these pyramids theyre very interesting pyramids and you say oh all right and give him the next question thats real smart you see pc starting to look slow and comm laggy you know all right all youd have to say is what about the pyramids when did they come up when did they come up isnt so bad but what about the pyramids do they have big tops do they have small bottoms is there anything going on around the base of the pyramid what is happening on the other side of the pyramid are there any ditches dug or anything like that around it this will youre writing script now you see so thats probably give him good arc break right at this point now you can go on and audit the process youve been auditing for another half an hour and you say what are you looking at oh hell say these damn pyramids of course you gave him the pyramids now dont be so alarmed about it because all youd have to do is take them away from him well how would you take them away from him the easiest way to take the pyramids away from him the easiest way is simply to tell the bank to do something else you know say well what happened toward the end of that life you know the bank will shift and you say what happened couple of lives later is there anything that happened in subsequent life to that that answers the auditing question oh there is oh well what do you know you wont hear any more about pyramids you can move the bank around one of the primary reasons auditors have trouble auditing engrams is they kept expecting the pc to move the bank they would sit there and they would say all right what are you looking at and be perfectly willing for the pc to go on and go through the incident but nobody was moving through any incident why because nobody was moving the incident pc was incapable of moving the incident and the auditor wouldnt all the auditor would have to say is well the end of the incident will now appear one year has now gone by the picture of that incident whatever is there will appear its very weird you know the pc says well you see i was beggar im beggar and i see all this and its horrible marketplace and im beggar im sitting down there and i got leprosy and so forth and its just not running dont you see and you say so on and so on he keeps saying well and this leprosy and i ive been leprotic for long time and hes getting more and more into the dramatization of the thing and so forth and you say well was there life later than that when you didnt have leprosy well in essence youve moved the bank he says well if you ask that way yes yes as matter of fact i havent had any leprosy since well what are you looking at now well im looking at small boy all right thats good wrong well does the small boy have leprosy you can move the bank around just by the most innocent questions you can audit actually with by moving the bank by innuendo not anything direct north east south and west just ask tthe pc about this and that part of their life now you expect pc to cycle through an arc question you just expect him to he cycles through an arctype process you see he goes out of present time he goes back into the past and back into present time again all right if you depend forever on that automaticity youre going to get lost somewhere because hes going to get into something hes not going to get out of you could always say to him youre trying to get him back up to present time well was there an arc break later than that or lets say arc processing well did you communicate to anybody after that oh yeah yeah well the following year did you communicate to anybody and hell have to say lets see what year was that and so forth and you figure it out for him you know and he figures it out and he says oh yeah well that was 1942 yeah well all right good now did you communicate to anybody in 1946 oh all right all right okay you did all right now did you communicate to anybody in 1950 oh all right good now did you communicate to anybody in 1955 oh yes yeah i did anybody communicate to you in that year oh ill say they did all right has anybody communicated to you in the last few days oh yes yes yes well have you communicated to anybody today oh yes and anybody communicated to you oh yeah as matter of fact you just did well youve moved the person up to present time by just interrogation interrogation with dates you just asked him questions about dates you didnt directly say the bank will now shift 189 years north but you could do that the reactive mind is always keyed to otherdeterminism and never to selfdeterminism and one of its common denominators is otherdeterminism so of course the auditor can always move the bank now in sec checking you very often get somebody into some kind of situation and by your pressure and your demands youre saying well have you ever stolen anything and the person says i havent well have you ever stolen anything at all now stolen have you ever stolen anything and the person says i havent youre not getting any read on the meter because youre not looking at it and you arent getting any anyhow well you mean to tell in the last two hundred years youve never stolen anything well now im going to when i snap my fingers something youve stolen will appear well all right all right when i snap my fingers something bigger you have stolen will appear all right well dont be too startled if the tone arm goes up it isnt an arc break you could probably get away with it but youve just given him more and more mass that he is not prepared to accept he isnt about to asis it and then if you just walk off at that point and dont do anything else about it you leave these things right there so make things vanish that you made appear good magician when he makes girl disappear on stage particularly at these straightlaced times of police and all that sort of thing usually shows her again to the audience you see well thats good principle good principle to follow its the decent thing to do of course in tougher rougher ancient times we didnt do that we showed the audience this brandnew trick you put the girl in the box and you put flaming torches in at every corner of the box and you opened up the box and there was girl and they thought this was marvelous and it was marvelous trick of course shed burned up but i call to your attention that youre auditing in milder times than that so when you say all right take look at those pyramids remember to say take look at something else all right now the auditor who is sitting there doing tr 0 on the report or on the auditing sheet only tr 0 for the meter tr 0 you see for the preclear tr 0 for the room and so forth hes got tr 0 has advanced as far as the point of ballpoint pencil you see and he can write and he sometimes can even read an auditing command off sheet but doesnt pay much attention boy the mans dangerous do you see why hes dangerous he not only never finds out whats going on with the pc but he never sees these instant reads in answers to his question he never clears these things he never finds out whats going on if something did go on he wouldnt do anything about it because he wouldnt think anything was going on all very fascinating but the high arm is often not always but is often cleared with withholds you get withhold off the case any old cottonpicking withhold it doesnt matter at all any withhold and youll see the arm start down little bit if it is withhold to the pc now what makes it withhold to the pc whether or not it is against the mores that the pc has subscribed to that is what makes it withhold we can broaden this definition we used to say well it was withhold if the pc thought it was withhold all right thats fine but thats not technically usable lets take more usable statement withhold is withhold if it is violation of mores the pc has subscribed to and knows about in other words you get violation of mores and you got withhold in other words if the withhold is violation of mores itll register on the meter the pc will consider it withhold he will give it to you as withhold and he will feel better all right lets get down little bit closer here why do some people feel so wonderful when you get off some withholds and others dont notice anything why is this why is this apparently spotty you sit down and you say have you ever robbed bank and pc you say have you ever robbed bank and he gets tremendous fall and you say to him all right when was that hahahahahaha and he says well that was chicago 1931 we robbed bank there was louie the pits and few of us guys and we robbed the bank and we we got away wit da loot and as matter of fact we shot each other afterwards and threw da money in lake michigan and then i was killed yes i robbed bank i i got recollection on it and so forth and thats fine and you expect the pc to grow wings at this moment you see and so forth hes gotten off withhold oh he wasnt withholding it nothing happens with the pc he did get fall we dont know what the fall is traceable to we ask him now did you ever rob bank and he says nah he says i never robbed any banks not any other banks than that and you dont get any more reaction on the needle and you say well now the pc should feel wonderful but he doesnt well it did fall so he should feel wonderful well you see robbing banks is not against the mores of bank robbers and there being so very few citizens who subscribe to law and order in chicago you see theyre in the minority that it doesnt make mores quite the contrary now he might very well go into get terrific relief on the thing you say well is there anything youve ever reported to the police hahahahahaha have you ever reported anything to the police hahahaha hm hm hey have you ever reported anything to the police oooooh he says thats really bad you got an instant read here come on come on come forth whats this you reported to the police you know good smooth arc here and he says well i i reported once my dog had been lost and the fall comes off the meter and he feels wonderful you say what on earth is this how come same fellow you see he robs the bank they shoot each other up they throw the loot they dont even get the money they throw the loot into lake michigan and so on and this has been terrific withhold and great unsolved crime of all time and here it is and he gets relief but he reports dog to the police and he says my im certainly glad youre auditing im getting such terrific results well thats because youre operating from one mores and hes operating from another as ive already talked to you about fantastic isnt it now supposing we find out something about the pcs past and we guess at what the mores of the various groups and societies hes belonged to might have been and we do security check from this particular level we are always going to get some kind of result but this is rather stunt proposition is there faster way to do this yes its called security checking by dynamic assessment there is the most available body of life or segment of life the most available segment of life on which he has reality against which he could be security checked and you will miss miss miss miss miss if it all still seems reasonable to you that he is sitting there in body part of race and so forth and so on and all these imsupposedtos are all taking place and this is social world and so forth and you think this is all ordinary and reasonable you forget you forget that its very unusual thetan is sitting in meat body in culture of some kind or another that is doing some weird odd things of some kind it is not usual and you know the whole thing can be security checked out lets look at it from that weird angle all right do dynamic assessment heres the way you do it dynamic assessment is done of course to find the most needle change of any one dynamic amongst the rest of them it is done really by change of pattern rather than largest fall or something like that it is done the same way you assess anything else now you can do dynamic assessment by elimination brandnew news for you that improves dynamic assessment bit you can assess by elimination itll leave you sitting there with one dynamic on which he has some reality all right what are the parts of that dynamic and we now are confronted with the task of composing great many new security checks they will be the teen series there will be check number 11 check number 12 13 14 15 16 17 and 18 and each one of those is subdivided as necessary to let us say second dynamic would be form 12 family that would be so form 12b would be something on the order of children you see you already have child security check but that should be its number and form 12c which would have to do with marital sexual relations and what is commonly passes for mores in the present society i think thats the total moral code is contained in that narrow sphere twelve d would have to do with unusual practices on the second dynamic and in other words you can get number of security checks plotted out here of course they go by the number of the dynamic so your 18 naturally is bunch of security checks questions on the subject of god theyre just religious security checks of some character or another so you have whole bunch of these things have you ever blasphemed okay that kind of that kind of security check have you ever used paraphernalia for other purposes have you ever used church for any other purpose than was intended you get the idea you just dream up all of the possibilities of misuseabuse crimes that fitted into innumerable areas of course number 14 would be your species checks and thats pretty easy but it probably subdivides and dynamic assessment could be done for the subdivision so that you could get not only the dynamic but you could also get the subdivision of the dynamic and you could wind up with proper security check but exact form security check is ever going to do the whole job youre going to have to add your own questions to it as they may appear your dynamic assessment directs you to that zone of life on which the pc has most reality and therefore would consider he would have the most crimes as it exists you will find pc all messed up on seven dynamics and able to be security checked on the remaining dynamic hes got some reality on it so hes done something to it he knows you see its his withhold now of course sec check form 11 none of these are written youre going to write them any time youre doing this and youre asking questions now by golly you write the question you ask down and i dont care how much little side time that you spend going off and grabbing off somebodys folder and find out what youre supposed to run on them next week and actually dream up security check make sure it stays in the folder and then we can go back over these things and we will get some horrendous thinking on the subject okay and it makes good show as matter of fact some of you who are not sec checking this week but who will be sec checking next week have in these folders right this minute out here you have this type of security check to do and those which are security checking will be security checking tonight you just run into it like truck hitting wall youre going to open up the folder and there it is and youre going to see well do an eight dynamic security check dream up the questions itll say all right well dream them up and you will find that youre getting off the case the withholds that come nearest to this pcs locus aberratus and there he sits in doing security checking lets get out to higher generality here on the subject itself the trouble with security checking is that the auditor is usually security checking from his viewpoint rather than from the pcs viewpoint the auditor is security checking against what he thinks would be crime in his own view and it is not crime to the pc so the auditor gets all upset because this question should have worked and hes got this bright sweet innocent little thing sitting across from him little highschool girl and shes sitting there and shes saying oh yes well i was raped in the third grade the fourth grade as matter of fact raped several boys in the fifth grade yeah as matter of fact im having clandestine relations at the present moment with my uncle except when im down at the firehouse so he says man you know when i get all this off when i get all this off and get all this straightened up this girl going to be flying right you know about three four weeks after hes finished this laborious task of security checking he walks by the firehouse and she in her negligee waves from the window what he missed what he missed was this what he missed was this her dynamic was the was the eighth dynamic and she was renegade from the temple of astarte and of course it would have been awful break of mores for her to have done anything else now if hed asked her questions such as have you ever been leaning out window and have not whistled to somebody he would have gotten fall and she would have gotten this off maybe with considerable grief she meant to do right now the odd thing about thetans is they are thetans that is the oddest thing about thetan and thetan is not natively member of any culture there arent just naturalborn eighth dynamic thetans and naturalborn second dynamic thetans and so forth they are just thetans and theyve come down the track by their own devious routes accumulating in their own peculiar way civilizations cultures mores group ideas and so on and some of them have come long way down the track without finding out any groups exist and all sorts of wild things have gone on you see its quite weird you see it isnt that everybody has the same body of aberration at all theyre thetans and in view of the fact that all the rest of this stuff is collected well its just what do they collect some collect stamps some collect blondes some collect debts some collect executions sort of hobby but the various mores in which they operate are registered very clearly and cleanly on the dynamics and as soon as you start doing this why youre going to see some interesting renewed upsurge results out of security checking of course im put to it right now i have to have zone and level of auditing which is comprehensible highly usable highly workable level of auditing prior to finding the pcs goal and terminal and i have to do that fairly rapidly because you have class ii auditor and he has to have body of skills so im not just busy inventing them im busy throwing them together its like the other day i looked up in horror in realization that we had coaudit processes of any kind whatsoever that could be trusted in coaudit by the new safety table i you look it over from viewpoint of the coaudit why youre in box thats bad spot but theres an old one 1951 that could be run in coaudit rising scale processing probably be gorgeous probably be gorgeous you can probably even do an assessment on the people as they walk in you know i mean you could take the old chart of attitudes and kind of work it out what did this fellow want he tells the coaudit instructor what his goals are all you had to do is pick out the column thats rising scale he runs hell make it its quite remarkable thing what you can do with concepts and that sort of thing leaving terminals alone the gains you can get now in this body of security checking here is whole zone of activity very simple zone there will be forms developed for this particular thing and all the security checks we havent got them all now but thats reason why i cant show you what it is or we cant use it dont you see you after all dont have to be led down the road with your feet being picked up one at time and set down on the cobbles by somebody else do dynamic assessment take the most active dynamic preferably by elimination take the parts of existence which might be the subdivisions of that dynamic look those over and take the most active one of those or the most fruitful one of those just dream up security check that has to do with it security check the pc on that particular zone and area you will be asking him things he never dreamed of were an overt hes doing them all the time and all of sudden its horrible oh god he feels terrible about that and he is so relieved vegetarian for instance that is also on the fifth dynamic she has other reasons that she could be vegetarian it might be on the seventh or eighth dynamic its something they should be doing you know because of some religious action or something of that sort but when pc is on the fifth dynamic and vegetarian and we security check him heres where your reasonableness will get assaulted you see youre going to ask this person such things have you ever eaten an animal and the needle is going to fall off the pin and youll find out hes been withholding every dinner he ever ate that had any meat connected with it and so on all sorts of wild things here you ask somebody along this line that falls on the fifth well have you ever walked on the grass needle falls off the pin hes liable to explain to you that he had to there wasnt any way you could go around the grass of course he realizes he smashed up lot of grass in his day you see you look on this as being so ordinary you know for people to walk on grass or kill plants or eat animals or something of this sort or chop down trees or do various things on the fifth this is all so routine that you wouldnt think bang like that that it would have any effect on case because its too ordinary and shouldnt have any effect on the case well that doesnt follow at all what has an effect on case is what has an effect on case you see what its what the thetan thinks is withholld and that goes back to what group mores are you operating against well any member of the old biological survey that was operating around here about six hundred million years ago has his hair stand on end whether he knows it or not every time new species becomes extinct on earth or every time man plows up another thousand square miles and plants it in cute cottages at contractor prices you see thats grim and his hair stands on end he knows its very usual and that he ought to be doing it he knows he should be doing it you see because its usual thing to do and thats okay and nobody else thinks its bad but he looks at this or doing something like that and he kind of its just not quite right he doesnt quite integrate why it isnt quite right he doesnt think the thought through he just sort of snarls little bit to himself quietly or he thinks of it as an overt or something and hes disturbed by it well its against the mores of the biological survey thats all thou shalt plant and populate planets pard they kept the life cycle going and balanced also i imagine any one of them that ever gets in schoolroom and the teacher says now we are going to talk about the balance of nature you see and they go back into the current biological nonsense about how there was spontaneous explosion of an atom somewhere in some sea of ammonia that got there by accident and then by natural selection and quite by accident everything got planned out this way you see well person thats been on that line is somewhere back in his bank you know things gonna go whirr and whirr well its an awful invalidation the time he spent on computers figuring out how many petals there should be on delphinium and of course then they wog him he finally doesnt like this explanation so goes over to the church and they tell him god did it and suddenly he begins to feel sort of megalomanic you know and its i wonder if i did create all these thetans he didnt do anything but run the computers that planned the posies on this particular type of planet but youll find these are overts when they register on that dynamic then you have to plot out what the overts would be on that particular line and you ask those questions youll find out the fellow has got overts hes got withholds and there he is and hell all of sudden feel much better and some odd and peculiar things that he has been doing in his life suddenly come straight and he remembers things and so forth you see men are very often so busy being ordinary that they dont recognize that every one of them is slightly somewhere extraordinary and this professional ordinariness that we get particularly in these socialistic times is great repressor it notises the differences and unless you can reestablish difference you can never reestablish differentiation you see its very easy to establish similarities and identities this is fairly easy to do man does this very well he just dismisses all problems by saying everything is alike you ever hear girl thats had bad love affair she says inevitably she says all men are alike thats her next statement they walk around and shes liable to be saying something on this order for some days or well hours anyway and but shes done the easy way out the way to solve all of mankind is simply and ordinarily and only to say that they are just all alike and thats it so you dont have to worry about it and then the next thing to do is if you want to dont want to have to go any further or exercise your wits any all you have to do is say well theyre all bad so the easy way to do is to say theyre all alike and then all bad and therefore youre safe and this is apparently safe thing to do you say well theyre all alike and all bad and therefore after this i will be warned and now im perfectly safe of course im miserable but im perfectly safe and person will then try to justify this kind of reasoning well that kind of reasoning is so idiotic and so simple and so stupid and notises so many things that its wonder that countries cycle down into some the great meltingpot togetherness of it all pigs are more equal than others you know this kind of this kind of an attitude it isnt that thetans are unequal but it isnt that theyre equal either perhaps at the beginning of track this might have been true but theyve been gathering inequalities for some time and then masking them by pretended equalities until theyre very hard to separate out well if you go ahead and look this over in security checking youll find out that the dynamic assessment is very marvelous way to get zone of life on which the person has overts and withholds and youll find that that works fine and produce some rather interesting results all right there is another thing called the problems intensive that we have been working on and ill tell you how to do this problems intensive its simple thing to do nothing much to it its form and you fill out the form and the only differences that you find from this and the first time i told you about it is you dont run the problem you fill out the form you get all the selfdetermined changes of the pcs lifetime then you assess those selfdetermined changes you find the one that reacts the most and then you ask for the problem immediately earlier than that change they give you problem if its the right change they will give you problem which is tremendous overwhelming problem that they have had for many many years and that is their present time problem of long duration and they would recognize that as such and that gets out of the road very nicely the statement of it of course makes it easier but now theres faster way of auditing it than running the problem problem is too close to still to be audited swiftly it isnt that problem cant be audited problem can be audited but it audits more slowly than approaching it through motion in other words its close to still problem is you ever notice workman when he runs into two pieces of timber that are going the wrong way in the structure he stands back and looks at it yeah he inevitably stops and problems are associated with stops so what you do is take it as still point on the track and find the area of prior confusion and then you sec check that area of prior confusion find out what the person was doing at that time find out what he withheld and from whom and how he did it and what he did and why he said it and you know that you just find out all of the things and stuff in that particular area which preceded the problem and all the change in the problem all you do with the change he made in life and the problem is use them as milepost in time behind which you look for the confusion and then you sec check the confusion and youll find out then the problem will blow unless its gone back fifty thousand years and youre actually trying to sec check his life as student barbarian or something which you can run into you get that area of confusion unraveled and youll find the problem blows the change blows and what do you know its usually accompanied by somatic of some kind and itll be some kind of chronic somatic and that will lessen somewhat or sometimes even blow entirely dont be disheartened after youve got the person goals terminal and you are running him on the line to have the somatic reappear where it really occurred on the track and itll reappear and blow now sec checking however will alleviate and get it out of the road and it usually stays out of the road so it stays lessened anyway and so doing problems intensive then merely consists of finding all of the selfdetermined changes person has made in lifetime listing those assessing those finding that change which gives the most reaction finding the problem stated by the pc which existed immediately prior to that change and then finding the area of prior confusion to the problem find that area and sec check the living daylights out of that area what was he doing at that time and whod he know and all this sort of thing and basically and principally what did he do and what did he withhold from whom now you dont have to do it person by person you actually can delete the assessment of the people in the list you neednt do that there is real point in it at all you neednt make list of people on problems intensive and then assess that list of people because its violation of goals terminal what you should do is just go in on the basis of an area of confusion find out who was present in it and then find out to whom he did what and from whom he withheld what and all of sudden the problem in majority of cases will blow now that is you call that problems intensive you see now dynamics sec checking by dynamics is an entirely different activity and it is an isolated activity of its own and problems intensive is an isolated activity of its own these things are distinctly different activities sec checking usually depends for its workability on the ability of the auditor to ask the right question at the right time now when were making the basic class of very functional type of auditor i mean an auditor that we would depend on the skill of that basic class ii auditor were not going to say that the class ii auditor is muzzled auditor and so on and so on you see the way we used to say there was class class ii is above that this person has got to have enough imagination to ask the right questions and put together the right questions in order to knock apart this mess thatd give him enough to think about and you have to be very good at it as matter of fact several members of this particular class are extremely good at this im very interested in watching it occur so we found the hidden confusion and that was the end of the problem you know bang bang doing it very well now whats interesting is is that you could sec check out of existence every outrudiment isnt that interesting you could take the room and you could take the present time problem you could take the auditor you could take the arc break and naturally the withhold and you could sec check out of existence all of these outrudiments by just asking for the prior confusion you find the rudiments out so you find out what went on before it you see rudiment cant hang up unless theres an unknown in it and an unknown cant exist unless there is withhold these people who walk around being fond of being stupid should get wise to themselves because all theyre doing is declaring that they have withholds here we have class of thing which is all of all of piece unknowingness forgettingness withholdingness and stupidity these all go together these are all of class they are not the same thing but each one interdepends on another its kind of another triangle like we used to have in arc and still have but unknown and stupidity and withholds go up and down accompanying one another they are hand in glove the more withholds person has the more stupid hed be the more unknowns he will have and youve got these three things just marching up and down beside each other and as you improve persons withholds if theyre actually withholds of course he will get brighter but if you think youre going to take member of the bank robbers security league and sec check him on churchmans moral code and wind up with an increased iq of course youre quite mistaken this will not occur what youve got to do is sec check within the reality of what the pc is and what the pc has done you have to sec check within that reality well there is one method of finding the zone by dynamics and another method zones of action by change that is the problems intensive well the hidden confusion was when he was in school all right now that is not anything but school mores it couldnt be anything but school mores it is not familial mores particularly its school mores the confusion immediately before this change that you assessed out was going to school so therefore its school mores its schoolboys attitude toward the parents schoolboys attitude you see toward teachers schoolboys attitude toward all the other aspects of existence well what are these what are these and whats the morals whats the mores of school thou shalt not give the headmaster an even break you know its the thousandodd commandments of the schoolboy thou mustnt peach thou mustnt inform on thy worst enemy all kinds of weird moral codes one kind or another thou shalt take revenge its quite weird you know somebody was mean so therefore all the other boys enforce the fact that there must be fight you know its quite weird but so is any of these moral codes and if youre living comfortably ensconced in sort of even easygo sort of society and youd say well i know whats moral thou shalt not thou shalt not and thou shalt not and thou shalt not and thats about all there is to it and of course i am moral person that is the emptiest remark that anybody ever made i am moral person there isnt any other kind it doesnt make him wellbehaved person except in one group the group that happens to have the same morals see that and then hes well behaved person only in that group its very interesting the auditors viewpoint can be thrown out the auditor can sec check securely from the fact of the presbyterian church and then with what amazement discover that nobody but presbyterians ever lives by the presbyterian church always discovers this with some shock and never under any circumstances realizes theres moral code amongst marijuana addicts see so that is immoral well look its only immoral to those groups that have moral code that says what the other side is doing is bad im not now trying to tear down and rip to pieces every single moral code that has ever been developed anywhere as matter of fact we have the only means that has ever been discovered of straightening them out i dont know how anybody can be presbyterian after having been roman catholic for fifteen hundred years if the presbyterian church was smart if it was very very clever why it would come around and find bunch of us auditors and get us to sit down with our emeters and put the congregation up the line out of the moral area that they are stuck in so that then they will hear something of what the preacher is saying i think its waste of air and church heat and few other things hes standing up there and hes ranting and pounding the pulpit and telling them they must not and just think of this fellow who is totally stuck in the nevergiveaplanetanevenbreak space jockeys protective association and heres this preacher ranting at him thou shalt not you must learn to become moral person and something in the back of his mind says you know i dont want to kill any more women and this fellow is standing up there demanding that i kill women and that is why i left the space jockey protective association because it was just too much just one too many women now why does the presbyterian church want to kill women this is what goes in crosswise you see in the reactive bank and the fellow is very puzzled about presbyterianism and he cant articulate what it is and he cant understand about it he just thinks that well its not quite for him and if you ask him about it almost on flash response what does presbyterian church want you to do they want to steal ships and kill women and even he at this point looking at that would say you know thats peculiar because they dont want him to commit if you raved and ranted at large group of people with great force and decibels of sound that they must not that they must be moral people and never at any time held up what you were talking about or defined morals or showed them any moral code or anything you just collect them at random and then just start screaming at them that they mustnt they mustnt be immoral so on people would walk out of there and do some of the weirdest things you should realize that there is act pronounced immoral in any one part of earth which cannot be found to be moral in some other part of earth so remember that when you are doing security checking security check against the moral code of the prior confusion and well if your prior confusion let us say is period after the person has been an auditor for years and its big confusion and it has something to do with auditing in an organization or something like this there was big confusion at this time and after that he changed something or other and thats the confusion you assessed and that is the confusion that you are security checking and youve learned that in his early life he was presbyterian or something you know hes probably crossed up one way or the other but probably the code he has gone against is the code he understands to be the code of scientologist not the written code of the scientologist the written code of the scientologist is not the code of scientologist oddly enough it is simply something that is held up as as some kind of model of action to keep us from getting our heads kicked in but we have developed quite structure of morality you know thou shalt not audit badly thats one of the foremost of them thou shalt not audit pc with pt problem it goes off into technical things dont you see and it so on person actually is getting into moral structure hes not into technical structure hes also into moral structure and by sec checking him you will find out that he thought of it as moral structure that was moral structure to him you look on it as technical structure but its moral structure he knew very well he knew doggone good and well that he shouldnt keep auditing this person badly after 330 am he just knew he shouldnt ought to be doing that because it was against all of his principles what he wanted to do and what anybody else wanted him to do and so forth it was just bad pc was getting tireder and tireder and tireder and practically finally spun in this gets to be hell of an overt somebody walks into the front room and swears and damns and screams and raises the devil about something or other and practically knocks the persons lease to pieces dont you see and you get that as an overt amongst scientologists you dont get it as an overt until they find out that they disturbed an auditing session that was going on you see all right they disturbed this auditing session well thats an overt something they shouldnt have done so gradually out of technical lines and out of behavior actions and group associations scientologists are building moral code of what they consider proper behavior and its built exactly and entirely against their experience not what theyve been told or what theyve been dictated to its built against the experience of what they know to be survival and what they know to be nonsurvival so you see you check against that moral code one way or the other now you have security check for an auditor now whether it embraces all those points or not is debatable at the moment i havent got the thing to hand possibly it doesnt but you see youre in the drivers seat if youre security checking scientologist you see thats easy thats nothing to it just all you have to do is say well what would i consider wrong you see as an auditor what would i consider wrong well all right ill ask him if hes done it you ever disturb an auditing session you ever done this you ever done that you ever written nasty letter to ron and couldnt get it back out of the post see anything anything you just bing bing and think those up just bang bang bang thats because you see youre auditing in the same sphere of the moral code now lets move it just one out youre security checking person who is your fellow countryman and who has gone to similar schools to you and so forth well this is pretty easy you know what youd consider wrong so you can ask him whats wrong and bang youll get all kinds of withholds and so forth and thats dandy all right lets move it out just little bit further youre member of the human race and youre checking security checking member of the human race well you get past the language difficulties you could dream up security thing you could you know you know enough about it vaguely other races and things and you could dream up something even if it was only have you ever done something that chinaman would consider immoral you know you had to be that stupid about it but you could still brace it in somehow or another here and get it through all right now lets security check monkey well what do monkeys consider moral what do they consider immoral i dont know i havent talked to one lately but they go on monkey code they must have one because they all behave alike as species dont they well they must have moral code of some kind or another which is racial code of some kind all right how about security checking blade of grass i can show you that tomato will register i can show you that cabbage will register on an emeter well the only problem there is not just how to get in communication with the cabbage see thats not the major problem thats not the only major problem the other major problem would be well what does cabbage consider immoral thats from security checkers viewpoint i imagine not to be eaten or something you never know about these things the basis of which you operate must be the viewpoint of the pc not the viewpoint of the auditor the only point im trying to make here you must you must security check from the viewpoiint of the pc always doesnt mean youve got to be in his ead but it means youve got to do some dreamup all right if this person was wrac was wrac for years and the incident youre security checking and the zone of confusion the prior confusion that youre security checking finds that she has been wrac for some years what is the moral code of wrac who knows well you could ask some questions about it you could dream it up have you ever spoken pleasantly to your commanding officer have you ever failed or refused to make catty remarks about sergeant see who knows what their moral code is but it might be immoral see it might be immoral to apparently be on good terms with your sergeant see it might be all kinds of wild things might be going on youre not sure because there are different standards of survival and the standards of survival can be so different that there it is its laid out in front of you your work is cut out for you but you always the rule is you always security check within the moral structure of the pc not the auditor you never security check within the moral structure of the auditor you just make damn fool of yourself if you do that you sound like parson yapping youve got moral code well whats so moral about it i dont know but there it is you got moral code now all moral codes tend to propagate themselves and people try to force other people into moral code within group and so on so an auditor does have latent impulse to force some old moral code of his off on the pc while he is security checking its perfectly all right to force any moral code you want to on anybody but not while youre security checking you security check by the moral code the pc has violated and youll get some terrific case gains youll get that tone arm coming down and so on well ive given you two excellent methods of doing this theyre very very good your problems intensive to find areas of confusion your dynamics assessment followed by security check along that particular dynamic line i think you will find these things are quite productive of interesting results the question very often comes up extremely well arent you just running perpetual withholds withholds withholds withholds arent you running withhold on the prehav scale it never flattens its one of these total duration if youve asked somebody have you withheld anything from george have you withheld anything from george have you withheld anything from george have you withheld anything from george yes that will flatten and that will run out but have you ever in the last two hundred trillion years restrained communication or restrained reach or restrained anything have you ever done this im afraid would take long time to flatten now it is much more rapidly flattened if you say have you ever overtly acted against or withheld yourself from some moral code that so on now weve got what his real withholds are we can get those out so it flattens as fast as youve cleaned up all the moral codes which he has violated how many groups has he belonged to i dont know its an unexhaustible amount fortunately you dont have to do it that particularly to get good result now theres one thing more here and that is the subject of the use of blame the use of make guilty in security checking and the ways of doing that and theres one more item is the use of critical thoughts in security checking blame has nothing to do with security check just forget it its just part of the prehav scale it comes under the heading of irresponsibility by the way not under the heading of overts and withholds to make guilty i notice theres tendency to ask peoplle if they have ever blamed anybody as security check and so forth and this just doesnt exist it isnt anything its nowhere now if you ask somebody have you ever made anybody guilty of _______ and security check question if you ask that bluntly just like that your chances of getting factual answer are something on the order of roulette wheel in vegas there it is because the thing that is wrong with your pc is that he or she has never really succeeded in making anybody guilty of anything anytime and they are still trying and the basis of their aberration is the effort to make others guilty not the fact of accomplished guilt you always use tried to make guilty attempted to make guilty such words as that must modify this made guilty have you ever attempted to make anybody guilty of rape thats perfectly proper security check question have you ever made anybody guilty of rape well this is vegas this girl and i dont know shes been raped by the firemen the police shes been raped by most anybody and everybody and just been raped for years and all during this period of time she has been saying you beast you dog get thee hence take thy dark shadow away from my doorstep and other equivalent remarks less ladylike in an effort to make fellows guilty and she has never succeeded in doing it and you ask her have you ever made anybody guilty of rape well this is nonsense she never has that is the answer and thats the reaction youll get on the needle she never has tried for years never succeeded yet but you ask have you ever tried to make anybody guilty ahhh well now thats guilt of another hue and youll find your tone arm is reacting to that one it can go up and down and back and forth do you realize that the only reason anybody has victimish motivatorish attitude is just an effort to make somebody guilty but remember its only an effort to make somebody guilty it is not successfully having done so now you can actually produce considerable change of mental attitude on the part of pc by saying now all right get the idea of your mother and father standing in front of you and saying theyre so sorry and then have them fall away and die thank you and the person will just cheer up theres tremendous effort to accomplish that exact end theres tremendous effort everybody has it its not singular theyve got something they wanted to make somebody guilty about and they havent ever made it and its still hung on the track so its always try to make guilty it is always attempted to make guilty it is always modifying word of that character and it is never have you ever made soandso guilty you ask judge in sessions you take him and you say all right judge and you put him on the emeter and you say all right now judge were going to find out if you ever made prisoner guilty and it gets fall man he has been sentencing them to be hanged he has been sentencing them to prison hes been banishing them out of the society hes been shooting them from guns for years and years and years why theyve been sent to old bailey and wormwood scrubs and here they go and hes never in his estimation succeeded in making one feel guilty they always have the insouciance as they walk out the door well i really didnt do it you see and hes just dog and somehow or another i will bear up with all this see hes always got this as his image he didnt succeed in making the fellow guilty he pronounced sentence you say have you ever pronounced sentence he will also say yes oh yes ive pronounced sentence pronounced sent you probably wont get any fall on the meter either thats what hes supposed to do pronounce sentence but you say have you ever tried to make prisoner guilty the thing will fall off its pin just run by the hour you just well how many prisoners do you want just one two three four five six seven eight oh joe and pete and roy and masses masses and masses of prisoners because every time one of these ones would come up accused of some very hideous crime he didnt think his punishment was adequate half the time or he didnt think the person would experience it in any way and hes busy pounding with the gavel and screaming at the fellow hang him by the neck until hes dead dead dead and the prisoner looks at him you know and goes kind of white and walks away all the judge gets is reaction after that that somebody wont speak to him now see the fact of making the other fellow guilty may have been accomplished but the person seldom finds out about it may have been accomplished but what he does know for sure is that he attempted to you could get great deal of response but its always try and attempt now another little point id like to bring up about security checking is debatable one this isnt clearcut point whether or not you should ever take an unkind thought as an overt i say its debatable just for this reason that sometimes its the only thing that is available on the pc apparently you can find nothing else but they thought an unkind thought about somebody and that was an overt and they withheld it and it sort of frees up and it few of these gotten off will make the person feel more friendly and so on yes theres some reaction to it but apparently and this is not on my own observation but apparently there is evidence to the effect that person with body of unkind thoughts against something or somebody has an actual overt which he is wi or she is withholding underneath those unkind thoughts and just like you see little flag waving above the powder mine you go along and flutter at the flag you see and you dont pay any attention to the mine you just dont get anything done about it you know you just monkey with the flag you know well i had an unkind thought so you make the flag wave little bit more you know and factually theres powder mine there and you say what have you got underneath this here critical unkind thought nothing i have been pure honest good samaritan washing my feet properly morning noon and night and drying it in my wifes hair ive been doing all the moral things i should be doing youd be surprised how many moral things there are and i have never done anything in my whole life to that person and i have withholds of any kind well theres little plumes theres couple little openings were going to have to put in up here when we start this type of security checking to let the smoke out of the emeter because its going to react so there is evidence to the effect that if you get some unkind thoughts you ought to whistle up for the bulldozers and the cranes and the big grab hooks to reach in and find out what the devil the overt is because the unkind thought is apparently the indicator which shows that an overt and withhold exist and if you audit unkind thoughts in security checking as themselves you are doing the same thing as leaving security check question unflat so this is another reason apparently why pc can be given security check and they get off lot of unkind thoughts unkind thoughts and then all of sudden why the needle gets all gummy and they just dont feel so good and they arent so good and so forth well actually the unkind thoughts were indicators the little flag was waving in the breeze and the auditor never really asked comprehensive question such as what have you done to william nothing thooong what was that what are you withholding from william nothing nothing but his inheritance and his wife and all of his baggage and few things like that you see but it comes up as well i thought williams tie wasnt so nice today so thats big overt actually those things are not sufficiently important they are not adequate to aberrate anybody they wont do much for case but they are indicators and there are several things in life which are these little indicators and something big lies under them now it isnt necessarily true though that the pc can get to it at his state of case now its something that you could kind of you may not even get reaction on it on the meter its too unreal to the individual see but little x across over in the border on the security check indicates to you that sometime someday this pc is going to come up the line and then youre going to find out well william well actually he didnt do anything to william really but when william was dead broke and didnt have any train fare he made him walk from london to east grinstead and when he got to east grinstead and so forth had made sure that the place that was going to employ him had bad reference on him yet he hadnt done anything to him you know and it was in the rain and he got pneumonia and died otherwise hes done nothing to william but pcs are not good at facing up to overts so they miss them in that particular character all right well there you are and i hope this gives you some more data some more interesting insights in security checking but remember that security checking belongs in the category of metering and unless you operate the meter security checking is very dangerous pastime and i wouldnt attempt it if i couldnt run meter thank you very much
