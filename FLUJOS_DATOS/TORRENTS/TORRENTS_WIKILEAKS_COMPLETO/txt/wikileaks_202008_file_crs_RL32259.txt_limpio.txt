terrorist organizations ftos pair of december 2003 attempts to assassinate pakistans president musharraf reportedly were linked to qaeda lethal but failed attempts to assassinate other top pakistani officials in summer 2004 also were linked to qaedaallied groups security officers in pakistan have enjoyed notable successes in breaking up significant qaeda and related networks operating in

launched major military operations in south and southwest asia as part of the global usled antiterrorism effort operation enduring freedom in afghanistan has seen substantive success with the vital assistance of neighboring pakistan yet the united states remains concerned that members of qaeda and its taliban supporters have found haven and been able at least partially to regroup in pakistani cities and in the rugged pakistanafghanistan border region this latter area is inhabited by ethnic pashtuns who express solidarity with antius forces qaeda also reportedly has made alliances with indigenous pakistani terrorist groups that have been implicated in both antiwestern attacks in pakistan and terrorism in indian kashmir these groups seek to oust the government of president gen pervez musharraf and have been named as being behind two december 2003 assassination attempts that were only narrowly survived by the pakistani leader in fact pakistans struggle with militant islamic extremism appears for some to have become an matter of survival for that country2 along with these concerns the united states expresses an interest in the cessation of crossborder infiltration by separatist militants based in pakistanicontrolled areas who traverse the kashmiri line of control loc to engage in terrorist activities both in indian kashmir and in indian cities us designated

top us policy goal in the region is combating terror and the conditions that breed terror in the frontline states of afghanistan and pakistan3 the 911 commission report released in july 2004 emphasizes that the mounting of largescale international terrorist attacks appears to require sanctuaries in which terrorist groups can plan and operate with impunity it also notes that qaeda benefitted greatly from its former sanctuary in afghanistan that was in part made possible by logistical networks that ran through pakistan the report further notes that pakistans vast unpoliced regions remain attractive to extremist groups and that almost all of the 911 attackers traveled the northsouth 1 terrorism here is understood as being premeditated politically motivated violence

by monitors the ltte also announced in may 2005 that it is looking at acquiring an air capability which is in violation of the ceasefire and could be destabilizing due to the possibility that such

thenus special envoy and ambassador to afghanistan zalmay khalilzad warned that resurgent taliban and qaeda forces presented serious threat to afghan reconstruction efforts in the wake of spring 2004 military operations by pakistan near the afghan border the afghan foreign minister praised pakistan for its role in fighting terrorism but afghan president karzai expressed concern that militants trained on pakistani territory continue to cross into afghanistan to mount antigovernment attacks there35 karzai paid visit to islamabad in august 2004 where president musharraf assured him that pakistan would not allow extremists to use pakistani territory to disrupt upcoming afghan elections just days before those october 2004 elections islamabad announced having moved extra troops and quick reaction forces near the afghan border to prevent militant infiltrations although the top us general in afghanistan had earlier expressed concerns that qaedalinked operatives were actively encouraging militants to disrupt the elections the successful and mostly peaceful polling led him to later declare that the taliban were longer meaningful threat to afghan stability36 however the influence of pashtun tribal animosities and lingering protaliban sentiments combined with reports that some elements of pakistans security apparatus and islamist religious parties remain sympathetic to antius forces 33 in december 2004 president musharraf claimed that bin ladens trail had gone cold with recent intelligence on where he and his top lieutenants were hiding he suggested that the united states was partly responsible because shortage of usled forces on the afghan side of the border had left voids however in june 2005 musharraf called it likely that bin laden was still alive and

implemented any program to register madrassas follow their financing or control their curricula102 many speculate that musharrafs reluctance to enforce reform efforts is rooted in his desire to remain

the early 1980s islamabads leaders have for decades supported and manipulated islamic extremism as means of forwarding their perceived strategic interests in the region thus despite pakistans crucial cooperation there continue to be doubts about islamabads full commitment to core us concerns in the vast lawless zones of the afghanpakistani border region where islamic extremists find shelter114 until september 2001 islamabads was one of only three world governments to recognize the afghan taliban regime and pakistan had been providing material support to the taliban movement throughout the 1990s especially worrisome are indications that members of the taliban continue to receive logistical and other support inside pakistan senior us senators reportedly have voiced such worries including concern that elements of pakistans intelligence agencies might be helping members of the taliban and other islamic militants115 in august 2003 at least three pakistani army officers including two colonels were arrested on suspicion of having ties to qaeda soon after then deputy secretary of state armitage was quoted as saying he does not think that affection for working with us extends up and down the rank and file of the pakistani security community116 in october 2003 testimony before the senate foreign relations committee assistant secretary of defense peter rodman said there are elements in the pakistani government who we suspect are sympathetic to the old policy of before 911 adding that there still existed in northwestern pakistan radical islamic infrastructure that spews

security interests it is dangerous for the pakistani military to completely remove the threat of extremism to kabul and delhi he went on to characterize full and sincere decision by islamabad to

focused specifically on pakistan and counterterrorism one area in which there appeared to be consensus among the threeperson panel of veteran pakistan watchers was the potential problems inherent in us overreliance on president gen pervez musharraf as an individual at the potential cost of more positive development of pakistans democratic institutions and civil society many analysts believe such development is key to the longterm success of stated us policy in the region according to one expert the united states is attempting to deal with pakistan through policy triage and by focusing on the personal leadership of president musharraf both of which are flawed concepts another provided similar analysis asserting that musharraf is best seen as marginal satisfier who will do only the minimum expected of him this analyst recommended that the united states must alter the impression our support for pakistan is essentially support for musharraf sentiment echoed by many pakistani commentators as well these perspectives suggest that many observers reject the specific conclusion of the 911 commission report that musharrafs government is the best hope for stability in pakistan and afghanistan119 pakistani military operations background in an effort to block infiltration along the pakistanafghanistan border islamabad had by the end of 2002 deployed some 70000 troops to the region in april 2003 the united states pakistan and afghanistan formed tripartite commission to coordinate their efforts to stabilize the border areas in june 2003 in what may have been response to increased us pressure islamabad for the first time sent its armed forces into the federally administered tribal areas fata in search of qaeda and taliban fighters who have eluded the usled campaign in afghanistan by september 2003 islamabad had up to 25000 troops in the tribal areas and major operation the first ever of its kind took place in coordination with usled forces on the afghan side of the border firefight in early october saw pakistani security forces engage suspected qaeda fugitives in south waziristan the southernmost of the fatas seven districts which borders afghanistans paktika

government was finding it more difficult politically to pursue taliban members who enjoy ethnic and familial ties with pakistani pashtuns121 after the two december 2003 attempts on president musharrafs life the pakistan military increased its efforts in the fata many analysts speculated that the harrowing experiences brought significant shift in musharrafs attitude and caused him to recognize the dire threat posed by radical groups based in his country in february 2004 musharraf made his most explicit admission to date that muslim militants were crossing from pakistan into afghanistan to battle coalition troops there in the same month the vice chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff told congressional panel that the islamabad government had taken some initiatives to increase their military presence on the border such as manned outposts regular patrols and security barriers by august 2004 75000 pakistani troops were in the western border areas islamabads more energetic operations in the western tribal regions brought vocal criticism from musharrafs detractors among islamist groups many of whom accuse him of taking orders from the united states122 operations in 2004 in march 2004 up to 6000 pakistani soldiers took part in pitched 12day battle with islamic militants in south waziristan more than 130 people were killed in the fighting including 46 pakistani soldiers but high value qaeda or taliban fugitives were killed or captured pakistani officials called the operation victory but the apparent escape of militant leaders coupled with the vehement and lethal resistance put up by their wellarmed cadre believed to be remnants of the islamic movement of uzbekistan led many observers to call the operation failure marked by poor intelligence and hasty planning123 during the course of the battle pakistani troops began bulldozing the homes of wazirs who were suspected of providing shelter to foreign terrorists and the united states made shortnotice delivery of 2500 surplus protective vests to the pakistani military124 concurrent with these developments the islamabad government made progress in persuading pashtun tribal leaders to undertake their own efforts by organizing tribal lashkars or militias for the purpose of detaining or at least expelling 121 see the testimony of both william taylor and brig gen gary north

the understanding that they would be allowed to remain in pakistan if they forswore terrorism the original date passed without single registrant coming forward and the government extended the deadline on several occasions on april 24 2004 the five mostwanted pashtun tribesmen surrendered to government authorities and were immediately granted amnesty in return for promises that they would not provide shelter to qaeda members or their supporters all five were reported to be supporters of maulana fazlur rehmans jui islamist party islamabad insisted that this shakai agreement would mark diminution of its counterterrorism efforts but the top us military officer in afghanistan at the time lt gen david barno expressed concern that pakistans strategy of seeking reconciliation with militants in western tribal areas could go in the wrong direction almost immediately upon making the deal the most outspoken of the tribal militants 27yearold nek mohammed who had fought with the taliban in afghanistan issued threats against islamabad and pledged his fealty to fugitive taliban chief mohammed omar during the following weeks series of what some analysts called spurious deals were struck between the government and foreign militants but these proved unsuccessful after the foreigners failed to register and numerous tribal militias sought but failed to capture any of them127 in response to this apparent failure of its conciliatory approach islamabad ordered authorities in south waziristan to shutter more than 6000 merchant shops in an effort to use economic pressure against uncooperative tribesmen and massive mobilization of federal troops was reported then in june the government rescinded its amnesty offer to the five key militants noted above and issued kill or

attacks in south waziristan the elders had been assisting army efforts to capture or kill fugitive islamic militants in the region140 despite this violence pakistani officials insist that qaedalinked militants have been completely eradicated from south waziristan141 fallout as was noted above president musharrafs postseptember 2001 policy reversals and his efforts to crack down on islamic extremist groups likely motivated the two deadly december 2003 attempts to assassinate the pakistani leader as pakistans coercive counterterrorism policies became more vigorous numerous observers warned that increased government pressure on tribal communities and military operations in the fata were creating backlash sparking unrest and strengthening proal qaeda sentiments both there and in pakistans southern and eastern cities142 developments in 2004 appeared to have borne out these analyses as his army battled militants in south waziristan in june of that year president musharraf told

tactics that focused on attacks by smaller cells conducting widespread assassinations of military police and party officials226 the unpopularity of this policy appears to have led the maoists to shift policy again and declare that they would not carry out further political killings or further destroy government infrastructure despite this guarantee attacks continue in may 2005 maoist commander in

continues to designate the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte as foreign terrorist organization in 2005 more than 64000 people are thought to have died during this conflict over the last 20 years and the ltte has consistently been one of the most effective and active users of suicidebomber tactics in the world in addition some analysts claim to have observed or heard of efforts by the ltte recently to establish an air capability by the acquisition of two cessnaclass light aircraft if true this represents worrisome event as the lttes past history shows penchant for adapting other means of transportation such as cars motorbikes and naval craft for suicide bomb attacks and it is not farfetched to assume that the same could be done with these aircraft the black tigers unit the elite specialoperations cadre of the ltte are those charged with carrying out such terrorist operations and it could be appropriate to watch for signs that these cadre members are receiving flight training to further verify any new air capabilities norwegianbrokered peace process has produced notable successes though it was suspended by the ltte in the spring of 2003 due to differences over interim administration arrangements in february 2002 permanent ceasefire was reached and generally has been observed by both sides in september 2002 the government in colombo and the ltte held their first peace talks in seven years with the ltte indicating that it was willing to accept autonomy rather than independence for tamil majority regions the two sides agreed in principle to seek solution through federal structure however ltte leader prabakaran has stated that there may be return to fighting the period from 2004 to early 2005 has witnessed increasing instability within the ranks of both the sinhalese government and the ltte which has led to increasing concern over the future of the peace process in june of 2005 christina rocca the assistant secretary for south asian affairs told house international relations committee panel that the united states continues to support norways facilitation of peace settlement in sri lanka the ceasefire of 2002 is holding although violence is ongoing and the peace process has stalled this is due in part to divisions within the sri lankan government and the absence of trust between the government and the ltte which continues to use assassinations and suicide bombers underscoring their character as an organization wedded to terrorism and justifying their designation as foreign terrorist organization231 the ltte has also of late experienced instability and intrafactional disagreements in march 2004 there was major rupture within the ltte ranks vinayagamoorthi muralitharan alias col karuna who as special commander batticaloaamparai district was in overall charge of the lttes military operations in the eastern province split with the northern command of the ltte headed by the supreme commander of the ltte veluppillai prabhakaran and took an estimated 230 this section written by severn anderson analyst in asian affairs 231 house international relations subcommittee on asia and the pacific holds hearing on united states and south asia fdch transcripts june 14 2005 crs51 6000 soldiers with him col karuna then called for separate truce with the government factional fighting ensued between karunas splinter group and the northern faction of the ltte and resulted in prabhakarans reassertion of control over the eastern areas which karuna had previously operated since that time there have been numerous instances of political and military operatives being killed by each side as they jockey for power in the east the ltte has accused col karuna and those loyal to him of cooperating with sri lankan army sla paramilitaries and special forces in raids and targeted killings of forces under their command which the sla denies karuna has since withdrawn to fortified base in the jungles of eastern sri lanka where they have repelled several ltte attacks232 between february and april 2005 there were several recorded instances of serious violations of the ceasefire first was the death of high level ltte political officer kousalyane in early february which was followed by an increase in politically motivated killings of individuals throughout the eastern provinces233 in early april there was also much publicized incident when sea tiger unit attacked sri lankan navy vessel carrying peace monitor slightly wounding him this led to formal censure of the ltte by the ceasefire monitoring group the sri lanka monitoring mission slmm and marked particularly brazen attack as the sri lankan navy vessel was flying the slmm flag indicating that monitors were abroad234 232 pti news
