other mineral resources in the united states is impacted by number of interrelated legal regimes including international federal and state laws international law provides framework for establishing national ownership or control of offshore areas and domestic federal law mirrors and supplements these standards governance of offshore minerals and regulation of development activities are bifurcated between state and federal law generally states have primary authority in the threegeographicalmile area extending from their coasts the federal government and its comprehensive regulatory regime govern those minerals located under federal waters which extend from the states offshore boundaries out to at least 200 nautical miles from the shore the basis for most federal regulation is the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla which provides system for offshore oil and gas exploration leasing and ultimate development regulations run the gamut from health safety resource conservation and environmental standards to requirements for production based royalties and in some cases royalty relief and other development incentives in 2008 both the president and the 110th congress removed previously existing moratoria on offshore leasing on most areas of the outer continental shelf the 111th congress will likely have to address this issue soon after it commences as the continuing resolution that is currently funding the minerals management service mms is set to expire at the end of march 2009 other recent legislative and regulatory activity also suggests an increased willingness to allow offshore drilling in the us outer continental shelf in 2006 congress passed measure that would allow new offshore drilling in the gulf of mexico this measure was incorporated into hr 6111 broad bill passed in the final days of the 109th congress president bush signed the bill into law pl 109432 on december 20 2006 areas of the north aleutian basin off the coast of alaska have also been recently made available for leasing by executive order the five year plan for offshore leasing for 20072012 adopted by the minerals management service in december of 2007 proposed further expansion of offshore leasing in 2008 the minerals management service announced plans to adopt new fiveyear plan for 20101015 that would further expand offshore leasing this proposed fiveyear plan would supersede the previously adopted plan at the same time the role of the coastal states in deciding whether to lease in areas adjacent to their shores has also received recent attention in addition to these legislative and regulatory ef forts there has also been significant litigation related to offshore oil and gas development cases handed down over number of years have clarified the extent of the secretary of the interiors discretion in deciding how leasing and development are to be conducted

area designation the continental shelf international law defines nations continental shelf as the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond either the natural prolongation of coastal nations land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin or to distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance 3 in general however under the convention nations continental shelf cannot extend beyond 350 nautical miles from its recognized

while signatory to unclos the united states has not ratified the treaty regardless many of its provisions are now generally accepted principles of customary international law and through series of executive orders the united states has claimed offshore zones that are virtually identical to those described in the treaty 6 in series of related cases the us supreme court confirmed federal control of these offshore areas7 federal statutes also refer to these areas and in some instances define them as well of particular relevance the primary federal law governing offshore oil and gas development indicates that it applies to the outer continental shelf which it defines as all submerged lands lying seaward and outside of the areas under state control and of which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the united states and are subject to its jurisdiction and control 8 thus the us outer continental shelf ocs would appear to comprise an area extending at least 200 nautical miles from the official us coastline and possibly further where the geological continental shelf extends beyond that point the federal governments legal authority to provide for and to regulate offshore oil and gas development therefore applies to all areas under us control except where us waters have been placed under the primary jurisdiction of the states

states have 1 title to and ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective states and 2 the right and power to manage administer lease develop and use the said

jurisdiction some state laws are limited to single paragraph and do not differentiate between onshore and offshore state resources other states do not distinguish between oil and gas and other types of minerals in addition to regulation aimed specifically at oil and gas development it should be noted that variety of other laws could impact offshore development such as environmental and wildlife protection laws and coastal zone management regulation finally in states that authorize offshore oil and gas leasing they decide which lands will be opened for development the appendix of this report contains table of state laws regulating and sometimes banning offshore mineral development the table indicates which state agency is primarily responsible for authorizing oil and gas development and if state oil and gas leasing is limited to specific areas by statute g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g20g142g156g152g158g155g140g142g156g561 the primary federal law governing development of oil and gas in federal waters is the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla16 as stated above the ocsla codifies federal control of the ocs declaring that the submerged lands seaward of the states offshore boundaries appertain to the us federal government more than simply declaring federal control the ocsla has as its primary purpose expeditious and orderly development of ocs resources subject to environmental safeguards in manner which is consistent with the maintenance of competition and other national needs17 to effectuate this purpose the ocsla extends application of federal laws to certain structures and devices located on the ocs18 provides that the law of adjacent states will apply to the ocs when it does not conflict with federal law19 and 14 united states v louisiana 363 us

ocs oil and gas resources g15g152g155g138g157g152g155g146g138g561 in general the ocsla requires the federal government to prepare revise and maintain an oil and gas leasing program until recently however many offshore areas were withdrawn from disposition under the ocsla pursuant to two broad ca tegories of moratoria applicable to ocs oil and gas leasing those imposed by the president under authority granted by the ocsla 21 and those imposed directly by congress which have most often taken the form of limitations on the use of appropriated funds22 appropriationsbased congressional moratoria first appeared in the appropriations legislation for fiscal year 1982 the language of the appropriations legislation barred the expenditure of funds by the department of the interior doi for leasing and related activities in certain areas in the ocs23 similar language appeared in every doi appropriations bill through fy2008 as of the date of this report congress has not passed doi appropriations bill for fy2009 instead it passed continuing resolution that provides for continuation of funding of the activities of the agency through march 30 200924 section 152 of that legislation provided that much of the moratorium language found in the fy2008 appropriations legislation shall not apply to amounts provided by this joint resolution as result mms is free to use appropriated funds through march 9 2009 to fund all leasing preleasing and related activities in most ocs areas where such activities are not prohibited by other legislation congress may choose to revisit this issue when it addresses funding for doi beyond the march 30 2009 expiration of the continuing resolution the language used in the legislation that funds doi after that expiration date will determine whether and in what form budgetbased restrictions on ocs leasing will exist in addition to the congressional moratoria for most of the last 20 years there have been moratoria issued by the executive branch on offshore drilling the first of these was issued by president george h w bush on june 26 1990 this memora ndum issued pursuant to the authority vested in the president under section 12a of the ocsla placed under presidential moratoria those areas already under an appropriationsbased moratorium pursuant to pl 10583 the interior appropriations legislation in place at that time that appropriationsbased moratorium prohibited leasing and related activities in the areas off the coast of california oregon and washington and the north atlantic and certain portions of the eastern gulf of mexico the legislation further prohibited leasing preleasing and related activities in the north aleutian basin other areas of the eastern gulf of mexico and the mid and south atlantic the

memorandum that rescinded the executive moratorium on offshore drilling created by the 1990 order of president george h w bush and renewed by president bill clinton in 1998 the memorandum revised the language of the previous memorandum so that only areas designated as marine sanctuaries are withdrawn from disposition the withdrawal has expiration date the july 14 2008 memorandum taken together with the exclusion of the congressional moratorium from the current continuing resolution has the immediate effect of opening up new areas of the ocs for consideration for exploration and production ocs acreage not protected by other statutory measures can now be considered by mms for leasing as described infra however congress will likely be enacting new doi appropriations legislation at the start of the 111th congress since the continuing resolution only funds the department through march of 2009 it is important to note that other prohibition s and moratoria on development on exploration and production in certain areas of the ocs exist for example the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 enacted as part of hr 6111 the om nibus tax relief and health care act of 200625 created new congressional moratorium over leasing in portions of the ocs that do not depend on annual renewal in appropriations legislation the 2006 legislation explicitly permits oil and gas leasing in areas of the gulf of mexico26 but also established new moratorium on preleasing leasing and related activity in the eastern gulf of mexico through june 30 202227 this moratorium is independent of the annual appropriationsbased congressional moratorium and thus would continue even if congress decided not to renew the annual appropriationsbased moratorium

failed to comply with certain procedural requirements in making determinations the court established relatively deferential standard of review which it has continued to apply in later challenges when reviewing findings of ascertainable fact made by the secretary the court will require the secretarys decisions to be supported by substantial evidence 99 however the court noted that many of the

subsequent litigation related to the fiveyear plan101 in these subsequent cases the court of appeals for the dc circuit applied deferential standard in reviewing the secretarys decisions particularly in reviewing the secretarys environmental impact determinations such that the secretary could perform environmental analysis using any methodology so long as it is not irrational102 further these cases indicate that the secretary is vested with significant discretion in determining which areas are to be offered for leasing and which areas will not thus while the secretary must receive and consider comments related to excluding areas from leasing the court has clearly stated that the secretary need only identify the legal or factual basis for leasing determinations at this stage and explain those determinations more searching judici review of the secretarys analysis is not required 103 litigation under the ocsla has also challenged actions taken during the leasing phase as described above the ocsla authorizes states to submit comments during the notice of lease sale stage and directs the secretary to accept states recommendations if they provide for reasonable balance between the national interest and the wellbeing of the citizens of the affected state104 courts have typically applied the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard to the secretarys decisions with respect to these recommendations according to the cases from the ninth circuit court of appeals because the oc sla does not provide clear guidance as to how balancing of national interest and states considerations is to be performed agency action will generally be upheld so long as some consideration of the relevant factors takes place105 cases from the federal courts in massachusetts including decision affirmed by the first circuit court of appeals have while embracing the arbitrary and capricious standard found the secretarys balancing of interests insufficient106 however it should be noted that the massachusetts cases reviewed agency action that was not supported by explicit analysis of the sort challenged in the ninth circuit thus it is possible that given more thorough record of the secretarys decision these courts may afford more significant deference to the secretarys determination apart from matters relating primarily to the authority of the secretary to authorize the various stages of leasing recent litigation has focused on the authority of mms to require royalty payments on certain offshore leases allegedly subject to mandatory royalty relief provisions in kerrmcgee oil gas corp v burton the plaintiff an oil and gas company operating offshore wells in the gulf of mexico pursuant to federal leases challenged actions by the department to collect royalties on deepwater oil and gas production107 the plaintiff alleged the department does not have authority to assess royalties based on an interpretation of the 1995 outer continental shelf deepwater royalty relief act dwrra that the act requires royaltyfree production until 101 see california v watt 712 f2d 584 dc cir1983 natural resources defense council v hodel 865 f2d 288 dc cir 1988

production has been reached and does not permit pricebased threshold for this royalty relief108 the dwrra separates leases into three categories based on date of issuance these categories are 1 leases in existence on november 28 1995 2 leases issued after november 28 2000 and 3 leases issued in between those periods during the first five years after the acts enactment the third category of leases is the source of current controversy according to kerrmcgee its leases which were issued during the initial five year period after the dwrras enactment are subject to different legal requirements than thos applicable to the other two categories kerr mcgee argued that the department has nondiscretionary duty under the dwrra to provide royalty relief on its deepwater leases and that the statute does not provide an exception to this obligation based on any preset price threshold to the extent any price threshold has been included in these leases kerrmcgee argued that such provisions are contrary to dois statutory authority and unenforceable section 304 of the dwrra which addresses deepwater leases 109 issued within five years after the dwrra s enactment directs that such leases use the bidding system authorized in section 8a1h of the ocsla as amended by the dwrra section 304 of the dwrra also stipulates that leases issued during the fiveyear postenactment time frame must provide for royalty suspension on the basis of volume specifically section 304 states any lease sale within five years of the date of enactment of this title shall use the bidding system authorized in section 8a1h of the outer continental shelf lands act as amended by this title except that the suspension of royalties shall be set at volume of not less than the following 1 175 million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in water depths of 200 to 400 meters 2 525 million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in 400 to 800 meters of water and 3 875 million barrels of oil equivalent for leases in water depths greater than 800 meters 110 it is possible to interpret this provision as authorizing leases issued during the fiveyear period to contain only royalty suspension provisions that are based on production volume with allowance at all for pricerelated threshold in addition such an intent might be gleaned from the language of the quoted section alone indeed in this provision congress provides for specific royalty suspension method and does not clearly authorize the secretary to alter or supplement it kerrmcgees challenge to the secretarys authority to impose pricebased thresholds on royalty suspension was based on this interpretation of the statutory language above the us district court for the western district of louisiana agreed with kerrmcgees interpretation of the language discussed above the court found that the dwrra allowed only for volumetric thresholds on royalty suspension for leases issued between 1996 and 2000 and that the secretary did not have authority under the dwrra to attach pricebased thresholds to 108 pl 10458 109 this term refers to tracts located in water depths of 200 meters or greater in the western and central planning area of the gulf of mexico

context of proposed ocs development nepa generally requires publication of notice of an intent to prepare an environmental impact statement eis acceptance of comments on what should be addressed in the eis agency preparation of draft eis comment period on the draft eis and publication of final eis addressing all comments at each stage of the leasing process where government action will significantly affect the environment 112 as described above nepa figures heavily in the ocs planning and leasing process and requires various levels of environmental analysis prior to agency decisions at each phase in the leasing and development process113 lawsuits brought under nepa are thus indirect challenges to agency decisions in that they typically question the adequacy of the environmental analysis performed prior to final decision there has only been one nepabased challenge to fiveyear plan natural resources defense council v hodel 114 the plaintiff challenged the adequacy of the alternatives examined in the eis and the level of consideration paid to cumulative effects of offshore drilling activities the court held that not every possible alternative needed to be examined and that the determination as to adequacy was subject to the rule of reason 115 this standard appears to afford some level of deference to the secretary and his choice of alternatives was found to be sufficient by the court in this instance116 however without significant explanation of the standard of review to be applied the court found that the secretarys failure to analyze certain cumulative impacts was violation of nepa 117 thus the secretary was required to include this analysis although final decisions based on that analysis remained subject to the secretarys discretion with review only under the arbitrary and capricious standard118 as mentioned above nepa plays role in the leasing phase as well mms often uses nepa and its tiering option to evaluate lease sales119 the nepa procedures and standard of review remain the same at this phase however due to the structure of the ocsla process more specific information is generally required120 still courts are deferential at the lease sale phase in challenges to the adequacy of environmental review courts have stressed that inaccuracies and more stringent nepa analysis will be available at later phases121 thus because there

process continues challenges under nepa at this phase are often unsuccessful122 it also appears possible to challenge exploration and development plans under nepa in edwardsen v us department of the interior the ninth circuit court of appeals applied the typical rule of reason to determine if the eis adequately addressed the probable environmental consequences of the development and production plan and held that despite certain omissions in the analysis and despite an mms decision to tier its nepa analysis to an eis prepared for similar lease sale the requirements of nepa were satisfied 123 thus while additional analysis was required to account for the greater specificity of the plans and to accommodate the hard look at environmental impacts nepa mandates the reasonableness standard applied to what must be examined in an eis did not allow for successful challenge to agency action 122 but see conservation law foundation v clark 560 fsupp 561 d mass 1983 123 edwardsen v us
