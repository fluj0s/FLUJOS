fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources to support peacetime economic growth the energy crises of the 1970s spurred the government to broaden the focus to include renewable energy and energy efficiency over the 30year period from the department of energys inception at the beginning of fiscal year fy 1978 through fy2007 federal spending for renewable energy rd amounted to about 16 of the energy rd total compared with 15 for energy efficiency 25 for fossil and 41 for nuclear for the 60year period from 1948 through 2007 nearly 11 went to renewables compared with 9 for efficiency 25 for fossil and

fossil energy and energy efficiency specifically it provides comparison that covers cumulative funding over the past 10 years fy1998fy2007 second comparison that covers the 30year period since doe was established at the beginning of fiscal year 1978 fy1978fy2007 and third comparison that covers 60year funding history fy1948fy2007 guide to tables and charts table 1 shows the cumulative funding totals in real terms for the past 10 years first column 30 years second column and 60 years third column table 2 converts the data from table 1 into relative shares of spending for each technology expressed as percentage of total spending for each period crs2 figure 1 displays the data from the first column of table 2 as pie chart that chart shows the relative shares of cumulative doe spending for each technology over the 10 years from fy1998 through fy2007 figure 2 provides similar chart for the period from fy1978 through fy2007 figure 3 shows chart for fy1948 through fy2007 background the availability of energy especially gasoline and other liquid fuels played critical role in world war ii another energyrelated factor was the application of research and development rd to the atomic bomb and other military technologies during the post world war ii era the federal government began to apply rd to the peacetime development of energy sources to support economic growth at that time the primary rd focus was on fossil fuels and new forms of energy derived from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion from fy1948 through fy1977 the federal government provided an extensive amount of rd support for fossil energy and nuclear power technologies1 total httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22858 spending on fossil energy technologies over that period amounted to about 154 billion in constant fy2008 dollars the federal government spent about 464 billion in constant fy2008 dollars during that period for nuclear fission and nuclear fusion energy rd2 the energy crises of the 1970s spurred the federal government to expand its rd programs to include renewable wind solar biomass geothermal hydro energy and energy efficiency technologies modest efforts to support renewable energy and energy efficiency began during the early 1970s from fy1973 through fy1977 the federal government spent about 15 billion in constant fy2008 dollars on renewable energy rd 140 million on energy efficiency rd and 170 million on electric systems rd3 the department of energy was established by law in 1977 all of the energy rd programs fossil nuclear renewable and energy efficiency were brought under its administration doe also undertook small program in energy storage and electricity system rd that supports the four main energy technology programs4 does funding support for those technologies began in fy1978 funding for all four of the main technologies skyrocketed initially and then fell dramatically in the early 1980s 1 doe pacific northwest laboratory an analysis of federal incentives used to
