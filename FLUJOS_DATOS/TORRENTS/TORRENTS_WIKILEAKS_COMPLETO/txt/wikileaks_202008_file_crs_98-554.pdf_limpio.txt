proposed general statute paul s wallace jr specialist in american public law american law division summary there is general federal statute proscribing criminal attempts the federal criminal statutes are written in such manner so as to include only the attempt to commit specific substantive crime or substantive offense therefore specific intent crime would require that the offender sp ecifically intended to devise scheme to commit the crime the government on th other hand must present proof by inferences from the circumstances that the offender possessed the specific intent to commit the crime this approach to the law has led to patchwork of attempt statutesleaving gaps in coverage and failing to satisfactorily define exactly what constitutes an attempt in all circumstances as intr oduced s 171 would address these problems in the current law by adding general attempt provision to title 18 of the united states code which would define what constitutes an attempt in all circumstances it is also the intent of the legislation to fill in the gaps found in the current attempt statutes this report will be update d if legislative activity warrants the law surrounding criminal attempts has produced considerable commentary relating to the vagueness of its elements there does not appear to have been solution which successfully addressed the complete range of attempt cases1 there is broad acknowledgment that the elements are va gue probably because attempts to commit crimes cover broad range of different criminal offenses each criminal offense contains different elements hence the type of facts necessary to prove an attempt to commit murder will not be the same as those required to prove an attempt to commit embezzlement or arson the classical elemen ts of an attempt are intent to commit crime the execution of an overt act in furt herance of the intention and failure to consummate the crime2 initially the defendant must have been acting with the kind ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98554crs2 2continued v williams 136 f3d 547 553 8th cir 1998 united states v burks 135 f3d 582 58384 8th cir 1998 united states v price 134 f3d 340 35051 6th cir 1998

under which attempts to commit federal crimes are determined 1 those with free standing attempt offenses which have sentences distinct and related to the sentence for the comp leted offense and 2 those which define crime where there is the intent to do certain proscribed acts or to bring about certain proscribed result and though unsuccessful there is an act of prepar ation which must occur but the statute is silent on what act must be accomplished in order to constitute the offense of attempt the model penal code requires an act or omission constituting substantial step in course of conduct planned to culminate in the actors commission of the crime model penal code 5011c 7the mail fraud statute provides whoever having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to

commission of the crime he is charged with attempting3 then the defendant must have engaged in conduct which constitutes substantial step toward commission of the crime conduct strongly corroborative of the firmness of the defendants criminal intent4 otherwise when one is attempting to commit crime where the attempt is not an offense the law enforcement officials must wait until the crime is completed or find some other charge to fit the criminals actions with regard to general definition for the crime of attempt two requirements must be met 1 intent to commit the underlying offe nse and 2 substantial step was taken beyond mere preparation to ward committing the crime5 the proposed legislation appears to embrace these elements and would seemingly provide direction in defining what constitutes an attempt in most if not all circumstances6 selected statutes in order to violate mail fraud statute one must 1 devise or intend to devise scheme to defraud obtain money or property by false pretense s or sell or otherwise deal in counterfeit currency and 2 mail receive via mail or cause to be delivered by mail document for the purpose of executin g or attempting such scheme7 hence

defraud and mailing for the purpose of executing the scheme8 mail fraud is an inchoate9 crime the offender does not ve to cause actual harm in achieving fraudulent scheme to violate the statute10 because it emphasizes guilt rather than consequences the law has in the inte rest of crime preven tion prohibited inchoate crimes and attached criminal culpability at an earlier point in time11 in contrast to attempt which assigns culpability for substantive offensethe substantive offense itself requires only th at the offender intended the scheme to defraudthe offender may also be charged upon

murder or manslaughter shall for an attempt to commit murder be imprisoned not more than twenty years or fined under this title or both and for an attempt to commit manslaughter be imprisoned not more than seven years or fined under this title or both the requisite mental state14 although in modern recodifica tions an intent to commit some offense is usually set forth as an element of the crime of attempt15 however under 1113 of title 18 the ttempt offense is free standing ie it is not based upon the elements of the murder itself nd has sentence that is distinct and related to the sentence for the completed offense16 analysis s 171 would make criminal the intent to commit any offense if the person engages in conduct that if successful would constitute or result in the offense in this type of situation the attempt would be complete if the offender has completed the conduct that heshe expects to cause proscribed result it would also appear as if the offense would be completed even if the offender had not completed the preparation for the criminal attempt in this instance liability would depend upon the offe nder having taken significant step in course of conduct wh ich was planned to culminate in the commission of crime the bill would create an affirmative defense which could be claimed if the offender abandoned or otherwise prevented the commi ssion of the offense under circumstances manifesting complete and voluntar renunciation of his criminal purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98554crs5 17see 18 usc 24211994 18 usc 1991 1994 18see 18 usc 1114 1994it will suffice to preclude the impossibility defense where causing result is an element and there is belief that the re sult will occur without further conduct on the offenders part the defense would be rejected since liability is focused upon the circumstances as the offender believes them to be rather than as they actually exist major difference between s 171 and the cu rrent statutes is that the bill would proscribe attempts to commit all or broad cl ass of crimes whereas the latter deal with attempts to commit particular crimes the most common of the latter class are those statutes which provide for liability if person attempts to commit crime and in such attempt does any act toward the commission of the offense but fails in the preparation or is intercepted or prevented in the execution of the crime17 the question which might be asked however is whether s171 will have any effect on existing federal attempt provisions eg is it going to be crime under the bill to attempt to violate 18 usc 1113 ie attempted attempted murder it is also unclear as to whether the general attempt crime will be merged into the completed offense eg would every individual who is gu ilty of murder of federal employee18 be subject to an added penalty for attempted murder as well or in the case of single act resulting in murder could the individual only be convicted and punished for either the attempted crime or the completed crime but not both critics may suggest that s 171 as intr oduced simply compounds the inconsistent approach set out in the federal attempt law it does not replace the existing federal attempt statutes and its sentencing approach seems at odds with that which congress has chosen in the case of the other general inchoa offense statute sen tencing for conspiracy at the next lesser degree than the offense attempted versus the current five year imprisonment regardless of the seriousness of the underlying felony has the potential of being inconsistent lastly it is unclear as to whether the bill will expand the federal criminal jurisdiction to include offenses where the incomplete element is the federal jurisdictional element itself eg kidnaping under circumstances whic h otherwise is not federal crime inasmuch as the offender has yet to transport the victim across state lines
