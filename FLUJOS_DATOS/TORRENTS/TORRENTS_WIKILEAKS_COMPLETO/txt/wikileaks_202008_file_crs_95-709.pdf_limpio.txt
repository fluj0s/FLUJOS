between free speech decisions of the supreme court which protect flag desecration as expressive conduct under the first amendment and the symbolic importance of the united states flag consequently every congress that has convened since those decisions were issued has considered proposals that would permit punishment of those who engage in flag desecration the 106th congress narrowly failed to send constitutional amendment to allow punishment of flag desecration to the states in the 107th and 108th congresses such proposals were passed by the house this report is divided into two parts the first gives brief history of the flag protection issue from the enactment of the flag protection act in 1968 through current consideration of constitutional amendment the second part briefly summarizes the two decisions of the united states supreme court texas v johnson and united states v eichman that struck down the state and federal flag protection statutes as applied in the context punishing expressive conduct in 1968 congress reacted to the numerous public flag burnings in protest of the vietnam conflict by passing the first federal flag protection act of general applicability for the next 20 years the lower courts upheld the constitutionality of this statute and the supreme court declined to review these decisions however in texas v johnson the majority of the court held that conviction for flag desecration under texas statute was inconsistent with the first amendment and affirmed decision of the texas court of criminal appeals that barred punishment for burning the flag as part of public demonstration in response to johnson congress passed the federal flag protection act of 1989 but in reviewing this act in united states v eichman the supreme court expressly declined the invitation to reconsider johnson and its rejection of the contention that flagburning like obscenity or fighting words does not enjoy the full protection of the first amendment as mode of expression the only question not addressed in johnson and therefore the only question the majority felt necessary to address was whether the flag protection act is sufficiently distinct from the texas statute that it may constitutionally be applied to proscribe appellees expressive conduct the majority of the court held that it was not congress recognizing that johnson and eichman had left little hope of an antidesecration statute being upheld has considered in each congress subsequent to these decisions constitutional amendment to empower congress to protect the physical integrity of the flag in the 111 th congress resolutions have been introduced in both the house and the senate hjres 8 and sjres 2 each propose an amendment to the constitution of the united states authorizing the congress and the states to prohibit the act of desecration of the flag of the united states and to set criminal penalties for that act

numerous public flag burnings in protest of the war2 for the next 20 years the lower courts upheld the constitutionality of the federal statute and the supreme court declined to review these decisions3 however during the 20year period between enactment of the flag protection act and its johnson decision the supreme court did visit the flag issue three times each time the court found way to rule in favor of the protestor and overturn state conviction on very narrow grounds avoiding definitive ruling on the constitutionality of convictions for politically inspired destruction or alteration of the american flag4 in street v new york 5 the court overturned state conviction for flagburning holding that the flagburner was prosecuted for his words rather than his acts in 1974 the court overturned prosecut ion by finding that the state statute was vague6 in spence v washington 7 the court held that the taping of peace symbol to flag was expressive conduct and thus protected by the first amendment in both of these later cases the court expressly referred to the federal statute in positive manner8 it was against this background that the supreme court took the johnson case in 1984 during the republican national convention in dallas texas johnson had participated in demonstration protesting the policies of the reagan administration in front of the city hall johnson unfurled an american flag which another member of the demonstration had taken from flag pole and had 1 pl 90381 82 stat 291 1968 codified at 18 usc 700 prior to this act there was an act which prohibited

with the desecration of venerated object in violation of texas statute9 johnson was tried convicted and sentenced to one year in prison and fined 2000 the conviction was upheld by the court of appeals of the fifth district of texas at dallas10 the texas court of criminal appeals reversed11 in 5 to 4 decision the us supreme court affirmed this reversal on june 21 198912 thus in effect holding that the flag protection statutes of 47 states and the federal statute could not be applied to flag burning that was part of public demonstration 13 in response to this decision congress enacted the flag protection act of 198914 the act changed the focus of the protection granted the flag from protecting it against desecration which the court had ruled unconstitutional to protecting its physical integrity the primary purpose of amending the federal desecration statute was to remove any language which the courts might find made the statute one that was aimed at suppressing certain type of expression if the statute was neutral as to expressionfor instance if it proscribed all burning of flagsthen its proponents argued the statutes prohibitions might be judged under the constitutional test enunciated by the court in united states v obrien under the obrien test which is less strict than first amendment standards applied in expression cases the government need only show that the statute furthers an important or substantial governmental interest and that the restriction on first amendment freedoms is greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest 15 all of the opinions in johnson had recognized governmental interest in protecting the physical integrity of the flag to some degree therefore it was at least arguable that such neutral statute would meet the second part of the test the new statute made criminal intentionally mutilating defacing physically defiling burning maintaining on the floor or ground or trampling upon the flag of the united states exemption was given for conduct consisting of disposal of worn or soiled flag the term flag of the united states was defined to mean any flag of the united states or any part thereof made of any substance of any size in form that is commonly displayed provision was made for expedited supreme court review of the constitutionality of the act the flag protection act of 1989 became effective on october 28 1989 on that date protesters in seattle washington and washington dc were arrested for violation of the new act these cases were dismissed upon findings that the act was unconstitutional as applied to their burning united states flag in protest context 16 the dc and seattle cases were appealed to the supreme court under the acts expedited review provision17 on june 11 1990 the court

protection act of 1989 could not be constitutionally applied to burning of the flag in the context of public protest in the summer of 1990 both houses of congress considered and failed to pass by the required twothirds vote20 an amendment to the constitution wh ich would have empowered congress to enact legislation to protect the physical integrity of the flag in six of the last seven congresses

punished for burning the flag as part of public demonstration the opinion outlined the questions to be addressed in case where first amendment protection is sought for conduct rather than pure speech first the court must determine if the conduct in question is expressive conduct if the answer is yes then the first amendment may be invoked and the second question must be answered the second question is whether the state regulation of the conduct is related to the suppression of expression the answer to this question determines the standard which will be utilized in judging the appropriateness of the state regulation the test of whether conduct is deemed expressive conduct sufficient to bring the first amendment into play is whether an intent to convey particularized message was present and whether the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it 27 the opinion emphasizes the communicative nature of flags as previously recognized by the court28 but states that not all action taken with respect to the flag is automatically expressive the context in which the conduct occurred must be examined29 the majority found that johnsons conduct met this test the burning of the flag was the culmination of political demonstration it was intentionally expressive and its meaning was overwhelmingly apparent in these circumstances the burning of the flag was conduct sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the first amendment30 the finding that burning the flag in this circumstance was expressive conduct required the court next to look at the statute involved to see if it was directly aimed at suppressing expression or if the governmental interest to be protected by the statute was unrelated to the suppression of free expression if the statute were of the latter type the government would need only show that it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest and that the restriction on first amendment freedoms is greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest 31 if the statute was aimed at suppression of expression then it could be upheld only if it passed the most exacting scrutiny32 texas offered two state interests which it sought to protect with this statute prevention of breaches of the peace and preservation of the flag as symbol of nationhood and national unity the majority rejected the first of these interests as not being implicated in the facts of this case disturbance of the peace actually occurred or was threatened the opinion also points out that texas has statute specifically prohibiting breaches of the peace33 which tends to confirm that flag desecration need not be punished to keep the peace34 27 texas v johnson 491 us 397 at 405 1989 citing

of national unity was found by the majority to be directly related to expression in the context of activity35 the texas law did not cover all burning of flags rather it was designed to protect it only against abuse that would be offensive to others whether johnsons treatment of the flag was proscribed by the statute could only be determined by the content of his expression therefore exacting scrutiny must be applied to the statute36 the majority held that the texas statute could not withstand this level of scrutiny there is separate constitutional category for the american flag the government may not prohibit expression of an idea merely because society finds the idea offensive even when the flag is involved nor may state limit the use of designated symbols to communicate only certain messages37 g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561g159g495g561g7g146g140g145g150g138g151g561 the court in reviewing the flag protection act of 1989 in united states v eichman expressly declined the invitation to reconsider johnson and its rejection of the contention that flagburning as mode of expression like obscenity or fighting words does not enjoy the full protection of the first amendment38 the only question not addressed in johnson and therefore the only question the majority felt necessary to address was whether the flag protection act is sufficiently distinct from the texas statute that it may constitutionally be applied to proscribe appellees expressive conduct39 the government argued that the governmental interest served by the act was protection of the physical integrity of the flag this interest it was asserted was not related to the suppression of expression and the act contained explicit contentbased limitations on the scope of the prohibited conduct therefore the government should only need to show that the statute furthers an important or substantial governmental interest and that the restriction on first amendment freedoms is greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest 40 the majority while accepting that the act contained explicit contentbased limitations rejected the claim that the governmental interest41 was unrelated to the suppression of expression the court stated 35 id citing spence at 414 n 8 36 id at 412 37 id at 415416 38 united states v eichman 496 us 310 at 315 1990 the majority also declined to reassess johnson in light of congress recognition of national consensus fa voring prohibition on flagburning stating even assuming such consensus exists any suggestion that the governments interest in suppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that sp eech grows is foreign to the first amendment id at 318 39 id 40 see united states v obrien 391 us 367 377 1968 41 the opinion notes that there are at least two other interests the government has in protecting the flag but these interests are not involved in the context of flagburning of privately owned flag the decision does not affect the extent the governments interest in protecting publicly owned flags might justify special measures on their behalf eichman at 316 nt 5 the government also has legitimate interest in preserving the flags function as an incident of sovereignty but the facts of this case did not interfere or threaten that interest id at 316 nt 6

privately owned flag rests upon perceived need to preserve the flags status as symbol of our nation and certain national ideals but the mere destruction or disfigurement of particular physical manifestation of the symbol without more does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way for example the secret destruction of flag in ones own basement would not threaten the flags recognized meaning ra ther the governments desire to preserve the flag as symbol for certain national ideals is implicated only when persons treatment of the flag communicates message to others that is inconsistent with those ideals 42 in essence the court said that the interest protected by the act was the same interest which had been put forth to support the texas statute and rejected in johnson the opinion went on to analyze the language of the act itself again while there was explicit limitation found in this language the majority f ound that each of the specified terms with the possible exception of burns unmistakably connoted disrespectful treatment of the flag and thus argues against the expression neutrality of the act43 therefore although the act was somewhat broader than the texas statute it still suffered from the same fundamental flaw namely it suppressed expression out of concern for its likely communicative impact 44 this being the case the majority found
