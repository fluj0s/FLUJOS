6810c10 class viii tape 14 auditor attitude and the bank good evening good evening we have here the what number lecture fourteen fourteenth lecture and the date ten ten sixty eight or eighteen ok this evening im going to talk to you about the art of being an auditor this of course is totally dependent upon art there is rules about it one has the knack or he doesnt theres reason why pcs get well rather mysterious thing it has to do with the auditors aura the foregoing have actually been stated by people who were pretending to teach dianetics the general opinion of psychiatry and other mental practitioners of decade or so ago was that well hubbard can do it but he has business teaching somebody else because you see its knack somebody has and of wf wf wf wf we have doubt but what he has found is very good psychiatry dont you wf waffa waffa waffa waft what hell of an insult that was so anyway the net result of all of this is that the general difficulty with which an individual is faced is normally somebody else can do it he is good auditor i wonder what magical knack he has what is it what is it and thats what causes you cats to pick up bunch of hidden data you think somebody else knows something peculiar that you possibly may not know you see and you see oscar q zilch and he seems to get results on the pc so you want to find out what he does you see because you flubbed it and then he says waffle waffle yiggle yaggle buckle buckle and he doesnt know what the hell hes doing and he probably isnt getting results from the pc hes probably just giving sales talk anyhow and the net result of all of that is that mystery about it well the subject of auditing is first recounted in book called the original thesis and the rule has not changed between 1949 and now the original thesis is prior to dianetics the modern science of mentai heaith and i was glancing through it moment ago and the last editor of it has not punched this up into the caps it deserves the reason why auditing can occur is that pc plus the auditor is greater than the pcs bank the pc versus the auditor and the bank is overwhelmed now think it over for minute and youll see that the law has not changed in all these years and you speak about basics that is the most basic basic there is in auditing the pcs awareness plus the auditors awareness concentrated upon the reactive bank is greater than the bank inevitably and invariably as an individual moves up into the upper ot sections if he has made it into those sections then he himself all by himself is greater than the strength and power of his bank this is peculiarly true then in the lower grades that it takes the auditor plus the pc as you would might add up ohms or volts or anything else you know like the auditors volts plus the pcs volts are greater than the volts of the bank do you follow its that you know the auditors apples plus the pcs apples are greater than the counter apples of the bank do you follow its just arithmetically true and if you have the auditor versus the pc then it is the auditor plus the bank is versus the pc and he may already be only one grasshopper power and so its very easy to blow him down you can tell at once when the auditor is not with the pc or when the pc solo auditing is not enough to blow down his own bank because the ta goes low whenever you see ta sinking in an auditing session it is the auditor is versus the pc the auditor and the bank are both united against the pc and the result is sinking tone arm now when the pc himself hits too much area in the bank that is hell of an overwhelm of some kind or another this is the solo auditor his ta goes low so in an ao you will very soon see cs on sessions cs on solo sessions where the ta taken on two hand electrode system has sunk below 2 the pc has not adequately made it up through the grades to be greater than his own bank and therefore he should be audited to straighten out his case to remove the charge which stands in his road to repair the grade we missed to put in the rudiments that were out during all of those sessions do you follow now by putting in the rudiments getting the charge off of arc breaks and things hes had with himself straightening him out relatively simple nothing very very complex its contained in the phrase at class viii its just fly each rud to fn the technique that is used is itsa earlier similar itsa complicated isnt it now if you however have ever seen dn dirty needle on the pc in the body of the session your trs stink to high heaven because the bank never makes dn all by itself you can immediately and directly then measure your ability as an auditor of uniting with the pc to handle his bank by the cleanness of the needle in the major actions of the session expect needle to go dn in the ruds we expect it to we hit missed withhold it for sure will but to have this happen in the body of the session means that the auditors trs went out now his trs went out is another way of saying he ceased to be with the pc now we can give you the cycle of communication we can gave you all of the various actions which you have to do but theres one action which remains with the auditor is he versus the pc is he on the other football team is the cowboy somebody in the black hat sitting across the table from him see is he trying to help the pc get through the bank or isnt he now i one time pulled little series of stunts which were quite fascinating i took in an hcg every time an auditor was going to audit pc i took him aside and i pulled his withholds from the pc and then sent him in to give session the funny part of it is that those who had withholds from pc and who did not get them off gave poorer session than the auditor who did not have who had just had his withholds from pc flipped out of the road before he audited the pc we used to get very splendid sessions by doing this trick im not recommending this trick this was research experiment because it simply meant that the pc was being audited by somebody whose rudiments were out on the pc in other words the auditors rudiments were out on the pc he wasnt with the pc he was withholding himself from the pc do you see how elementary that is now im not saying that is always the case im just giving you this as one little special example now you dont have to climb inside the pcs head although i would expect class viii auditor to be able to audit somebody at four five feet without saying word and if he really polished himself up well to audit somebody on the other side of the world without any trouble at all im not giving you anything esoteric youll find occasionally in trying to audit body thetan somebody who has not been up through the grades and doesnt know what hes doing cant make one move he tries to make the body thetan move and the body thetan moves him you know ho hes sort of telepaths the body thetan to the beginning of the incident thats why they fall back so easily on patter its wonder they dont pull up chair on the other side of their desk to have the body thetan sit down in pretty queer but there isnt any real difference between auditing body thetan telepathically through the material he has to be audited through to blow him and to straighten him out and then those body thetans of course are straightened out oddly enough there is difference between doing that and auditing pc sitting across from you in the lower grades as you audit them you are auditing composite and the processes which you use are those processes which work on composite being the pc is himself he isnt cluster as ive heard some people saying he is being however who is impeded and crossordered by number of other beings who have caved in and who arent in control of the body but are just there but now thats telepathic action zoooom through the bank and mfafmf mfmfm theres patter involved in it now if this guy is three feet away from him and is called pc he merely has the complexity that hes trying to audit more composite being and he should be able to make the pc do exactly the things he can make the body thetan do he should be able to audit somebody in the next county and why is it that i was always able to tell the auditor what the item would be before the pc listed it it was trick it isnt even trick of reading minds but it is something on the order of horsepower see what i mean so we take this fellow he hasnt been up through the grades at all hes just fake and he oh yeah well i got all my grades in brisbane yeah got my grades in brisbane and hes been through the clearing course couldnt find anything and so forth and it all blew to fn and you all of sudden get hold of him and hes got stage four needle thats going up tick pow tick ooh now the chance that he will be able to audit body thetan is so remote that you may as well forget it thats why the grades are arranged that way now very often person who has been audited well up through the grades gets to clear there are lots of cases of this gets to clear and he finds out theres some other beings here you know what the hells this whats this you know well his reality has been raised up to the point of where he knows hes supposed to be and some of those characters know theyre running ot2 out of these beings and auditing 3 is just breeze there is nothing much to it do you follow this is this is whats known as impingement and effect upon other beings now you will find here and there that somebody has tried to audit body thetan that he has been mad at it didnt work and you get him in review or something and you find out that he has actually arc broken overrun busted up every body thetan he had anything to do with you ill get you where the hell rrrr rrr nothing happened or he got one awful kickback hes auditing out of arc did it myself way back when ran across somebody who was actually one of the r6ers and i thought to hell with you bud i aint gonna audit you and that was that as far as i was concerned about four days later why he showed up again he was awfully caved in so i had to pick up the arc break and audit it out do you understand auditing requires unlimited tolerance and charity now you get somebody whose writing very evaluative cses i reserve the right to say this guy has simply fallen on his head he has had too much waggle waggle and bug bug and so forth but if you will go back through the fellows auditing or go into the intelligence files youll find out that im not picking it up on the air waves he said it two days before in his auditing session but you dont find saying this is horrible bum this is dog he really ought to be shot but somehow or another we will audit him because the funny part of it is he wont respond as pc if you have that attitude in session cs could have that attitude but if he colors the auditors attitude too much toward the pc then you get auditor plus bank versus pc and the auditing becomes very difficult and very slow do you see where were going with this see well its elementary now nobody enjoins upon you that youve got to have halo eighteen kw around your skull or anything like that it comes under the heading of the auditor who the auditor should be able to say who he audits and an auditor should be able to refuse pc he doesnt think he can help him is nice way of saying he probably has overts on he doesnt like him and doesnt want to have anything to do with him now that auditor auditing that pc is not going to get very many gains youre dealing not with an art youre dealing with very crystal clear proposition that the pc can overcome and handle his bank if the auditor is with him and the pc has hell of time when the auditor is not when the auditor is against him it becomes impossible somebody auditing somebody in anger can actually spin them i had girl stumble into my office one time that had been audited in anger or i think she more or less walked for about i dont know something on the order of fifteen hundred miles to get to my office somebodyd audited her in rage spun her she had enough sense to go someplace where somebody could help her i straightened her out rather rapidly as matter of fact but then the auditor and the bank combined caved in being that wasnt too well off to begin with thats why my lip curls at the whole subject of psychiatry psychoanalysis invalidative subjects psychology man is an animal this sort of thing because you see i know they dont work because they bust the first axiom its not the first axiom but they bust the first datum that was put out strongly on the subject of auditing therefore it comes back to this what is class viii auditing it is auditing the pc with good trs now do you sit there and say lets see now i have to love this pc therefore im womp womp womp womp womp youre gonna audit over hell of false line all you gotta have is just willing to help him out thats all if youre willing to help him out youre ok and if you know how to help him out youre very ok and if your trs are very smooth they will stem from those other two points if your trs are smooth now this is very very fascinating and sometimes very bewildering you say well how would i know how would i know i can tell you how i policed and drilled myself along this line it might be rather surprising to you that i drilled myself along the lines of auditing i have had to learn better than any auditor was taught that i was teaching any of the techniques or mechanics the model sessions the prep checks the sec checks had to learn the trs better than those i was teaching naturally and that i sat down and didnt drill them out of thin air but i actually did sit down and drill them and every time auditing styles had changed and they have why id drill myself into the new auditing style well thats interesting its interesting to do i was getting good results on pcs in 1948 49 50 i was solving pcs other auditors couldnt solve not because i was doing something different i was running engrams and so forth on them i was running at gradient they could tolerate and i was very willing to help them that was the main difference i wasnt in any contest with them i was very willing to help now what what was the difference you can say comprehension of the subject well what comprehension is there of the subject its the same basics you know now as cases have gone up the line and as things have been learned as grades advanced up along the line why what i have known has been applied i dont have any trouble auditing somebody at distance the only reason you dont is it just hasnt occurred to you you could and when you try to audit somebody into it at distance yes audit their ruds out and you dont audit them properly and they very often are stuck on the track to begin with and theyre also being distracted in various ways but it can be done now you can actually move an animal around on time track in the wildest and most imaginable fashion not because hes an animal but because his time track is so different that it doesnt in the least bit bring any question about your imagining it you are not i am sure on greedy quest for bones nor are you terrified of your master beating you set when we run some savage dog backwards on the time track well encounter unmistakably what he is stuck in its often very interesting to see what they are stuck in most incredible things and it is so different from zone of ones own experience that one can evaluate what hes doing and others but this this you could say is trick stuff it aint it aint it isnt at all trick it is about as common as eating dish of ice cream now you say well i couldnt do that i dont know and so on yes an individual who is surrounded around by tremendous number of body thetans his own case is shaky his own rudiments are out when he tries to do something or other he restimulates his own ridges or those of the body thetans in his immediate vicinity and he doesnt get very far in other words hes introverted now because lower class auditor is therefore impeded hence his extension is poor you then teach him by form you teach him by form that he does so and so and he does so and so and then the responses are so and so and the responses are so and so you teach him these forms and actions now the funny part of it is that matter how good he gets these forms and actions are still there do you see the mechanics of it are still there but youve actually given him something that he can do on communication line now im not saying that you as class viii ought to be able to run somebody through to ot6 or something of this sort without ever speaking to him without his knowing anything about it this is not the game im talking to you about but sitting across the table from somebody sitting across the table from somebody and this is the only point im making if you get any other point out of this wow its the only point i am making your intention is actually capable of holding him from moving on the time track particularly at his state of case and you can hold him up and freeze him right on the time track you go out and try to audit somebody who is very wog wog and youd absolutely be fascinated youd absolutely be fascinated an auditor has always verbally been able to handle the pcs bank and make it move around better than the pc always now you can actually establish zone of freeze well im going to help the pc i suppose that doesnt register on him you doubt he can get back that far into the incident i suppose that doesnt register huh well i dont know if i can help you or not i dont know if im doing right now get get what somebody might be doing i dont say that theyre doing this but think of what they might be doing jesus christ i hope ive got this right guess id better catch up my administration thats all ive got to get this this time and so on well if he doesnt see how nervous i am about this yes move to the beginning of the of the incident if it doesnt register in his voice its gonna register otherwise recall let see what the hell was the command just minute just minute sorry uh recall what the hell was it well now if your actions didnt make him nervous your think also could you start running on pc some time the same button that youve just been assessed on then you make an effort to stay into pt and he cant go back track see weve both been assessed let us say on catfish see and you say recall catfish and he says laughter that doesnt mean you should travel all over the time track it just means that you should be free of catfish at that moment now all im trying to tell you is there is communication line there its demonstrable with body thetans so therefore im talking to you in your zone where you can grab reality on it that its therefore three feet away possible its therefore actually lot of feet away possible and its beyond range of sight in actual fact it is not something one does without knowing hes doing it it isnt an accidental activity it is intentional i imagine somebody could be real kooky and be in some kind of telepathictype of rapport but then you must be in some telepathic report from body thetans cause you can see their pictures well if you can see their pictures theyre communicating with you now you look at somebody who suddenly walks through that door you dont necessarily see his pictures mostly because you dont look but the point im trying to make is here there is communication line and its not because you are everybody and everybody is you because thats damn lie it is communication line we use the mest universe and we use verbalization and we use pieces of mest to make the communication positive one of the reasons communication has to be made so positive is elementary that is because theres so much cross think here and there it sounds like the tower of babel all you have to do is walk into crowded room where people are excited or upset and you get kickback from it obvious i used to think there was something terribly wrong with because i didnt like people around who were miserable or unhappy or something and i thought this was something wrong with you see that is must have something to do with the restimulation of because of that this is way way back when i ran into this and so on and itd make feel miserable you know id look at this person hed be miserable and id say well god i must have lot of misery on my track and so forth you see how complicated it all was you know i had it all figured out it must be restimulating some sort of an incident and its then therefore wha wha waffle waffle imagine my amazement one fine day when my reality had gotten up to the reason i didnt like to see people miserable is because they felt miserable very complicated see laughter and it was something like fingernails on the black board or something and then i came up to point where i was perfectly willing to look at somebody who was miserable and i didnt have to feel he was miserable and i could feel how miserable he was and if i got in that frame of mind i could also move him to point of track you know put him in some other point of track i had big failure doing this one time with an animal who was barking and snarling and raising the living daylights and i thought i dont like you i think ill move you into an engram make you shut up funny part of it is i did move him into an engram but the funny part of it was i couldnt move him before the engram and this puzzled very great deal i pondered on this for while what was wrong here well it was because i was mad at him to begin with laughter there was arc i wasnt willing to help him i was trying to ruin him every time i walked by why he shattered my ear drums with psychotic lot of yowp yowp yowp you know and i thought the hell with you see im gonna move you into an engram and shut you up i moved him alright he went in he went into an engram but then i couldnt move him ahead of the engram i could restimulate something bad with him but i couldnt restimulate anything good i was mad at him so there is communication line and it is not very airyfairy at the level class viii is you will start getting reality on that communication line now youll get failure here and there of putting through positive communication you wonder why that is and so on the waitress wont come over to you and so on you start asking yourself what was your attitude toward the waitress when you tried to make her come over there and all will be explained now therefore there is this thing called communication and it is communication now communication goes on its own formula lines and so on there are various types and ways of handling something theres permeation theres communication theres intentionedness with the thing and so on these are all upper ot track facilities and abilities they explain such weird things as engines run for some people and they dont run for others and so on well the engine runs for somebody else not because hes got any magic beam on it because when he looks at the engine he knows dont you see and he says well any crazy fool could see that you havent got the throttle open you know you havent turned on the ignition you see but how does he know that so suddenly well ill give you some idea that actually woggleboggles our own engineers i can call the shots in our engine room without going into the engine room and the engines run fine once in while i give up if its too far away and the communication line is too bad and so forth and ive given the directions too many times and they really dont get followed and something else is happening the whole time while theyre trying to put the thing out of communication faster than theyre putting it in ill say to hell with it see im also willing not to win all the time now if youre anxious im not holding myself up as any model here im just giving you framework if youre anxious and questioning your own abilities then you see youve got to win every time to prove to yourself youre alright see ive gotta and this in itself will cancel out certain amount of communication now just in the last week how many times have you spoken to somebody casually who didnt answer you you see well it happens in mest communication which is mest communication because its very positive well itll certainly happen on this other communication line you dont have to prove to yourself you have these great powers i get angry sometimes when piece of mest wont move and then i realize what im doing cause thats why it wont move now these youre moving up into ot capabilities these are not as complex in fact theyre much simpler it is the additive of anger the additive of necessity the additive of pressing it home the additive the additive the additive do you see now i can tell you how to mock up planet see any damn fool thetan can mock up planet the action is its too easy you havent actually scaled your effort down to point where you can do it again do i start making sense its the effort and complexity now you can get this idea well to mock up planet for christ almighty let see its got to have core and its got to have swamp and its got to have wuf wuf wuf wuf wuf and then have veins and mountains theres so much water over on the planet let see now the proportion of the water should be about twothirds to three quarters water and the rest of it would be land so that the atmospheric pressure and that should be about three hundred miles and it should be so and so on and aw nuts any damn fool thetan knows what planets consist of you know its just you get it now in studying class viii you are actually experiencing this phenomena with scientology youve thought of scientology as very complex here very complex there and very difficult and hard to grasp and theres an awful lot of rules and its awf awf awf awf awf and terrific amounts being demanded of you and so on and i hope you are learning at class viii level that the simpler it is the easier it is its very thats funny remark its it actually isnt encompassible with words its just well the easier it is the simpler it is the things you have to know are very few actually and you just do those few and do those in simple fashion it all comes out alright its thing you experience its thing you suddenly know thats it pow pow pow pow pow now you can keep check on yourself how good you are there is way you can keep check on how good you are the length of sessions is inversely proportional to the ability of the auditor the longer the session the poorer the auditor the shorter the session for number of actions the better the auditor actions successfully completed length of time how long does it take you to get through cs now you say well i dont want this pc because hes tough and this other pc and hes easy and so forth there are tough or easy pcs theyre just you as the auditor hes at different levels of case some of them are worser and some of them are better alright thats hell of way to fail see some pcs are bad pcs some pcs are good pcs nonsense that isnt nothing to it its not true some pcs are at different grades than other pcs now you when these grades are labelled theyre very often inexpertly labelled we say this person is grade four i have seen some of the woggiest grade fours you ever saw and ive seen some of the highest tone grade fours you ever saw do you understand and in the highest tone grade fours you ever saw they were very expertly audited up through their grades and the woggiest grade fours that you ever saw were not audited on their grades at all and they were wogs and somebodyd given lick and promise hadnt even you know really they never even sat down the worst ones off had never been in the auditing chair at all somebody comes along therefore the falsity of grade assignment gets in our road in the estimation of the case and you are gonna be surprised sometime to find person who is allegedly at ot 5 who is not in actual fact even at arc straightwire the phenomenon actually can occur all the grade auditing was done on body thetan and hes gone laughter it isnt often you will find this but actually the difficulty of the case is simply where the case is how charged is the case what grades and actions have to be put in on the case thats all but that thats the only difference amongst cases then once you get that straight why youre great because yours is not social response youre not being responsible for his social conduct you merely know that after he has been audited he will fall on his head ethicswise if his auditing was incorrect and this is usual you get into trouble with ethics if his auditing is out you could almost show this if you want to get somebody in trouble with ethics why just give him the wrong item on couple of lists and let it go at that and theyll wind up over in ethics all too frequently you can determine it to that degree now that doesnt mean everybody in ethics has been badly audited their life has been badly lived very often their rudiments have been out too long in life they are living over outrudiments and theyll get in trouble with ethics now what what then what then is one striving to achieve he is simply striving to achieve simplicity he is striving to achieve not fixed attitude but an attitude which will not impede the pc from making progress he doesnt even have to really be helpful if fact you can get so helpful you wreck the pc but your trs mustnt at least impede the pc and now theres another method by which you can check up your own auditing ability back around 62 i was working with this method its very interesting method if you get dn on pc while you are handling major action you stink i mean to put it crudely because its crude if after you have left the rudiments and are into any major action you were to have appear before you on your meter dn you stink your trs are out ive checked this out very thoroughly i can guarantee this there isnt an engram known to man or beast that can turn on dn you can run person through engrams by the hat full and they wont turn on any dns the read might tighten to bit as he thinks the think but actually it just flows along it never goes dn the only person it goes dn on is the auditor it works like this you can check it up you can check it up yourself you see little tick of the meter you havent given it chance to go dn it all of sudden goes tick you did something or other and theres that tick now you can get in the way of the pc doing this too but if you were to ask the pc at that moment did something just happen that upset you in any way the pc would say yes and itd blow off you can keep track of your own trs man if in tr drills the needle dirties up in any way whatsoever the auditor is goofing it if any dn turns on during drill youve goofed it now if your ability to audit your willingness to help the pc are there the pc is not an unmanageable unpredictable thing it would not be good to do so but you could even set yourself up the problem of pushing him through it with his ruds out as matter of fact the perfect auditing session is one in which the auditor is not even faintly lntuded into the pcs attention the pc is totally unaware of the auditor or the environment and is only aware of his bank and his action and that makes the fastest session the most expert session are that one which has the maximum gains not aware of the auditor at all so if the auditors trying to show off or do something or other that is interesting or interest the pc or all kinds of kooky things the auditor could do theyre all simply distracting so the best trs are those which distract the least and get the action done the most smoothly so if an auditors willing to help the pc and if the needle remains clean and flowing you havent got anything out the pc just gonna go along just great thats your own self check i give it to you as its all very well to have other people blowing down your necks and things happening to you because of this that and the other thing but the truth is the truth is that you are probably your own most savage critic probably your own most savage critic matter of fact i possibly you could look forward to the time when the auditor goofs in the auditing session when he ends off the session why he runs out and jumps overboard laughter the upshot of it all is simply this that if you yourself do not have an awareness of what you are doing and critical eye of your own actions it is improbable that you will ever improve you can be persuaded however to have critical eye towards your own actions one is not trying to introvert you anybody who learns to audit in this school the sea org school is never likely to let go of it or be scared of anything when he finishes it up because we are now at the moment down in the ancient civilizations and so on it is quite amusing to realize that we are also practicing the stoic philosophic school the stoic was able to endure now with that preliminary there is thing called auditing presence there is thing called auditing intention and there is thing called trs and the conditions of the session are those which ive just described to you and are in actual fact greater than those i have just described to you they do not exceed those things i have just described to you there arent hundred and fifty nine thousand others those are the conditions and attitudes of session now when you add to that meter and when you add to that administration youre making sort of one man band action correct now if you had any difficulty handling an emeter or any difficulty with an administrative action you are of course detracting from the amount of cool invested in the session an auditor has to be sort of one man band hes got meter to run and hes got administration to keep up and hes got pc to handle and hes also in charge of the whole environment around him which many auditors forget and as result it is multiple of actions now let tell you how you make multiple of actions become simple is you learn to do each one perfectly and then learn to do them all together for instance just to put ridiculous line on it if there was any difficulty sometime you eat these eskimo pies and things like this and theyre very hard to eat on summer day without getting them all over your shirt they melt when you bite the chocolate why the inside squirts requires bit of skill to eat an eskimo pie so as to one be able to eat all of the pie and not leave part of it on the ground and to keep your shirt clean at the same time and not get it all over your face that requires certain amount of skill now it requires certain amount of skill to fire sub machine gun to get any accuracy with sub machine gun it usually has to be supported with two hands one sights along it in some fashion or another he does this that and the other thing but if he was going to be doing something else at the same time he had certainly better learn how to handle sub machine gun rather easily so if you could learn how to eat an eskimo pie and fire sub machine gun with deadly accuracy into target at the same time without getting any eskimo pie on your shirt without shooting anybody else but the target and all the time with tremendous aplomb youve got an action there which is less complicated than auditing you have to recognize this the fact youve got several things to do but thetan can do several things at the same time if you dont believe it hold up your hand and look at it have you any idea of how much how much think and action and complexity that requires i suppose you think your muscles do it or something if youre not very far up along the line you will youll think well i flex my muscles and then i and so on how is it that you could bring up your hand and open it why does the thing happen to open do you see now youve educated yourself into believing that you have to have this hand in order to open the cover of something i dont know whats wrong with you because you can just as easily intentionedly open the cover of something with intention except you have to be able to permeate the cover to the degree that youre willing to permeate your hand that ive given you some stuff out of 8 actually this is all the trick there is to moving mest so at first you would say oh my god how would we reverse the polarity of the empire state building in other words it seems to be big problem it would seem to be very difficult and so forth but in actual fact it isnt until you recognized the difficultness not the difficultness of it but the complexity of it and the simplicity of doing it are the two things which you recognize simultaneously and at that moment you could do most anything with the empire state building this is all germane to auditing in class viii auditing there is then style its an effortless one man band that goes like the mischief and gets it all done and does it all very simply and brings it all right out at the other end it adds speed and deftness to the ability one already has but it also requires that one recognizes the simplicity of what he is doing before theres real speed and deftness suddenly come to one there isnt very much to know and thats the trouble with it its almost too little to know so its hard to grasp the feeling there must be something more to it keeps intruding on the fact and all of sudden fuff you do it very easily now so much for the attitude of the session the case supervision of the session is what is audited in the session that is what is done by the auditor and there are certain standard things which make class viii class viii and that is that you insist on nothing short of perfection we leave the ground of the auditor got away with it we leave that utterly almost to we dont care what the final result was if it was done wrong it was wrong there is optimism because i can show you in the long run that every session that is done wrong gets pc who falls on his head eventually your errors of session multiply and they multiply and they are very because youre auditing smoothly youre auditing quickly something like this and all of sudden you make bungle baaa youre the guy carrying flask of tnt in your hip pocket nearly all soup men in oil fields drink it in tea cups and that sort of thing they think its tnt soup they handle it in the most wild and peculiar fashions and they faint if they see anybody else even going near it they themselves know they can handle the stuff they themselves dont worry about it any but they recognize that if they have dynamite the soup it is very explosive now youre auditing rapidly youre auditing with intention youre already auditing above the ceiling of the person to resist the auditing you already are in case state that can put person almost anyplace you want to put him on the time track just by plain think and then you flub the only answer to it is you gotta be perfect if youre gonna audit with that much velocity youre gonna have to audit perfectly there must be flubs so it is flubless style now when we look over when we look over well done folder it might seem rather mysterious what is in the folder we see cs something on the order of the cs on this particular one is gf green form and you do green form to first fn you dont do green form to the second fn the third fn the fourth fn its done to fn so its your case supervision is only necessary gf to fn now you havent seen too many green forms being handed out and the real reason you havent seen them handed out is most people coming in have already been green formed up to their teeth it is not the green form is out of style theyve just been green formed to their teeth now you actually as person starts to hit the upper strata of auditing where he has been badly audited early on you start at once to be cautious about lists about getting him to list im not talking about assessments you start being cautious about getting him to do lists and so on thats good csing you can run all the damn lists you want to in the lower grades you see but you start getting cautious about lists particularly if you dont have the pcs full listing background if you could go back to the basic list on the track and correct it that would be great but you very often cant do that sometimes its above the level and ability of the auditors you have auditing for you to go back and correct the first list ever made on the case and list then at the upper levels been done too often becomes risky action youre putting the pc at risk all hes got to do is get couple of wrong items and hell throw into restimulation the earlier list so you as case gets on up into the higher levels the continuous ordering of gf gf gf gf gf to hell with it hes had gfs running out of his ears do you see but its common action theres nothing wrong with it but you have tendency if youre doing csing to look through folder to find out how many gfs this character has you know you havent got the full folder you never do theres always part of it in spokane you look through there and you see lists heres great list oh that was good one oh dear god where the hell did this list come from whistles jeez i never saw that in this folder before i have just opened this folder at random and i have found one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen sixteen item list which has been nulled down to the fifteenth or down to the twelfth item and it had left in one two three four five six seven items reading this is listed by the pc not prepared list and its squirrely list i wouldnt know why anybody would have listed it its give quote unquote name and its sixteen one list hes had the pc write sixteen items and one two three four five six seven stayed in and he gave the pc one ahhh now when youre doing case supervising work you look into these things and you very often see this sort of thing so you give some sort of cs along this line you know that you havent got the folder the persons been around for seven years and this is only two years ago it was only last year actually and you think youve got that was the earliest list thats the earliest list in this folder the persons been around for ages so obviously it isnt the earliest list on the case now we probably could correct that list but now were going to get into some kind of fire fight because thats gonna restimulate this and itll restimulate something else and it probably wasnt in restimulation anyhow and the case has long since more or less forgotten that list do you get the idea he we start correcting list which is late list and then we try to correct something else and we look through the case and we find that the green form on january 27 1967 god look at this green form look how far it went didnt fn this green form was not run to fn now thats something else you could restimulate now you could run green form but heres backthere green form that didnt fn heres list that is absolutely kooky see youre getting locked out as cs those are very ordinary actions see listing and nulling green form ah boy we start canceling them out get the idea heres green form after green form after green form list after list after list after list the way we actually approach the thing is go back to time when the case was running well how was the case running well well the case rehabbed like bomb on the twenty fifth of september see fn fn fn fn fn good indicators all kinds of fns all over the place apparent gis ta was normal action so we arent gonna correct back any further than that get the think were not gonna correct back of that were not gonna find something wrong with the case in 1962 if we are were gonna find it on generality and so we get procedure of we take the area now weve had green forms theres flubbed green form theres flubbed list lets say this case does run into trouble and its starting to fall on its head now weve gone back to the area where it was running well and it comes forward into another area and it isnt running well and its little bit difficult to figure out why it wouldnt be running well common error is the case doesnt fn anymore all of sudden she stops fning ta goes up something happens now we havent got this area now were being denied our normal repair weapons theres listing to do an s and d to do remedy b something like this its starting to get locked out you see by earlier bad listing we havent got the earliest lists we dont know what ones in restim you get the kind of case supervisor problem youre being set up with now all problems of this character come under the heading of corrective problems the correction problems so case supervisor problems fall into these two characters and one is corrective and thats corrective of the auditing and the other one is advancing of the case theyre two separate categories you cant correct the auditing without advancing the case but they are two separate categories so all case supervisor actions come under the heading of corrective of the auditing or advancing the case now picking up and running out psychoanalysis of 1895 is not corrective of the case cause there its the case so that an assessment of resistive cases has couple of items on it which is audited over out ruds or grades and continuous overts on dianetics and scientology are the primary ones that are corrective you have to correct the case now somebodys goofed the floof if the case got here this far boy and its still reading on those two things i wouldnt give you much for the auditing it had reading on one or the other of those continuous overts on scientology and nobody picked that up audited over out ruds or grades and nobody picked that up ah so youve got corrective action of the auditing or youve got remaining or almost all of them just advancing the case now case supervisor can advance cases by grades or he can take an action to get charge off so the grade or action can be undertaken that sounds funny but it isnt funny and theres nothing very complex about it and the case somehow or another has gotten to ot 2 and doesnt find any on 3 this simply means the case is too charged to be where it is at the time it is now the case wasnt brought up right thats for sure so you might write up something on the order of check the lower grades to see which ones have been run or not run and the order would be they would appear like this in case supervisor folder its fly the ruds to fn thats any rud first fn you get on the ruds fly the ruds to fn and theres something i could tell you about that actually the guy could have ptp and he wont fn on an arc break you should by the strength of your magic eye actually make him fn on it but the truth of the matter is if hes got ptp or missed withhold he really doesnt fn until he gets to it so if the pc fns on an arc break you are very sure that he hasnt got ptp or missed withhold do you understand the rationale about it so if he doesnt fn on arc break dont shoot somebody for it because its because hes got ptp or missed withhold if your auditor was absolutely cracker jack he could make him arc on it he could make him audit he could just put his ruds in you know pffft ruds in the guys confidence is such that his ruds couldnt be out you know this kind of thing cause rudiment actually is something the guy thinks is in his road so anyway the case supervision of such case will be to fly the ruds to fn see hes at 2 you look back to the folder so you dont find much in the way of rehabs and you say fly the ruds to fn two check rehab or check lower grades rehab or run to be absolutely correct lower grades you can say check lower grades which isnt rehab them maybe hes had too many rehabs but youre fairly sure that theres one out one or more out you could say check or run lower grades or rehab or run lower grades itd be two different case supervisions you think this guy this guy oh you can rehab somebody half to death dont you see so to avoid all the rehab you want him to check these things now theres several ways he could do it he could actually take list list and assess it from the lower grades and find one that read if the list would communicate to the person but the other day we had little kid and hed had several lower grades run on him and ill be of gun nobodyd ever taught him the name of the lower grades and of course he wasnt class vi he was only eight and the auditor got in hell of fire fight with him because the kid thought hed been run on one process while hed been run on another process the whole difficulty is that the kid didnt know the names of the processes anyhow the auditord just asked him the questions now the auditor to check up the lower grades asked with the process names and so the kid didnt know what hed been run on and got into an awful confusion and dropped out of session i noticed vixie barking at him so i imagine his ruds are out he probably has developed an ethics record by this time this this would be common action you say somethings wrong alright so this comes back to you again this comes back to you again there was some charge came off and you want to get auditors used to just making fall long fall bd type actions so that you can see how much charge is coming off you know on their work sheets and it didnt take off too much charge hut it took off some the fellow had cognited on the fact that he had an arc break while he was running service facsimile and he got the right service facsimile hut he had an arc break at that time and the auditor cleaned up the arc break at that time he got something off on the ruds and he got this bit off do you see on having an arc break then they run the service facsimile and thats it sigh and this is what youre gonna be faced with case supervising some time the ta was at 45 during the whole beginning ruds and it didnt fn now high ta overrun now you have pat process listing what can be overrun its absolutely packaged you do the same thing with it you can run it all you want to any time it has limits of any kind whatsoever you could even be running it up at 9 there is limit on it because if theres nothing been overrun it simply fns and if something has been overrun its something thats come into restimulation since the last time it was run dont you see its not like listing process its just bunch of items that youre youre finding something to audit so you could do that certainly that ta is up and it comes back to you again and the ta is at 45 and there isnt anything that the fellow thought was overrun now thats wonderful opportunity to do something else just because the pc couldnt confront it or think of it is reason it isnt there something has been overrun normally in this current civilization at this particular time i can tell you at once what is there lsd lsd25 is the first compound distributed by psychiatry to make drug addicts out of people to show them give them an idea of how it feels to be insane become very popular or its pot marijuana cannabis indica is the proper name or cannabis americana the proper name of marijuana whether grown in india or america hashish which is simdly solid substance made out of cannabis indica or cannabis americana all of which looks like tumbleweed growing in some back lot very easy to come by its one of those its one of those or it is some medical preparation or it is some drug which has been administered to treat the person for insanity or its biochemical cure or something of this sort and the individual thinks that hes been released someplace along that line now you understand you did the usual to begin with you asked what has been overrun but you didnt get to first base with this itll be drugs itll be drugs and youll rehab em and the tone arm behaves and the guy runs great those are just standard remedies first you suspected you see that some auditing action was out that is the easiest and closest one to handle you couldnt find an auditing action that was out or you couldnt find one that was grossly out or the one you found out wouldnt straighten out so its life action its high ta so something has been overrun now the ta is so low that the individual can hardly crawl and ive tried to give you some subjective reality not because you have low tas but ive tried to give you just some handling experience and also because it works on anybody and also because you should do it before you you actually should do it before you do full rehab it is your lx1 process which is simply an assessment of prepared list and then you get the down stat type of charge off the case when he thinks hes been down stat and you run some engrams to get rid of that run some overt engrams so that is wont key back in again or wont be dramatized and lot of charge comes off the case and then you can do full rehab action and you can get much more out of the full rehab action thats just in the interest of getting charge of the case now notice that is life action thats actually case gain type action it doesnt have to be expressed but its case gain type action now let show you how you could really foul it up because what ive told you is relatively simple now i can show you how you really foul it up got high ta high ta so we do an lx1 and run it without putting and forget to put in the ruds this would be gruesome beyond belief the guy has high ta well you think thats impossible that anybody would do anything like that i assure you that in past years it has been almost fashionable to believe that the next grade would bring the ta down or up thats how gross tech can go out oh well tas at 5 if we give him power why that will bring it down oddly enough power is actually adequate occasionally to bring it down because it hits some overrun in the process of running it and it does come down and that gives somebody win but this is one of those wins that has cut somebodies throat because the next one wont come down itll just go up through the moon your ta must be floating before every major action that is something that seems very new but you must float the ta before every major action the ta must always be floated before major action well the think get this little think on it you could say well christ if you float the ta before major action why do the major actions well thats somebody that thinks his target is floating needle what he actually wants is discharged case and floating needle floats on release so that if you comprehend the definition of release comprehend the definition of erasure comprehend the general definition of the bank what its all about it becomes very obvious persons reality is goes up in direct proportion to the amount of charge he gets off his case there is some charge which has more quality than other charge charge taken off on the grades has more quality oddly enough any charge taken off over enough centuries would probably discharge the case also the rule is still there so youre monitoring against this the guy bounces out of engrams guy cant come close to it therefore you want some kind of discharging process before you send him into some major action cause hes in need of an assist hes bunged up like fire drill he cant even approach the grades he cant approach these next actions so you have this whole little class of processes by which you discharge case you can do various little things by which you take charge off case if you were to do category of relatives just to give you this is the routine you see yes the prepared list and the prepcheck thats one of the methods of taking charge off case do list of all the different types of relatives an individual can have theres usually every little girl had favorite aunt or something who will show up as an ally suddenly and mysteriously at the last moment you know something like this so lets do list of relatives this individualts talking about family family family family family and so lets do list of aunt uncle grandma grandfather father mother and so on and so forth now were either gonna get an ally or suppressive out of this we dont care what see all kinds of familial names and then just for portmanteau you know just for grab bag and throw one in like friend and then we assess it just standard assessment and we prepcheck it just standard prepcheck and the case starts blowing out guy says great sessions he doesnt realize were trying to set him up to run something we can just barely manage to fly the guys ruds after half an hour of sweat case is too charged we are undertaking major actions so either the other earlier actions that have been undertaken on the case were badly undertaken and didnt discharge the case the way they should have or the individual is piling up more charge than anybody has right to in some fashion something is going on with this case you actually dont have to know whats going on with the case to the degree that you think you do all you have to know is is lets get some charge off before we do anything else lets make this guy easy to fly if we cant fly this guy easily aww lets work on it bit here huh lets do this that or the other thing to straighten up lets take some charge off lets find some charge where is it so youll find yourself case supervisoring doing this where the hell is some charge here of course youre up against the fact that most of the things you see in an auditing session have already been discharged lets go back to green form done by mazie gulch of dry gulch south dakota who always is dry gulching pcs and were liable to find something very interesting in here overts what type of overts does this pc have what does this pc specialize in here oh bit here yes he has lot of ignores well what do you know he ignores dispatches ahh good lets make little list here administration business organizations posts orgs well get some charge off this guy assess the thing and prepcheck it he says god how did they know so youre trying to find some charge so you can take it off so that you can undertake it and get in ruds easily and undertake major actions thats clever case supervision thats not clever correction that is case advancement youre not correcting the case to that degree youre trying to advance the case were trying to set this case up to run the next grade hell get some real advance on the next grade but we dont let him fumble into the next grade we wouldnt let somebody go into the clearing course who wasnt in pretty good shape on r6ew along with that we have program where actually you fly the ruds before you permit somebody to audit solo hes got to come in and have his ruds flown and hes studied the material got it all taped what hes supposed to do hes got to come in and get his ruds flown before hes permitted to solo audit and then hes got to turn in the first session to the cs and get cs on it and get his next cs before he can do his next session and then very few people will be getting into trouble it would only be the dishonest bloke who does seven sessions without cs that wraps himself around telegraph pole but you get what the think is so on the one hand were trying to advance the case by taking off charge and were doing it in an auditing session whereby were permitting the individual to confront and handle his bank because of the assistance of the auditor and we can take off major charge in an auditing action so as to set up case so he can handle it in solo if guy cant handle his case in solo he had better have an auditor do you follow these are the different attitudes of auditing there is on the one hand the planning of it the putting together of it and so forth ana then theres the application of it these are two separate zones and areas but guy who cant apply it well is not likely to be able to order it well and these are the two separate zones and areas that class viii has to be expert in thank you very much
