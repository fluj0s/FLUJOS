children and spouses of employees scholarships which also may be taxfree under continuedto for example enter new occupation or keep uptodate the skills required to maintain their current positions3 the tax benefits intended to help families pay higher education expenses at the time they are incurred joined longstanding provi sions in the irc whose eligible population is defined by its employment relationship employer educational assistance was initiated in the revenue act of 1979 and the working condition fringe benefit in the deficit reduction act of 1984 according to the most recent data available 49 of employees in the private sector had access to workrelated educational assistance as part of the fringe benefit package offered by their firms many fewer workers 15 had access to nonworkrelated instruction in march 2007 employees in management professi onal and related occupations in fulltime jobs who belong to labor unions with average earnings of at least 15 per hour and work at large firms 100 or more employees are the most likely to have educational assistance benefits made availa ble to them by their firms4 employers who offer their employees edu cational assistance can deduct its cost as business expense in determining the firms income tax liability empirical research suggests that employers gain from sponsorin g employee education and training because it increases employee retention5 economists theorize that there is less investment in human capital than is optimal for society becau the benefits of education extend beyond those who choose to undertake and pay for it g better health leading to lower medicare costs thus society also gains from empl oyerprovided education to the extent it increases the educational atta inment of the population and thereby compensates for the underinvestment in human capital6 any fringe benefits ie nonwage compen sation such as employer expenditures on health insurance firms offer are taxable to employees unless by law the benefits are specifically excluded from gross income7 employerprovided educational assistance generally is included as part of taxable wages on the w2 statements employers send to employees each january except in the instances discussed below8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22911crs3 8 continued section 117 of the irc are not discussed as well because firms may establish grants for persons who lack an employment relationship with them eg persons who reside in the community in which business is located 9 however educational assistance does exclude paym ent for or provision of tools or supplies that employees may retain after the course is completed as well as meals lodging or transportation it also excludes reimbursement for courses invo lving sports games or hobbies unless related to the employers business or the courses ar required as part of degree program 10 the education assistance programs pl 98 611 reauthorized section 127 from january 1 1984 to december 31 1985 the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 further extended the provision from january 1 1986 to december 31 1987 while also raising the excludable maximum next the technical and misc ellaneous revenue act of 1988 pl 100647 reauthorized the exclusion from january 1 1988 to december 31 1988 and longer covered continuedthe employer educationa l assistance exclusion congress authorized an exclusion from wages of up to 5250 annually at section 127 of the irc for employer payment or reimburseme nt of job and nonjobrelated educational expenses including tuition and fees books supplies and equipment incurred by employees under firms qualified educational assistance program and employer provision of job and nonjob related courses of instruction for employees including the cost of books supplies and equipment under such program the 5250 limit has been in place since 1986 fo r employees of multiple employers with qualified educational assistance programs the 5250 limit pplies to the value of the benefit received from all employers the educational assistance ex clusion was authorized at up to 5000 annually for five years as part of the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 effective to december 31 1983 before 1979 employers could exclude from em ployee taxable income only jobrelated educational assistance under anot her provision of the irc discu ssed in the next section the jobrelated requirement has been narrowl construed eg trai ning to maintain or improve skills so employees retain their current jobs consequently the educational opportunities of employees in lower leve l positions have been limited compared to employees in higher level positions that typi cally have relatively br oad job descriptions section 127 was intended in part to remedy this perceived inequity the jobrelated requirement also means that firms must ma ke determinations bout whether each course taken by employees is very closely linked to their current positions determinations with which the internal revenue service irs later might disagree section 127 thus simplified the tax code by enabling the ex clusion from wages of expenses employees incur for virtually all educati on whether jobrelated or not9 the temporary employer ducational assistance provisi on has been extended often retroactive to its expira tion on numerous occasions10 most recently the

december 31 2001 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 most r ecently extended and amended the tax provision as discussed in the above text 11 the nondiscrimination requirement may cause the programs to be expensive if utilized by many employees employers are permitted to im pose course completion or grade requirements however similarly they may require employees to remain on the payroll for some period after course completion these allowable program feat ures may limit its cost in addition employers are not required to fund existing educational ssistance programs that effectively allows the companies to stop offering the benefit if they are in financial straits 12 joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 2007

compensated employees11 it also cannot provide more than 5 of payments to shareholders or ow ners and cannot offer employees choice between taxable income nd the education benefit the firm must provide reasonable notice of the program to employees as well the educational assistance exclusion must be coordinated with other credits and deductions in other words employees cannot use the same educational expenses reimbursed through section 127 program as the basis for claiming other tax benefits but for example employ ees whose employers have excluded 5250 in educational expenses from their wages may be able to claim the lifetime learning credit for any remaining tuition and fees up to the cred its cap of 10000 per income tax return the joint committee on taxation estimates that

plan which means the benefit is exempt from plans nondiscrimination rules that restrict whom firms may assist under section 132 then company could for example offer the benefit to employees it wants to single out for special treatment or move quickly up the corporate ladder since the lack of written plan also means there are reportin g requirements theres need to spread the word to other employees15 courses may be taken at th undergraduate and graduate levels under both section 127 and section 13216 the two provisions allow deducti ons for tuition and related fees books supplies tools and equipment but sec tion 132 also allows the deduction to apply to meals lodging and transportation ex penses if the employee travels from home to obtain the education unlike the 5250 limit on
