implementation of the 1951 convention under the 1951 convention refugee is legally defined as person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or owing to wellfounded fear of being pe rsecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership of particular social group or political opinion is outside of the country of his nationa lity and is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country5 the central rights accorded to refugees are nonrejection of asylum seek ers at the border nonforced repatriation nonrefoulement admission to safety access to fair and efficient procedures for determination of refugee status assurance of the same rights and basic help received by any other foreigner who is legal re sident and appropriate lasting solutions6 the 1951 convention limits the definition of refugees to those created by events occurring prior to 19517 in response to the emergen ce of large refugee movements since 1951 the 1967 protocol incorporates the measures included in the 1951 convention but imposes time or geographi cal limits states may be party to one or both instruments unhcr often works with states on national

stateless persons and others compared with the year before this number has decreased by 2 million as many refugees have returned to their home countries when refugees begin to return to their home

seeds and assistance rebuildin g homes and schools monitoring of their wellbeing rarely continues longer than two years unlike refugees who seek asylum outside their country of citizenship internally displaced persons have not crossed an inte rnational border but remain inside their own country under international law idps do not have the same protection as refugees idps fall into the gaps between the mandates of different agencies by default unhcr has provided assistance and some protection to idps but it has argued that it lacks the capacity and resources to cope systematically with the needs of idps in addition to its refugee caseload the plight of this group has gained international recognition as problem that needs to be addressed there are other groups requiring assistance asylum seekers are people who flee their home country and seek sanctuary in second state they apply for asylum which is the right to be recognized as refugee and receive legal protection and material

three main functi ons first it provides legal protection to those who fall within its mandate governments establish procedures to determine refugee status and related rights in accordance with their own legal systems unhcr offers advice and nonbindi ng guidelines to these governments9 in countries which are not party to inte rnational refugee trea ties but request unhcr assistance unhcr may determine refugee st atus and offer its own protection and assistance second unhcr seeks permanent solutions to refugee situations in general there are three solutions for refugees 1 voluntary repatriation 2 local integration in the country of first asylum and 3 rese ttlement from the country of first asylum to third country unhcr prefers voluntary re patriation whereby refugees return to their home countries if repatriation is impossible then unhcr seeks either local integration or if this is impossibl resettlement in third country third unhcr also coordinates numer ous nongovernmental organizations ngos that provide emergenc humanitarian relief to refu gees this relief includes shelter food and basic medical care unhcr also carries out variety of other activities for example in the past unhcr has provided training for border guar ds on how to handle refugee situations developed an intergovernmental emergency re sponse team for greater integration and coordination and resolved particularly nsitive situations between governments and those seeking asylum some of these situations involved behindthescene negotiations and discussions unhcr operations as humanitarian crises became more complex through the 1990s unhcr began working with wider num ber and variety of organizations within the system unhcr works most closely with the world food program wfp the childrens fund unicef the world health organization who the development program undp the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha and the high commissioner for human rights unhcr also coordinates with interna tional organizations ios such as the international committee of the red cross icrc and the international federation of red cross and red crescen t societies ifrc and ngos

currently while there are small number of ngos in iraq agencies provide the bulk of humanitarian assistance in the form of food and dicine reportedly the united nations estimates that over 60 pe rcent of 24 million people in iraq receive monthly food distributions12 depending on its scope nd duration war could create humanitarian emergency with large popula tion movements across borders or within

contributions it depends on the annual gene rosity of its donors and cannot anticipate from year to year how much money will be available nor how much it will have to spend some pledged contributions are so late these problems create general cash availability crisis and budget shor tfalls in february 2002 unhcr froze its administrative budgets as of june 30 2002 only 678 million had been received

earmarked to be used only for specific countries or type s of activities and 72 lightly earmarked allocated for use within specified geog raphic regions other countries tightly earmark larger proportion of their contri butions such as the european commission which does so for its entire contribution in contrast the ne therlands provides 65 of its contribution in unrestricted funds16 tight earmarking in particular means that some programs are well funded and othe r programs experience shortages for example countries provided high level of funding earmarked to the kosovo crisis but african crises have not recei ved the same level of funding17 countries that tightly earmark appear to view unhcr as an implementing partner rather than global multilateral agency with universal mandate18 internally displaced persons high commissioner ruud lubbers has reportedly stated that unhcr will care fo r idps only under certain conditions and only if unhcr has adequate resources i will not say that unhcr will care for all idps i do not believe in that at all19 instead high commissioner lubbers seeks broader response from the system and the international community the lack of designated organization mandated to focus on idps has resulted in an inconsistent and often incomp lete response to idp crises20 number of questions remain unresolved which organizations should take on this role what kind of protective legal mechanism might be established to provide for idps in much the same way the 1951 convention and 1967 pr otocol have done for

germany tanzania and the united states however the countries with th most refugees per 1000 inhabitants are armenia guinea federal republic of yu goslavia republic of the congo and djibouti when one takes into account gdp those countries with the largest refugee populations per 1 llion of gdp are armenia guinea tanzania zambia and congo21 these countries have generously accepted refugees and often receive international assistance from unhcr however the international community does not cover all the costs associated with rge refugee populations these countries and many others have become ss willing to take in asylum seekers because they already have substantial refugee populations f ace increasing economic problems and worry about perceived threats to domestic security even developed countries are less w illing to accept asylum seekers the european union for example sought to stem the flow of asylum seekers by promoting regional protection relying on safe havens and other zones in the region of origin and interpreting narrowly th definition of refugees for example excluding those persecute d by nonstate actors22 these measures may have the unintended consequence of expanding ille gal migrati on migrant trafficking and organized crime as refugees under dur ess seek other avenues of asylum23 accusations of misconduct in november 2001 unhcr requested an investigation into allegations of sexual exploitation of refugees by its own aid workers in west africa the resulting report in july 2002 could not verify the allegations but found 10 cases of sexual exploitation of which one case involved volunteer even though allegations against staff members have been substantiated the report does re veal that sexual exploitation occurs in refugee camps perhaps due to lack of daytoday unh cr management and th conditions of camp life through 2002 and 2003 unhcr is impleme nting series of reforms to stop sexual exploitation among refugees24 security in some regional and

briefing august 29 2002 http wwwstatego vpsarlsrm13187htm 29 regular assessed dues cover the administrative costs of unhcr operations to shape the outcome of the war and mani pulate the response by the international community as result refugees may be seen as central to the objectives and strategies of war and yet many remain innocent victims caught in the crossfire in many cases refugees s eek to escape violence but violence often follows them to refugee camps these camps may house rival ethnic groups and armed rebels as in democratic republic of congo and pakistan in th 1990s may be invaded by rebel forces as is currently the case in uganda and may not be able to protect refugees from sexual exploitation and general vi olence unhcr has sought to protect refugees and its workers from this violence but some argue that more needs to be done since unhcr often operates in the midst of wars humanitarian assistance to refugees is not always viewed by the combatants as neutral act25 unhcr and other humanitarian actors are increasingly perceived as taking sides further aggravating these problems humanitarian agencies have needed to work with military forces which also increasingly provide humanitarian assistance as was the case in macedonia during the kosovo conflict the risk some argue is that the humanitarian assistance community and refugees they protect may appear to be parties to the conflict26 as result of these trends some humanitarian aid workers have become targets in civil wars to improve security to its personnel the united nations established at the end of 2001 new emergency and security service program of which each agency pays portion of the costs unhcr will pay 2 million for this program as well as another 7 million for other security programs27

shortfall is beginning to advers ely impact field operations in number of regions30 authorization for participation in the unhcr program is through the migration and refugee assistance act of 1962 pl

supports certain programs and certain geographical areas and allows us policy priorities to influence unhcr priorities s econd through the very act of contributing money and protecting refugees according to certain standards the us government also encourages other countries to contribute at appropriate leve ls and treat refugees at certain standard third the united states is an active member
