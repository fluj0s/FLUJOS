the law corrupt governor thwarts governance and development in paktya province afghanistan ref kabul 1345 classified by interagency provincial affairs deputy director hoyt yee for reasons 14b and d 1 c summary paktya governor juma khan hamdard has the skills and charisma to be successful politician however his hezbiislami gulbuddin hig connections alleged meddling in political affairs in balkh province leadership of provincewide corruption scheme and suspected contacts with insurgents make him detrimental to the future of afghanistan through an investigation of corruption involving local afghan engineer assigned to the usled provincial reconstruction team prt in the province patkyas national directorate of security nds chief informs that hamdard is the central point of vast corruption network involving the provincial chief of police and several afghan ministry line directors alleged skimming of usg development funds occurs at four stages of project when contractors bid on project at application for building permits during construction and at the ribboncutting ceremony these allegations of corruption hamper usg relations with giroa officials as well as contractors and are being reviewed by us embassy law enforcement officials as with other corruption cases major challenge to successful prosecution will be the afghan legal systems limited institutional capacity the major crimes task force mctf currently has four vetted prosecutors and limited number of vetted investigators to work this and numerous other pending corruption cases from all over the country end summary governors pedigree as hig commander 2 s governor hamdard was born in 1954 and is an ethnic pashtun from balkh province he is member of the wardak tribe from mazarisharif he supposedly completed high school but has poor reading and writing skills during the war with the soviets hamdard fought under gulbuddin hekmatyars leadership and was hig commander in 1994 he fought with general dostum against the taliban until he defected to the talibans side and assisted in their victory over dostum in 199798 following the usled coalitions invasion in 2001 hamdard rejoined dostums forces although relations were uneasy following the war he served as number 8 corps commander in balkh hamdard was later appointed governor of baghlan and then jowzjan provinces he became governor of paktya in december 2007 hamdard also is one of president karzais tribal advisors he is affiliated with hezbiislami afghanistan hia political party and is its leader in northern afghanistan sensitive reporting indicates that hamdard is still serving as hig commander and leads faction of hig fighters in the north he often signs memos with the military title lieutenant general 3 c in paktya hamdard has shown himself to be very charismatic leader nevertheless he spends more time outside the province than in it leaving most governance responsibilities to deputy governor abdul rahman mangal prior to the august 2009 elections he stated on several occasions to us representatives that he expected to leave paktya for governorship in another province or national position following the elections rumors in gardez and jalalabad place him as top candidate for the governor of nangarhar comment as nangarhars governor he would have access to significant revenues generated at the torkham gate border crossing with pakistan end comment threatening the use of force during election campaigning 4 c during the preelection period for both the august 20 elections and the subsequent planned runoff hamdard spent significant amount of time outside of paktya reportedly campaigning for president karzai according to afghan and international press his activities in balkh province during this period created potential for armed conflict abdullah abdullah supporters claimed that hamdard abused his government position by campaigning in the northern provinces and distributing weapons to balkhs pashtun districts in order to destabilize the province hamdard denied these charges and armed clashes were avoided because the runoff was canceled but his activities in balkh demonstrated the strong support base that he continues to maintain in the north under investigation for 2007 deaths of demonstrators kabul 00004150 002 of 003 5 c hamdards own comments on his governorship in paktya leave the impression he was banished to this southeastern province in may 2007 he was forced to resign as governor of jowzjan when thousands demonstrated against him forces under his command shot at demonstrators in the uzbek town of shibirghan killing thirteen and injuring more than thirty reportedly further straining relations with dostum because many of the demonstrators were junbesh party members and dostum supporters xxxxxxxxxxxx informed us that the ministry of the interior administration deputy requested his assistance in arresting governor hamdard and bringing him to trial for the charges action has been taken to carry out this request center of paktya corruption scheme 6 s on august 23 the paktya office of the national directorate of security nds arrested prt paktyas local national engineer jawid khairudeen an afghan citizen for engaging in corrupt contract practices investigations surrounding the jawid case reveal an extensive network of corruption throughout the province of which hamdard and his office directorchief of staff hashmatullah yousifi are allegedly at the center paktya nds chief ali ahmad mubaraz and eyewitnesses have accused hamdard of soliciting bribes from contractors by having contractors arrested at job sites and held until the bribes are paid nds also accuses hamdard of being an active member of hezbeislami gulbuddin hig in balkh province funneling money he receives from bribes and smuggling drugs and jewels to hig operations in his home province of balkh he allegedly has illicit contacts with insurgents in parwan kunar and kabul provinces as well as pakistani intelligence isi and iranian affiliation unknown possibly irgc operatives through his business in dubai he is allegedly business partner with gulbaddin hekmatyrs in dubai evidence collected in the case points to corruption involving us funds and actively undermining giroa counterinsurgency policy 7 c on october 29 xxxxxxxxxxxx came to forward operating base gardez to speak with the prt about corruption in governor hamdards office according to xxxxxxxxxxxx there are four opportunities at the provincial level for illegally skimming usg funds during the life cycle of prt development project the first is during the biddingselection process at this stage afghan ministry line directors who are part of the contractor selection process receive payments to rig the scores assigned to contractors so that they will receive the highest scores and qualify for the contract the second opportunity occurs when the contractor requests permit to start work the governors signature is needed for the permit so payments are made to intermediaries to secure the governors signature the third occasion occurs during the quality assessmentquality control qaqc process at this stage workers may be arrested at the construction site and held until the requesting qaqc government official is paid bribe the other possibility is that the contractor must pay off the public works official conducting qaqc on the project in order to receive positive report the final opportunity for graft occurs at the ribboncutting ceremony where significant sums of money are sometimes passed during the giftgiving part of the ceremony strong sense of impunity 8 c based on evidence collected hamdard and his accomplices allegedly act with complete impunity blatantly placing themselves above the law contractors have informed the prt that hamdard told them he does not care about possible repercussions of his corrupt practices because hes under investigation already if contractors complain to the prt about him he will have them chained and dragged to his office adding salt to the wound on october 19 the governor called prt leadership and the maneuver commander to his office to confront them with an email hamdard obtained in which prt officer asked contractor constructing border police checkpoints questions about corruption involving paktyas chief of police and hamdard note the email was apparently leaked to hamdard although he stated he received it from giroa source end note during the meeting hamdard waxed indignant and in memo dated soon after kabul 00004150 003 of 003 proscribed ministerial line directors from meeting further with unama or prt officials or answering queries from them word has consequently spread about the corruption investigations and interlocutors are reluctant to talk to nds and coalition forces representatives many stating that their lives are threatened comment 9 c allegations of corruption surrounding governor hamdard have come from all quarters including the private sector public employees and xxxxxxxxxxxx afghans throughout the province generally regard him as corrupt hamdards hamfisted approach to intimidate international partners and the prt while not an admission of guilt illustrates his contempt for the international donor community giroa the lawful processes for development within ministry line directories in particular and the rule of law his reported statement that he wants to declare jihad against the prt is illustrative of the strained relations with the prt somewhat fortunately governor hamdard is often away in kabul or balkh province and deputy governor mangal is capable administrator and thoughtful intermediary 10 c if hamdards case comes to trial his political influence and hig ties make it possible or perhaps likely that corruption among other highranking government officials in the province and beyond will be exposed the prt has briefed this case to the embassy via appropriate channels and will share the investigative documentation to date us law enforcement officers based in kabul will work with the afghan attorney generals office to develop this case further as with other corruption cases major challenge to successful prosecution will be the afghan legal systems limited institutional capacity the major crimes task force mctf currently has four vetted prosecutors and limited number of vetted investigators to work this and numerous other pending corruption cases from all over the country 11 u this message was drafted at the paktya prt in
