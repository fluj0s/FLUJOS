international security ellen tauschers february 2 meetings with french counterparts from the elysee presidency and mfa included discussions of us disarmament priorities the npt review conference npt revcon the nuclear security summit and missile defense meeting separately with nsaequivalent jeandavid levitte presidency strategic affairs advisor francois richier and mfa strategic affairs director patrick maisonnave us tauscher reassured the french that while world without nuclear weapons is sincere usg ambition the united states will not move precipitously and will take allies interests into account us tauscher discussed next steps on npt revcon preparations including thinking creatively about outcomes and minimizing the threat of disruptive egyptian behavior us tauscher also clarified usg missile defense priorities especially political support for territorial defense at the 2010 lisbon nato summit end summary moving forward on disarmament 2 c us tauscher stressed to levitte richier and maisonnave that the us position on disarmament is not far from that of france president obamas ambition for world without nuclear weapons is sincere but grounded in reality and the united states will not act precipitously or jeopardize core french interests or our relationship us tauscher added that disarmament language in coming international forums such as the april nuclear security summit and the may review conference for the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt revcon is important to the united states however the united states also wants strong focus on nonproliferation tauscher stressed that the usg wanted to work with france to strike the right balance between disarmament and nonproliferation the united states remains committed to an effective deterrent and the presidents recent budget proposal includes significant increase for the maintaining of us nuclear forces additionally the forthcoming nuclear posture review npr will strengthen extended deterrence focusing on the quality of the deterrent force rather than quantity 3 snf expressing relief at the usg commitment to coordination with france richier and maisonnave nevertheless both stressed the french commitment to its nuclear deterrent and richier said the french worry that any unwelcome changes to us declaratory policy in the npr could signal us intention to insert the same policies into the nato strategic concept richier noted that any such attempt could impact frances ability to integrate its nuclear forces into nato in such situation they would have to declare their strategic forces totally independent us tauscher responded that the french would not be surprised by the npr because consultation would be ongoing adding that the united states has intention of acting unilaterally on nuclear issues in the nato context richier noted that france was working on paper that looks at its nuclear policy as result of their review the gof has concluded that their criteria for use are very limited 4 snf levitte asked when the administration was planning on pushing for ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt as us ratification would be key to chinese ratification the true french goal us tauscher said that getting the poststart treaty ratified would be first priority but that discussions of ctbt would start soon including an upcoming report by the national academy of sciences levitte stated that only when the us ratifies the ctbt will it be possible to put real pressure on the chinese on fissile material cutoff treaty fmct richier said the french have reason to believe that china has been pushing pakistan to keep up its opposition to starting negotiations at the conference on disarmament adding that pakistan does not seem to care that it is isolated nuclear security summit 5 sbu richier and maisonnave both reiterated frances position that the april nuclear security summit in washington should address radiological threats in addition to nuclear material they also expressed gof opposition to language in the draft communique calling for world without nuclear paris 00000193 002 of 003 weapons us tauscher suggested that while the united states would insist on having disarmament language in the communique the formulation agreed to in the g8 statement from the july 2009 laquila summit may allow consensus note we arecommitted tocreating the conditions for world without nuclear weapons in accordance with the goals of the npt end note richier and maisonnave agreed that france could accept this language they did note their concern that it may be difficult for all 44 countries invited to the nuclear security summit to agree to this language since some are not npt members npt revcon 6 snf richier and maisonnave agreed with us tauschers analysis that egyptian fm aboulgheit will if unchecked work to undermine the revcon with an aggressive posture on the middle east nuclear weapons free zone nwfz resolution us tauscher outlined ongoing us efforts to gain consensus language on the nwfz but underlined the need to contemplate more forwardleaning strategy she suggested considering possible phone calls from presidents obama and sarkozy directly to egyptian president mubarak in the midmarch timeframe to sensitize the egyptian president to the importance of the revcon in strengthening the npt and the unhelpful role the egyptian mfa is playing the french agreed on the likely need to elevate the issue beyond aboulgheit in this context us tauscher also brainstormed with the french on final package deal that could be offered to the egyptians including new consensus language on nwfz conference on civilian nuclear power in the middle east andor pushing israel to accept ctbt note the latter two were uncleared spontaneous french suggestions end note us tauscher said that if egypt is still not willing to budge it may be worth finding other nonaligned movement states that could be separated from egypt with promises of assistance that egypt would longer receive 7 c levitte said that progress on middle east peace prior to the revcon would help greatly in creating constructive atmosphere adding that he would pursue discussions on this linkage at the february 57 munich security conference 8 c richier suggested that in the absence of an acceptable and substantive final document it may be possible to capitalize on other events prior to the revcon including the september security council summit the nuclear security summit and the march oecdhosted civilian nuclear energy conference in paris richier said it may be worth looking into how to repackage the positive results achieved or expected at these events in statement or document at the revcon that acknowledges their importance in strengthening the npt iran 9 c levitte said that the french ambassador in tehran believes that there is growing split between the population and the regime that may be irreparable the iranian population thinks that action against the regime by the international community is good and france believes that it is important to support publicly those protesters taking to the street levitte noted that he had talked to iranian foreign minister mottaki in davos switzerland in an attempt to get the iranians to accept the tehran research reactor deal mottaki stated that iran had new ideas but did not provide any details levitte stated that iran was counting on tension between washington and beijing missile defense 10 cnf levitte said the gof is in the early stages of an interagency review on missile defense md according to him the old guard sees md as threat to frances nuclear deterrent but he added that president sarkozy has publicly stated that md is in fact welcome complement to deterrence france has money for nato system but would be happy to contribute specific capabilities he added that president sarkozy would not see specific proposals on the way forward for several weeks richier added that the more details the united states can provide on its own plans the easier it is to arbitrate between different factions in the french paris 00000193 003 of 003 government in the nato context maisonnaves deputy and nato specialist muriel domenach said frances concerns about funding required for md were amplified by its judgment that the costs for programs approved for common funding inevitably seem to rise after approval is given 11 c us tauscher and das frank rose clarified that the us phased adaptive approach paa was the us national contribution to nato system and that the usg would provide all funding us tauscher stressed that the main us priority was to gain political support at the head of state level for making territorial md nato mission at the 2010 nato summit in lisbon tauscher noted that the united states wants natos active layered theater ballistic missile defense altbmd to provide the backbone to the phased adaptive approach but that we would not make the lisbon summit donors conference other issues 12 c on the conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty maisonnave noted that the french government believes that the treaty is dead but paradoxically everyone believes it is good treaty and there is consensus on how to move forward germany for example does not believe it is dead the french believe that it would be better to take vienna documenttype approach to achieve some of the objectives of the cfe treaty 13 c both richier and maisonnave raised the issue of the ec151 eurocopter richier noted that france classified it as civilian helicopter the french were concerned that the us review on this issue continued to be postponed us tauscher agreed to look into this matter she noted that visit to the french factory was to occur soon and promised to get back to the french as soon as possible rivkin
