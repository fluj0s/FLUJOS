waned since 1997 but supporters differing strategies various service limits at the federal and state levels and the most recent general election are keeping the issue alive some proponents have changed their goal from mandatory limits through constitutional amendme nt to voluntary limits through candidates pledges to limit their own tenure fiftynine members of the 106th congress have pledged to limit their service including 10 who will reach their selfimposed limit at the end of this congress house members who have served as chair of the same committee or subcommittee since 1995 will also reach the 6year chairmanship limit established in house rules since 1995 at the state level total of 373 state legislators in 12 of the 19 states that limit their state lawmakers service were ineligible for reelection in 2000 term limits were also an issue in the 2000 general election some proponents were committed to recruiting and supporting candidates who pledged to limit their own tenure and to campaigning against those who did not take the pledge or who took the pledge but broke it this report will be updated as events warrant during106th congress background there is mandatory limit on the number of terms or years members of congress may serve but termlimit proponents continue their efforts to add federal lawmakers to the list of elected public officials whose tenure in office is limited currently that list includes the president governors in 39 states and state legislators in 19 states1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20543crs2 2 based in washington dc us term limits is national advocacy group that promotes term limits at the congressional state and local levels 3 this approach was developed after such events as the following 1 1995 ruling of the us supreme court us term limits inc v thornton invalidating stateimposed limits on congressional terms 2 failed attempts to attain support sufficient for passage in congress of constitutional amendment and 3 several

limits for their federal legislators 6 located in florida eight is enough is termlimit advocacy group that has spearheaded campaign of the same name ie eight is enough to limit the tenure of floridas cabinet members state legislators and members of the us congress proponents contend that term limits are needed to ensure membership turnover offset some of the advantages of incumbency increase competition in elections and enhance the role of merit rather than seniority in the distribution of power opponents argue that term limits would infringe on the citizens right to determine who serves and for how long force many of the most competent and experienced members from office prematurely and weaken the legislative branch by creating larger numbers of inexperienced and lame duck members of congress and shifting power from elected legislators to lobbyists congressional staff and executive branch personnel who are less accountable to the electorate issues in debate campaign against term limit pledgebreakers termlimit proponents have tried variety of strategies in their efforts to attain congressional term limits so far none have been successful major group us term limits2and other advocates hope to change that with their latest approach3 they have shifted from promoting mandatory limits through constitutional amendment to promoting voluntary pledges by candidates to limit their own tenure as part of this strategy proponents are also conducting media campaigns aimed at candidates who do not take the pledge or who take the pledge and subsequently break it the decision to focus attention on pledgebreakers has caused some discord among termlimit advocates some supporters believe that campaigning agains t pledgebreakers reinforces the importance of keeping the pledge others contend it may increase the opportunity for replacing termlimit advocates with people who dont support term limits4 further while this strategy may provide incentive for wavering members to keep their pledge it may also alienate some supporters and cause candidates who might be willing to limit their own terms to resist taking the pledge limit on house tenure another key issue among supporters is the appropriate limit on house service for example some including the term limits legal institute5 have suggested 12year limit others including us term limits continue to press for limit of 6 years still others including the floridabased group eight is enough 6 support an 8year limit in particular the willingness of some proponents to accept limitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20543crs3 7 in

had been in place approximately twofifths of the house 174 members or 40 would have been ineligible to serve and 6year limit would have rendered more than half of the current house 253 members or 59 ineligible to serve7 among termlimit advocates the general consensus is for limit of 12 years on senate service as of the beginning of the 106th congress 41 senators had served more than 12 years members who have taken the term limits pledge according to us term limits 59 members of the 106th congress 45 representatives and 14 senat ors have pledged to limit their tenure ten of these will reach their tenure limits at the end of this congress8 according to press reports seven of the 10 indicated they would keep their pledge and not seek reelection three retracted their pledge9 the three who retracted their pledge were reelected to the 107th congress and one of the seven who is stepping down in compliance with the pledge has not discounted running for reelection in 200210 members of congress who are former state legislators one effect of the limit on state legislators may be that those who have been term limited out of their state legislative position will seek other public offices state senators may choose to run for the state assembly or vice versa further number of state legislators may decide to seek election to congress historically significant percentage of the congress has previously served in state legislature for example at least 47 of the members of the last five congresses have been state legislators and 50 of the members of the 106th congress are

termlimit proponents were unable to attain limits on the overall tenure of members of congress but they did achieve limits in two important legislative arenas 1 chairmanships of committees and subcommittees in the us house of representatives and 2 state legislatures in 19 states11 since 1995 when republicans became the majority in the house house rules have limited members serving as chair of the same committee or subcommittee to three consecutive terms ie 6 years12 since 1990 19 states have chosen to limit the number of terms or years their state legislators may serve11 these committees in the us house of representatives and state legislatures may provide some insight into the termlimits issue and some of its practical effects the limits effects could have signif icant impact on whether there will be resurgence of interest in the issue in congress house congressional committees13 under the 6year chairmanship limitation representatives who have served as chair of the same committee or subcommittee since 1995 will reach their tenure limit at the end of this congress if change in the limitation rule is made member who has been chairman of the same committee or subcommittee since 1995 can continue serving as chairman of that committee or subcommittee in june 1999 however speaker dennis hastert ril made clarification of the limitation rule and announced that member who reaches the 6year chairmanship tenure limit at the end of this congress is not disqualified from becoming chairman of another committee or subcommittee during the 107th congress precisely how this would work and what its final effect would be are unclear at this time it may be that allowing any member who has reached the chairmanship tenure limit to become chairman of another committee or to chair subcommittee of his or her current committee would enhance continued use of the chairmans knowledge and experience it may also add incentive for some chairmen to continue serving after they have reached the 6year chairmanship tenure limit14 on the other hand it might cause some dissension particularly between junior and senior members as well as between committee and subcommittee members it could also provoke opposition from some advocates who consider the 3term limit on house committee and subcommittee chairs the most important achievement in the congressional termlimits movement15 the limits may also have significant impac t on committee structure subcommittee jurisdictions and partyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20543crs5 16 ethan wallison democrats likely to kill term

control of the house they might have abolished the 6year limit on chairmanships since most of them did not support it in the first place reportedly two years ago when democrat offered proposal in caucus that would have put limits on ranking members tenure the caucus rejected the proposal16 stillthe issue is not cut and dry for the democratic caucus in part because the last 5 years have seen good deal of turnover in the caucus one political observer has noted17 state legislatures proponents of term limits have had significant success in setting limits for state legislators nineteen states now limit how long their legislators may serve the impact is becoming increasingly evident in 1996 52 state legislators reached their tenure limits in 1998 more than 200 in 2000 total of 373 lawmakers were ineligible for reelection in 1998 the impact of term limits was most evident in the state houses of arkansas and michigan where half of arkansas 100 members and 67 of michigans 110 members reached their tenure limits tenure limits could be reached for the first time in the year 2000 by state legislators in five states arizona florida montana ohio and south dakota18 termlimit opponents believe this systematically high turnover will adversely affect the political process by paving the way for legislative newcomers to replace wellregarded experienced legislators proponents argue that the automatic turnover will guard against undue influence from special interests and maintain constant influx of newcomers who are more likely to take risks press for more ethics reform and be more fiscally responsible mixed results so far preliminary results from the states with term limits have been mixed for example in californiaone of the first two states to experience the impact of term limits in both state houses all of the assembly members who had served in the legislature since 1990 and many of the state senators reached their tenure limits in 199619 one political observer claims that term limits has generated even more partisanship and incivility among members growing inability to compromise legislative leadership with greatly reduced powers and sharp decline in legislators

the case for nor against term limits is sharply advanced by our findings one can find results that suggest the reform is working in both positive and negative ways22 perhaps further reflecting the mixed results from the states is the variety of the termlimit proposals for state legislators that were introduced in the state legislatures in 1999 and 2000 among these were measures to establish term limits for state legislators measures to repeal existing term limits for state legislators and measures to limit terms but also to increase the length of term in either or both houses of the state legislature impact on the 2000 general election termlimit advocates made the issue factor in the 2000 general election in january 1999 us term limits announced plans to spend 20 million in the year 2000 election cycle on campaign aimed at educating voters on the benefits of term limits the group also promised concerted effort to defeat house members who it believes are violating their pledges23 to that end the group and some of its allies conducted campaign aimed at praising those selflimiters who kept their pledge criticizing those who broke it and pressuring those who appeared to be wavering about keeping it to keep it recent developments on march 7 2000 voters rejected termlimits initiative on the california primary ballot among other things the measure would have allowed congressional candidates voluntarily to sign nonbinding declarations of intention to serve more than three house terms and two senate terms or to declare their choice not to so limit their terms on
