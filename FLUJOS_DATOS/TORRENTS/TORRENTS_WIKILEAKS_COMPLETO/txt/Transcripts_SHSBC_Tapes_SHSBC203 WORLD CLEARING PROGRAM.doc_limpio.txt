world clearing program lecture given on 14 august 1962 thank you lecture 2 saint hill special briefing course 14 august ad 12 world clearing program audience really mmm this is the first lecture or announcement or bulletin or anything else on the forwarding of scientology on very worldwide clearing basis now the point involved here is that we have world clearing activity sort of understood see its sort of understood that were going to clear lot of people see but let tell you that simply incorporating foundation and putting it into your own home with administrative lines of any character is not the way to go about world clearing the place begins to look like bargain basement very rapidly of course these snide references are to 42 aberdeen road elizabeth new jersey i dont hardly think even the foundations of the house were left when we finally but such things require planan agreed upon and more importantly highly workable plan that will deliver the goods now let tell you about this plan innot the plan itselfbut lets tell you how central organization could go about clearing ill show you then how the plan can develop out of these mechanisms we have hpahcasome slight degree of neglected sphere now terribly necessary but nevertheless neglected sphere prepchecking is not really an adequate skill to turn people totally loose with there is another form of auditing which has just marched into view which has terrific therapeutic value its goals listing not finding goals but goals listing and whatever else happens with trick ways of finding goals and that sort of thing youve still got goals listing and the funny part of it is is somebody is spinning in keokuk and they write you frantic letter saying what can they do well its dangerous to ask them for their withholds because they sure will neglect to put one or two on and just wind up madder than hell at you but you can ask them for their goals you can tell them to write goals liststate some astronomic figure and tell them to write you some goals and send you the list and you can carefully preserve it or see that it gets turned over to an auditor or something of that sort for gods sakes dont handle one of those lists badly all right therethere is this action and very shortly clearing assistance will definitely be part of hcahpa training definitely how would he go about this trained hpa would know how to prepcheck particularly if given more reliable if more expensive meter with red light or something like thator big oscilloscope or something of that sort youve got prepcheck action this person has to take now thats very time devouring person isnt going to stay insession at all with flock of overts that are right here in pt or they wont talk to the auditor you cant get them to ask answer questions youll never be able to get the rudiments in to find goal dont you see so thats necessary action your goals listing or any trick goals listing that you care to make sure is done could be taught at that level see weve taken an awful lot off of an auditor now you just look at your checksheets your checksheets are thin compared to what they were and your next action would be listing goal see weve just skipped finding goal there we just omitted that so an hcahpa who could list goals prepcheck somebody into position for goalsmooth the case out get the overts off and that sort of thingand then could list all the items for goal would be very valuable character to have around wouldnt he and gradually as he went along for sure hed learn how to find goals if hed gone that far see see that so if you included listing of goals and listing of items for goals as part of hcahpa training youve pushed clearing long way ahead because why because handful of saint hill grads in an organization could find all the goals necessary to be found in that organization theres where the skill and accuracy must exist see youre veryyou got goal and youve got to really be sharp now thats very much to the point because if you were to list the goals for the pc or drive the pc on into the listing of goals and sessions andas saint hill graduateand prepcheck the pc and set the pc up in all directions to find goal and then go ahead and null by the mid ruds the list and find the goal and then sit down and do all the listing necessary to clear that up man youre looking at hours now these hours are being pushed out into rather fabulous thing yes youre listing goals here after you found one but i call something to your attention that once you get slippery on finding goal and you get used to the tiger drills and that sort of thing this is less time consuming particularly as im cutting down and shortcutting how that operation is done but notice that there are shortcuts being done aside from the tip that youd better clean up the goal and lines at the beginning of every session in listing goal out and you realize that goal listing action runs as many as 2500 items per list and there are four lists thats 10000 items man thats lot of hours of auditing so if we took saint hill graduate andand moved it down to the point where he did supervision on the goals list and supervision on the listing of itemsmade sure this was going along all righthe makes sure of this by the way that at item two or three hundred on each list that the pain is in the right place and its you know all firing off properly and he gives the goal another instructors check and so forth and makes sure its firing as long as he was satisfied the case was set up to have his goal found before he found the goal and as long as he was satisfied that the listing would continue to free needle if he had some people around who could list goals do the prepchecking and do the actual listing of the goals weve really smoothed this out havent we all right so in central organization policy letter has just gone out that forbids saint hill graduate from doing anything in that central organization but find goals and staff training has all of sudden been given the push on the tricks oftheyve all got lot of prepchecking and so forth under their belts now now just listing of goals and listing of items dont you see this is part of the training program so very soon somebody will be able to walk into central organization and get prepared get his prepchecking get the listing and so forth and find himself greater or lesser part of his you see it isnt that the saint hill graduate would have him for one intensive or one and onehalf andor two intensives or something it isnt divided up that way you dont do that that way he audits him as long as it is necessary to find the goal you got the idea he picks him up at the moment hes ready to pick him up as dependent on whether the pc is ready and has been carried on and then carries him just as long as is necessary to actually find andand prove out that goal and then drops him like hot potato and picks up the next pc you got the idea you see hehe might be lucky enough to find the goal in four or five days or he might find the goal in one and onehalf intensives or two and half intensives or something like this you see at that moment why youd have to have fluidity of schedule that the pc would be reverted to staff auditor who is not saint hill graduate see that way you got central organizations doing clearing as long as saint hill graduates arent put around in address section or something you see now thats central organization program it aint saint hill graduatesthereshad enough metering and enough this and enough that and need pushing around and so forththats what they ought to be doing oh yes well if youre rich you can have saint hill graduate as d of p and one as d of t you see thats getting wealthy thats getting real wealthy i will go into staff clearing in just moment but lets take look now at that as an activity you see that that would be then workable activity and youd start turning out clears and you wouldnt be wasting your skill this is way to do this now youre going to see some section of this program as the wheels turn here and although it is very hard on somebody in the middle of listing to suddenly lose his auditor and have another auditor shoved on youre going to see that gradually taking place here but the advanced 3ga auditor is finding goals and the new person just moved into 3ga is doing nothing but list got the idea audience mmhm now where you have group which is coaudit you realize that if inexactly and if rather rough to supervise still approximates the same type of activityroughly and now let say word about staff clearing as special activity your staff could coaudit on getting the goals listed and could coaudit on the listing of items and thus form an auditing activity with the saint hill graduate staff staff auditor which is what theyre called picking them out just as fast as they were ready or as he had time and whipping down the list and finding their goal and shoving them back into the group you see youd still have clearing going forward on staff training program see how you could do that all right now lets take another look over here atwere not speaking of world clearing yet were speaking of central organizations they will do an awful lot of it but lets look at wider program here lets look at world clearing exclamation point we get fifty people and i dont care what financial arrangements are made with these fifty people central organizationsthey might do something like this at sometime or another in pe and so on but possibly doubtful if you got fifty people and perhaps those people are contributing so much per week as group as coauditand you talk to these people you talk to them straight from the shoulder and you say heres what were going to do with you people you all want to be clear fine thats all understood theres nogoing to be arguments with that all right weve got that taped you may not even know what it is but you want to be it thats fine youre tired of being in the muck and going through the endless cycle of it all and going deeper all right we can lift you out of that fine thats established and understood but how are we going to accomplish this well the way were going to accomplish this is were going to form coaudit and youre going to be in here three nights weekor whatever arrangements are made in timeand youre going to have your pc and youre going to be somebodys pc and youre going to undertake the necessary actions to get goals listed and then afterwards to get the items listed and as soon as youre ready or if several are ready at one time you are going to draw lots with short straws and the saint hill graduates running this particular unit probably two of them will get that person by the nape of the neck when that person is ready and just on daytime auditing schedule auditing certainly more than five hours in the day find that persons goal and shove them back into the coaudit and pick up the next one and find that persons goal and shove them back into the coaudit and pick up that next one and find that persons goal and shove them back into the coaudit you see this audience member yeah i do and we say well thats what you folks is going to do and that means that within the year youall going to be clear within the year now as far as second goals are concerned well go as far on that as we can after all the first goals are found we will keep this cycle going but your main action at first is to learn something about the tools of your trade and read few of these bulletins and try to make sense out of them and youre not expected to study the theory of whats going on and youre not expected to do this but youre actually expected to sit there and look like an auditor as people in coaudit very often do quite well and theres somebody supervising that coaudit and the coaudit is pretty muzzled it usually runs off rather smoothly well the financing situation of this particular character of course is selfexplanatory i dont know whether you would charge them so much to find their goal or something of this sort or if they carry it all ahead just on their weekly contribution or what you would do about this thats up to the persons running the coaudit i myself would rather favor fairly liberal weekly contributionnot small oneand base it on the numbers i had that would make perfectly adequate income running through the place even princely income running through the place so nobody is having to dive sideways and audit some psycho from north manitoba just because the center needs some money you know this is the wildest most uneconomical thing to do and yet centers and field auditors are always doing this you see they all of sudden audit for free audit for free audit for nothing the light bill keeps going up you know and the rent goes unpaid and then all of sudden they have to go on some wild wingding of accepting pcs that they never would have dreamed of just because they were too bashful to ask for certain constant contribution from people who are around that center you got the idea all right now we take this as an action what damage would it do interesting question to ask since very naturally youre going to have some interesting blowups in coaudit but if you have these peopleif theyve got any withholds or looking blowy or something like thatyou sir make sure that they tell you about them whether they tell their auditor about them or not you can probably keep this thing cooled off dont you see and you make some screaming set of penalties for anybodys pc blowing just dont let them have pcs that blow in other words make them take some responsibility for this fact you know take the other mechanisms which come into account or whatever other mechanisms are necessary to keep the group together and keep it going you see now that group is going to be very hopeful youre going to have to do certain amount of training if you dont do certain amount of training why of course youll find yourself around the bend with this activity well the thing to do is to do the training at first but get some goals listed so your program isnt stopped waiting for goals lists or something and you take the person that is the best trained and looks the best or takethatthe few that are you know pretty good you get the goals list in hurry and get this program of finding the goal on your weekly auditing schedule you see just pocketapocketapocketa and then fit the rest of it in and put it together while youve got that part of it running and these guys are going to go frantic the people who arent up to it are going to go frantic because something is actually happening and you havent got to stand up in front of them all the time and fill them full of hope and courage and all that sort of thing because they see it happening in their midst theres joe they found his goal last week see and hes going clear hes being listed right now by betsy ann hahahahahaha lucky stiff see something is happening well youve got quite boom to lower there if somebody starts slogging it and doing nothing and muck it up see now you could even improve this just little bit by making the persons auditing skill certain number of points against theirgetting their goal found in other words you balance this off not only is their needle straight and their list complete but their auditing points must be adequate to that some type of police action so that they deliver proper session or have wish to could count against their number on the list to have their goal found dont you see when it comes to select the nextnow i wouldnt select them all at first see id grab them in handfuls of three four five at time id never get it plotted ahead more than about six weeks see on the people who have not had their goals found i would never get it plotted ahead more than few weeks you see why theres this one bird says hes got to wait for eight months until his goal is found do you seejust arbitrarily well hes going to ride hes not going to try to jockey himself up into more favorable position by gettingmaking better show out of it you get the idea some type of mechanism of this character would be highly desirable now you might think that this would cut people off from going and getting trained nofar from it far from it theres somebodyhes looking pretty bad andhes had his testlet us say hes had his taste of auditing hes had this and hes had that all of sudden hell propose to you the novel idea that he could be of more help to you if he went down to the central organization and took course and came back because he isnt about to have his goal found in the next three months anyway and why doesnt he go and take course and come back in the meantime and hed be straightened out by that time and so forth youll find out this kind of randomity occurring and far from discouraging it you should encourage it you wind up with more help dont you see all right you continue on along this particular line and you will wind up at the end of yearif two auditors had fifty peopleyou would wind up at the end of the year with high probability of having gotten the lot you would have released into the community fifty firstgoal clearsthud that would do things man now you shouldnt multiply the number of franchise holders or coaudittype groups doing this by the number of years and arrive with the figure of how many people will be cleared in ten years this is not the way that would go at all it would go by arithmetical progression this stuff would start taking off on high climb you see about the only thing that limits it is how many people could be put through saint hill thats limiting factor and this of course is you know rough and at time will i ever downgrade an auditors skill just to let him go home because his wife is dead of starvation or something of the sort these are minor affairs are you good auditor thats what counts you see because actually you lose the whole game see i let an auditor go out of here that cant audit cant handle cases and that sort of thing the whole game is lost any time hes been here is actually lost now that number actually could be stepped up without reducing quality too fantastically by various refinements and so forth but there are an awful lot of oldtime scientologists around lots of them around the world youd be amazed so ive instituted new program of putting them in touch with franchise auditors and im now in the process of getting all the names and addresses of everybody who ever thought he wanted to be trained and sending them to the nearest franchise holder wherever they are in the world see so that in his own town why somebody may have quite few hpas hcas that sort of thing that he hardly knows of or that have and then weill write these people and tell them to contact this center and the center can talk to that person and get that person in and cooperating in some way or another you see and well use our backlog well use our carefully builtup backlog and that backlog i of course have been carefully building up over long period of time and its rather sizable itd surprise you now that gives you some semitrained assistants right at the start fromfor administrative action or it gives you people who would simply come into the group for this particular purpose or various other uses dont you see well this isthis is jumpoff now thats not very startling arrangement is it that doesnt stun you but its its terribly simple arrangement and if you think that in single year theres possibility of releasing twentyfive clears into this community and fifty into that one and thirtyfive into another city and this will start to look interesting i think itll look far more interesting than you realize at first glance so this is sort of kickoff well now ive been waiting until we had provenup procedure it was going along and it was doing all right and of course im working on refining the speed with which goals can be found which is single pin that would extend this program out too much and weve got something in the run and that is kind of the way i figured it out i have talked to couple of people who know on this and they seem to think this is very feasible program its essentially very simple but dont get so crazy as to believe that you can audit twentyfive hours day and carry forward the program there must be finite auditing period and i certainly would never audit more than about five hours in day i just wouldnt five pardon fivefive and half hours thats about what staff auditor does and if i myself were working in this center i think i would probably work about oh id maybe do four or five hours of auditing day and id spend some time in the evening on training and making sure the coaudit was running all right and id have some reception assistancesomebody to answer the phone and carry the money to the bank its nice to have such people around ive always found them quite useful now as we expand this that is basic world clearing activity now of course the workhorse of scientology is the central organization and always has been it brings in new people quite consistently with its pes and it does various things years ago central organizations only existed as information centers and after that just as means of well training theyve always existed for training but as far as pcs are concerned means of demonstrating results and keeping up the level of results and that sort of thing now we started out on program which was not necessarily premature but i just got the word around that we had certain number of people were going to clear out in the field former hgc pcs and that sort of thing and central organization ought to start getting those lined up using this other program of clearing see it isnt question of if theyre going to come in because most of these pcs come into central organizations are rather scattered around theyre in the oddball places of the world and so forth and they come in were going to run them through this same type of program i just described to you see that in central organizations they start getting these people lined up not question of if they are going to come in its question of they were on this list of people to be cleared when are they coming in to get their preparatory actions and everything ive been doing is trying to improve quality of auditing up to point where it could be tremendously trusted well youre going to have trouble with that in any organization youre going to have trouble with that on any coauditis to keep up the auditing quality and not let it be slipshod and not let it skid thats always fight its always fight because bunch of green auditors can think up you think you can think upgod gave you lecture an hour ago about dynamic assessment and theres going to be some of you asking the instructors what do i do now i have two dynamics rock slamming equally now what do we do from that point you see well theres going to be problem there thats for sure but you think you can think up problems well most of your problems make sense man you get coaudit goingyou get coaudit going the problems you get make sense at all you cant figure out how the devil this ever came about it should happen to you you know its pretty weird this guys been mooning around and worrying and worrying and worrying and youve never quite been able to figure out what he was worrying about and finally one day he levels with you and so forth he cant figure out whether this is theosophy as it ought to be practiced and you say huh hes been there for six months but he thought he was in philosophy group of some kind youd be amazed at some of the wild things that happen and of course you have less control over people and they get themselves fouled up well you know you can foul up pcs and students pretty badly on the second dynamic other regulations when theyre missing well things can get awful kind of gruesome around in unit but how about one over which you have control of any kind you see whereas the people are in their workaday life you also have the problem of they try to adjust it with you when they can get off and so forth and i just never would qanda with that at all i dont care when you can get off i can only tell you what week you must take off because youve got to be here and the fellow says yes but if and if and if and so forth and id be sure and be fired if i took that particular week off well get another job dont worry with that part youre supposed to be here you can get that straightened out pretty well they have tendency to muck up your time you can watch central organization you know exactly what point the public is impinging against because itll be that point that is the most scrambled and mucked up its the most offline and man its really offline itll beitll be something inwherever it directly contacts the public that hat youve got to put back on about every three months see because itll go sailing off and reception is now expected to empty the wastebaskets lord knows whats happening but this has gone out you see routing of bodiesbody routing lines and that sort of thing well that can happen in central organization it sure can happen like mad on scheduling and so forth on coaudits and your main danger there is not maintainmaybe it doesnt make any sense to you but let tell you very severely that the main danger is with your limited staff and the small number with which you are operating that the public shoves your time scheduling madly out and you just got to be meaner than gutshot bear theyre going to tell you theyre going to wander in there at eight oclock when they shouldve been there at seventhirty and that sort of thing well you just got to learn to lower the boom because the point theyll most mess up is time time is the single source of human aberration in actual fact thered be aberration if it werent for time old dianetic axiom and that is the point where the craziest ones will louse you up the most so its the craziest ones of course that you want to keep in line hardest so if you want to keep the time line most severely walked you will also be imposing tremendous amount of good control on those that are the worst in the group and its an excellent control factor so if you control time if you control the groups time you will find out theres less enturbulation and aberration visible in the group and they will want you to audit them after the coaudit at night for two hours you see or in the afternoon from 137 you see to 318 you see because they have to pick their mother up at school now and if you let themif you let them move around your time factor youve let them control you in their sessions thats just something that you should use because the first thing they try to do itll be the hardest front for you to hold but once youre holding that front youll find out that you will win in many other zones and areas that you never dreamed of winning in just hold that time guy is there at 731 he is supposed to be there at 730 youve already started to tell them what they were going to do this evening and how theyre pairing off and youre reading their schedule at their roll call and somebody walks in for heavens sakes greet them effusively dont let them ever sneak in greet them effusivelyjust stop the whole operation be happy they gladwere glad to come tonight and theyll be there at 730 after that and make sure they know that you think that scheduling is important and as soon as they find out that you think scheduling of what youre doing with them is important lot of other marbles will start concatenating with other marbles and the next thing you know they wont have lost their marbles so inaccessibly theyll start to reassemble and theyll say well this outfit means business because everything fires off on time see its method of controlling people who are otherwise quite unruly now thats thethats the basic action of control but youve got to keepyouve got to keep certain amount of administration running and if you have just couple of auditors and nobody doing any administration at all you all of sudden are going to waste an awful lot of auditing time an awful lot of auditing time gets lost in answering the mail and filing the letters you know and answering the telephone and so forth and answering foolish questions and itsyouve got to save certain amount of time in order to get broad clearing effective now im speaking about time merely because its primary control point because its primary aberration point these people out ofgiven any fifty peoplewill rather string out to the degree of preparation if you have single thing they have to pass they will actually sort of sort themselves into the leading order of hens on the length of time they will pass this certain thing it doesnt much matter what it is see because of this the longer they take to do anything why the more reactive bank is in their road in other words the more reactive bank is in their road the less understanding per unit of time the reactive bank actually is composed of time at all and they get up into total timelessness so they never have any time to do anything so this has various ramifications but it plots out just this way time is single source of aberration and such person requires or anywell people have different periods of time to register the same recognition see we hang sign on the wall and it says boojum and if you actually had areaction meters wired up to every person in the room that could plot it on drum of some kinditd fire offyou would find out that everybody in the room would have taken different period of time to have recognized what the word was and what was hanging on the wall and it would get on down from anything from hundredth of second down to ten minutes and that is direct index of how much bank is in the fellows road on study do you understand some students require longer than others to absorb the same data now if it were just pandetermined factor that is to say if it were just factor which nothingit existed the same on all subjectsthis would be very easy to plot wed say this person is tensecond character see in other words it took this person ten seconds to really register and soak in any one item the person was looking at unfortunately this isnt true human beings vary from subject to subject dynamic to dynamic because their goals are sorted on the different dynamics and theyre stupider on one thing than they are on another so it takes them longer to absorb one thing than it does another so you get certain unevenness running through all this because of the variability and there actually isnt real general constant you take somesome girl and you show heryou show her slide rule and she looks at this thing and she looks at it and she looks at it and she looks at it and looks at it and all shes supposed to find on this thing is its got numbers on it see and she looks at it and she looks at it and she looks at it and she turns it over and she looks at it and youre waiting for this girl to recognize that there are numbers on the slide rule and she just looks at it and looks at it and looks at it an hour later shes still looking at it and theres only one thing you have asked her to recognize is that it has numbers on it she just wont do it and you show her cake recipe thats full of numbers she goes bzzzt bang practically knock out the cake together to throw it in the oven before you could spit get the idea its just where her goal sits see here was numbers in one form and numbers in another form and in one form she just knows she must not ever understand this well of course thats practically an infinite time nonunderstand see that gets in the road of your meter reading persons ability to read meter is dependent upon the amount of aberration they have about meters in actual fact in ten minutes person b who is very aberrated on the subject has less time spent in recognitionyou follow this see out of ten minutes there is less of that ten minutes used in actual recognition than person who is not quite so aberrated on that subject who only observes it for tenth of second there is more recognition for person in tenth of second than there is for person b in ten minutes do you see thats why you hand the meter to one person and they have hell of time seeing the needle they stare at it and stare at it and stare at it you know well hell it read seconds ago and theyre still looking and another person the thing gives the barest tick and the person is right there johnnyonthespot see hes recognized that digested it and put it out its on the subject of meter conversely we might take this same person give them very complicated bulletinthis isnt necessarily true there is some coordination between these two points but not necessarilyand we give them this bulletin and they fire off on the bulletin brrrrrrr and they go in and they pass it brrrrrrr they understand all of it everything is all fine and so forth and they take the meter in the hand and when did it read well theyll stare at it as long as they havent got time in which to recognize it very sane person has fantastic quantities of time i almost made onesomebody faint one time by telling them the local program for this planet that is this quarter of the universe program for this planet this person haswas just going ahhaaa you could just see the exhaustion coming off of this person oh my god thatjust embracing plan that had that much time mixed up in it see real time mixed up in it it just wore them out i was tossing off thingswell in 5000 years this is whats supposed to happen you see and then this is actually were in dead period right now which is absolutely true there isnt anything much going to happen here for about 5000 years so theres little time to stretch but after that why theres several programs firing off and so forth and the actual allowed time for this particular planet was 15000 years you see and plot this plot that and so on and thats fairly rapid program thats fairly rapid you know speedy program thats sort of rush program this person was dying at the idea you know of planning something out for 5000 years well hell ive seen billion years planned out on the track down to its smallest detail it gets to be fantastic you know i mean how muchhow much time is time and it has great deal to do with the amount of recognition person can experience per unit of time so anyway here is your source of aberration your basic source of aberration is time if you didnt have any time you wouldnt have any motion dont you see you could have havingness either the unit velocity of vibration so the possibility of having any matter would be quite slight all of these various other things all add up and the more bank persons got the less time he hag during the longer period do you follow that rock can sit there without any recognition at all for few trillennia you see speed of recognition depends on how much time person can actually have present time for some people is thousandth of second and for some people as much as second or two and you can expand that out to about ten minutes and then it becomes frightening if your present time was to be expanded in this split second herei mean you justi snap my fingers your present time was expanded to ten minutes so that you knew everything that was going to happen in ten minutes do you realize you would be able to see the consequences of everything that was going to happen and correct it before it occurred audience mmmm you certainly would make mistakes would you so the number of mistakes person makes is actually proportional to the amount of present time they have present time is band present time is not aan instantaneous instant and the saner person is and the better they are and the freer they arelet put it that way lets forget this sanerbut the freer they are the more present time theyve got it gets pretty wild sometimes somebody with ten minutes of present time you see he can unturn all the corners he shouldnt have turned before he turns them but this guy who has got thousandth of second as his present time never foresees the difficulty of doing anything he never foresees it he does the most impulsive and stupid things you ever heard of youll find him always driving up the side roads and backing out of those to get back onto the main highwaydrivingalways see hes just in total confusion all the time all the time all the time he never can foresee anything there isnt any time to foresee anything foresight is not really brightness but pt theres nothing beats looking you can be pretty smart and think your way out of things but nothing beats looking your way out of things of course if you were able to foretell the future for thousand years with complete accuracy your first thought is that you would be bored stiff well i dont know how did you have to have excitement that waywhereby you have excitement only because youre stupid thats quite interesting isnt it anyway this basically gives you very fast index on pcs i didnt mean to talk about it so long it gives you very fast index on pcs coaudit members and so forth it gives you very very easily assembled groups and so forth not necessarily dependent upon apas and ocas and that sort of thing you see not necessarily dependent upon their intelligence and that sort of thing but the amount of time it takes them to recognize something and you could almost break down your group in advance into when they would get their goal found do you see how you could do this its by measuring how much time is required to find out something is there and this is useful in numerous ways its meter useful put something in front of somebody and wait for ping on the meter yeah thats the most direct index i know of you put little red light or statue of snake or something like that on the desk in front of themput it down with thud and look at your meter itll finally register but on some people when you put it down they register it instantly you dont even have time to look back to your emeter the thing has been recognized you got the idea well the length of time it takes them to absorb auditing information would be the length of time it would take them to be reliable there is some coordination between these two points you shouldnt be toodont yourself be stupid in classifying these people or in pairing them up and you should pair up comparable recognition periods if you want to call it that rather than comparable social interests or comparable ages or something like that it has nothing to do with it its comparable recognition period and these two people in coaudit will be fairly satisfied with each other it will seem reasonable to both of them and if youve got somebody whos got tenminute recognition period or something like that and you put them with somebody with tenminute recognition period the other person will sit there quite happily he knows how long it takes and understands but you mix up tenth of second recognition period with tenminute recognition period and theyll both drive each other batty now methods i havent even explored actually many methods of determining actually what the recognition period is or anything like that but such methods could easily be developed and easily be used for dividing up and separating and putting together coaudits that would be highly successful because your coaudit will break down on the basis that some member thinks the other members are stupid and if you keep them segregated at comparable levels of recognition theyre not going to get this audience mmmm now all of that is in technical lines but how much should you teach these people in coaudit well id just irrationally demand perfection out of them i wouldnt cut back my sights never make practice of tolerating bad auditing i dont care whos doing it and you demand this out of them youd be amazed how closely they will approach it of course itll probably be utterly hopeless when you were ten feet away at first and then theyll let you be fifty feet away see theyre okay as long as youre there and then because youre running the group they will be all right i wouldnt count on them ever taking any vast responsibility for cases individually dont you see because they the but they work all right as long as somebody will take some of the responsibility for it and youll find out they work fine that way youll find out in any coaudit the amount of gain in the coaudit is to some degree proportional to the amount of responsibility which the instructor of that coaudit is taking for those people and if hes taking very little responsibility youll have very little gain regardless of what process theyre runningpeople always come around asking for process well theres thousands of processes you an old scientologist could sit there and dream up auditing processes day and night theyd haveall have some workability but you havent got to waste any time on this coaudit by dreaming up processes of this and that you have present time problem process which is independent of ow and responsibility you have problem of comparable magnitude going back even further so as you dont have to get too much into ow in exchanging these terrible confidences that they dont want to you can dodge these things to very marked degree you can set this thing up to run quite successfully but your best bet is to just put them right on the project theyre supposed to be on theyre there to list goals and list items well god help em theyd better be studying or listing goalsdoing something or prepchecking goals lists or doing something analogous to goals list right up to the time when they get their goal found you see till persons goal is found in other words put them on quite real actions start them out on prepcheck you always got two or three in group youve had something to do with and you cleaned them up to large extent yourself start in with them and get them with goals list so their goals list is prepared start the others in with prepcheck type of action that would be enough for staggering then really keep themkeep them quite germane to getting thegetting the goals list all straightened up and squared away you know spend lots of coaudit time on the actual fact and dont try to dream up side panels just to keep them busy because if youve got to keep them busy you can always give them something to study that would advance their skill and if youre up against keeping people busy aside from swamping up their present time problem and youtheyve got everything else done and theyre just on wait make them study you see make them study listing theyd study that with considerable enthusiasm you get what i mean see try not to occupy peoples time because people have to be kept busy but try to utilize the time available to you in that coaudit try to utilize that time in the most productive possible way thats contributive to the situation now i dont know how many coaudit people could be handled by one auditor i think one auditor handling it it would get fairly lonesome id hate to be in that position because ive been in it for years see its not very tenable position you got datum of comparable magnitude youre always on parade you see you never take your boots off in the barracks you know its harder on you than youthan you would think and many field auditors just practically go out through the bottom just because theyre all by themselves itsthey get lonesome they got nobody to talk to about this theyre always explaining always teaching you know and therestherell be something missing in their vicinity now as you see coaudit in central organization could be organized also along these lines theres reason why central organization shouldnt run such group of its own in its immediate vicinity but its group certainly would have nothing to do with whether or not such coaudit group was running elsewhere now we speak of whether or not group so running should be franchise holder or city office or something of this sort for long time ive been trying to decide this myself in actual fact were moving up toward better proposition as city office franchise holder doesnt feel like he belongs as much as he should there are many things that are little bit haywire with this and actually these characters are holding an outpost dont you see of some kind or another theyre holding an exact point of reference and if that point of reference isnt firmly on the map they to that degree are being scanted because they move around and fold up and pass on and that sort of thing it has sometimes been difficult to maintain center of control i mean not control the point but the points control of the environment the operation ebbs and flows to too great an extent but i expect greater stability will occur in the future and i expect to see franchises more or less turning into city offices had very little to do with incomeit has tremendous amount to do with the influence in the area and the erection and maintenance of worldwide communication channel youll find out that your communication channel falls off to the degree that the person is outside the organization and comes up to the degree that the person feels he is inside the organization you understand thats just feels see its quite amazingquite amazing the difference this makes and what im looking forward to is that every such area and held down of course is simply city office its perfectly official office people walk in there if they dont and its in communication with everything else and it gets itself in trouble and its got somebody to scream to and then the persons there dont feel that this is an outsider you see they feel well thats one of the gang weve got to pitch in and help dont you see any way we could promote this i would be very happy to do so but were advancing now toward necessity to make everything neatas neat as possible because its going to blow up anyway im great believer in blowing up neatly you see for years now in central organization design and communication line design i have tried to make those lines expandable and yet i find out any time central organization doubles its business its lines blow up and what you really do is try to make the lines as expandable as you can and then be an expert in putting it back together again do you get that see and then youre smart thats very smart measure to take then youre not always dismayed because it somewhat fell apart for instance i know that in every central organization the body line between the d of p and the registrar must be put in every three months see im an expert now in patching that line up im willing to be reasonable and talk to them about it and give them all kinds of unreasonable answers you see i work hard at this all right that linebecause the public impinges against it totallyblows up every three months in every central organization in the world all right so it does well i used to knock my brains out and be very unhappy about it all the time because it fell apart and now ive realized that its perfectly all right for it to fall apart because i can always put it together again get the idea well any time increased traffic hits network of communication lines you can expect the seams to open and the water to pour in here and thereno matter how carefully you planned it and if youre so sold on perfection that you go out and commit suicide because your plan wasnt perfect every time so help you dont get much accomplished youre just picking up new bodies all the time you know but the point im trying to make is is you start throwing sixty clears fifty clears thirty clears into this community and that community inside of year well we havent got enough telexes we havent got enough personnel we havent enough administration we havent enough file cabinets we havent enough printed books you understand well were walking into this in that full realization just go ahead and realize it and then realize that we can still put it back together again you understand and itll look lot better to you because the second you start putting this much traffic and this much strain on your own communication lines remember youre putting an equal amount of strain which actually is multiplied for various reasons on the public at large and theyre not organized at all they go into total confusion they hit your lines they blow up and any patch youve put on blows off at that moment you see and its pretty bad you must be skilled in putting something together not skilled in holding the same old line together see you see your lines gone well dont waste your time and energy and sweat in screaming and saying how terrible this is just be an expert at putting the line there again you see its gone put it back dont scream at and say do you realize that for four months there has been hco secretary in chicago you know like what do you mean isntwhawhatwhats the matter with you see i mean what are you doing that for why dont you send cable and say i just found theres hco secretary in chicago and janet woods would be fine for the post is she appointed see thats much more effective then all i have to do i dont have to wade through the scream you see all i have to do is say okay you see and all of sudden youve got that area in order again or its being put in order do you get how this is well youre not in position of holding the world together so you might as well get used to the idea of putting it together so any coaudit or central organization entering in on clearing program should design it so that itll operate perfectlywithout single hitch please do and get the exact people on the post that should be on post and get the exact files that should be there exactly filed and in place just plan it down to ato split hair and then put it all back together again the second it blows up see because you never do an expansion or forward action of this character without coming apart at the seams the public sees to that now you hold the fort with time with good regulations with discipline by not compromising by not throwing everything out of line just because one person goes out of line you hold it together and you realize that world clearing is on basis of you somehow make it it isnt planned juggernaut that rolls on smoothly down the highway look there isnt even road there and until recently hasnt even been vehicle so if you start bumping and so forth look down and youll find out youre going over tree trunksdont scream just make better road you got it its something you do off the cuff you follow policy as far as you can you put it together the way it should be as best you can and then you make it work and as the thing goes all out of size and so forth and youve got the city council also in the coaudit suddenly dont blink longer than is necessary to hand them the enrollment cards go ahead and do whatever you can but dont do this dont scant technology dont fail to deliver the goods when you promise it and dont fail to turn out clears those are the only mistakes you cant make you cant make those mistakes see you can make any gods quantity of mistakes and the world will forgive you okay well i didnt mean to preachify at the end but this is the first word ive given you on world clearing and its quite important in actual fact and i think you particularly that are gathered here this evening will find it quite exciting thank you very much
