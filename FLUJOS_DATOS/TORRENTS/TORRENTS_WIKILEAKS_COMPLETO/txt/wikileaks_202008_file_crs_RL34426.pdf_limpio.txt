approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms tcm and case management are optional services that states may elect to cover but which must be approved by cms through state plan amendment spas 2

to state medicaid and child welfare directors although the state medicaid director letter smdl addresses tcm claiming for children in foster care it is often cited as guidance for states on how to claim tcm expenditures under medicaid more generally9 the smdl reiterated statutory language that broadly defined tcm and left states substantial flexibility on whether to cover and how to structure tcm services in addition the 2001 smdl described examples that would be considered appropriate claiming of tcm expenditures subsequently in the early years of the bush administration states received indirect guidance on tcm expenditure claiming from gao and health and human services office of inspector general hhsoig reports that were critical of state and cms practices on tcm 10 as well

marylands spa for foster care tcm13 provided states additional unofficial info rmation but as found by gao contributed to ambiguity on tcm because other states were allowed to continue similar practices14 for example gao reviewed sample of massac husetts and georgia tcm claims and found number of claims where tcm services billed to medicaid were integral parts of other programs such as foster care15 nevertheless tcm expenditures continued to increase raising questions about whether some states were delivering direct medical and social services to beneficiaries through other social services programs eg child welfare foster care juvenile justice special education and classifying those expenditures as medicaid tcm subsequent hhsoig audits found state practices for tcm claiming inconsistent with current cms policy federal or state laws andor medicaid rules16 moreover bush administration officials testified that state practices for claiming tcm and other medicaid services were abusive and violated the federal state medicaid partnership by inappropriately shifting costs for other federal programs to medicaid and claiming services directly delivered by other federal programs as tcm17 in 2005 congress passed dra which contained section 6052 reforms of the case management and targeted case management sec 6052 refined the case management definition by adding new language that narrowed what serv ices could be considered case management the dra case management provision identified case management services such as assessment development of care plans referral and related activities and monitoring and follow up of beneficiaries and elaborated on the overall content of these services the dra also reiterated that case management including tcm excluded the direct delivery of underlying medical educational social and other services the dra also specifically explained that federal matching payments would not be permitted to assist noneligible individuals including those individuals ineligible for tcm target group the dra also reiterated that medicaid thirdparty rules 12 medicaid states efforts to maximize federal reimbursements highlight need for

final rule elaborates on changes to the tcm definition authorized and initiated in dra by providing specific guidance on how states may claim federal financial participation ffp for tcm expenditures it also directly addresses case management issues that previously might have been considered open to interpretation cms stipulated that the case management interim final rule applies to all medicaid authorities so that all case management including tcm and services delivered through waivers would be covered under the rule 18 cms estimated that the case management regulation will reduce federal medicaid expenditures by approximately 128 billion between fy2008 and fy2012 cms also estimated that federal foster care expenditures would increase by 369 million between fy2008fy2012 some of the

management provided to individuals who reside in community settings or who want to transition from institutions to community settings in general states may not receive ffp for beneficiaries residing in inpatient acute care facilities although there is an exception for individuals with complex or chronic medical needs as defined by states the interim final rule permits states to receive ffp to assist individuals who are able to transition from an institution to community setting this provision would enable states to claim ffp to assist individuals in transitioning to community settings during either the last 14 days for beneficiaries institutionalized for shortterm stays or the last 60 days for beneficiaries who were institutionalized for longterm stays however for states to receive ffp for beneficiaries transitioning to the community the beneficiary must receive the tcm services for terms that span their inpatient and community placement in addition under the new regulations ffp would be payable only after the date on which beneficiaries community residence begins states may use tcm to help coordinate other services such as housing and transportation for individuals

medicaid will and will not pay for case management services cms further claims the proposed rule will reduce past confusion about the overlap between medicaid tcm and nonmedicaid programs moreover cms cites gao studies oig audits and review of spas that document past abuses of medicaid tcm claiming advocates for children and adult medicaid beneficiaries who receive tcm services contend that the rule is more restrictive than what congress intended in dra23 advocates also fear that reduced federal medicaid funding for tcm will need to come from other programs or services that do not have funding resulting in cuts to tcm services states cite administrative complexities of the rule that will increase state costs while decreasing provider participation and beneficiaries quality of care further states and advocates also believe that the complexity of the rule will make it difficult for states to implement within the specified time frame child welfare advocates and organizations representing mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals many of whom need medicaid tcm believe that the interim final rule will cut tcm services for these beneficiaries child welfare advocates argue that by requiring medicaid to reimburse providers based on 15minute billing segments costs of care would increase and provider participation would decrease they also argue that new requirements for record keeping and claims processing will discourage provider participation and reduce actual beneficiary services advocates claim that states already cannot afford to fund enough tcm services and that with more restrictions states will be forced to cut services further according to advocates with less tcm available children receiving foster care and protective services will get fewer health care services causing their existing medical and related conditions to deteriorate moreover they argue without tcm these beneficiaries will ultimately require more costly health care treatment in the future 24 some medicaid and other state officials believe that the cms case management rule will increase costs by creating additional administrative activities25 for example medicaid agencies have raised objections to the additional reporting requirements and other administrative complexities contained in the interim final rule because they believe these rules will make it harder for them to provide tcm to beneficiaries medicaid agencies claim that new delayed billing requirements for providers who assist tcm beneficiaries in transitioning from institutions are burdensome and may reduce patient access to tcm services 26 as noted earlier the interim final rule proposes to permit states up to two years to comply with the oneprovider provision for case management the additional time for states to comply suggests that cms recognizes the complexity for states to adapt their systems and administratively comply with the proposed rules in the same vein state medicaid
