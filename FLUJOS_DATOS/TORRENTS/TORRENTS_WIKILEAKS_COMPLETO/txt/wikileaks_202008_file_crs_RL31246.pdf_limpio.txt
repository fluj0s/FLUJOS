president supervising the department of justice and federal prosecutors control the investigation and possible prosecution of allegations of criminal wrongdoing by themselves or by other highlevel officials in their own administration7 the five year sunset requirement for the independent counsel law had been an original provision in law enacted in 1978 and thus required periodic reauthorization and in practical sense periodic review of the operation of the law after being amended and reauthorized in 19838 and then again amended and reauthorized in december of 19879 the independent counsel provisions were not reauthorized in the 102nd congress and were allowed to expire on december 15 1992 during the previous five years there had been intensifying criticism of the independent counsel

request the appointment of an independent counsel by court named on her own authority special counsel or regulatory independent counsel robert fiske with authority and powers nearly identical to those of statutory independent counsels to investigate and potentially to prosecute any wrongdoing involved in the whitewater and related matters10 in large part because of the whitewater controversy congress eventually reauthorized an amended version of the independent counsel law in 1994 in the 103rd congress11 under an increasing political and public policy attack the law as structured was found to be constitutionally permissible in an 8 1 decision by the supreme court in 1988 in morrison v olson 487 us 654 1988 and after controversial investigations which had now affected

attorneys general of the united states have on several occasions in the past exercised their own general discretion and authority to directly name and appoint special counsels or special prosecutors

laroro16 these special counsels were appointed at time when the independent counsel statute was in force and had been criticized by some as an attempt by the attorney general who had expressed philosophical opposition to the independent counsel statute to avoid the appointment of an independent counsel by the threejudge panel17 these special counsels were intended to conduct only what would be considered preliminary reviews of the matters and reported to the attorney general without conducting any prosecutions of their own other special appointments have included the socalled backup

withholding or suppressing evidence19 regulations of the department of justice for special counsels when the independent counsel law expired after june 30 1999 the attorney general promulgated specific regulations concerning the appointment of outside temporary counsels in certain circumstances20 such personnel appointed by the attorney general from outside of the department of justice to conduct investigations and possible prosecutions of certain sensitive matters or matters which may raise conflict of interest for justice department personnel are to be called special counsels although temporary outside personnel to investigate andor prosecute for the united states under these circumstances have also in the past been called regulatory independent counsels given their more limited independence from the attorney general and the department of justice than the independent counsels under the former statute it seems appropriate that such personnel are called special counsels since their designation as independent counsels might be considered somewhat of misnomerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31246crs5 21the regulations issued for the watergate special prosecutor first by attorney general eliot richardson and then by acting attorney general robert bork both provided that the watergate special prosecutor would have the greatest degree of independence consiste nt with

and to what extent he will inform or consult with the attorney general about the conduct of his continuedthe most significant departures in the regulations from the former statutory independent counsel schemes are that 1 the attorney general and not an independent body such as the threejudge panel actually names the person who is to be the special counsel 2 the attorney general and not an outside panel establishes and defines the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the special counsel 3 the general jurisdiction of the special counsel is limited to the specific matter referred to him or her and not also related matters as under the statute as well as collateral offenses arising out of the investigation which interfere with the investigation 4 the special counsel is subject to all the notification and review and approval provisions within the internal department of justice procedures policies and practices but may circumvent certain review and approval procedures by consulting directly with the attorney general 5 the attorney general must be notified concerning significant actions that the special counsel is to take and may countermand any proposed action by the special counsel 6 appeals of cases by the special counsel must be approved by the solicitor general of the united states presidential political appointee and 7 while the statute provided only that independent counsel may be removed by the attorney general for good cause physical or mental disability the department of justice regulations provide specifically that special counsel may be removed by the attorney general for misconduct dereliction of duty incapacity conflict of interest or for other good cause including violation of department policies potentially the most significant change or difference in the regulations is the overall degree of ultimate control and authority that the attorney general is to exercise over special counsel investigationprosecution in comparison with the statutory independent counsel procedures and former regulations such as those authorizing the watergate special prosecutors under the former independent counsel statute as well as under previous regulations authorizing the watergate special prosecutors the independent counsels or special prosecutors were intended to exercise very high degree of independent authority and ultimate control in the decision making process concerning their investigations indictments prosecutions and strategies including for example which documents andor other evidentiary materials to seek from targets individuals or government agencies or offices and which asserted privileges such as executive privilege to challenge21 the special prosecutors expressly and the independent counsels as explained in the legislative history of the law also controlled whether and to what extent they would inform report to or consult with the attorney general22 under the new regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31246crs6 22continued duties and responsibilities 38 fed reg 14688 june 4 1973 and 38 fed reg 30739 november 7 1973 the independent counsel statute provided that the independent counsel was to comply with justice department procedures except where such procedures were inconsistent with the purposes of the law such as when they would compromise his or her independence by requiring notification and approval of prosecutorial strategy by justice department officials or the attorney general see 28 usc 594f1 see s rpt 103101 103rd cong 1st sess 32 1993 hr

allocating the power of prosecutorial discretion 49 mercer law review 427 431432 1998 at the very least there is public perception that an attorney general who is beholden to the president cannot objectively evaluate the conduct of other high ranking officials beyond mere perceptions there is concern that the attorney general would convert the presumption of innocence into an almost irrebuttable presumption note also walsh lawrence the need for renewal of the independent counsel act 86 georgetown law journal 2379 238182 july 1998however as expressly explained in the background information promulgated by the department of justice the attorney general rather than the special counsel will have the ultimate responsibility for any matter referred to the special counsel the special counsel would be free to structure the investigation as he or she wishes and to exercise independent prosecutorial discretion to decide whether charges should be brought within the context of the established procedures of the department nevertheless it is intended that ultimate responsi bility for the matter and how it is handled will continue to rest with the attorney general or acting attorney general if the attorney general is personally recused in the matter thus the regulations explicitly acknowledge the possibility of review of specific decisions reached by the special counsel23 comparing the new regulations to both the former independent counsel statute and to the regulations which were issued for the watergate special prosecutor it is apparent that there is major shift of discretion and ultimate authority back to the attorney general even in investigations and prosecutions which could be directed at the president vice president or highranking colleagues of the attorney general in the presidents administration thus the tradeoff in providing greater accountability of special counsel to the regular appointed federal officials in the justice department and particularly to the attorney general may arguably be that the underlying problems conflicts of interest and loyalty issues would not necessarily be resolved in the situations which gave rise to the independent counsel law in the first place that is where there are inherent issues of fairness and appearances of even handed application of the federal law when the attorney general presidential appointee confidant and member of the presidents cabinet is making the ultimate decisions concerning law enforcement activities and investigations directed at the president and members of his administration24 as argued by some commentators in the debate concerning whether to reauthorize the independent counsel law giving the attorney general more discretion seems only to enhance the

the type of situation which engendered some severe criticism from several members of congress and the media of the attorney general for her failure to ask for the appointment of courtappointed independent counsel in the allegations of campaign finance irregularities of the democratic party and the fundraising activities of the president and vice president during the 1996 election26 analysis of the provisions of the regulations appointing special counsel grounds and alternatives the department of justice regulation s regarding an appointment of special counsel apply to matters which may raise conflict of interest for the department of justice to investigate or prosecute or generally to person when such conflicts may arise or in other extraordina ry circumstances when in the opinion of the attorney general it is in the public interest to appoint such counsel 28 cfr 6001 the statute on the other hand triggered automatically and applied to expressly designated officials in the government regardless of any finding of actual or apparent conflict of interest where an inherent conflict for the justice department to conduct the matter was presupposed27 while the statute spoke in mandatory language the attorney general shall apply to the division of the court for the appointment of an independent counsel if 28 usc 592c1 in investigating allegations brought to the attention of the attorney general under the new regulations the attorney general has several options including the naming of special counsel directing an initial investigation or keeping the matter within the justice department 28 cfr 6002 during an initial investigation under the regulations there are limitations on the attorney generals investigative authority as there had been under statute which had barred for example the granting of immunity the issuing of subpoenas plea bargaining or the convening of grand juries28 furthermore there is specific time limitation on the attorney generals review and initial investigation of the matter in the regulations as compared to the time limitations in the independent counselhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31246crs8 29 the independent counsel statute provided that such counsel should be sought where there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted 28 usc 592c however under the statute if the attorney general conducted preliminary investigation and did not apply for an independent counsel the attorney general had to notify the special threejudge panel that there were reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted 28 usc 592b1 this provision and standard had been criticized by legal commentators as unfair because it required the attorney general and the subject to prove negative 30see also 28 cfr 6007a and 6007dstatute on initial reviews 30 days and preliminary investigations 90 days with possible onetime extension of 60days the criteria for determination of whether to appoint special counsel under the regulation that is that criminal investigation of person or matter is warranted is somewhat comparable to the former statute29 however under the new regulations the attorney general is not as limited in making determinations of state of mind and criminal intent of the subject in dismissing matter during the attorney generals preliminary reviews and investigation as was the attorney general under the statutory provisions 28 usc 592a2bi and ii the involvement and the discretion of the attorney general at the early stages of matter under the department of justice special counsel regulations are thus significantly broader in comparison to the statutory independent counsel provisions when special counsel is appointed under the regulations the attorney general is to notify the chairman and ranking minority member of the house and senate judiciary committees 28 cfr 6009a1 qualifications of the special counsel the former statute provided that the person to be chosen as an independent counsel had to be one who possessed the appropriate experience and who would conduct the investigation in prompt responsible and costeffective manner 28 usc 593b2 the new regulations provide that person chosen as special counsel shall be lawyer with reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking 28 cfr 6003a this appears to respond somewhat to criticisms of the former statute that politically active partisans were not disqualified and had been chosen by the special court at times to be independent counsel the regulations also expressly provide that the person chosen to be special counsel will be someone to assure that prosecutorial decisions will be supported by an informed understanding of the criminal law and department of justice policies id justice department policies thus appear to be intended to play more significant and mandatory role in prosecutorial decisionmaking under the regulations than in the statute30 the regulations also indicate that the job of special counsel will be the principal employment of those persons during their tenure as the responsibilities of the office are to be the first precedence in their professional lives noting that these duties may require full time attention 28 cfr 6003a this appears to be directed at the criticism that some had concerning independent counsel kenneth starrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31246crs9 31see discussion of this issue in gormley ken an original model of the independent counsels statute 97 michigan law review 671673 december 1998 32see for

the former independent counsel statute concerned the vague and thus potentially broad jurisdictional grant of authority to independent counsels such independent counsels could investigate the matter that was the original subject of the referral from the attorney general to the special threejudge panel as well as matters related to that subject matter and collateral offenses that may arise out of the original investigation 28 usc 593b3 this allowed the independent counsels to pursue matters that some including the department of justice argued went far afield of the actual subject matter underlying the independent counsels original grant of jurisdiction32 the new regulations however provide more narrowly and precisely defined jurisdiction the department of justice regulations provide that in establishing the jurisdiction for the special counsel the attorney general will provide specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated and that the jurisdiction will include also the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of and with the intent to interfere with the special counsels investigation 28 cfr 6004a if there are additional matters that the special counsel wishes to pursue in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned or if the counsel wishes to investigate new matters the special counsel must consult with the attorney general who will then decide whether to include the additional matters within the special counsels jurisdiction or whether to assign them elsewhere 28 cfr 6004b the justice department regulations explain that for example if the special counsel wishes to pursue otherwise unrelated allegations concerning witness that may be necessary to obtain cooperation then the special counsel would report the matter to the attorney general and the attorney general would then decide whether to grant the special counsel jurisdiction over the matter33 staff it appears from the regulations that the normal and expected way special counsel is to staff his or her office and investigation is through detail of available personnel in the department of justice including the fbi the special counsel may specifically request certain people for detail the regulations provide that if necessary the special counsel may request that additional personnel be hired or assigned from outside the department 28 cfr 6005 emphasis addedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31246crs10 powers and authority similar to former independent counsel legislation and past regulations the special counsel appointed by the attorney general will exercise the same power and authority of any united states attorney subject to the limitations of the regulations 28 cfr 6006 accountability review and approval by justice departm ent or attorney general of proposed actions under the regulations issued by the department of justice there are four types of what could be generally considered oversight or supervision of the special counsel by either officials in the department of justice or by the attorney general personally while it is not anticipated under the regulations that there will be dayto day supervision of the attorney general or any other departmental official the regulations provide 1 that the special counsel is subject to the department of justices review and approval procedure prior to taking certain investigatory or prosecutoria l steps which may require consultation and approval from either department officials or in extraordinary circumstances the special counsel may bypass department officials and go directly to the attorney general for consultation 28 cfr 6007a 2 that the attorney general may review any investigatory or prosecutory decisions of the special counsel and may countermand such decisions that are so inappropriate or unwarranted under departmental guidelines 28 cfr 6007b 3 that the special counsel is required to notify the attorney general of significant events in the course of his or her investigation in conformance with the guidelines concerning urgent reports 28 cfr 6008b and 4 that the special counsel must submit to the attorney general for approval budget within 60 days of taking office and then annually must submit status report and new request for budget at which time the attorney general shall determine whether the investigation should continue 28 cfr 6008a review and approval the regulations provide expressly that the special counsel must comply with the rules regulations procedures practices and policies of the department of justice 28 cfr 6007a emphasis added failure to follow department of justice policy is specific ground for removal of the special counsel by the attorney general 28 cfr 6007d the most significant impact of the departmental procedures practices and policies upon the independence of special counsel might arguably be the procedure practice or policy of what the justice department has called review and approval procedures these would require the special counsel to seek variety of levels of review concerning sensitive legal and policy issues arising in the counsels investigations and prosecutions the department of justice has explained the reasons for requiring review and approvalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31246crs11 3464 fed reg 37039 1999 emphasis added 35there are often sound institutional reasons for review and approval provisions that transcend the merits of any particular case 64 fed reg 37039 1999 36united states attorneys manual september 1997review and approval procedu res are the way in which the department typically addresses the most sensitive legal and policy issues facing its prosecutors such matters are usually not dealt with by mandatory substantive rules rather the department recognizes that even the most controversial and risky investigative and prosecutorial steps might in extraordinary circumstances be justified therefore such issues are generally handled by requiring variety of levels of review and approval before the step can be taken were special counsels to be exempt from these procedural requirements they would be left without relevant controls and without departmental guidance in the most sensitive situations34 such review and approval procedures would appear to ensure that the department of justices institutional interests are furthered and applied in matters which are politically or legally sensitive the department of justice has expressly noted for example that the decision to appeal case must be reviewed and approved by the solicitor general and that the longterm interests of the department in case law development might take precedence over short term interest in vigorously pursuing legal matter by the special counsel35 the wide range of matters that are subject to review and approval procedures are set out in prior approvals chart in the united states attorneys manual usam at section 9240036 many of the subjects of required prior approval would most likely be of little relevance to the type of investigations that special counsel would undertake however there are other subjects and actions concerning investigations and prosecutions

the views of the special counsel in such matter should be given substantial deference but the ultimate decision is with the attorney general if the attorney general prevents an action by the special counsel the attorney general is to notify the chairman and ranking minority member of the house and senate judiciary committees and to provide an explanation for such countermand upon the conclusion of the special counsels investigation37 notification of significant events the special counsel is expressly required by the regulations to notify the attorney general of events in the course of his or her investigation in conformity with the departmental guidelines with respect to urgent reports 28 cfr 6008b under current departmental guidelines as explained in the united states attorneys manual the urgent report procedure is used to communicate major developments in new or pending important cases38 the types of events which would trigger an urgent report are those that are politically sensitive have high likelihood of media or congressional interest or of interest to the president including investigations of public figures allegations of improper conduct by department of justice or other high level public figures questions which present serious challenge to presidential authority the bringing of public figures before grand jury or for trial39 that is similar types of allegations and events that might precisely be involved in and be the reason for special counsel investigation and which have resulted in independent counsel or special prosecutor investigations in the past given that much of what special counsel may be involved with would appear to trigger such notification to the attorney general what is the impact of such required notification while the section on significant events does not expressly provide that the attorney general is to do anything other than to be notified the attorney general under an earlier section as noted above has been expressly given the authority to order that any particular investigatory or prosecutorial step by the special counsel not be taken40 clearly the department regulations perceive pre clearance of major and controversial investigative and prosecutorial steps and legal strategies by the special counsel with the attorney general the department explanation of the significant event notification

attorney general in certain circumstances those circumstances are defined using the same standard as that governing united states attorneys who are required to notify the attorney general or other department officials before seeking an indictment in sensitive cases and at other significant investigative steps special counsel will be dealing with issues that are sensitive with many possible repercussions and experience has shown that such prosecutions are often as sensitive legally as they are politically given this sensitivity notification of proposed indictments and other significant events in the course of the investigation with the resulting opportunity for consultation is critical part of the mechanism through which the attorney general can discharge his or her respons ibilities with respect to the investigation41 the regulatory standard for the attorney general to countermand special counsels anticipat ed prosecutorial or investigative move however indicates that such decision not be arbitrary or capricious but rather must be grounded upon established departmental practices and finding by the attorney general that the special counsels anticipated action is not only outside of or contrary to such practice but that it derogates such policies to such an extent that it is so inappropriate or unwarranted that it should not be pursued42 as noted above if the attorney general does conclude that proposed action should not be taken by the special counsel the attorney general is to notify upon the conclusion of the special counsels investigation the chairman and ranking minority member of the house and senate judiciary committees and to provide an explanation for such countermand43 discipline and removal the special counsel will be subject to internal discipline for misconduct and ethical breaches to the same extent as any other employee of the department of justice 28 cfr 6007c however the special counsel may be disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the attorney general 28 cfr 6007d the independent counsel law provided only that independent counsel could be removed by the attorney general for good cause physical or mental disability 28 usc 596a while the department of justice regulations provide specifically that special counsel may be removed by the attorney general for misconduct dereliction of duty incapacity conflict of interest or for other good cause including violation of department policies 28 cfr 6007d the explanation of the justice department further expanded on these standards and noted that willful violation of some policies and series of negligent or careless overlooking of important policies might warrant removal or other disciplinary action44 if special counsel is removed the attorney general is to notify the chairman and ranking minority member of the house and senate judiciary committees and to provide an explanation for such action 28 cfr

the prosecu tions or the counsels decisions not to prosecute 28 cfr 6008c under the independent counsel statute there had been substantial criticism of certain independent counsels final reports which were made public by the threejudge panel in that such reports provided the prosecutor independent counsel with an unfair opportunity to publicly castigate and to level criticisms and judgments against the targets of his or her investigation even if the independent counsel was unable or unwilling to indict such persons at the conclusion of the investigation of special counsel the attorney general will notify the chairman and ranking minority member of the house and senate judiciary committees 28 cfr 6009a it is anticipated in the regulations that such reports to congress will be brief notifications with an outline of the actions and the reasons for them45 included in the notification will be description and explanation of any proposed actions by the special counsel that the attorney general determined should not be pursued the attorney general may determine that such reports should be released to the public in conformance with departmental guidelines
