prior to abortion act in november 2004 the us court of appeals for the first circuit invalidated the act because it does not include an explicit exception that would waive the measures requirements to

northern new england the us supreme court will consider whether the new hampshire parental notification prior to abortion act the act may be upheld despite its lack of an explicit exception that would waive the acts requirements to preserve the health of preg nant minor in past abortion cases the court has discussed requiring such an exception in measures that regulate abortion at the pre and postviability stages of pregnancy in november 2004 the us court of appeals for the first circuit concluded that the act is unconstitutional because it does not include health exception the case was argued befo re the us supreme court on november 30 2005 and decision is expected in 2006 under the act abortion shall be perf ormed upon an unemancipated minor or female for whom guardian or conservator has been appointed until at least 48 hours after written notice has been delivered to one parent of the minor1 while the act includes several exceptions to the notification require ment including judicial bypass procedure and waiver of the requirement if the attending abortion provider certifies that the abortion is necessary to prevent the minors death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice the socalled death ex ception it does not include an explicit waiver that would allow an abortion to be pe rformed to protect the health of the minorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22342crs2 2 for additional discussion of planned parenthood of southeaste rn pennsylvania v casey and other abortion decisions see crs issue brief ib95095 abortion

fsupp2d at 66ayotte the attorney general of new hampshir contends that the acts judicial bypass procedure and other state statutes sufficiently preserve the health of the minor however planned parenthood of northern new engla nd and the other respondents maintain that the act must have health exception ayotte also argues that the first circuit failed to apply the correct standard of review when it heard the case in 2004 the respondent s brought facial challenge to the act unlike an as applied challenge which cons iders the effect of measure as applied to particular individual facial challenge attempts to invalidate measure before it takes effect rather than apply more rigorous standard that was first articulated by the court in 1987 case the first circuit applied th undue burden standard recognized by the court in planned parenthood of southeaste rn pennsylvania v casey 2 the courts decision in ayotte is expected to clarify which st andard should be used in facial challenges to abortion measures health exception the need for health exception in abor tion regulations was first discussed in roe v wade with regard to the states interest in protecting fetal life after viability the court indicated that state may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother3 in stenberg v carhart 2000 case involving the socalled partialbirt h abortion procedure the court appeared to extend the health exception requirement to previability abortion regulation since the law requires health exception in order to validate even postviability abortion regulation it at minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation4 the respondents first challe nged the act shortly after its passage in june 2003 in december 2003 federal district court in new hampshire concluded that the act is unconstitutional because it lacks health ex ception and because its socalled death exception is too narrow the court noted that on its face the act does not comply with the constitutional requirement that laws re stricting womans access to abortion must provide health exception5 the court found that other new hampshire statutes do not provide an alternative health exception that could render the act constitutional in addition the court maintained that the acts judicial bypass procedure does not save the act from the lack of constituti onally required health exception6 on appeal the attorney general defended the act and its lack of health exception on four grounds first the attorney general ar gued that parental tification statutes do not require health exception because of the interests that are protected by these statuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22342crs3 7 planned parenthood of northe rn new england v heed 390 f3d 53 60 1st cir 2004that is while health exception is necessary for statute that prohibits particular method of abortion it is not needed in pare ntal notification statut that protects minors from undertaking the risks of abortion without the advice and support of parent the first circuit disagreed with the attorney general maintaining that the interests served by statute do not have an impact on the need for health exception regardless of the interests served by new mpshires parental notice statute it does not escape the constitutions requirement of health exception7 the attorney generals s econd argument focused on hodgson v minnesota 1990 case in which the court upheld minnesotas parental notification statute despite the absence of health exception the attorney general contended that the courts decision should be controlled by hodgson however the first circuit noted that the lack of health exception was not raised as reason to invalidate the statute at issue in hodgson moreover the first circuit reasoned that even if the court had considered the absence of health exception in hodgson the courts subsequent decisions in casey and stenberg would now require health excepti on in the new hampshire statute the attorney generals remaining arguments were similar to those made before the district court acknowledging that the act contains explicit health exception the attorney general argued that other pr ovisions of new hampshire law provide functional equivalent the attorney general identified va rious statutes that preclude civil and criminal liability for health prof essionals who provide care under certain circumstances for ex ample under one statute physi cian would be shielded from criminal liability if he provides emergency medical care when one competent to consent to such care is available similarly another statute would preclude civil liability for health professionals who render em ergency medical care without consent the first circuit concluded that the proffe red statutes would not preclude all civil and criminal liability for medical personnel w ho violate the acts notice requirements to preserve minors health while the st atutes would protect medical personnel who provide treatment without consent they w ould not necessarily protect such individuals when treatment is provided to consenting minor without the pare ntal notice required by the act moreover the first circuit indicat ed that the clear and unambiguous language of the act identifies only three exceptions to the parental notice requirement when abortion is necessary to prevent the minors death when parent certifies in writing that he or she has been notified nd when court grants judici bypass the first circuit reasoned that it would be contrary to basic canons of statutory c onstruction to construe other statutory provisions like those identified by the attorney general as superceding the clear intent of the act and allowing ot her opportunities to avoid the notice requirement finally the attorney general argued that the acts judicial bypass procedure preserves minors health by allowing for the prompt authorizati on of healthrelated abortion without notice the acts judici bypass procedure provides for the prompt consideration of cases involving minors who do not want parent to be notified under the act minor is afforded 24hour 7day acce ss to the courts and court must rule on minors petition within seven calendar days from the time petition is filed if decision is appealed ruling must be issued within seven calendar dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22342crs4 8 heed 390 f3d at 62 9 481 us 739 745 1987 10 planned parenthood of southeaste rn pennsylvania v casey 505 us 833 895 1992the first circuit was not convinced that the judicial bypass procedure adequately protects minors health delays of up to two weeks can occur during which time minors health may be adversely affected even when the courts act as expeditiously as possible those minors who need an immediate abortion to protect their health are at risk8 the first circuit determined that the bypass procedure could not replace the constitutionally required health excep tion because of the potential delay death exception the first circuit affirmed the district courts decision with respect to the acts death exception the first circuit maintained th at the exception is too narrow and fails to safeguard physicians goodfaith medical determination concerning whether minors life is at risk because the course of dical complications ca nnot be predicted with precision physician cannot always determin whether death will occur within the 48 hour time period contemplated by the act consequently the death exception forces physician to gamble with patients lif in hopes of complying with the notice requirement or risk violating the act by providing an abortion without parental notification the first circuit believed that the threat of sa nctions that arises from such choice would have chilling effect on the willingness of physicians to perform abortions when minors life is at risk th court also found that the absence of clear standard by which to judge physicians d ecision to perform an abortion would have similar chilling effect on physicians willingness to provide lifesaving abortions standard of review the attorney general has asked the court to consider whether the first circuit applied the correct standard of review to the respondents facial challenge of the act in united states v salerno 1987 case involving facial challenge to the bail reform act the court determined that facial challenges require the challenger to establish that set of circumstances exists unde r which measure would be valid9 the salerno standard requires that measure be upheld even if it operates unconstitutionally under some circumstances application of the salerno standard however has been complicated by the courts adoption of the undue burden standard in casey in casey and stenberg the court applied the undue burden standa rd to invalidate state rest rictions on abortion among federal courts of appeals only the fi fth circuit has continued to apply the salerno standard to facial challenges to aborti on regulations the undue burden standard is believed by some to be less stringent standard because it would render an abortion regulation facially invalid if in large fraction of cases it will operate as substantial obstacle to womans choice to undergo an abortion10 while the first circuit acknowledged that the court has never explicitly addressed the tension between the salerno standard and the undue burde n standard it concluded thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22342crs5 11 ohio v

the courts application of that standard in casey and stenberg as well as the use of the standard by significant num ber of the courts of appeals the attorney general maintains that th first circuit should have applied the salerno standard when it evaluated the act the attorney general has cited ohio v akron center for reproductive health and rust v sullivan two abortion cases from 1990 and 1991 in which the court applied the salerno standard to support its position that the salerno standard is appropriate for evaluating abortion regulations11 moreover the attorney general argues that the salerno standard is consistent with the courts traditional practice of adjudicating constitutional questions only in concrete cases and controversies the respondents however insist that facial invalidation of the act is the only relief that effectively protects the health of minors they argue that minors challenging the act on an as applied basis would have to ay getting appropriate and urgently needed medical treatment until they get constitutional ruling permitting it12 the courts application of the undue burden standard in casey and stenberg would seem to suggest that it longer views the salerno standard as appropr iate for evaluating facial challenges to abortion regulations the courts refu sal to review four abortion decisions in which the undue burden standard and not the salerno standard was applied may further suggest that the court endor ses the use of the undue burden standard13 the absence of definitive statement by the court concerning the salerno standard and its application to abor tion regulations following casey has prompted considerable interest in ayotte if the court reaffirms the use of the salerno standard in abortion cases the wholesale invalidation of future abortion st atutes seems unlikely individual plaintiffs would have to challenge the constitutionality of an abortion measure as it was applied to them delays that could accompany plain tiffs case would likely raise concerns about the possibility that womans health was being compromised in addition determination by the court that an explicit health exception is not necessary because of the acts judicial bypass procedure and other new hampshire statutes would also be significant such decision would likely have an impact on the parental consent and notif ication laws that exist in fortyfour states14 it would seemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22342crs6 14 continued services at httpwwwcrlporgpub_fac_restrictionshtmlpossible that some state legislatures would amend their consent and notification requirements to remove existing health exceptions questions posed by some of the ju stices during the oral argument on ayotte seem to suggest that the court might be willing to remand the case to the first circuit to recognize health exception that would then make the act constitutional it is uncertain how the court would fashion such an exception re sponding to the justices questions counsel for the respondents indicated that allowing th first circuit to find health exception for the act would likely have the effect of encouraging states to write patently unconstitutional laws with the knowledge that reviewing court would later correct any constitutional flaws remand of the case is not guaranteed it is still possible that the court could invalidate the act because of its lack of an explicit health exception the courts decision is not expected until 2006
