extensions efforts toward longterm reauthorization of welfare reform began during the second session of the 107th congress and remain on the agenda for the 109th congress in preparation for the reauthorization debate that began in 2002 the department of health and human services hhs solicited public input on tanf during the fall of 2001 hhs conducted series of regional listening and discussion sessions and also invited the public to submit comments either through the mail or electronically through specially created website this report presents summary of the comments received by hhs more than 4000 were submitted and is intended to convey general sense of the views and opinions expressed readers should note that the persons and groups who submitted comments represented selfselected and varied group and may or may not be representative of the larger population hhs prescribed format for the comments so they were submitted in many forms and sizes some were long essays others included lengthy lists of ideas while others submitted just paragraph some commenters urged comprehensive proposals that dealt not only with tanf but with related programs and services some made comments without necessarily making recommendations for change the following general observations might be made about the content of these free form recommendations all categories of commenters wanted congress either to maintain or increase the amount of funding available for the tanf block grant there was concern that although welfare reform has succeeded in promoting work jobs have failed to end poverty for some families and have not been possible for others because of personal barriers advocates for lowincome families tended to urge substantial change in tanf many wanted to impose more mandates on states they wanted congress to require states to provide certain services to certain groups and to adopt certain procedures some proposed repeal of existing ineligibility rules on the other hand representatives of states and statecounty welfare departments generally wanted to keep maximum flexibility to design and operate tanf among commenters on work and time limit rules there was strong support for allowing more education and training to be treated as work activities and for suspending the time limit for some persons and under some circumstances child care was widely seen as

dependent children afdc program and replaced it with block grant to states for temporary assistance for needy families tanf1 this landmark legislation required that federally funded cash assistance be timelimited and conditioned on work but also gave states great flexibility in the design of their welfare programs tanf funding was authorized and appropriated only for six years and expired at the end of fy2002 however congress has continued the program and its funding at fy2002 levels through series of temporary extensions efforts to enact long term reauthorization of welfare reform began during the second session of the 107th congress and remain an agenda item for the 109th congress during the 108th congress the house and the senate finance committee each passed different versions of longterm reauthorization bill hr 4 but final action occurred2 the tanf block grant is administered at the federal level by the department of health and human services hhs during the fall of 2001 in preparation for the debate on reauthorization of tanf hhs solicited public input through two mechanisms first hhs officials conducted series of regional listening and discussion sessions to which state and local officials and welfare recipients were invited to share their views about implementing and improving tanf programs wade horn assistant secretary for children and families led these sessions in atlanta chicago dallas philadelphia new york san francisco and washington dc meeting with tribal representatives also was held in san francisco in addition in the october 17 2001 federal register hhs formally invited members of the public to submit comments through november 30 2001 either through the mail or electronically through specially created website as stated in the federal register the departments primary interest was gathering input about the tanf provisions of the 1996 welfare reform legislation however many other federal programs such as the food stamp program the child care and development fund child welfare and child support enforcement serve the same needy families as tanf and provide related benefits some of these programs are facing 1 see crs report rs20807 short history of the 1996 welfare reform law by joe richardson and vee burke 2 for comparison of current law with the house and senate finance committee versions of hr 4 108th congress see crs report rl32210 tanf reauthorization sidebyside comparison of current law and two versions of hr 4 by vee burke and gene falk crs2 reauthorization as well thus the department will also accept comments on program coordination issues precise count of unduplicated comments received by hhs or of the individuals and organizations who submitted them is not obtainable several groups led organized campaigns and generated hundreds of comments some of which were easily identifiable as part of an organized campaign while others were not the following numbers are offered to give sense of the scope of the tanf comments project through the specially created hhs website nearly 700 comments were submitted some may have been duplicates others may have been submitted on different topics by the same individual or organization almost another 4000 comments were submitted through the mail or by other means email hand delivery of these about 3000 resulted from organized campaigns for example an organization called network national catholic social justice lobby brought in more than 2000 comments other groups that organized comment campaigns included the childrens defense fund grassroots organizing for welfare leadership midwest partners influencing state policy and the welfaretowork partnership this report presents summary of the comments that were received by hhs in response to the departments request and is intended to convey general sense of the views and opinions expressed the report begins with an explanation of the methodology used for preparing this summary and discussion of the categories of groups and individuals who submitted comments followed by general overview of the comments themselves the balance of the report presents summary of the comments organized by topic only limited background information is included on the current law provisions which may be the subject of comments readers should consult other crs reports for background information on tanf law and related programs and for the status of current legislation3 methodology this report summarizes the tanf reauthorization comments by focusing on three major questions who made the comments to place the comments in some perspective it is necessary to describe who made them what were the most common comments and legislative recommendations who said what what were various types of organizations or individuals interested in were there differences in the types of concerns and recommendations made by different groups 3 readers should go to the current legislative issues section on the crs home page click on social policy and then on welfare for selected list of crs products or use the search box on the crs home page to identify the full range of crs reports on tanf and related programs and issues crs3 team of congressional research service crs analysts categorized information about the commenters and their comments and entered them into database the comments are qualitative in nature that is they are in essay form and varied widely in both style and content though the database afforded analysts structure for categorizing the comments their varied nature often required crs analysts to exercise considerable judgment categorizing the commenters those making comments were categorized into groups for example elected officials national advocacy organizations local advocacy organizations faithbased groups etc additionally comments and recommendations were received by number of organizations that are nonpartisan research organizations but which expressed point of view such as the heritage foundation and the center for budget and policy priorities these organizations were placed in their own category researchadvocacy distinction also was made if an organization was involved in delivering services to families see appendix table a2 for list of the categories used in this report additionally commenters were categorized by their geographical affiliation national organizations were identified as such and organizations at the state and local level were identified by their state the categorization of many commenters proved to be difficult some of those making comments identified themselves with an organization but it was unclear whether they were speaking for the organization with mailed comments it could reasonably be determined that those written on letterhead and signed by an official represented the organizations point of view however it was much more difficult to discern whether comments submitted through the internet represented an organizations point of view or an individuals opinion additionally comments submitted through the internet often did not contain enough information to identify commenter as belonging to particular category therefore relatively large number of commenters were classified either as general public or unknown categorizing the comments the comments themselves were also categorized crs primarily focused on legislative recommendations made by the commenters ie those statements that signaled change in policy that could be made by amending federal law however judgment was often required to determine whether comment was making legislative recommendation or expressing more general point of view about welfare policy moreover since hhs solicited comments from the public and not just legislative recommendations an attempt was made to capture the flavor of the comments in addition to their recommendations many comments included numerous legislative recommendations each recommendation was placed in the appropriate topical category that is comment from single individual or organization could have been entered into the database under several different categories see appendix table a1 for listing of the categories why there are counts of comments though each comment was tallied in the crs database this report does not provide exact numbers of specific comments or recommendations for legislative change it was determined that any attempt to quantify the comments or recommendations would pose problems some crs4 comments represented large organizations potentially reflecting the views of many people and some represented individual views there is objective way to weight such diverse commenters further large number of comments were made through organized letterwriting campaigns and again there was objective way to give weight to these comments without either skewing the results in the direction of those comments generated by letterwriting campaigns or devaluing comments made through such campaigns instead for each particular issue the report presents the scope of the recommendations made as well as the suggestions that were more or less popular among the commenters brief description of the commenters the many persons and groups who responded to the hhs call for comments represented selfselected group those who made comments were aware of the opportunity to comment from the federal register notice the hhs press release and each other furthermore for various reasons they were sufficiently interested in the future of tanf to participate in the process many of them had close experience with tanf and had come to some conclusions about how it should be changed if at all though the commenters were selfselected they did come from wide range of organizations and backgrounds some of the organizations that commented are familiar from previous debates on welfare reform and have been asked for and given testimony before congress on welfare issues however others who commented were less connected to past federal legislative debates and are active mainly at the state and local level comments on tanf reauthorization were received from elected officials comments were received from several united states senators state legislators and few governors moreover there were comments from organizations that represent elected officials among them the national governors association nga national conference of state legislators ncsl and the us conference of mayors state and local human resource agencies and service delivery practitioners the american public human services association aphsa and numerous state human resource agencies submitted comments and legislative recommendations these public agencies administer or supervise the administration of tanf at the state level and aphsa is their national advocacy organization in addition there were comments from local human services agencies as well as numerous comments from community service organizations including child care referral agencies comments were also received from the national council of child support directors the national association of social workers and the national association of black social workers national advocacy organizations comments came from national advocacy organizations representing particular constituencies or views comments were received from groups such as the childrens defense fund cdf planned parenthood federation of america the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp national organization for crs5 women now legal defense and education fund national urban league childrens rights council the american bar association and others state and local advocacy organizations relatively large share of comments came from private state and local advocacy organizations unlike many of the national advocacy organizations which commented on welfare reauthorization while expressing views on wide range of issues state and local advocacy organizations often were more narrowly focused for example there were several comments from organizations concerned about protection treatment and services for victims of domestic violence there were also organizations that appeared to focus on tanf reauthorization as their single issue for example washingtons tanf reauthorization campaign the utah reauthorization project few indian tribes made comments faithbased organizations comments were made by both national and local faithbased advocacy and service groups national faithbased groups that made comments included the us conference of catholic bishops evangelical lutheran church in america united jewish communities catholic charities usa and the national catholic social justice lobby number of comments came from local chapters of catholic charities and local dioceses research organizations comments were received from number of research organizations that tend also to make policy recommendations such organizations included the center on budget and policy priorities cbpp center on law and social policy clasp the heritage foundation and the progressive policy institute additionally comments were received from professors at universities and students of social work the general public some commenters did not identify themselves as members of any organization some of these comments were likely made by members of the general public few identified themselves as being former recipients fairly large number of comments did not have enough information to identify the commenter with particular organization though the comment might reflect the view of an organization or may have been part of letterwriting campaign overview of comments comments on tanf reauthorization reached hhs in many forms and sizes format was prescribed list of subjects for comment was given some persons submitted long essay responses summing up their appraisal of tanf achievements and failings some gave long lists of ideas for change some just paragraph some urged comprehensive proposals that dealt not only with tanf but with related programs and services it can be assumed that most wrote about what concerned them most reading this outpouring of freeform suggestions about the next round of welfare reform gives this general picture crs6 all categories of commenters wanted congress either to maintain or increase the amount of funding available for the tanf block grant there was concern that although welfare reform has succeeded in promoting work jobs have failed to end poverty for some families and have not been possible for others because of personal barriers advocates for lowincome families tended to urge substantial change in tanf many wanted to impose more mandates on states they wanted congress to require states to provide certain services to certain groups and to adopt certain procedures some proposed repeal of some existing ineligibility rules on the other hand representatives of states and statecounty welfare departments generally wanted to keep maximum flexibility to design and operate tanf among commenters on work and time limit rules there was strong support for allowing more education and training to be treated as work activities and for suspending the time limit for some persons and under some circumstances child care was widely seen as necessary work support and child support as needed source of family income summary of comments on tanf goals and philosophy basic philosophy and program goals attracted very large block of comments on tanf outnumbered only by comments on funding and the time limit majority of the philosophic commenters urged that poverty reduction be added as program goal or purpose typical remark was that tanf should strive to reduce poverty not caseloads support for making poverty reduction an explicit program goal came from advocacy organizations faithbased groups research groups some elected officials state legislators us senators human service agencies community service organizations students of social work and members of the general public including two former welfare recipients few commenters said there should be federal obligation to serve families in need and several said tanfs overall purpose should be expressed as promoting the wellbeing of children and families the next most common goal recommendation closely allied to the existing statutory goal of ending dependence on government benefits proposed self sufficiency as key tanf objective noting research findings that many extanf recipients have joined the working poor these groups often urged income supports and better jobs for them along with education and training to enhance their earning capacity some states expressed because of welfare i was able to work part time views about the objectives of and raise my daughter in healthy happy and safe environment our home please make welfare tanf one said it found work to ensure lowincome families can work their reasonable the existing way out of poverty statutory statement of purpose former welfare mother crs7 to increase state flexibility in operating programs designed to achieve 1 support of needy children in their own homes 2 an end to dependence on government benefits 3 reduction or prevention of outofwedlock pregnancies and 4 promotion of the formation and maintenance of twoparent families one said tanf should maintain core elements including entitlement and continued focus on work another state said it would be serious mistake to take the focus off work and training remarks about the current family formation goals welfare reform has begun to improve the old numbers 3 and 4 above welfare system by promoting work and disclosed disagreement most responsibility these first few years of commenters favored efforts to implementation however have demonstrated that reduce unwed pregnancy there is much more that needs to be done to help especially among teenagers lowincome families achieve selfsufficiency state welfare agency but many opposed the current abstinenceonly education programs aimed at that goal instead favoring more comprehensive education on reproduction and birth control many commenters urged that government be neutral regarding marriage sample comments give their flavor government should not legislate morals or favor married couples the shift to promoting marriage is dangerous marriage is highly personal matter common view was summed up by county welfare directors permit but dont mandate marriage promotion on the other hand few respondents urged that portion of tanf funds be set aside for marriage promotion funding the most common recommendations concerned tanf funding in terms of sheer numbers more comments advocating either maintaining or increasing funding were made than were made for any other legislative recommendation moreover recommendations not to cut funding or to increase tanf funds were made by all categories of commenters additionally there were large number of comments that advocated retaining or even expanding state flexibility in the use of grants retaining state flexibility was major concern of organizations representing state interests but it was theme in other comments as well basic funding levels the 1996 welfare reform law established basic 165 billion annual block grant to states for fy1997fy2002 congress has continued the program at this funding level through series of shortterm extensions this amount was based on federal funding in the mid1990s for tanfs predecessor programs and is not adjusted for inflation or for states needs the basic 165 billion block grant lost 15 of its value over the fy1997fy2004 period in addition to federal funds tanf programs receive financial contribution from the states under maintenanceofeffort moe requirement like the basic block grant the required moe is based on historical expenditures in tanfs predecessor programs national total of 104 billion the number of families receiving cash welfare declined by almost 60 from march 1994 to september 2001 and has remained relatively constant through march 2004 but states have used their flexible tanf dollars to provide new types of services to welfare and other lowincome families crs8 large number of those even though tanf caseloads have fallen by 50 who commented called for percent it is clear that the need for tanf increasing the tanf block supported services has not declined federal data grant for inflation this was reporting of the tanf caseload reflects only the recommendation of the number of families receiving tanf cash assistance american public human in given state it does not include families that services association aphsa receive tanffunded child care employment and that was also reflected in many training counseling and other supportive non comments from state human assistance services services agencies as well as national association of state welfare agencies other organizations other national organizations that recommended adjusting the grant for inflation included the childrens defense fund the national association of social workers and the child welfare league of america several senators governor lincoln almond of rhode island the california legislature and the washington state legislature democratic caucus all called for adjusting the basic block grant for inflation others who commented suggested an unspecified increase in funding some simply argued that funding needed to be maintained they countered arguments that the grant should be cut because of the decline in the cash welfare caseload by noting the expansion of services beyond cash welfare that has occurred under tanf and the more disadvantaged caseload that remained many organizations and commenters who suggested maintaining or increasing federal tanf funding also recommended maintaining the moe requirement at least at current levels some organizations including aphsa said that if the tanf block grant were adjusted for inflation the moe requirement also should be increased few state human services agencies eg maryland followed the lead of aphsa on this point but many were silent virginia under the previous governors administration recommended that an moe based on prior law caseloads be discontinued other grants in addition to the basic block grant tanf includes contingency fund to provide additional funding during recessions supplemental grants for certain states with high population growth andor low historic federal funding per poor person and welfaretowork grant program to help localities provide employment services to certain tanf recipients and other groups including noncustodial parents these grants also were the subject of several comments although not to the degree that basic funding was discussed there was widespread sentiment that there should be tanf contingency fund to help states through recession further there was sentiment that access to the contingency fund created by the 1996 law was too restrictive the most common proposal was to reduce the amount states needed to spend before they could access the fund additional comments requested that the fund be less restrictive but did not specify changes that should be made both supplemental grants and welfaretowork grants were the subject of some comments but their constituency was relatively narrow supplemental grants are crs9 generally made to states in the south and interior west the west coast states of california oregon and washington did not receive supplemental grants most calls for renewing supplemental grants came from those states that received them or from national organizations similarly there were relatively few calls to reinstate welfare towork grants these grants were generally administered locally rather than by the states the major national organization advocating welfaretowork grant program was the us conference of mayors also supporting these grants was the national child support enforcement association generally state organizations except the iowa department of human services which recommended that they be continued and expanded were silent on whether welfaretowork grants should be renewed regarding additional tanf grants some commenters would establish new bonus for poverty reduction some would revise the existing high performance bonus that rewards states for certain outcomes and some would eliminate or alter the existing bonus for reducing outofwedlock births see additional discussion of bonus funds under state accountability section below flexibility in the use of grants under current law states may expend tanf funds in any way reasonably calculated to achieve the goals of the program states also may transfer up to 30 of the federal tanf grant to the child care and development fund and the social services block grant ssbg ssbg transfers are limited to 10 of the tanf grant this ceiling was set to decline to 425 starting in fy2001 but congress has maintained the 10 limit through annual appropriations laws states also may carry over funds without fiscal year limit but carriedover funds can only be used to provide assistance essentially ongoing cash welfare to families common theme running through the reauthorization comments was maintaining state flexibility in the use of grants however some advocacy and public commenters did suggest particular uses of tanf funds and some even advocated legislative restrictions on the use of funds by states organizations representing the states often called for continuing the authority to transfer funds with the ssbg transfer limit set at 10 rather than 425 and earmarking of funds for specified purposes the suggestion that portion of tanf funds be setaside for promotion of marriage received more negative than positive comments including from advocacy organizations and others it was common to suggest that if congress wished to emphasize particular goal or set of activities additional funds rather than setasides from current funds should be provided the states and others the four purposes of tanf along with the sometimes sought more flexibility granted to states resulted in flexibility in the use of funds remarkable transformation of welfare programs particularly asking for the with an economic downturn evident and caseloads ability to use carryover funds on the rise the last thing states need is more for any tanf activity instead prescriptive program keep the purposes and the of just cash welfare flexibility generally this was not member of the public opposed however the center further identification on budget and policy priorities commented that states should crs10 have the ability to reserve only limited amount of tanf funds 50 of the block grant and be required to spend additional grants within three years the states and advocacy groups split on the issue of supplantation ie use by states of federal tanf dollars for activities that are allowable under tanf law to achieve its broad goals but which were previously paid for with state funds large number of advocacy organizations and commenters both national and at the state and local levels recommended legislation to prohibit supplantation the states by and large opposed this effort as restriction of their flexibility in using tanf dollars there also were some general comments about the use of funds particularly advocating an increased emphasis on the use of tanf for certain activities these comments were not always phrased as legislative recommendations and sometimes suggested that tanf be used for activities that are already allowable by law or commended states for using funds for these activities for example there were comments on the expanded use of tanf funds for individual development accounts supplements to the earned income tax credit eitc economic development or job creation development of model programs and services to address the needs of families with barriers to selfsufficiency few urged that tanf grants be allowed to fund foster care and adoption some suggested that tanf funds which now cannot be used for medical services be permitted for some medical services payable under medicaid such as behavioral or mental health assessment several commenters requested that treatment for alcohol and drug abuse be exempted from the definition of medical services to facilitate use of tanf funds for them one state said that tanf should provide specific amount for intensive family development services program requirements federal law gives states flexibility in the design of their welfare programs within certain federal parameters for example the welfare law prohibits the use of federal funds to provide ongoing cash welfare to household with an adult who has received benefits for 60 months states may exempt up to 20 of their caseload from this time limit and they also may establish shorter time limits states also can use their own funds to serve recipients beyond the federal time limit states also establish their own eligibility rules however federal funds cannot be used to serve certain categories of individuals eg specified groups of noncitizens certain felons unwed parents under 20 unless they comply with certain requirements furthermore while states design their own programs federal law requires states to engage certain percentage of their caseload in work activities referred to as the work participation rules the law specifies which activities count toward this requirement and clearly emphasizes work first before education and training or other types of activities these and other program requirements were the subject of many comments some of which advocated additional federal requirements more extensive applicant screening for example in general these comments did not come from states or organizations representing states which tended to favor flexibility at the state level crs11 time limits comments showed overwhelming support for liberalization of the current law fiveyear limit on federally funded ongoing cash aid proposals included suspending the time limit for persons who comply with program requirements increasing the hardship exemption from the current 20 of caseload limit requiring or allowing states to suspend the time limit for working recipients and allowing or requiring extensions in times of high unemployment some recommended that certain caregivers be categorically exempted from the time limit some proposed to prohibit state time limits shorter than 60 months and few proposed to lengthen the federal limit eligibility rules three categorical eligibility rules received comment the ban on federally funded tanf payments for immigrants during their first five years of residence discussed in more detail in the section on noncitizens below the prohibition on tanf for persons convicted of drugrelated felony unless the state opts out by state law and the ban on tanf aid to an unwed mother under age 20 who does not live with an adult with allowance for good cause exceptions those who commented recommended repeal of all these restrictions some also recommended that states be barred from imposing family cap on benefits paying benefit or reduced amount on behalf of new baby born into tanf family existing law is silent on this issue many urged that eligibility and benefit policies not be allowed to discriminate against applicants or twoparent families many proposed that the federal government require that states pay specified minimum benefit and some proposed that states be required to base benefits on real need and to index them for inflation work rules the national governors association was among many commenters who urged that states should have greater authority to determine work activities that are countable toward federal requirements among the numerous persons who commented on tanf work activities there was overwhelming support for allowing more human capital activities education and training to be credited toward the work participation requirements and for lifting restrictions on creditable vocational educational training under current law participation in education completion of high school and vocational educational training can account for more than 30 of persons credited with work and vocational educational training is countable only for 12 months numerous persons urged that rehabilitative activities such as participation in treatment for substance abuse mental illness and domestic violence be counted as work activity many recommended that domestic duties caring for disabled or ill family member for example be treated as countable work activity further some urged that job search be countable activity for longer than six weeks rhode island and arizona said federal work participation rates should be dropped utah called them administratively burdensome and not instrumental to success virginia and new hampshire and the american public human services association said participation rates should be replaced by outcome measures of success another state suggested that partial credit should be allowed for persons working fewer hours than the weekly minimum now 30 for most families some persons urged elimination of the higher participation rate for twoparent families 90 vs 50 for all families many commenters urged that participation rates be suspended or reduced for times and areas of high unemployment some urged that crs12 the caseload reduction credit be ended or modified this credit reduces state work participation rates by one percentage point for each percent reduction from 1995 levels in the states average monthly caseload its effect in 2002 was to lower to zero the effective participation rates in 21 states few commenters sought to have congress exempt certain persons parents with child under four with child under one with multiple barriers to work from both work requirements and the calculation of participation rates one state recommended that any persons exempted by the state from work should be disregarded in calculating official participation rates assessments concerns about tanf participants with multiple barriers to employment were raised frequently by commenters including those who addressed the laws provisions regarding assessments under current law the state agency responsible for administering the tanf program is required to make an initial assessment within 90 days of determining that an individual is eligible for tanf benefits of the skills prior work experience and employability of each tanf recipient who is at least age 18 or who has not completed high school or obtained certificate of high school equivalency and is not attending secondary school on the basis of the assessment the state tanf agency has the option in consultation with the recipient to develop an individual responsibility plan for the recipient the manner in which assessments are performed varies across states for example some states simply have form for recipients to fill out others have an indepth questionnaire some have caseworkers conduct cursory interviews with recipients while others use specialized staff such as substance abuse specialist to perform interviews many respondents all states must be required to implement proposed that states be required mandatory screening and assessment for barriers to screen all applicants assess to tanf participants especially those related to their employability and mental health substance abuse and domestic and determine whether they have sexual violence barriers to employment the social work student recommendation of commenters usually mentioned national advocacy organization campaign the following as barriers to employment being victim of domestic or sexual violence mental health problems physical disabilities substance abuse problems and limited english proficiency many of the commenters also wanted to mandate that states provide the appropriate types of services to help recipients deal with their employment barriers many commenters maintained that caseworkers needed more specialized training to properly screen recipients some suggested that qualified professionals be used to screen recipients and perform assessments in general the commenters supported requiring states to do more to protect vulnerable families with multiple barriers to employment they urged that states serve and protect the most vulnerable and provide more help for those with severe work handicaps consistent with this concern many commenters wanted states to perform additional assessments before sanctioning family additional comments on this topic were mentioned by only one or two groups or individuals recommendations included establishing panels to identify appropriate strategies for dealing with persons with multiple barriers to employment providing referral information to vulnerable families if the tanf agency could not crs13 provide the needed service performing assessments on recipients annually extending the family violence option which requires screening and referral to services for victims of domestic violence to other employment barriers offering mentoring programs to vulnerable families providing extra funding to reduce language barriers including hiring staff that speak spanish etc providing family needs assessments as well as vocational assessments and extending assessment services to noncustodial parents of tanf children sanctions sanctions are financial penalties for failure to comply with work or other requirements of the state tanf programs under current law states must impose sanctions on families that refuse without good cause to participate in required work activities states also must impose sanctions on individuals who fail to cooperate without good cause with child support enforcement cse requirements and on teen parents who fail to comply with school attendance and living arrangement requirements in addition states may sanction families that are not complying with their individual responsibility plans which can include requirements that custodial parents attend school maintain certain grades and attendance ensure school attendance of their schoolaged children obtain proper immunizations for their children attend parenting and money management classes in general states have considerable flexibility in the design of their sanction policies eg size of the sanction exemptions from sanctions etc most persons commenting full family sanctions should be prohibited on sanctions urged that realizing children receive the worst impact of such congress prescribe sanctioning sanctions procedures some state advocacy organization recommended that full family sanctions in which the entire cash grant is eliminated be prohibited at least for first violation most of the commenters maintained that recipients should be assessed or screened before sanctioning occurred these commenters generally said that states should be required to review cases and to acknowledge and address severe or multiple employment barriers before families are allowed to lose tanf benefits moreover some of these commenters argued that vulnerable families with severe work barriers should not be sanctioned as long as they are participating in program or receiving service to ameliorate their barriers many respondents wanted to ensure that due process concerns eg timely notice reassessment fair and nondiscriminatory practices and opportunity for fair hearing were adequately addressed before sanctions were imposed numerous respondents supported expansion of the existing federal child care exemption for caretakers of children under age six to include older children schoolage children adolescents disabled children some also proposed that good cause for work refusal should include lack of transportation lack of quality child care and suffering from serious impairment substance abuse mental illness domestic violence or being in treatment for the impairment in contrast several commenters stated that strict sanctions such as full family sanctions are needed to ensure that families comply with program requirements one state welfare agency maintained that states should continue to have the right to design penalties as they see fit crs14 additional comments on sanctions mentioned by only one or two groups or persons included support for funding of programs to increase compliance and reduce the need for sanctions such as home visiting programs giving families more opportunities for compliance before sanction is actually imposed using protective payee approach rather than full family sanction ending sanctions immediately after family complies with program requirements and eliminating sanctions altogether treatment of special groups domestic violence victims some commenters urged that the protections for domestic violence victims under the family violence option now adopted by 44 tanf jurisdictions become mandatory and several proposed that states be required to adopt specific procedures for serving victims of domestic violence including counseling for noncustodial fathers education on domestic and sexual violence and mandatory caseworker training teen parents few persons commented on teen parent rules but of those who did most favored ending the requirement that they live under adult supervision and some favored dropping the requirement that they attend school some proposed that the federal time clock not commence until these parents reach age 20 and one law center said states should have full authority to develop programs for teen parents mothers of young children various individuals suggested exempting mothers from work requirements for time after their youngest child reached age one the current outer limit in federal law the several proposals were to lift the threshold to age one age three age four or age eight and in each case to exclude the exempted mothers from the calculation of work participation rates one person said all states should be required to adopt uniform age of youngest child at which the parent would be required to work nonparental caregivers among the persons commenting on rules and benefits for nonparental caregivers of tanf children all but one favored federal rule exempting the caregiver from the time limit most also favored exempting the caregiver from the work requirement and three said states should have the option to decide these issues under current law caregiver who receives tanffunded assistance on his or her own behalf is subject to tanfs work and time limit rules also see comments on child welfare below rural issues small subset of commenters focused mainly on rural issues few other commenters included recommendations about rural recipients within their more general comments about tanf among comments focused on rural issues there was general agreement about the difficulties faced by rural welfare recipients transportation and child care were two areas that while seen as problems for tanf recipients in general are viewed as much worse for rural tanf recipients recommendations included providing transportation assistance such as carbuying programs allowing child care to count as work activity for mothers with children up to age two and counting travel time toward work participation hours crs15 indian tribes several states with indian populations including at least one that contributed state funds to tribal programs and received tanf maintenanceof effort credit for the spending said tribal block grants should be fully federally funded two tribes advocated tribal access to bonus and contingency funds and also recommended that tanf funds and programs be better coordinated with other federal tribal workforce development programs two groups proposed that tribal employment services program be established to replace the current native employment works program one tribe said poverty level should be developed specific to tribes and one group said all participants in tribal work program should be exempt from work participation calculations five commenters advocated giving indian tribes technical assistance to support their infrastructures state accountability federal tanf law establishes program goals provides states with funding for activities to achieve these goals and has penalties and bonuses to enforce requirements and reward high performance states are required to submit to hhs plan of the program they intend to operate and report data to hhs on the characteristics work and job preparation activities of cash welfare recipients these documents and data reports provide hhs and congress with information to help monitor states progress toward achieving the goals set forth in tanf the following section discusses comments on tanf bonuses and data reporting requirements bonuses current tanf law provides for two bonuses one for reducing out ofwedlock births with reduced abortion rates and high performance bonus there was little comment on the efficacy of providing bonuses as means of encouraging states to design programs to meet federal goals rather comments generally focused on support or opposition to particular bonuses or criteria for awarding bonuses as discussed in the section on program goals and philosophy one of the most common comments was to establish reduction in poverty as tanf goal many of those who made that recommendation also suggested that poverty reduction bonus be added to tanf few state groups made this recommendation with the exception of new york which commented that any use of child poverty as measure of meeting program goals should be in positive framework such as performance bonus however recommendations for poverty reduction bonus came from the broad spectrum of those who sought to incorporate poverty reduction as goal of tanf national and state and local advocacy organizations faithbased groups community service organizations and members of the general public there were number of suggestions to abolish the current bonus for reducing outofwedlock births some suggested that these bonus funds be put to other uses for example the center on budget and policy priorities recommended replacing this bonus with fund to conduct research on policies that could enhance the wellbeing of families with children the now legal defense and education fund suggested replacing the outofwedlock birth bonus with poverty reduction bonus and the crs16 minnesota department of human services recommended moving its funding to the high performance bonus the comments on the high performance bonus generally related to specific criteria used to measure performance and award bonuses minnesotas department of human services suggested eliminating the measures that award part of the bonus based on coverage of the food stamp and medical assistance programs number of commenters suggested adding additional measures to be rewarded such as employment in jobs that pay certain wage job advancement effectiveness of services for different groups eg racial ethnic groupspeople with disabilitieslow income communities and reductions in homelessness information and data reporting sharp divisions appeared in the comments between state groups and others who addressed the subject of information available about state programs and data reporting advocacy groups typically requested more information and more data states generally opposed adding to existing data reporting requirements and some suggested reducing existing requirements among the state human services agencies that commented additional reporting requirements were unanimously and adamantly opposed there were calls to streamline and simplify existing reporting requirements concerns about the impact of any additional reporting requirements on state computer systems eg changes to large computer systems necessary to comply with requirements and desire that reporting also be separately financed was voiced in the comments other commenters particularly advocacy organizations requested more information about state programs for example some commenters proposed that state tanf plans be required to include new provisions suggested as mandated plan provisions were procedures for civil rights complaints description of how the state and the county in county plans will function as partner in the workforce investment act wia onestop center and how funds will flow report on what strategy will be used to help families with limited english proficiency description of how states will enter into cooperative agreements with state vocational rehabilitation agencies to be sure that tanf parents are assessed for hidden disabilities before being required to work and description of how states will assess the needs of kinship families the center on budget and policy priorities suggested that the hhs annual report to congress include more detail on state program rules better reporting of how federal and state funds are spent was also requested by number of groups large number of commenters urged that states make data publicly available with information provided by race and ethnicity to ensure that services are provided on an equitable basis administration number of additional comments related to state administration were received for example some persons said that states should be required to accept tanf applications immediately and unconditionally some urged that states use planning process that includes input from the public and that hhs monitor compliance with this rule current law requires that summary of any plan crs17 or plan amendment submitted to hhs be made available to the public several commenters urged that states be required to make sure that caseworkers are adequately trained with regard to federal administration one state urged that regulations be kept to minimum equitable provision of services and benefits sizeable number of national state and local advocacy groups addressed the need to ensure fair and equitable treatment of tanf recipients and applicants these comments concerned fair access to tanf benefits and services as well as equitable treatment for tanf recipients in general commenters sought to ensure that civil rights and labor law protections applied to tanf recipients and together they listed wide variety of conditions characteristics or statuses that they asserted should not be factor in access to or receipt of tanf benefits or services these include applicant or recipient status mental or physical disability marital status race gender ethnicity sexual orientation criminal record immigration status and primary language within the context of ensuring equitable access to all some commenters specifically mentioned the need for languageappropriate services education and welfaretowork services that meet the needs of all tanf recipients many of these commenters also asked for greater attention to compliance with labor and civil rights laws as well as with the americans with disabilities act including specific data reporting on benefits and services provided by race gender and other categories summary of comments on related programs child care many commenters focused on child care issues affecting lowincome families and provided recommendations with respect to the reauthorization of the child care and development fund ccdf as well as tanf4 both of these federal block grants support child care for lowincome families but only the ccdf is dedicated solely for that purpose5 as result recommendations for changes in funding and program requirements usually applied to the ccdf but not always in some cases commenters called specific attention to tanfs role in supporting child care services and suggested changes to the federal tanf law ie requiring that tanffunded child care meet the same health and safety standards of ccdffunded child care at the broadest level the comments reflected desire to improve the availability affordability and quality of child care the suggested means for achieving those 4 for comparison of child care legislation approved by the house and senate finance and help committees in the 108th congress see crs report rl32241 child care reauthorization sidebyside comparison of child care provisions in hr 4 s 880 and current law by melinda gish 5 the term ccdf refers to the combination of mandatory and discretionary funding that is used to administer programs under the rules of the child care and development block grant ccdbg act in this report ccdf is used not only as funding term but also to encompass all rules and regulations under which those funds are administered crs18 improvements generally involved making changes with respect to ccdf funding program requirements and data collection funding the most frequently submitted comment with respect to child care called for increasing ccdf funding many commenters specifically recommended increasing the mandatory portion ccdf is funded through combination of mandatory and discretionary grants total ccdf funding appropriated for fy2005 amounts to 4817 billion with the mandatory portion comprising 2717 billion these amounts have been roughly unchanged since fy2002 commenters of all types expressed the sentiment that funding for child care has fallen short of the need and that increasing ccdf funding would help move toward serving all eligible children and help improve overall child care quality in addition to increasing funding for child care has fallen short of the true the overall funding available for need waiting lists for child care programs are child care many commenters common and place our most vulnerable children in favored raising the percentage substandard care fund more slots and set of ccdf funds that states are higher income guidelines required to set aside specifically community service organization for promoting quality activities under current law 4 of ccdf funds must be dedicated for this purpose and many commenters expressed support for raising that percentage to 12 likewise several commenters advocated increasing the funding reserved for infants and toddlers comments that deviated from promoting these setasides came from at least two organizations which while supporting an increase in overall funding oppose additional setasides in favor of greater state flexibility in their use of ccdf funds one researchadvocacy organization emphasized that while they do support providing additional resources for the quality setaside it should not reduce the current level of funding available for actual child care slots aside from funding levels and setasides number of commenters expressed support for simplifying ccdf rules for states obligation and expenditure of funds by making the time periods for doing so identical regardless of ccdf funding stream program requirements most of the comments that called for changes in ccdf program requirements reflected those commenters lack of satisfaction with the availability of quality child care both during standard work hours and weekend and evening care numerous comments expressed the sentiment that one way to improve child care quality is to improve compensation for providers and to help them get additional education however only few of those commenters mentioned dedicating specific funds for this purpose ie setaside several individuals and organizations called for requiring that all providers receiving ccdf funds have training in childhood development before caring for children moreover some commenters recommended using provider payment rates as means of improving quality of care each of these commenters suggested the federal government require states to pay the full market rate as opposed to the 75th percentile suggested in ccdf regulations for child care and higher rates for care that is of higher quality limited supply for children with special needs and children crs19 in lowincome communities with respect to the providers who receive public funds many commenters said that they should be subject to at least two mandatory unannounced visits year several commenters recommended requirement that every community have access to child care resource and referral agencies many comments also expressed support for simplifying the application and recertification process for parents the most common recommendation in this area was to require certification for ccdf subsidies more than once year so that the recertification process would be less likely to present barrier to receiving subsidies data collection those submitting child care comments overwhelmingly recommended additional funding citing need to improve child care availability affordability and quality however many acknowledged lack of comprehensive national data to illustrate the needs they describe several comments included identical language calling for national data collection initiative to gather information on child care supply and demand as well as quality available to low income families tanffunded child care several commenters who addressed child care issues suggested two tanfrelated modifications the first alluded to earlier would require that the health and safety standards applicable to ccdf child care providers also apply to providers receiving funds directly from tanf under current law tanf funds transferred to the ccdf are required to be spent according to the ccdf rules but tanf funds spent for child care directly within the tanf program are not the second modification relating to tanf child care concerns the definition of assistance under tanf under current law tanf program requirements ie work requirements time limits are triggered when tanf money is spent on assistance as defined by hhs in regulation whether child care is classified as assistance depends on the individual situation for example child care for working person is not assistance and would not trigger tanf requirements whereas child care for nonworking person such as cash welfare recipient in training program would be categorized as assistance and thus trigger tanf requirements several commenters suggested that child care should not be counted as assistance under any circumstances child support enforcement6 most of the individuals or groups that made comments on the child support enforcement cse program were interested in getting more child support to children they wanted child support collections to be paid to former tanf families first before the state or federal government could claim for their own expenses any child support arrearage payments as required under current law up to the amount of tanf benefits that had been paid to the family 6 for comparison of child support provisions passed by the house and senate finance committee during the 108th congress see crs report rl32258 child support enforcement sidebyside comparison of current law and two versions of hr 4 by carmen solomonfears crs20 in addition they wanted child support payments should benefit the child some of the child support not the state or federal government one of the collected on behalf of current reasons that lowincome fathers do not pay child tanf families to be passed support or do not pay it on the record is because through to the families and when their child receives tanf assistance their disregarded in determining the child support will be used to reimburse the state familys tanf benefit amount rather than to support the child some of these commenters national advocacy organization stated that the current law requirements regarding the federal share should be eliminated in other words they maintained that states should be able to pass through and disregard portion of child support collected on behalf of tanf family without having to reimburse the federal government most commenters did not put dollar amount or percentage on how much child support should be passed through and disregarded and only minority said all of the child support collected for tanf family should be passed through and disregarded few commenters said that states should be rewarded with monetary incentives for providing more child support to tanf families several commenters suggested that the child support passed through and disregarded should be counted as state moe funds or that tanf funds be used to help support the child support passthrough another frequent recommendation was to repeal the existing federal requirement that tanf applicants and recipients cooperate in establishing paternity or obtaining support payments these commenters generally argued that if the custodial parent did not want to pursue child support it usually was because of legitimate reason moreover several commenters wanted to eliminate the current law provision that requires tanf recipients to assign their rights to child support to the state several commenters mentioned financing of the cse system some wanted to maintain the current general federal matching rate of 66 of state expenditures on cse activities and the 90 federal matching rate for the laboratory costs of paternity establishment couple of commenters wanted the enhanced automated systems matching rate which was 80 of capped amount reinstated until october 2005 other commenters wanted 90 federal matching rate for costs associated with medical support few commenters wanted to eliminate or adjust the current law cap on incentive payments to the states which requires states to compete among each other for fixed amount of funds other comments which convene panel of noncustodial parent were raised by only few organizations to seek their advice on how tanf people called for additional cse child care and related programs can best funding for visitation programs serve them and their children in which noncustodial parents mens advocacy organization would have more access to their children the development of fatherhood programs requirement that unemployed noncustodial parents participate in welfarerelated work programs the transfer of the administration of the cse program from the states to the internal revenue service and the initiation of forgiveness program which would allow noncustodial parents who consistently paid their child support obligations on time to not have to pay specified percentage of crs21 their child support arrearages in addition there was concern about the need to do more to enforce the child support obligations of higherincome noncustodial parents the need for more collaboration between the cse agencies and the tanf agencies increased communication among the states the need for states to properly distribute undistributed child support collections and the need for states to better use the tools available to them for the enforcement of child support medicaid the subject of medicaid drew comments from relatively small number of persons the predominant medicaid recommendation was that eligibility should be extended to cover working parents without other health insurance coverage the next most common recommendation was for some form of general health care coverage at least for families with children one proposed that medicaid be converted into universal coverage for those with income below 200 of the federal poverty guideline some sample comments provide national health care plan or at least permit lowwage employees to buy into medicaid provide new funding incentives and authority to states to expand health insurance coverage some persons mentioned transitional medicaid assistance tma7 the tma provision which requires l2 months of coverage for families whose earnings end their tanf eligibility expired on september 30 2002 and has been extended through series of temporary measures along with tanf most of the commenters said tma should continue to provide at least one year of coverage two said it should be automatic and another that its reporting and income rules should be abolished some recommended that the length of tma be doubled to 24 months one at state option and two urged that medicaid be extended indefinitely to extanf recipients without time limit one urged that application for tma be consolidated with application for food stamps and child care few groups urged revision of basic medicaid eligibility rules poverty law center recommended that medicaid eligibility be relinked to tanf conferring automatic medicaid coverage on tanf recipients the minnesota department of human services said states should have authority to align medicaid with tanf eligibility and be allowed to adopt twotiered system with separate eligibility standards for tanf and nontanf families the county welfare directors association urged that states be given the option to extend medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip to noncustodial parents who are paying child support one commenter urged new federal eligibility floor for medicaid three commenters recommended that congress end the ban on medicaid reimbursement for residential alcohol and drug treatment programs law center said states should be required to act affirmatively to ensure that persons eligible for medicaid and schip receive those benefits and legal aid group urged that procedures be established to ensure that eligible prisoners are enrolled in medicaid when they leave prison or jail 7 for information on this program see crs report rl31968 transitional medical assistance tma under medicaid by april grady crs22 food stamps8 among those who commented there were number of calls for unspecified strengthening of food stamps and making the program more effective safety net for lowincome families such comments and those proposing an increase in either food stamp funding or benefit amounts were typically made by advocacy and faithbased organizations or the general public some persons associated with state human resource agencies expressed opposition to creating block grant to replace the existing food stamp program the progressive policy institute recommended that congress radically rethink the food stamp programs place in network of supports for working families additionally there were comments from the american public human services association aphsa states human resource organizations or state organizations suggesting simplification and streamlining of food stamp rules there were few calls to deemphasize the programs administrative emphasis on reducing error rates child welfare limited number of commenters made recommendations that dealt with child welfare services andor the interaction between tanf and child welfare services generally children who clarify the law to permit the use of tanf funds receive tanf benefit and are to provide support services including child care cared for by nonparent to kinship caregivers of tanfeligible children relative eg grandparent or without regard to income aunt would in the absence of state association of county welfare agencies this kin care be in state protective custody foster care commenters who ranged from national researchadvocacy groups and county welfare directors to community service organizations and social work students called for fewer requirements and greater access to support services for kinship care givers see treatment of special groups nonparental caregivers earlier in this report regarding exemptions from tanf requirements number of commenters also advocated for kin caregivers access to other kinds of support such as child care assistance respite care and food stamps and national advocacy organization suggested that states be required to provide information in the tanf state plans about how they will assess and serve the needs of kinship families under the 1996 welfare reform law as amended in 1997 state may claim federal reimbursement of certain foster care and adoption support expenses only if the child on whose behalf the funds were spent was removed from family that would have been eligible for afdc as it existed on july 16 1996 few commenters primarily state and county human services agencies or groups who advocate for them proposed severing this relationship between the nowrepealed 8 food stamp amendments were enacted in 2002 after these comments were submitted for summary of food stamp provisions in the 2002 farm act see crs report rl31195 the 2002 farm bill overview and status pp 1821 crs23 afdc program and federal foster care and adoption assistance they recommended basing eligibility on childs need alone or letting states set their own income eligibility levels eg up to 200 of the federal poverty level some commenters also took the opportunity to call for greater funding or increased flexibility in the use of other child welfare funds recommendations included increased funding for the promoting safe and stable families program directing some federal spending from foster care and adoption assistance to more preventive child welfare services and modifying restrictions on certain funds to improve coordination between child welfare services and tanf other programs numerous commenters understood tanf as one component of broader social safety net and as result promoted increased support for variety of other programs and laws designed primarily to assist lowincome individuals and families these include the earned income tax credit eitc unemployment insurance the social services block grant ssbg the community services block grant csbg the minimum wage and housing assistance public state and local human service agencies were among the commenters on ssbg but most additional recommendations concerning other programs came from advocacy groups community service organizations labor unions and the general public earned income tax credit among the community service providers local and national advocates legislators researchers and others who commented on the eitc there was near unanimous support for an expanded or increased federal eitc benefit few commenters only referenced encouragement of state eitc programs specifically commenters suggested making the benefit more valuable for married couples and families with more than three children and one suggested making it available to primary wage earners who are attending schooltraining the heritage foundation suggested increasing the value of the credit for married couples with children as well as the income range in which the credit is available for such working couples unemployment insurance advocacy organizations at the community state and national level including faithbased organizations and others commented on the need to reform the federalstate unemployment insurance system overall they asked that the system provide greater security for parttime and lowwage workers in general and for former tanf recipients in particular state advocacy organization recommended that unemployment insurance cover former tanf recipients who are longer eligible for tanf but who have worked at least half time social services block grant nearly all of the commenters who wrote about the ssbg called for full or historic level funding which they variously defined as 238 billion or 28 billion and many asked that the current option which allows states to transfer up to 10 of their tanf money into the ssbg be maintained support for fully funded ssbg came from variety of groups including state and local human service agencies national and state advocacy groups faithbased organizations labor union indian tribe professional associations and others crs24 community services block grant very small number of commenters addressed the community services block grant they asked that funding for this block grant be increased that states be allowed to transfer tanf funds to this block grant andor that services funded under tanf and csbg be better coordinated minimum wage number of commenters included recommendations about increasing the minimum wage as part of their general tanf comments of those who mentioned the minimum wage the majority wanted an unspecified increase to living wage however there were several commenters who wanted specific increase of at least 150 per hour housing advocacy groups and faithbased or other community service organizations were the primary commenters who addressed housing concerns they sought greater attention to housing needs as part of tanf program planning citing adequate and stable housing as essential to the achievement of selfsufficiency many called for an increase in spending for or creation of affordable housing including use of tanf or other funds few suggested developing serviceenriched housing for tanf clients who have multiple or severe barriers to employment the wisconsin governor and state legislature separately were among the several housing commenters who asked that tanf dollars be allowed for use as ongoing supplemental rental assistance and that this support be treated as nonassistance in addition to give states tanf participants must have stable residential an incentive to address housing situations before they can secure and handle issues as part of their tanf employment programs some commenters state advocacy organization suggested tying part of the high performance bonus to reduction in homelessness or separately to specific criteria that would measure housing stability among families who are tanf incomeeligible finally some of those who commented on housing issues urged more effective coordination of services designed to promote selfsufficiency and job mobility among housing assistance and tanf recipients they also called on hhs and the department of housing and urban development hud to develop uniform data collection methods for tanf recipients who receive housing assistance summary of comments on crosscutting issues noncitizens title iv of the 1996 welfare reform law restricted legal immigrant eligibility for several social service programs including tanf supplemental security income ssi medicaid and food stamps under the 1996 law legal immigrants entering the country after august 22 1996 are ineligible for tanf for fiveyear period states may use federal funds to provide assistance to some groups of legal immigrants including certain refugees and asylees for five years after their entry into the country residents with 10 years of work history and veterans of the us armed forces and some members of their families federal funds also can be used to assist crs25 legal immigrants who entered the country before the cutoff date or after they have been in the country for five years in addition states may choose to assist other categories of noncitizens with their own funds some of the prohibitions on noncitizen eligibility especially for ssi and food stamps have been loosened since 1996 but generally legal immigrants eligibility for federal public assistance programs remains very restricted9 among those commenting on immigrant eligibility for immigrant children should have equal access to tanf and related social basic assistance food stamps health care foster care and social services public education and programs there was almost housing regardless of the immigrant status of the universal support for loosening child or the childs parents the restrictions that were national legal advocacy organization established in 1996 large number of commenters made recommendations to repeal all restrictions on legal immigrant eligibility for social programs tanf food stamps ssi and medicaid additional commenters recommended ending the ban on immigrant eligibility for individual programs primarily food stamps and tanf only few commenters wanted to retain the current restrictions or place additional restrictions on immigrants access to public benefits or make legal immigrants completely ineligible immigrants need our help and assistance said social work professor this country will be stronger and better functioning with the support of our immigrants program coordination although the main purpose of hhss request for comments was to gather input on tanf the federal register notice also requested comments on program coordination between tanf and other benefit programs for lowincome families food stamps child care child welfare and child support enforcement all were mentioned specifically in the notice recommendations regarding each of these specific programs have been discussed above however the range of comments went well beyond these individual programs and covered issues related to the overall social safety net for lowincome families and families leaving welfare there was general support from commenters for improving coordination between tanf the food stamp program and medicaid the recommendations provided by commenters addressed improvements in both the systems and the rules for these programs most commonly commenters supported modifying eligibility rules and aligning income and resource rules across programs to improve the systems commenters suggested crosstraining for case workers simplifying applications providing more hours for interviews and recertifications automatic eligibility for multiple programs automatic transitional benefits for those leaving welfare and improved outreach to inform people of their potential eligibility 9 for further information and current legislative proposals see crs report rl31114 noncitizen eligibility for major federal public assistance programs policies and legislation by ruth wasem crs26 several commenters also giving states the flexibility to align program goals advocated more integration of eligibility requirements and outcomes across tanf and workforce programs would allow states to more effectively investment act programs serve lowincome families other programs mentioned state welfare agency included public housing vocational rehabilitation and child welfare programs these comments came from wide range of individuals and groups including advocates and state human service agencies university child development center said support collaboration at the service delivery level allow families to have one service delivery plan rather than multiple plans many commenters wanted coordination between tanf agencies and different types of service providers ie community action agencies or domestic and sexual violence agencies others recommended more public input generally among those who made comments about coordination there was support for broadening the range of actors in tanf service provision and allowing specialists in specific fields to deal with their areas of expertise transitional supports for welfare leavers families leaving welfare are often eligible for wide range of benefits and services under various federal or state programs recipients who leave tanf for work are not only eligible for but are often given priority to receive child care subsidies under the states ccdf plan transitional medicaid assistance also is currently available to these former recipients for one year and up to two years at state option there was general support among commenters for providing wide range of supports to recipients who leave the rolls and recognition of the importance of these supports in the transition to selfsufficiency in addition to food stamps and medicaid transportation subsidies child care and education and training were frequently mentioned as valuable supports for working families other services mentioned include job retention services and housing assistance other suggestions the law should do more to ensure that families included providing an leaving welfare continue to receive food stamps entitlement to transitional medicaid child care and other necessary supports services for period of time local community service organization after leaving tanf eg six months one year and improving access to supports and making sure leavers are aware of their continued eligibility as noted above similar suggestions were made about coordinating program eligibility as response to tanf work mandates and time limits number of commenters proposed creating some type of public service jobs program to provide work for families on or leaving tanf cash assistance the groups mentioned most often as the target population for these programs were families reaching time limits and those with limited work experience other populations cited as potential beneficiaries of these programs include the hardtoemploy those with prison records and recipients in rural or urban areas with limited employment opportunities crs27 or high unemployment among the commenters advocating public service jobs program many emphasized that such jobs must pay living wage some commenters also wanted these jobs to provide education and training mentoring and support services charitable choice section 104 of title i of the 1996 welfare law addresses services provided under tanf by charitable religious or private organizations commonly known as the charitable choice provision the stated purpose of this section is to allow states to use religious organizations as service providers on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairing the religious character of such organizations and without diminishing the religious freedom of beneficiaries of assistance funded under such program10 although there were number of commenters affiliated with churches or faith based service providers these groups did not often comment on the charitable choice provisions under tanf comments on charitable choice came from wide variety of individuals and groups most of whom had similar concerns about the provision in general commenters supported the protections currently afforded recipients under the charitable choice provision such as the prohibition against requiring religious observance to obtain services but wanted system of oversight and increased protections to make sure that these protections were being enforced in addition many of these commenters were concerned that under charitable choice federal tanf funds could be paid to employers who discriminate in hiring the current charitable choice provision allows religious organizations who are exempt from section 702 of the civil rights act of 1964 which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of religion to maintain their exempt status as service providers under tanf among those who commented on these provisions there was strong support for applying antidiscrimination laws to all providers of tanf services 10 for more information see crs report rs20717 charitable choice faithbased initiatives and tanf by vee burke crs28 table a1 comment and recommendation categories11
