crs has ac cess to section 1115 expenditure estimates and fy2005 federal medicaid waiver expenditures as percentage of total medicaid spending were steady at approximately1214 in fy2006 there was substantial increase in federal waiver spending as percentage of total medicaid sp ending ie almost 60 increase over the fy2005 totals while there are several plausible explana tions for this increase eg ramp up of new and renegotiated waivers prior period adjustments et c because waiver financing arrangements are negotiated over 5year budget window it is hard to determine if the jump in federal expenditures represents step increase in overall federal wa iver spending or onetime increase that will be mitigated over the budget authority window analys is of future waiver expenditure trends will

of choice refers to requirement th at medicaid beneficiaries have the freedom to choose provider comparability refers to require ment that services be comparable in amount duration and scope for persons in particular ligibility groups waiver of the statewideness requirement allows states to provide services in only portion of the state rather than in all geographic jurisdictionsbackground medicaid authorized under title xix of the so cial security act is federalstate program providing medical assistance for wincome individuals who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent children or who have one of few specified medical conditions the balanced budget act of 1997 established schip under new title xxi of the social security act schip builds on medicaid by

secretary of health and human services hhs with broad authority to conduct research and monstration projects under several programs authoriz ed by the social security act including medicaid and schip section 1115 also authorizes the secret ary to waive certain statutory requirements for conducting these projects without congressiona l approval for this reason the research and demonstration projects are often referred to as section 1115 waiver projects under section 1115 the secretary ma waive medicaid requirement s contained in section 1902 including but not limited to what is known as freedom of choice of provider comparability of services and statewide access2 the secretary may also use the section 1115 waiver authority to provide federal financial participation ffp for costs that are not otherwise matchable under section 1903 of the social s ecurity act for schip specific sections or requireme nts are cited as waiveable section 2107e2a of the social security act states that section 1115 of the act pe rtaining to research and demonstration waivers applie s to schip states must submit proposals outlining terms and conditions for proposed waivers to cm s for approval before implementing these programs in recent years there has been increased interest among states and the federal government in the section 1115 waiver authority as means to restructure coverage control costs and increase state flexibility under current law states may obtain waivers that allow them to provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible for medicaid or schip cover nonmedicaid or schip services limit benefit packages for certain groups among other purposes whether larg or small reforms section 1115 waiver programs have resulted in significant changes for medicaid and schip recipients nationwide and may serve as precedent for federal and state officials who wish to make statutory changes to these healthcare safety net programs while section 1115 is explicit about provisi ons in medicaid law that may be waived in conducting demonstration projects numbe r of other provisions in medicaid law and regulations specify limitations on how state may operate waiver program for example one provision restricts states from establishing waivers that fail to provide allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21054crs3 3 section 1903 describes the conditions under which federal financial participation is available section 1115a2 stipulates that expenditures under waiver are eligible for matching under section 1903 the same federal reimbursement rule s apply to schip waiver projects as with schip state plan expenditures schip secti on 1115 waiver programs are reimbursed at an enhanced federal matching rate 4 an exception was made by the secretary for th katrina waivers ie all tests of budget and allotment neutrality were waivedmandatory services to the mandatory povert yrelated groups of pregnant women and children another provision speci fies restrictions on costs haring under waivers other features of the section 1115 waiver authority include federal reimbursement for section 1115 demonstrations approved section 1115 waivers are deemed to be part of states medicaid or schip state plan for purposes of federal reimburseme nt project costs associated with waiver programs are subject to that states fmap or enhancedfmap3 financing and budget neutrality unlike regular medicaid cms waiver guidance specifies that waiver costs are budget neutral to the federal government over the life of the waiver program to meet the budget neutrality test estimate d spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated cost of the states existin g medicaid program under current law program requirements4 for example costs associated with an expanded population eg those not otherwise eligible under medicaid must be offset by reductions elsewhere with in the medicaid program several methods are used by states to ge nerate cost savings for the waiver component 1 limiting benefit packages for certain eligibility groups 2 providing targeted services to certa in individuals so as to divert them from full medicaid coverage and 3 using enrollment caps and cost sharing to reduce the amounts states must pay financing and allotment neutrality under the schip program different budget neutrality standard applies states must meet an allotment neutrality test where combined federal expenditures for the states regular schip program and for the states schip demonstration program are capped at the states individual schip allotment ie original allotments and funds made available th rough the redistribution of unspent schip funds this po licy limits federal spending to the capped allotme nt levels application and approval process there is standardized process to apply for section 1115 demonstra tion but cms has issued program guidance that impacts the approval process states often work collaboratively with cms to develop their proposals project proposals are subject to approval by cms th office of management and budget omb and the department of hea lth and human services dhhs and may be subject to additional requirements such as site visits before the program may be implemented unde r the agreed upon terms and conditions duration waiver projects are generally approved for fiveyear period however states may seek up to threeyear extension for their existinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21054crs4 5 the approval process associated with each type of extension is defined in statute at section 1115e and at section 1115f respectively 6 for example states may not provide benefits to qualified aliens as part of section 1115 eligibility expansion without adhering to the fiveyear ban on alien access to federal assistance as required by the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104 193 7 program rules and regulations that meet spec ified rulemaking criteria are legally binding to date cms has not shaped section 1115 waiverrelated policy through program rules and regulations 8 unlike program rules and regulations program gu idance is not legally binding rather program guidance provides framework for the process by which states may obtain approvals and the principles under which states may operate their programs program guidance contains authoritative interpretation and clarification of stat utory and regulatory requirements to date the secretary has only used guidance to shape section 1115 waiver policy 9 estimates do not include state experience under the 5 month temporary katrina waivers described below waiver program under the same special terms and conditions stc and an additional extensions under revi sed stc for the continuation of waiver project operating under an initial threeyear extension5 relationship of medicaidschip demonstration waivers to other statutes section 1115 waiver projects may interact with other program rules outside of the social security act for example employer sponsored health insurance as scribed by the employee retirement income security act erisa or alien eligibility as contained in immigration law in cases like these the secretary does not have the authority to waive provisions in these other statutes6 program guidance the secretary can develop policies that influence the content of demonstration projects and prescribe pproval criteria in three ways 1 by promulgating pr ogram rules and regulations7 2 through the publication of program guidance eg waivers must be budget neutral8 and 3 waiver policy may also be implicitly shaped by the programs that have been approve d eg cms appr oval of benefit specific waivers legislative action may be required if congress chooses to further shape the secretarys authority over the content of the demonstration programs dictate sp ecific section 1115 waiver approval criteria or otherwise limit the secretarys waiver authority program types as of july 1 2008 there were 94 opera tional medicaid
