yacobucci specialists in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division climate change comparison and analysis of s 1766 and s 2191 s 3036 summary several proposals designed to address greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress two proposals s 1766 introduced by senators bingaman and specter and s 2191 introduced by senators lieberman and warner and reported by the senate committee on environment and public works on may 20 2008 are receiving increased scrutiny in preparation for senate debate on s 2191 on may 20 2008 senator boxer introduced s 3036 which is identical to the reported version of s 2191 except that it contains proposed budget amendment to make the bill deficit neutral on june 2 2008 the senate invoked cloture on motion to proceed on s 3036 allowing discussion of the bill but not allowing amendments to be introduced as of june 4 2008 it is unclear whether the senate will agree on the motion to proceed leading to further discussion and allowing amendments to be introduced the two proposals s 1766 and s 2191 would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 2191 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities and would allow entities to trade emissions under that cap s 1766 would establish emissions targets on covered entities and allow those entities to either meet emission reduction targets through trading program or make safety valve payment in lieu of reducing emissions under both proposals shortterm us emissions would likely be below businessasusual scenario although reductions under s 2191 are guaranteed by the cap and are projected to be larger particularly over the longterm in contrast costs under s 1766 are likely to be lower and more predictable than under s 2191 major policy question is whether one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore willing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie favoring safety valve like s 1766 or one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie pure tradeable permits as in s 2191 s 2191 leans toward the quantity total emissions side of the equation s 1766 leans toward the price side of the equation contents

generally would require action at the national level in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing the six primary greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 20001 for more than decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of power plant carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources however greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions2 he has also rejected the concept of mandatory emissions reductions3 since then the administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions in contrast in 2005 the senate passed sense of the senate resolution on climate change declaring that congress should enact legislation establishing mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the united states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations4 number of congressional proposals to advance programs designed to reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress these have generally followed one of three tracks the first is to improve the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions to provide basis for research and development and for any potential future reduction scheme the second is to enact marketoriented greenhouse gas 1 under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc those gases are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 some greenhouse gases are controlled under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and are not covered under unfccc 2 for further information see crs report rl33826 climate change the kyoto protocol bali action plan and international actions by susan r fletcher and larry parker 3 president george w bush president bushs speech on global climate change june 11 2001 4 samdt 866 passed by voice vote after motion to table failed 4354 june 22 2005 crs2 reduction program along the lines of the trading provisions of the current acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments the third is to enact energy and related programs that would have the added effect of reducing greenhouse gases5 an example would be requirement that electricity producers generate portion of their electricity from renewable resources renewable portfolio standard this report focuses on the second category of bills and on two bills in particular s 1766 and s 2191 as reported6 note that crs has more comprehensive discussion of the costs and benefits of s 2191 available7 many of the caveats and limitations about modeling and forecasting in that report are applicable to this one readers are urged to consult that report in addition to reading this one proposed senate legislation comparison of s 1766 and s 2191 s 1766 introduced july 11 2007 by senators bingaman and specter s 1766 would set emissions targets on most of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions8 beginning in 2012 covered entities would face emissions limits with emissions targets set at their 2006 levels in 2020 the emissions targets would decline steadily until 2030 when the emission target would be set at the entities 1990 levels for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent covered entities can comply with the bill by submitting an allowance through trading program or by paying safety valve price called technology accelerator payment or tap under the trading program allowances are allocated to various entities including covered entities eligible facilities noncovered facilities that may be in covered sectors such as coal mines and carbonintensive industries states and parties conducting sequestration activities initially 24 of all allowances are auctioned percentage that increases over time the tap is set at 12 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2012 increasing 5 annually above the rate of inflation the bill also requires countries that do not take comparable action to control emissions to submit special 5 for discussions of relevant energy

mines animal waste and municipal wastewater projects along with nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soil management wastewater treatment and manure management are not included under the targets although credits for use by covered entities are available or may be generated by verified greenhouse gas reductions in these areas crs3 allowances or their foreign equivalent to accompany imports into the united states of covered greenhouse gas intensive goods andor primary products s 2191 senators lieberman and warner introduced s 2191 on october 18 2007 as reported by the senate committee on environment and public works the bill would cover emissions from petroleum producers and importers facilities that produce or import more than 10000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of fluorinated chemicals annually any facility that uses more than 5000 tons of coal annually any natural gas processing plant or importer including lng and any facility that emits more than 10000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of hfcs annually as byproduct of hydrochlorofluorocarbon production s 2191 is estimated by its sponsors to reduce total us greenhouse gas emissions 19 below 2005 levels by 2020 up from 15 as introduced and 63 below 2005 levels by 2050 the bill would establish carbon market efficiency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary like s 1766 s 2191 also requires countries that do not take comparable action to control emissions to submit special allowances or their foreign equivalent to accompany exports to the united states of any covered greenhouse gas intensive goods and primary products on april 10 2008 proposed amendment to s 2191 was submitted to the congressional budget office cbo to be included in the scoring of the bill the amendment would provide for some of the auctioned revenues to be put aside for deficit reduction purposes on may 20 senator boxer introduced s 3036 which is identical to the reported version of s

us environmental protection agency epa the reports are entitled epa analysis of the low carbon economy act of 2007 s 1766 in the 110th congress january 15 2008 and epa analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 s 2191 in 110th congress march 14 20089 the analyses employ suite of models and basecases along with some useful sensitivity analysis this report will focus on three of the models and two basecases10 the first model is adage computable general equilibrium cge model developed by rti international11 the s 1766 and s 2191 cases employing the reference basecase are designated epaadageref in this report while the cases employing the high technology basecase are designated epaadagetech the second model is igem cge model developed by dale jorgenson associates12 the cases employing the reference basecase are designated epaigemref in this report while the cases employing the high technology basecase are designated epaigem tech the third model is ipm dynamic

analysis of s 2191 using its preliminary 2008 annual energy outlook aeo baseline eia also conducts some useful sensitivity analysis that focuses on the upside risk of increased energy prices under s 2191 however eia did not update the sensitivity analysis it had previously conducted on s 1766 the core16 s 2191 analysis and the updated s 1766 analysis are designated eianems in this report emissions reductions figures 1 and 2 present greenhouse gas emissions under s 1766 and s 2191 as estimated by the models for s 2191 the spread in projected emissions reductions is largely the result of two factors 1 estimated emissions growth in the 1015 of the economy not covered under the bill and 2 estimated use of international allowances or offsets to meet emission reduction requirements if covered entity submits an international allowance or offset for compliance purposes the entity can emit comparable amount domestically this latter point is most evident in the adage estimates for s 1766 the spread would also be in response to these uncertainties although the epa cases and eias updated analysis did not include international credits what the figures do not show is that the tap safety valve is increasingly used by covered entities after 2030 preventing the projected emissions from achieving the targets specified under the bill this result is discussed more fully later 15 for more on the nems model see httpwwweiadoegovoiafaeooverviewindexhtml 16 the use of the word core should not imply that eia believes it to be the most likely scenario crs11 figure 1 total estimated us

spread in the outyears as evident in the figures it should be noted that the eianems case for s 2191 mimics the extension of s 2191 to 2050 by requiring the model to have 5 billion allowance bank at

revenues both s 2191 and s 1766 would auction significant portion of allowances although auction revenues would be significantly higher in s 2191 for two reasons 1 s 2191 allocates more allowances for auction and 2 s 2191s allowance prices are higher starting in 2012 both bills would auction roughly quarter of all allowances in later years s 2191 auctions larger share of allowances than s 1766 in 2030 s 2191 would auction roughly 68 of allowances while s 1766 would auction 53 also as shown in figures 7 and 8 in all models s 2191 has higher prices than s 1766 in some cases two to three times as high figure 9 shows estimated auction revenues based on allowance prices in the epaadage tech case using allowance prices from the other scenarios would show an even wider discrepancy between auction revenues as the epaadagetech case presents the lowest allowance price for s 2191 while all of the models peg s 1766 allowance prices at or near the tap price figure 8 estimated annual revenues from

using allowance price estimates from epaadage tech case crs19 crs has chosen to present auction revenues only to 2030 for two reasons first s 1766 requires new congressional vote under special procedures in order to continue beyond 2030 second based on the analyses available the tap becomes the dominant compliance strategy after about 2030 suggesting congress may want to reassess its level at that time if additional reductions are considered warranted analysis addressing the price versus quantity issue s 1766 and s 2191 represent different answers to the choice between controlling the price and the quantity of emissions under marketbased control strategy in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or compliance costs price allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable if one is more concerned about the possible economic cost price of the program then use of safety valve to limit costs could appear to some more appropriate even through it introduces some uncertainty about the amount of reduction achieved quantity in contrast if one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level quantity with costs handled efficiently but not capped tradeable permit program without safety valve may be viewed as more appropriate in the case of these alternatives s 2191 leans toward the quantity total emissions side of the equation s 1766 leans toward the price side of the equation uncertainty in emissions reductions the projected emission reductions under s 2191 are more certain than under s 1766 there are two key sources of uncertainty for s 2191 1 the precise number of covered entities that must meet the reduction requirements and the future emissions growth from noncovered entities and 2 the availability and use of international allowances that meet the bills compliance requirement but do not reduce domestic emissions s 2191 is estimated to cover about 85 of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions in addition the analyses presented here assume that international credits that meet s 2191s eligibility requirements would be available at reasonable prices in other analyses of s 2191 this assumption is disputed s 1766 has these uncertainties plus an additional one in the form of the safety valve as indicated in the results section the cases reviewed here generally assume that the allowance price equals the safety valve price or is very close this results in banking in the early years of the program and use of that bank later as the program approaches 2030 the bank is exhausted and covered entities begin making tap payments as illustrated in figure 10 the result is an actual emissions level that is higher than the level targeted by the bill18 18 in early years as the bank is built up both annual emissions and cumulative emissions are below the targets in the bill as the bank is used up annual emissions exceed the targets and continued crs20 because the tap price becomes the allowance price over time in all cases under s 1766 projected emissions exceed the bills target once the tap is triggered this situation reveals the emissions uncertainty that safety value introduces the tap price is compliance strategy independent of the capandtrade compliance strategy thus the actual emissions reduction under s 1766 depends on the interplay between allowance prices and tap prices for example epaigemref sensitivity analysis indicates unlimited availability of international credits would keep allowance prices below the tap price19 eianems does not project beyond 2030 however none of the sensitivity analyses from eias previous analysis resulted in an allowance price below the tap price in 2030 the result could change if the sensitivity analyses were updated to the 2008 annual energy outlook aeo baseline with lower projected baseline emissions and thus presumably lower

reference case emissions target actual covered emissions source crs analysis of data from epaadageref s 1766 case uncertainty in cost estimates the projected cost effects under s 2191 are more uncertain than under s 1766 major source of uncertainty for s 2191 is future businessasusual growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities because s 2191 establishes strict cap on greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities based on limits specified in the bill any increased emissions resulting from continuing economic growth would have to be reduced or offset the more robust the economic growth the greater 18 continued cumulative emissions approach and eventually equal the bill target when the tap is included once the bank is exhausted and cumulative emissions are equal to the target annual and cumulative emissions exceed the targets in all future years 19 however s 1766 allows covered entities to meet only 10 of allowance requirements through international offsets crs21 potential for higher emissions that would have to be offset to maintain the cap in general greater emissions reduction leads to higher costs if economic growth is less robust fewer reductions would be necessary and costs would be less20 s 2191 cost estimates are affected by several other uncertainties as noted earlier the span of estimated allowance prices under s 2191 is significant the differing estimates are based on varied assumptions about the availability of the following 1 costeffective energy efficiency improvements 2 costeffective non co2 greenhouse gas reductions and other offsets 3 costeffective carbon capture and storage technology ccs and other lowcarbon emitting technology and 4 costeffective international allowances andor credits with program designed to achieve leastcost solution through marketbased allowance trading system restricting the availability of options be they emissions reduction opportunities ie offsets or new technology increases projected costs hence the incentives and funding for new technology and the availability of offsets and credits under s 2191 are critical to its longterm success s 1766 cost estimates are not as sensitive to the factors identified above partly this is by design and partly this is because s 1766 targets less emission reductions than s 2191 the reduction targets under s 1766 are not as stringent as the emissions cap under s 2191 as discussed earlier fewer emissions reductions required translates into lower costs this is reinforced by the tap price which is projected to become the dominant compliance strategy in the longterm the effect of lower emission reduction targets is illustrated by the impact of the two bills on projected 2030 electric generation as illustrated in table 2 as discussed in crs report rl34489 in some ways the interplay between nuclear power renewables and coalfired capacity with ccs is proxy for the need for lowcarbon source of electric generation in the mid to longterm21 as indicated considerable amount of lowcarbon generation will have to be built under s 2191 in order to meet the reduction requirement the amount of capacity constructed depends on the models base case assumptions about future supply and demand and need for capacity replacementretirement under s 2191 along with the degree of consumer response to rising prices and incentives contained in s 2191 the amount necessary under s 1766 is substantially less as fewer existing facilities are retired or replaced for example epaipm estimates that for 2025 about 193 gigawatts gw of oil fired natural gasfired and coalfired capacity would be retired under s 2191 it estimates only 95 gw of such capacity would be retired under s 1766 20 for more information see crs report rl33970

built is the amount the model determined needed to be built about is an estimate by crs of the additional capacity necessary for the increased electricity production projected by the model between 2010 and 2030 under s 1766 and s 2191 in the absence of capacity data being provided the estimates are calculated assuming an 80 capacity factor for biomass 90 for nuclear power and coal 48 for renewables and 85 for natural gas crs23 to put these numbers into historical context from 1963 to 1985 78 gw of nuclear power were ordered constructed and began operation22 for the 19year period of 1966 through 1984 the country added 464 gw of generating capacity including 210 gw of coalfired capacity 38 gw of hydropower 27 gw of natural gas capacity steam technology 46 gw of oilfired capacity and 54 gw of peaking capacity to improve system reliability after the 1965 blackout in addition to new additions between 1965 and 1972 about 400 coalfired generating units were converted to oil to meet environmental requirements after the 1973 oil embargo this trend was reversed with 11 gw of capacity converted back to coal by 198323 for more recent example from 2001 through 2005 the united states added about 180 gw of new capacity almost all natural gasfired24 like s 2191 s 1766s projected cost is affected by the assumed availability of costeffective control measures such as those noted above energy efficiency improvements nonco2 greenhouse gas reductions and other offsets carbon capture and storage technology and other lowcarbon emitting technology and costeffective international credits however s 1766 does not represent as much of shift in generation supply as does s 2191 this is evident from the projected impact of s 1766 on coal production for electricity generation where the model results indicate stable production under s 1766 under s 2191 future coal production is heavily dependent on the models assumptions about the availability and costeffectiveness of ccs technology compared with alternatives such as nuclear power combined with more modest reduction requirement s 1766s safety valve caps the upside risk of costs and ensures its costs would be lower than s 2191 although there are uncertainties in s 1766s potential costs its safety valve puts strict upper limit on compliance cost 12 ton nominal 2012 increasing 5 annually in real terms besides putting an upper bound on cost s 1766s safety valve narrows the band of potential costs substantially the remaining cost uncertainty is only with respect to the lower bound of costs price versus quantity the safety valve the purpose of safety valve price is to bound the costs of any climate change control program price at the expense of reductions achieved quantity25 in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of permits allocated caps 22 compiled from eias reactor

program by larry parker crs24 allowable emissions while letting the marketplace determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax or the safety valve contained in s 1766 sets the maximum unit cost per ton of co2 that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received26 for those confident that achieving specific level of greenhouse gas reduction will yield significant benefits enough so that even the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve is not concern pure tradeable permit program may be most appropriate greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit program the cost involved would be handled efficiently though not controlled at specific cost level this efficiency occurs because through the trading of permits emission reduction efforts concentrate at sources at which controls can be achieved at least cost however if one is more concerned about the potential downside risk of substantial control costs to the economy than of the benefits of specific level of reduction then including safety valve may be most appropriate in this approach the level of the safety valve effectively caps the marginal cost of control that affected entities would pay under the reduction scheme but the precise level of greenhouse gas reductions achieved is less certain emitters of greenhouse gases would spend money controlling greenhouse gas emissions up to the level of the safety valve however since the marginal cost of control among millions of emitters is not well known the overall emissions reductions for given safety valve level on greenhouse gas emissions cannot be accurately forecast in essence the safety valve contained in s 1766 could be seen as contingent carbon tax conclusion the two proposals s 1766 and s 2191 would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 2191 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities and would allow entities to trade emissions under that cap s 1766 would establish emissions targets on covered entities and allow those entities to meet those targets either through trading program or by making safety valve payment in lieu of reducing emissions under both proposals short term us emissions would likely be below businessasusual scenario although reductions under s 2191 are guaranteed and projected to be larger particularly over the longterm in contrast the cost of s 1766 is likely to be less and more predictable than s 2191 hence major policy question is whether one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore willing to accept some 26 for another discussion of this tradeoff see epa tools of the trade guide to designing and operating cap and trade program for pollution control june 2003 p 25 crs25 uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie safety valve or one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie pure tradeable permits s 2191 leans toward the quantity total
