berlin 504 classified by robert pollard ministercounselor for economic affai rs for reasons 14b and d 1 c summary germanys new federal interior minister thomas maiziere is known for being competent administrator who performed effectively over the past four years as the chancellery chief of staff maiziere is close confidant of chancellor merkel their professional relationship dates back to 1990 and he developed reputation as reliable crisis manager and interagency master over the past four years although maiziere previously served as state interior minister in saxony he has less direct experience dealing with the international security issues most prominently counterterrorism that he will face as federal interior minister furthermore maiziere is not known for being ideological or outspoken in this respect maiziere represents marked change from his predecessor powerhouse wolfgang schaeuble who had strong views on security policy and was willing to endure considerable criticism to achieve his policy goals we do not expect maiziere to push for further expanding law enforcement powers of police andor security services maiziere indicates that he intends to focus on integration of foreigners into german society and will continue the ministrys islam conference controversial schaeuble initiative that had advanced the countrys discussion on immigration and discrimination issues he also intends to promote the further integration of former east and west germany end summary an aristocratic westerner makes his name in the east 2 u maiziere 55 is lawyer by training who was born and raised in bonn but has spent nearly the last two decades in the eastern states of mecklenburgvorpommern and saxony he is descendent of the noble maizierelesmetz family who as huguenots fled france for asylum in prussia in the late seventeenth century maizieres father ulrich was inspector general of the german armed forces his cousin lothar was the last and only democratically elected premier of the german democratic republic who later served as minister in the kohl government as staffer in the offices of berlin governing mayor richard von weizsacker and later eberhard diepgen maiziere participated in the negotiations on german reunification after 1990 maiziere worked to reestablish democratic structures in eastern states starting first in mecklenburgvorpommern from 1998 through 2005 maiziere served in saxony as head of the state chancery and as finance justice and interior minister maiziere joined the christian democratic union cdu as student in 1972 maiziere won direct mandate in the september 27 national parliamentary election and is now member of the bundestag representing the district of meissen in saxony 3 c maiziere first met angela merkel in 1990 and his recommendation of her to his cousin lothar maiziere is said to have facilitated her entry into cdu politics chancellor merkel and maiziere are known to have very close professional relationship and to share similar sober and analytical approach to governing maiziere is reported to have performed well throughout his tenure as merkels chancellery chief and minister for special duties as chancellery chief of staff maiziere was known as consensus builder who understands and effectively works the interagency process sometimes requiring competing ministers to resolve disputes among themselves the chancellor doubt appreciated maizieres efforts to shield her from these policy battles given her general propensity to stay above the fray and to express an opinion on an issue only when consensus has been reached at the cabinet level maiziere faces steep learning curve 4 c maizieres experience in eastern germany helped him gain new responsibilities for the federal interior ministry the entire department of eastern german affairs has been moved from the transportation and urban affairs ministry to the interior ministry in his remarks to ministry employees on his first day in office maiziere said that with this move the interior ministry is now responsible for not only immigrant integration but also the integration of eastern and western germany and the cohesion of german society maiziere will continue the german islam conference an initiative started by his predecessor which seeks to improve the integration of germanys muslim population and open dialogue between the government and germanys muslim community the islam conference has met with some controversy and came under scrutiny earlier this year when it was discovered that some muslim representatives were alleged to have links with extremist groups 5 snf maiziere has some familiarity with security issues given that his duties in the chancellery included overall coordination of germanys intelligence services maiziere was helpful in promoting cooperation between german ministries and security services with usg counterparts both during the 2007 sauerland islamic jihad union terrorist cell case and following extremist threats surrounding the recent national elections maizieres predecessor wolfgang schaeuble spent considerable time dealing with the issue of terrorism and working to update germanys legal frameworks and expand the mandates of law enforcement agencies to ensure they had the capabilities to address the phenomena in contrast maiziere said virtually nothing in public on the issue of terrorism during his time in the chancellery and he has not emphasized the topic since moving to interior therefore there is some question concerning the depth of his knowledge of the transnational character of terrorism radicalization pathways and terrorists increasing use of the internet and related technology to recruit train and organize aspects of the issue that most affect germany today 6 c during his first day remarks to employees maiziere made the peculiar statement that the interior ministry is responsible for internal matters and the foreign ministry is responsible for issues external to germany this characterization of the mois tasks contrasts sharply with eu law enforcement integration initiatives under schaeuble such as the pruem data sharing agreement observers are concerned that maizieres limited perspective could result in diminished bilateral cooperation and mark significant departure from former minister schaeuble who placed heavy emphasis throughout his tenure on increasing security cooperation with european and other international partners maiziere would benefit from learning about the benefits of international cooperation first hand from his counterparts at the g6 meeting in london this week which dhs secretary napolitano and senior doj representatives will attend note the g6 is an informal grouping of the interior ministers of germany italy spain france poland and the uk schaeuble made point of inviting the usg to g6 meetings that he hosted custom that uk minister jacqui smith is following for this weeks london meeting ref d will maiziere be strong security partner 7 c we do not expect maiziere to be aggressive in pushing for expanded security powers however there is less need for this as two recent legislative packages have already strengthened germanys counterterrorism legal framework refs c and more relevant is whether maiziere will build on schaeubles record of deepening usgerman security cooperation such as the successful negotiations of bilateral pruemlike agreement to exchange information on terrorism and serious crime suspects as well as establish an automated fingerprint checking system final implementation of our agreement is awaiting resolution of some concerns raised by green party justice senator from hamburg we will likely need support from maiziere to break this impasse but it is unclear whether maiziere is willing to make the effort on an initiative that his predecessor initiated and for which he received heavy criticism due to data privacy concerns on the issue of resettlement of guantanamo detainees maiziere has yet to express viewpoint one way or the other 8 c we anticipate that data protection and domestic security issues will be continuing theme that the new coalition government of the christian democrats cdu and csu and free democrats fdp will struggle with during the previous administration the fdp regularly criticized former interior minister schaeuble for policies which the fdp believed trampled on citizens privacy rights ref b germanys new justice minister leutheusserschnarrenberger fdp believes that schaeuble went too far in giving police new powers of investigation and she was successful in committing the new government to modify number of these powers and introducing added data protection measures in the recently completed coalition agreement ref the fdp has found it politically expedient to cast personal freedoms and security policy as mutually exclusive in this debate maizieres greatest advantage is that he is not schaeuble as interior minister maiziere is expected to support existing laws and practices initiated by his predecessor and his reputation for reasonableness and consensusbuilding should serve him well in these discussions murphy
