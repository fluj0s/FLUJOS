suspension hr 2900 does not include drug importation provision many observers believe that drug importation will next be discussed by the s 1082hr 2900 conferees context as public concern over rising spending on prescription drugs continues many in congress have cosponsored legislation to amend the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca and permit the importation of fdaapproved drugs from lowerpriced foreign sources1 lawmakers have also sought to use the appropriations process to counter administrative blocks to drug importation2 1 housepassed hr 2427 and s 1 and hr 1 as amended in the 108th congress s 109hr 328 s 184hr 753 and s 334hr 700 in the 109th and s 242hr 380 and s 251 in the 110th 2 members have offered amendments to appropriations bills that would prohibit the use of funds to enforce importation prohibitions eg the housepassed agriculture appropriations bills for fy2006 and fy2007 and pl 109295 the department of homeland security fy2007 continued crs2 on may 1 2007 senator dorgan offered his drug importation bill s 242 the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act of 2007 as an amendment during floor consideration of s 1082 the fda revitalization act s 242 would change ffdca section 804 to allow personal and commercial importation of prescription drugs under detailed set of procedures to address concerns of safety and cost before accepting the amendment on voice vote the senate first voted 4940 to approve seconddegree amendment offered by senator cochran that would effectively prevent the importation provisions from taking effect the cochran amendment to the dorgan language would require the government to certify the safety of imported drugs something it has indicated it is not able to do the house companion bill to s 242 hr 380 was introduced by representatives emanuel and emerson the housepassed hr 2900 the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 does not include drug importation provisions the congressional debate on prescription drug importation will likely continue as s 1082 and hr 2900 proceed to conference this report provides brief look at the issues surrounding the debate over s 242 and compares its provisions to current law the report concludes by listing other crs reports on drug importation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22660 background current law and the bills introduced over the past several years all seek to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs with the assurance that these imports would be safe and effective sponsors of drug importation legislation want to reduce or restrain the financial burden prescription drugs place on us consumers senator dorgans website description of his legislative proposal uses the title reducing the cost of prescription drugs under current law it is illegal for anyone to import prescription drug other than its manufacturer the law includes provisions for pharmacists and wholesalers to import but provides that they not become effective until the secretary of health and human services hhs certifies that the importation program would be safe and offer cost savings to us consumers secretaries in both the clinton and bush administrations have declined to provide that certification referring to safety and cost concerns the requirement was first established by the medicine equity and drug safety meds act of 2000 which added ffdca section 804 despite much debate to change that approach congress included importation provisions in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act mma pl 108173 that retained the certification requirement current law addresses importation for personal use differently until secretary provides the certification the law does not permit individuals to import prescription drugs for their own use if secretary were to certify and allow the importation program section 804 still would not directly allow individual importation it would authorize the secretary to waive under specific conditions the provisions that prohibit importation by individuals fda has chosen to leniently enforce that ban and has allowed individuals 2 continued appropriations bill crs3 to bring into the united states small amount ie 90day supply of nonfdaapproved drugs for personal use this fda enforcement policy requires that those individuals affirm in writing that the drugs are for their own use and provide the name and address of their treating physician when fdas personal use import policy began it was not envisioned as way for consumers to bring lowerpriced prescription drugs into the united states according to its policy statement on importing drugs for personal use fda intended this enforcement discretion to allow individuals to get treatments not otherwise available in the united states3 s 242hr 380 the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act of 2007 would rewrite section 804 it would eliminate the secretarys certification requirement and allow pharmacists wholesalers and individuals to import prescription drugs under program that would address potential safeguards regarding drug safety and effectiveness in s 242hr 380 senator dorgan and cosponsors led by senator snowe and representative emanuel and cosponsors led by representative emerson continued the approach they had taken in the 109th congress s 242hr 380 differs in few aspects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22660 from its predecessor in part by including some provisions from the other 109th congress bills those provisions related primarily to aspects of packaging that address identification and protections against tampering and counterfeiting and requirements to impede unlawful drug importation requests by prohibiting certain payment system transactions involving unregistered foreign pharmacies s 242hr 380 differs from current law in its approach to ensuring that imported drugs are safe and effective the bill also includes provisions to influence industry behavior so that drugs are available for import by us consumers at cost savings to current domestic prices finally it includes administrative arrangements including financing safe and effective drugs relationship to fda approval current law explicitly requires that an imported drug be approved for us sale by the fda s 242hr 380 would require that manufacturer notify the hhs secretary when drug that could be imported differs from the version fda has approved for sale in the united states the us label drug the bill would require extensive information about whether the difference if it were to be made to us label drug would require supplemental application to fda and whether fda would require that the application be processed before the drug could be marketed permitted countries current law would allow the importation of prescription drugs from canada if the hhs secretary were to certify that the program of importation would be safe and costeffective to us consumers s 242hr 380 would permit 3 fda information on importation of drugs prepared by marvin blumberg division of import operations and policy office of regulatory affairs fda hfc170 april 3 1998 at httpwwwfdagovoraimportpipinfohtm and fda coverage of personal importations regulatory procedures manual office of regulatory affairs fda january 11 2003 at httpwwwfdagovoracompliance_refrpm_new2ch9pershtml crs4 prescription drug importation from australia canada japan new zealand switzerland and members of the european union except for the 10 countries admitted to membership in may 2004 the legislation includes criteria by which the secretary could add other countries to this list ensuring drug identity to address the possibility that adulterated or counterfeit drugs could enter the us market s 242hr 380 calls for variety of procedures regarding registration monitoring inspecting and testing packaging and labeling and internet pharmacies registration current law requires that canadian establishment involved in the distribution of prescription drug that is imported or offered for importation into the united states register with the secretary its name and place of business and the name of its us agent s 242hr 380 would require all exporters from permitted countries and all commercial importers to register monitoring inspecting and testing while current law relies on laboratory testing of samples of every shipment of imported drugs to verify their content potency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22660 and labeling s 242hr 380 would instead require documentation of monitored uninterrupted chain of custody from manufacturing facility to importer the requirements related to registration involve ongoing and onsite physical monitoring of the facilities of drugs manufacturer exporter and importer if the secretary determines it necessary these would include the inspection of any facility and its records that handles the product along the chain of custody packaging and labeling to ensure that drug dispensed to individual consumers is the same product that was tested monitored or inspected at specific manufacturing shipping or storage facility s 242hr 380 would require that the packaging of all prescription drugs not just those being imported incorporate overt optically variable counterfeitresistant technologies that provide visible identification of the product and be similar to those used to secure us currency in addition manufacturers must incorporate the technologies into elements of the packaging including blister packs shrink wrap package labels package seals bottles and boxes the bill would require that the exporter and importer agree to mark each shipping container to identify its compliance with all registration conditions the markings must include anticounterfeiting or trackandtrace technology taking into account their economic and technical feasibility and must be designed to prevent unauthorized affixation internet pharmacies current law does not address use of the internet to sell or purchase imported prescription drugs s 242hr 380 would require that detailed information be accessible on an internet pharmacys website covering pharmacist credentials address and telephone contacts and the name and professional licensure information of the person if any who provides for medical consultations through the site for purposes of providing prescriptions the bill includes many restrictions such as one could dispense or sell drug if the purchaser or patient who communicated through the internet did not have valid us prescription and the dispenser of the prescription drug must have qualifying medical relationship with the patient crs5 cost savings to us consumers even if secretary were to issue the certification necessary to begin the drug importation section in the ffdca many analysts and members of congress anticipate manufacturer resistance to practice that might limit the industrys revenue s 242hr 380 contains specific provisions designed to influence industry behavior discrimination and unfair acts s 242hr 380 would make it unlawful for manufacturer directly or indirectly including being party to licensing or other agreement to discriminate or act unfairly against an exporter importer or person who distributes sells or uses an imported prescription drug by charging higher price denying restricting or delaying supplies or refusing to do business drug differences s 242hr 380 would make it unlawful for manufacturer to make drug for distribution in permitted country so that it differs from the drug made for us distribution for the purpose of restricting importation of the drug enforcement provisions include the involvement of the federal trade commission and the state attorneys general httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22660 patent law recent federal court case has raised the prospect that drug manufacturer could under certain circumstances sue drug importer for patent infringement and block us imports of drugs the company sells abroad the court ruled that us patent is not exhausted by foreign sales and thus drug manufacturer could exercise its patent rights and block imports of its patented drug products into the united states s 242hr 380 would insert new subsection in the patent and trademark act to reverse this judicial precedent under the provision goods that were the subject of authorized foreign sales by us patent holder may be imported into the united states without regard to the us patent administration of importation provisions s 242hr 380 would set up fee mechanism to fund the administrative and regulatory tasks of the importation program it also would set specific implementation dates funding current law includes explicit funding mechanism other than authorizing appropriations of such sums as necessary to implement the prescription drug importation provisions s 242hr 380 provides for both exporter and commercial importer fees designed to cover all costs of the program it links the aggregate total of all fees to the estimated costs of the importation program setting limit of 25 of the total price of drugs imported the secretary would collect from each exporter and importer both flat registration fee and proportional registration fee each individual importer or exporter would pay the latter fee based on the extent of its own activity and calculated to estimate its proportion of the aggregate amount s 242hr 380 would require that these fees be used only for the administration of the importation provisions that the bill would add crs6 effective dates current law does not specify when importation could begin other than by linking it to required safety and cost certification by the secretary it directs the secretary to exercise discretion to permit importation by an individual for personal use if it does not appear to present an unreasonable risk to the individual s 242hr 380 would require that the secretary promulgate final rule for implementing the importation provisions not later than one year after promulgating an interim rule it also states that the importation provisions shall permit the importation of qualifying drugs without regard to the status of the issuance of implementing regulations from registered exporters to individuals in the united states 90 days after enactment and from permitted countries by registered importers commercial one year after enactment severability s 242hr 380 states that if any provision of the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act of 2007 were to be held unconstitutional the remainder of the act would not be affected crs reports on prescription drug importation
