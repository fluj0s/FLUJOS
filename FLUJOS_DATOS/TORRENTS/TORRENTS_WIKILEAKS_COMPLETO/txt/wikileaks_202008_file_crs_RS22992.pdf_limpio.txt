national government government and finance division summary procedures governing replacement of pres ident or vice presidentelect during the transition period depend on when the events that might lead to temporary or permanent replacement occur at the general electi on voters choose members of the electoral college which formally selects the president and vice president several weeks later between election day and the electors meeting the two major political parties rules provide that replacement candidates woul d be chosen by their national committees should vacancies occur most authorities agree that the president and vice president elect will have been chosen once the electoral votes are cast on december 15 2008 the electoral votes are c ounted and declared when congress meets in joint session for this purpose on january 8 2009 during this pe riod between december 15 and the january 20 inauguration if the presidentelect dies the vice presidentelect becomes president elect under the 20th amendment to the constitution although the 20th amendment does not specifically address questions of disability or resignation by president or vice presidentelect the words failure to qualify found in the amendment might arguably be interpreted to cover such contingencies while the 20th amendment does not address vacancies in the position of vi ce presidentelect these would be covered after the inauguration by the 25th amendment in the event person qualifies as president or vice president then the pr esidential succession act 61 stat 380 3 usc 19 would apply the speaker of the house of representatives the president pro tempore of the senate and duly confirmed cabinet officers in that order would act as president since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 observers have expressed concern that an attack during the presidential inauguration ceremony might lead to the death or disability of most or all officials in the line of presidential succession this concern takes particular note of the fact that ther are generally few if any duly confirmed cabinet members at that time one potential remedy for this situation would be for an official in the line of succession to be abse nt from the ceremony another might be for cabinet secretary from the outgoing administration to remain in office until after the inauguration alternatively cabinet secretarydesignate of the new administration might be nominated by the incumbent president confirmed by the senate and installed prior to the inauguration either action w ould avoid gap in the line of presidential succession under these circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22992crs2 1 the electors shall meet and give their votes on the first monday after the second wednesday in december next

succession between the popular election and the inauguration hearing 103rd cong 2nd sess february 2 1994 was hington gpo 1995 pp 1213introduction presidential transitions in the past halfcen tury have generally been characterized by high levels of activity and frequent improvisation as the presidentelects team works to finalize personnel and policy rrangements for the incoming administration within period of just over ten weeks the proce ss takes on further significance and complexity when new president replaces retiring incumbent and political party control of the executive branch also changes succession and disability procedures cerning the presidentelect and vice presidentelect provide potential complicatin g factor during the transition period they are based on combination of political party rules federal law and constitutional provisions different elements of which apply during three distinct periods in the transition period depending on circumstances congress could be called on to make decisions of national importance in questions of either the death or disability of president or vice presidentelect succession between the popular election and the meeting of the electoral college the first period in which succession proce dures would be invoked in the event presidentelect or vice presidentelect were to die or leave the ticket for any reason includes the time between the election and the date on which the electors meet in december to cast their votes in 2008 th electors will meet on december 151 most commentators suggest that in this case th political parties would follow their long established rules by which their national committees designate substitute nominee2 in the event of the presidential nominees death it might be assumed that the vice presidential nominee would be chosen but neither of the major parties requires this in its rules further it is assumed that the electors who are predominantly party loyalists would abide by the national partys decisi ons given the unprecedented nature of such situation however confusi on controversy and breakdow n of party discipline among the members of the electoral college might also arise leading to fragmentation of the electoral vote3 for instance an individual elector or group of electors might justifiably argue that they were nominated and elected to vote for particular candidate that the death or withdrawal of that candidate rel eased them from any prior obligation and that they were henceforth free agents able to vote for any candidate they chosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22992crs3 4 us congress house of representatives counting electoral votes proceedings and debates of congress relating to counting the electoral votes for president and

succession between the popular election and the inauguration pp 3940 7 ibid p 12the historical record does not provide mu ch guidance as to this situation horace greeley the 1872 presidential nominee of the mocratic and libera l republican parties died on november 29 of that year several w eeks after the november 5 election day as it happened 63 of the 66 greeley electors vot ed for other candidates and congress declined to count the three cast for greeley on the grounds that elect oral votes for dead person were invalid4 even so the question as to the validity of the greeley electoral votes was of little concern since the stalwar t or regular republican nominee ulysses s grant had won the election in landslide gaining 286 electoral votes succession between the electoral college vote and the electoral vote count by congress the second period in which succession pro cedures would be invoked in the event presidentelect or vice presidentelect were to die or leave the ticket includes the time between the meeting of the state electoral college delegations5 when the electoral votes are cast december 15 2008 and the date on which congress count s and certifies the votes january 8 2009 the succession pro cess during this period would turn on the issue of when the candidates who received an electoral vote majority actually become presidentelect and vice presidentelect the results of the electoral college are publicly known but are the candidates who won major ity of electoral vot actually elect at this point or do they attain this position only after the electoral college returns have been counted and declared by congress on january 8 some commentators doubt that there would be president and vicepresidentelect before the results are certified they maintain that this contingency would lack clear constitutional or statutory direction6 others however assert that once majority of electoral votes has been cast the winning candidates immediately become the president and vice presidentelect even though the votes have yet to be officially counted or the results declared7 if this is the case then section 3 of the 20th amendment would apply as soon as the electoral votes were cast namely if the presidentelect dies then the vice presidentelect becomes the presidentelect this point of view receives strong suppor t from the language of the 1932 house committee report accompanying the 20th amendment addressing the question of when there is presidentelect the report states it will be noted that the committee uses th term president elect in its generally accepted sense as meaning the person who has received the majority of electoral votes or the person who has been chosen by the house of representatives in the event that the election is thrown into the house it is immaterial whether or not the voteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22992crs4 8 us congress house proposing an amendment to the constitution of the united states report to

or if the president elect shall have failed to qualify then the vice president elect shall act as presid ent until president shall have qualifiedhave been counted for the person becomes the president elect as soon as the votes are cast8 the 20th amendment is however silent on such questions as disability of the president or vice presidentelect or their resignation during this period succession between the electoral vote count and inauguration during this third period provisions of the 20th amendment would cover several aspects of succession as mentione d previously section 3 of the 20th amendment provides for succession in the case of the death of the presidentelect providing that the vice presidentelect becomes presidentelect further vice presidentelect who succeeds under these circ umstances would have the authority after his or her inauguration to nominate re placement vice president under the provisions of section 2 of the 25th amendment moving beyond death of presidentelect the 20th amendment does not appear to specifically cover such other circumstances as resignation from the ticket disability or disqualification of either the president or vi ce presidentelect in the case of president elect however if the language of the am endment were interpreted so that the aforementioned circumstances constituted failure to qualify then the vice president elect would act as president til president sha ll have qualified9 under this construction vice presidentel ect might act as president until disabled presidentelect regained health or if the presidentelect resigned from the ticket failed to regain health or subsequently died from the effects of disability the vice president might act for full fouryear term the death disability or departure of the vice presidentelect is not specifically covered by the 20th amendment but in this circumstance the president would nominate successor after being inaugurated again in accordance with section 2 of the 25th amendment finally the 20th amendment empowers congress to provide by law for instances in which neither president elect nor vice president elect shall have qualified such legislation would declare who shall then act as president or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected and such person shall act accordingly until president or vice president shall have qualified the presidentia l succession act of 1947 the succession act as amended 61 stat 380 3 usc 19 implements this authority providing that if by reason of death re signation removal from office inability or failure to qualify emphasis added there is neither president nor vice president to discharge the powers and duties of the office of president then the speaker of the house of representatives shall upon his

consult crs report rl34692 presidential succession perspectives analysis and proposed 110th congress legislation by thomas h neale 11 under the succession act the president pro mpore of the senate would like the speaker have to resign from the presidency pro tempore and the senate in order to act as president similarly the cabinet appointment of any cretary of an executive department acting as president would be automatically vacated 3 usc 19d3 12 3 usc 19d2 for instance if the presid ent pro tempore of the senate were serving he or she could be superseded if the speaker of the house qualified for the position 13 alan fram four to miss bush speech du to security ap online january 21 2004 available at httpwwwhig hbeamcomdoc1p189589949htmlcongress act as president10 the act further extends the order of succession to the president pro tempore of the senate and the secretaries of the principal executive departments the pr esidents cabinet11 it should be noted that persons acting as president under the succession act would c ontinue to do so only until qualified individual higher in the order of succession is able to act in this instance the higher qualified official then supplants the lower12 concern about succession during the tran sition period has increased since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and centers primarily on presidential succession under the succession act what might happen in the event of mass terrorist attack during or shortly after the presidential inaugura l while there would be president vice president speaker and president pro tempor during this period who would step forward in the event an attack removed these officials this question takes on additional importance since the cabinet an important ement in the order of succession is generally in state of transition at this time the previous administrations officers have almost always resigned by january 20 while the incoming administrations designees are usually in the midst of the confirmation process further only cabinet officers who hold regular appointments and have been conf irmed by the senate are eligib to act as president under the succession act it is possible to envisi on situation in which not single cabinet officer in the incoming administration will have been confirmed by the senate under these circumstances thus leaving ccession an open issue should the speaker and the president pro tempore also be unavailable one option to avoid this potential situation would be for some official or officials in the line of presidential succession not to attend the presidential inauguration ceremony the presidents state of the union message to joint sessions of congress offers precedent in this case for r easons of security one member of the presidents cabinet has not attended this event for many years th is practice took on additional urgency following the terrorist attacks of 2001 and it is widely assumed that since that time the designated survivor has been conducted to secure locati on in order to guarantee continuity in the executive branch in the interest of legislative branch continuity beginning at least in 2004 congress has similarly designated one or more senators and representatives usually representing both political parties who do not attend the state of the union session13 two additional remedies could eliminate the possibility of gap in the line of presidential succession under thes circumstances first one or more incumbent cabinethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22992crs6 14 here too the secretary would arguably av oid being present at the inaugural ceremony 15 michael d shear and ann scott thompson gates said to be near deal to keep post washington post november 26 2008 p a1 a10officers of the outgoing administration might be retained in office and away from the inaugural ceremonies at least until after the president and vicepresident elect have been safely installed alternatively one or more cabinet officers of the incoming administration could be nominated by the in cumbent president confirmed and installed in office before the january 20 inauguration14 one advantage conferred by these related proposals would center on the fact that cabinet secretaries unlike elected officials do not serve set terms of office which expire on date certain further while the presidentelect cannot submit cabinet nominations until assumin g office there is legal impediment to prevent the outgoing incumbent from submitting any or all of his successors nominations to the senate after it convenes at the opening of the new congress wh ich assembles on january 6 2009 both the retention of incumbent secretaries pending senate confirmation of their successors or preinaugural nomination nd confirmation of one or more cabinet secretaries of the incoming administration w ould depend on high levels of good will and cooperation between the incumbent president and his successor and between the political parties in the senate moreover the latter option would arguably impose sizeable volume of confirmationrelate d business on the newlysworn senate and possibly the senate in the previous congress during the tenweek transition period recent press accounts suggest that incumbent secretary of defense robert m gates may be retained in his position for an inde finite period following the inauguration of president barack h obama on january 20 200915 while it is not known whether succession concerns had any role in this re ported decision secretar gatess continuance in office and his absence from the inauguration ceremony would arguably meet some of the concerns expressed earlier in this report
