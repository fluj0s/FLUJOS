threats to children from pollutants in the ambient environment moved the us congress to legislate president clinton to issue an executive order and the us environmental protection agency epa to establish new office aimed at enhancing childrens environmental protections in the 107th congress legislative proposals have been introduced that would extend these protections this report summarizes and analyzes the scientific basis for concerns about childrens environmental health risks from chemical s in the ambient environment and discusses alternative federal policy responses that have been proposed at the request of the senate committee on environment and public works crs elicited expert assistance from scientist s to consider the weight of scientific evidence regarding childrens environmental risks and policy experts to propose possible federal policy options crs convened an allday seminar on may 22 2000 at which authors presented draft papers and experts representing wide range of viewpoints critiqued them addressing scientific papers in the morning and policy papers in the afternoon the seminar and the commissioned papers were supported in part by grant from the robert wood johnson foundation based on these papers and discussions crs constructed consensus statements and submitted them to participating experts for review and comment this crs report briefly summarizes the papers lists the consensus statements draws conclusions and identifies issues for legislators concerns about childrens exposure to chemicals in the environment appear to be based at least in part on scientific data and studies the science indicates that there may be increased risks to children but that the extent and significance of those risks are unknown because data on chemical toxicity and exposure particularly with respect to children are very limited given this relatively sparse scientific basis for making general policy decisions policy analysts representing broad spectrum of political philosophies support additional federal funding for toxicological and risk assessment research beyond research and monitoring policy preferences of experts diverge the arguments for and against each policy approach are difficult to follow and analyze in part due to the shifting definitions used by advocates key factor in the debate is how individuals experts and nonexperts weigh risk estimates based on available scientific information against their personal and societal values policy preferences also depend on political philosophies members of the 107th congress have introduced proposals to increase funding for data collection and analysis that may be relatively uncontroversial the outlook for proposals that go beyond research is less certain provisions that target specific contaminant eg wood preservatives used in childrens playground equipment may be enacted in evaluating broader proposals congress will likely consider the adequacy of scientific evidence demonstrating need for legislation as well as the value of the potential outcomes good and bad of choosing to act in the current legislative session or to wait for additional evidence this report will not be updated since it summarizes specific set of scientific and policy papershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322contents background 1 issue development 1 the crs seminar on the

13 appendix summary of recent congressional and administrative activities concerned with environmental risks to childrens health 14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322childrens environmental health what role for the federal government background issue development the middle to late 1990s saw flurry of federal legislative and administrative activity concerned with environmental risks to childrens health for example three major environmental statutes the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca and the safe drinking water act sdwa were amended to address risks to children new office of childrens health protection was established at the us environmental protection agency epa and president clinton issued executive order 13045 establishing an interagency task force to identify strategies for better protecting childrens environmental health and safety selected key activities are described in appendix in the 107th congress policymakers are asking do us children need more federal protection from environmental pollution and do our other environmental laws need to be more protective of children although few doubt that children are potentially more vulnerable than adults to certain environmental hazards such as lead poisoning skeptics question the need for increased federal efforts to protect children from most environmental contamination sometimes because the risks appear small and uncertain relative to other health risks in childhood such as risks of poisoning or falling or perhaps because the homes playground s and other places where children are most likely to be exposed to chemicals traditionally have been regulated at the local or state level others question the statutory authority or competence of epa for addressing hazards that they believe might be handled better by public health practitioners or perhaps housing specialists rather than by federal environmental protection specialists on the other hand many children advocate groups argue for stronger environmental laws and believe that environmental regulations should provide greater child protection in all program areas not just for pesticides and drinking water the crs seminar on the issue this report summarizes and analyzes the scientific basis for concerns about childrens environmental health risks from chemicals in the ambient environment and discusses alternative federal policy responses that have been proposed because the scientific and policy issues involving childrens environmental health are complex this crs analysis is based in large part on papers prepared by outside experts in fields related to childrens environmental health and on critiques of those papers presented at crs seminar by peer reviewers representing range of viewpoints the seminar was held at the request of the senate committee on environment and public works four knowledgeable pediatricians and research scientists prepared scholarly papers exploring the scientific research basis for assessing potential environmental health threats to children in addition four policy experts authored papers evaluating federal policy opportunities with respect to suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs2 risks critiques of the eight papers were prepared by other pediatricians toxicologists epidemiologists and environmental or public health scientists and policy experts representing range of informed viewpoints highlights of the papers and critiques were presented and discussed at an allday crs seminar held may 22 2000 scientific papers were presented in the morning session policy papers in the afternoon following the seminar authors revised their papers to address comments by peer reviewers and points raised during the discussions crs analyzed the final papers and discussions to identify points of consensus and dissent constructed consensus statements and submitted them to all experts for review and comment the final consensus statements summarize the conclusions of scientists with regard to each of the four scientific topics and of policy experts regarding federal policy options project scope because congressional interest has centered on perceived threats to childrens health from pollutants in the ambient environment air soil water and food and on the role of epa in managing them crs attempted to focus the papers and discussions on narrow definition of environmental so as to exclude consideration of potential hazards over which epa has little authority because they are not in outdoor air water or soil however the pediatricians and other public health professionals who participated in the crs project occasionally blurred the boundary between the broader public health and narrower project definitions experts concerns about particular health trends among children for example cancer and asthma incidence prompted crs to broaden the definition of environmental hazards to include indoor air pollutants eg environmental tobacco smoke particulate matter from use of gas stove or pesticides used indoors nevertheless the definition of environmental used in this report is narrower than the traditional public health definition public health professionals use environmental hazard to refer to any factor that is not genetic ie inherited including infection by pathogen s accidents of all kinds and socalled lifestyle factors like diet exercise violence smoking and drug use as well as exposure to pollution indoors and out state of the science the state of scientific knowledge about childrens environmental health risks in the ambient environme nt as reviewed by four scientists is summarized below following each summary is list of crsdeveloped consensus statements relevant to each topic based on the papers and ensuing seminar discussions seminar participants were given the opportunity to review and comment on the statements men are from mars women are from venus and children are from pluto pediatric environmental health by dr ruth etzel the first scientific paper was authored by ruth etzel md phd pediatrician and epidemi ologist who is captain in the us public health service in washington dc she is the immediate past chairperson of the american academy of pediatrics aap committee on environmental health and the editor of the aap handbook of pediatric environmental health dr etzel began by explaining how and whyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs3 1the word developmental is used throughout this document it is defined in dr mattisons paper as related to the process of growth and maturation from an immature to more mature stage 2infant refers to child from birth through one year of agechildrens environmental health risks are different from those of adults she noted that children may be exposed differently to pollutants children may absorb pollutants differently children have higher rate of metabolism and children have windows of vulnerability while they are growing and developing when their target organs may be more susceptible than the target organs of adults dr etzel summarized developmental stages and illustrative environmental health risks that occur during each stage1 to address the question of how environmental health risks compare to other health risks for children dr etzel discussed the five leading causes of death among infants less than one year2 children between 1 and 4 years children between 5 and 9 years children between 10 and 14 years and children 15 to 19 years changes over time in these risks also were discussed she concluded that with respect to childhood mortality environmental health risks have been greatest during pregnancy and during the first year of life estimates of the proportion of infant deaths that might be due to environmental causes dr etzel noted vary between 5 and 40 if one assumes that the lower estimate is accurate then 1424 infant deaths 5 of 28488 infant deaths would be attributed to environmental causes she explained however she emphasized that mortality is poor indicator to use when assessing how environmental risks compare to other health risks for children because most environmental health risks do not result in deaths among children but in illnesses and disabilities which are not routinely tracked scientists who participated in the discussion of dr etzels paper at the crs seminar generally agreed on the following points as group childrens environmental health risks differ from those of adults the differences may be large and may go in either direction differences in exposure and vulnerability to health effects among individual children may be less than equal to or greater than differences among groups of children at different stages of development prenatal perinatal infant toddler preteen and adolescent or than between children as group and adults as group children differ from adults in exposure to potentially toxic chemicals in the environment their absorption and metabolism of such chemicals and their susceptibility to harmful effects some of these differences arise from differences in behavior for example drooling and mouthing objects or crawling physical size maturity of organs or physiological processes or presence in different environments eg in utero occupational recreationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs4 3developmental neurotoxicity is the capability of causing damage to the growth structure or function of the nervous system of an embryo or fetus either before or after birth up to the time of sexual maturation or educational socioeconomic conditions health and nutritional status genes and access to medical care mediate environmental health effects childrens biological exposure from chemical contamina nts in the air some foods and water may be greater than that of adults in the same environment because children breath more eat more and drink more relative to their size and the skin of newborn child may absorb more pound for pound children experience periods of special vulnerability to some toxic effects of some chemicals as their organs develop some of these vulnerable periods are quite extended although us death rates due to childhood exposure to environmental contamination are not known they should be viewed in the context of known causes of death which vary depending on age us death rates might not be the best basis for comparing health risks to children some measure of illness or disability would be useful if data were available do we know which environmental pollutants pose special health risk to children case studies of lead pcbs and methyl mercury by dr lynn goldman lynn goldman md professor at johns hopkins school of hygiene and public health prepared the second paper as the former assistant administrator of the office of prevention pesticides and toxic substances at the environmental protection agency she has broad knowledge of the range of chemicals regulated by the federal government dr goldman gave an overview of the chemicals and pesticides on the market today and the information available about them to assess risks to children her points were illustrated by case studies of lead mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs she concluded that children may be more susceptible than adults to chemicals in the environment and that scientists now recognize need to gather childspecific data dr goldman and the other scientists who participated in the discussion of dr goldmans paper at the crs seminar generally agreed on the following points informa tion about the potential toxicity to children of chemicals in us commerce is very limited and usually based on indirect measures there are few experimental data related to developmental neurotoxicity3 data on childrens exposure to chemicals including prescription drugs remain sparse data on childhood exposure to lead in the united states provide sound basis for risk assessments lead exposure in children can lead to iq deficits impaired school performance distractability short attention spans and impulsive behavior even when data clearly establish the toxicity of chemical to children such as the toxicity of methyl mercury to developing brains exposure data for us children are lacking epidemiological studies suggest that small proportion of us infants may be at risk due to prenatal exposure to methyl mercuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs5 new data are being collected by industry and government to improve estimates of exposure and toxicity to us children of pesticides some pediatric drugs and methyl mercury chemicals like lead and methyl mercury that are toxic to nervous tissue in similar ways in children and adults are more likely to harm young children whose brains are still developing than adults given comparab levels of exposure where data exist on other chemicals they are not always well exploited for example data gathered by the food and drug administration fda and epa as part of product registration application have not been used extensively to develop models for predicting toxicity of unstudied chemicals often because access to such data is restricted to protect confidential business information cbi also known as trade secret claims how do we know chemical can produce birth defect by dr donald r mattison donald mattison md msc is the medical director of the march of dimes in the third scientific paper he summarized the state of knowledge about birth defects and other adverse effects on growth and development to illustrate his answer to the question do environmental exposures to pollutants increase the rates of adverse health outcomes birth defects are the leading cause of death among infants and the second leading cause of death among children generally after motor vehicle accidents about 150000 babies are born each year with birth defects at rate of 35714 per million births about 1 in 28 yet the causes of many birth defects are poorly understood according to dr mattison he described major difficulties encountered by scientists studying birth defects and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of various kinds of data scientists who participated in the discussion of dr mattisons paper at the crs seminar generally agreed on the following points exposure during development to certain chemicals at toxic levels may cause death structural abnormality altered growth or functional deficits some effects may take years to be evident while others may be immediate short lived and reversible increased probability of premature birth also might be an effect of toxic exposure for most chemicals it is not known whether adverse health effects might result from prenatal infant or childhood exposure to low levels in the environment the causes of most significant health problems in infants and children for example some birth defects and asthma are only partially understood the overall infant mortality rate and the rate of infant deaths due to birth defects have fallen significa ntly in recent years nevertheless the united states has higher rate of infant mortality than 25 other nations birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the united states birth defects most commonly affect the cardiovascular system respiratory system chromosomes and nervous system in that order premature birth is the second most common cause of infant mortality and the number of preterm births has increased slightly in recent years estimates of the percentage of all birth defects that may be caused at least in part by environmental factors including smoking and alcohol use vary widely from about 3 to as much as 75 more recent estimates are on the higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs6 4a teratogen is chemical physical or biological agent that causes birth defectsend of this range individual susceptibility to environmental pollutants may often be determined genetically all known human developmental toxicants cause developmental disease in at least one species of experimental animals animal tests for effects on development often are accurate predictors of human developmental toxicity there is indication that background ambient levels of teratogens in the air water or soil have caused human birth defects in the united states4 there is limited evidence that birth defects have increased in the vicinity of some contaminated industrial sites asthma rates have been rising in the united states for 30 years but scientists do not know why public health surveillance of asthma morbidity and other disorders in children is needed it is not clear whether the observed increase between 1973 and 1994 in rates of some types of childhood brain tumors indicates real increase in cases or improved medical technologies generally it is not clear whether cancer rates in children are rising pesticides and childhood brain cancer review and perspective by dr andrew f olshan andrew olshan phd is professor in the department of epidemiology school of public health at the university of north carolina his paper examining the state of research on childrens environmental health is the fourth and final scientific paper dr olshan used his own research on the relationship between brain cancer in children and pesticide exposure to portray the more general issues in childrens environmental health research scientists who participated in the discussion of dr olshans paper at the crs seminar generally agreed on the following points the environmental factors that might increase childhood cancer rates generally are not known with few exceptions most notably ionizing radiation large increase is needed in chemical testing to support risk assessments for potential health effects in children due to environmental exposure to chemicals better chemical exposure data are needed for parents and children currently most studies estimate pesticide exposure levels for all pesticides as group rather than for particular products and estimates almost always are based on indirect measures of uncertain validity although data on pesticide exposure are limited some believe that home lawn and garden uses of pesticides may be larger sources of pesticide exposure to most parents and children than agriculture the biologic mechanisms by which pesticide exposure might lead to cancer in children remain speculative and should be investigated the totality of epidemiologi c evidence is not sufficient to conclude causal association of pesticide exposure and brain cancers though the data are suggestive httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs7 5according to the genomics lexicon toxicogenomics is an emerging scientific discipline that combines genomics the study of genes and their function and bioinformatics the management and analysis of biologic research data using advanced computing techniques to identify and describe the ways that chemical molecules affect and are affected by human bodies the lexicon may be viewed at http209525628lexiconindexhtml 6structureactivity relationships refers to the study of how molecular structure relates to functionthere is need for much more screening of chemicals for environmental risks to childrens health new research methods including toxicogenomics and bioinformatics should be developed to screen chemicals5 research should take into account the effects of age at exposure timing and duration of chemical exposure there is need for better experimental data on the health effects of pesticides on offspring of laboratory animals new methods are needed for toxicological testing and for evaluating existing databases especially for factors that determine toxicity allergenicity and non cancer endpoints like developmental immunology structureactivity relationsh ips sar among chemicals might be used to evaluate absorption distribution metabolism and interaction with cells but need remains for new animal strains suitable for testing6 selected policy options the four policy papers and key points raised during their discussion are summarized below crsconstructed consensus statements based on the policy discussion follow seminar participants were given the opportunity to review and comment on the statements placing childrens environmental health risks in perspective by dr kenneth chilton kenneth chilton phd presented the first policy paper in the afternoon session of the crs seminar on may 22 2000 dr chilton distinguished senior fellow and manager of environmental research at the center for the study of american business at washington university in st louis missouri argued that environmental risks to childrens health are not large relative to other risks and were exaggerated by the clinton administration he expressed concern that this exaggerati on might distort priorities in public health programs diverting public resources away from programs targeting greater risks he urged restraint in public resource allocations and in public communication about childrens environmental health risks tempering pronouncements about risks with acknowledgments of any associated benefits that may justify risks dr chilton described current federal research efforts on childrens environmental health risks as considerable and adequate he would broaden or rescind president clintons executive order 13045 which mandates development of childcentered programs environmental protection legislation dr chilton stated should be written to include consideration of costs benefits and other risks when regulating environmental contaminants finally dr chilton recommended that broadly focused public health agency rather than epa should lead any childrens environmental health initiative on the part of the federal government thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs8 7the food quality protection act of 1996 amended the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra and the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca to enhance safety for children exposed to pesticidesarrangement would be more likely to preserve an appropriate balance among programs devoted to various risks according to dr chilton the role of the federal government in protecting childrens environmental health by daniel swartz rabbi daniel swartz executive director of the childrens environmental health network cehn emphasized the importance of social ethical and political values in addition to biological and economic factors in determining what federal policies should be with respect to childrens environmental health particularly in light of the uncertainty of scientific estimates of risk he argued that equity liberty and justice are values americans hold in common he expressed preference for policies aimed at prevention as opposed to treatment after exposure reductions in poverty should be pursued along with reduced environmental hazards according to the rabbi he admired the example set by the food quality protectio n act standard for protecting children in which pesticides are not assumed to be completely safe for children but are not assumed to be dangerous at all levels in all circumstances either data drive the decision whether to provide an extra margin of precaution in standard setting7 rabbi swartz provided several suggestions for federal action to protect childrens environmental health including more protective standard setting consideration of cumulative and aggregate risks to children in risk assessments and rule development development of national monitoring and research strategies establishment of broad parental right to know about potential risks to their children better intragovernmental and intergovernmental coordination of relevant programs support for moral code that protects children and responsible behavior with respect to children finally rabbi swartz warned of the limitations of economic analyses and advised the federal government to revise economic assumptions that he alleged are incompatible with protection of childrens environmental health rabbi swartz said he favored retaining and supporting the executive order on childrens environmental health establishing white house council on childrens environmental health and safety and employing whatever means are appropriate at the federal level to achieve protection of childrens health including regulation voluntary programs grants demonstration programs outreach and education and legislation navigat ing the maze federal activities to address childrens environmental health risks by dr kimberly m thompson kimberly thompson scd assistant professor of risk analysis and decision science at harvard universitys school of public health gave the third policy paper dr thompson provided an overview of the recent history of federal agency involvement in childrens health issues she argued that the focus of recent initiatives on childrens environmental health with heavy focus on chemicals failed to recognize or address the most significant risks to childrens health such as poverty accidents and violence however she noted the lack of data that would permit relative risk assessment she summarized research needs identified by various workgroups in recent years the federal government should evaluate and address environmental risks she urged inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs9 light of more certain risks of equal or greater magnitude such as children s risk of dying in automobile accidents gun violence and child abuse she argued that both exposure to and toxicity of chemicals in the environment must be assessed chemical bychemical because the quality and quantity of health effects are variable dr thompson concluded that sparse data do not provide solid scientific basis for rulemaking with respect to childrens environmental health risks due to pollution she urged policy makers and researchers to clearly define terms identify inequities and target policies to relatively high risks the role of the federal government should be to coordinate programs concerned with child welfare address childrens health issues of national or international scope support medical and public health research regulate multinational industries provide resources to meet childrens needs and monitor childrens health according to dr thompson she questioned our national commitment to improve childrens health however and expressed special concern about the health of uninsured children and the congressional failure to ratify the international convention on the rights of the child dr thompson stated that federal support and oversight is needed for traditional local public health programs such as immunization and food stamp programs and she argued that more analytic approach is needed to ensure accountability and efficient use of federal resources available for childrens health programs prerequisite to analysis she claimed is more transparency in how resources are allocated to research and risk management programs dr thompson criticized policy decisions that failed to consider tradeoffs among risks and benefits and she concluded that future research should collect data on costs and benefits of alternative risk management policies as well as information needed to put environmental risks in perspective the role of the federal government in protecting childr ens environmental health by dr richard j jackson richard jackson md mph director of the national center for environmental health at the centers for disease control and prevention cdc contributed the final major paper in which he argued that federal responses to chemical risks historically have been delayed pending data collection and analysis resulting in unnecessary suffering and permanent disabilities he urged vigorous enforcement of existing regulations and aggressive promulgation of childcentered sciencebased preventionoriented environmenta l health and safety policies that protect children now and in the future the special role of the federal government should include public health surveillance data collection and analysis and development of national goals for child health he stated much more funding for research is needed dr jackson claimed in order to fully understand the health effects resulting from exposures to environmental toxicants particularly when those health effects appear only many years after exposure dr jackson praised the food quality protection act provision mandating addition of up to 10fold safety factor to federal standards limiting pesticide residue levels on food eaten by children he argued that the fqpa forces manufacturers of pesticide products to prove their safety an approach which he favored swift implementation of the fqpa provisions is needed he said he also urged continued and increased funding for the interagency task force on childrens environmental health httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs10 discussion discussants raised number of issues for example dr trudy cameron professor of economics at the university of california at angeles noted that the policy papers all seemed to recommend selection of measurable public health goals prior to decisions about how to allocate federal resources dr cameron argued that the federal government should intervene to manage the availability of public goods like health protection because preventive measures in particular are unlikely to attract much private investment many speakers expressed concern about focus on mortality when illnesses are so much more prevalent in children moreover it was noted that defining childrens risk in terms of deaths during childhood would miss any increase in death rates during the adult years due to childhood exposure to environmental contaminants dr james wilson senior fellow at resources for the future stated that most federal laws governing chemicals and the environment protect women of childbearing age and children making additional chemical regulations unnecessary he opined that the key lesson of the seminar was that the effect of poverty on the environment of children is more significant problem than environmental pollution ms karen florini senior attorney with environmental defense argued that the united states is rich enough to be both safe and healthy that is to address injuries as well as environmental risks to children what she termed lack of political will to address poverty guns and smoking does not excuse delays in addressing environmental health hazards for which political will does exist she said in addition ms florini claimed that at least some progress in reducing environmental risks to children may be relatively inexpensive or even profitable for the regulated industries ms florini added that data are too sparse to rule out childrens exposures to environmental chemicals as causes of chronic diseases in adulthood until data can be collecte d she urged use of conservative protective assumptions to fill in any scientific gaps ms sandra tirey an assistant vice president of the chemical manufacturers association now the american chemistry council suggested that key role for the federal government should be in communicating accurate childrens health risk information to the general public she also favored federal incentives for collaboration among government academic industry and other stakeholder interests the ultimate purpose of research sponsored by the federal government seemed to be at issue according to mr jim ohara formerly with the food and drug administration and now directing healthtrack project supported by the pew charitable trusts through grant to georgetown university he noted that some policy advocates want research to inform regulations while others seem to see research only as tool to inform the public he urged integration of public health and environmental protection approaches in federal policies areas of consensus convergence rather than divergence of opinion is evident among the authors and discussants of policy papers authors seemed unanimously to favor governmental action in the form of research the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs11 8participants wanted to go beyond the narrow measure of mortality to include other adverse conditions of health they discussed the advantages and disadvantages of various health benefit measures in use today such as lives saved lifeyears saved qualityadjusted lifeyears qalys saved and disabilityadjusted lifeyears dalys saved but disagreed about their measurability and utility statements of consensus on possible federal approaches were approved by participants in the may 22 2000 seminar the federal government should identify research priorities and conduct and sponsor basic medical biological environmental and public health research to improve scientific understanding of childrens health and development the federal government should organize fund and evaluate monitoring programs to collect data on chemicals in the environment childrens health trends and childrens exposure to chemicals the federal government should help shape manage and support public health infrastructure capable of preventing and responding to significant childrens environmental health risks with special attention to children with limited access to medical care federal policies should recognize that economic status environment and health interact and that diseases usually are caused by confluence of genetic and environmental factors and federal policies for research and risk management related to childrens health should recognize the significance of morbidity ie illness and disability although satisfactory metric is available for quantitative comparisons8 conclusions concerns about childrens exposure to chemicals in the environment appear to be based at least in part on scientifically based knowledge of past experience with toxic chemicals and adverse effects of exposure to them in the environment the science indicates that there may be increased risks to children but that the extent and significance of those risks are unknown because data on chemical toxicity and exposure particularly with respect to children are limited and do not permit generalizations about the risks to children that may be posed by the universe of chemicals it is possible that the relative toxicity and exposure of children to toxic chemicals in the environment may be greater relative to adult exposure on average or for most chemicals on the other hand greater health risks to children have been found for environmental exposure to lead and research demonstrates potentially greater toxicity to children if they are exposed to high enough levels of other pollutants like pcbs and mercury given this relatively weak scientific basis for making policy decisions analysts representing broad spectrum of political philosophies support additional federal funding for toxicological and risk assessment research new methods of data analysis appear promising as tools to maximize the informative value of data collected by various programs and agencies scientists and policy experts also endorse greater commitment to monitoring of environmental contamination and of human exposurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs12 especially childrens exposure to chemicals in the environment improved assessments of childrens environmental health risks depend on such data collection efforts beyond research and monitoring policy preferences of these experts diverge despite common understanding of available scientific evidence the arguments for and against each policy approach are difficult to follow and analyze in part due to the shifting context of the discussion policy advocates employ diverse definitions of terms like environmental children and risk and compare different sets of hazards and different measures of risk for example some advocates for more active federal role in protecting children from environmental risks define environmental to include microbiological hazards in buildings and risk to encompass rates of illness and potential irreversibility of some health effects as well as probabilities of death these might argue that many or even most risks are due to geneenvironment interactions on the other hand those who maintain that environmental risks are small relative to other childhood hazards sometimes compare mortality rates attributed to chemical exposure to risks from deaths attributed to accidents and other physical and biological hazards which can also be considered environmental in the broadest public health sense that is they are not determined by individuals genetic makeup for the purposes of this report and the project on which it is based policy arguments about risks due to environmental exposures to chemical pollutants are distinguished from arguments about risks due to other environmental influences on health such as poor nutrition illicit drug use automobile accidents or inadequate medical treatment children is used to refer to infants children and teenagers key factor in the debate which appears to be fundamental is how individuals experts and nonexperts weigh risk estimates based on available scientific information against their personal and societal values for example people disagree about whether chance of increased harm to children justifies increased expenditures or reallocation of resources by government or regulated entities to ensure safety clearly whether or not action is justified depends in part on the likelihood magnitude and severity of harm that is the risk that might occur but there is little agreement even among experts on such questions as how much information is enough to act what sources of information are most reliable the less scientific information that is available the more policy preferences are influenced by value preferences which vary widely moreover factors other than risk may be important considerations with respect to policy preferences policy preferences also depend on political philosophies individuals advocate different policy approac hes depending on what they see as the strengths and weaknesses of federal state and local governments and nongovernmental entities experts argue for wide range of federal policy approaches to childrens environmental health protection some experts are inclined to avoid federal actions that would divert existing resources to further reduce childrens environmental health risks at least until such risks could be better characterized with respect to competing priorities while waiting for scientific evidence allowing better quantification of relative risks policy makers should be targeting resources to reduce recognized health and safety risks to children these experts believe other experts are inclined to increase investments of federal resources to enhance protection of children now forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs13 example by attempting to minimize their exposure to potentially hazardous chemicals through federal pollution prevention incentives or regulations legislative proposals in the 107th congress consensus seems to have emerged that additional research is needed to better understand and evaluate risks to children exposed to chemicals in the environment the 107th congress appears likely to continue full funding for existing programs at epa such as endocrine disruptor screening and pesticide residue tolerance reassessment under the food quality protection act other proposals in the 107th congress would go beyond research some are narrow provisions that target specific contaminant for example provision in senatepassed s 1216 would require an epa report on the safety of childrens playground equipment treated with chromated copper arsenate cca wood preservative the childrens environmental protection act s 855 is much broader bill that would direct epa to ensure that all environmental standards protect children and other vulnerable subpopulations with an adequate margin of safety evaluation of these proposals involves considering the adequacy of scientific evidence demons trating need for legislation as well as the value of the potential outcomes good and bad of choosing to act in the near future or to wait for additional evidence health economic social political and ethical outcomes are few of the key factors to be considered httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31322crs14 appendix summary of recent congressional and administrative activities concerned with environmental risks to childrens health three consecutive congresses enacted legislation targeting environmental health risks to children the 104th congress enacted the food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa in part to better protect children from pesticides to ensure the safety of children the fqpa requires epa review of all pesticide registrations for food uses and standards for pesticide residue levels on food tolerances where there is reason to believe that children might be at greater risk and there are insufficient data to assess risk fqpa directs epa to set standards that are up to 10 times safer than would be required to ensure adult safety amendments to the safe drinking water act in 1996 direct epa in regulating
