6504c13 shspec58 the lowest levels research is not wrapped up new datum has emerged and research is going south lrh is researching power processing it is not surprising that the more one discovers in the upper reaches the more understanding one has of fundamentals that apply to the bottom youve got r6ew that is holding you nicely im putting the capper on the r6 gpm plot r6 has developed into series of starrated processes the first is the method of cleaning up outruds on yourself it is solo ruds process twoterminal auditing is too slow at level vi solo auditing all the gpms on r6 takes about three months at three to four hours per day the end product of this auditing is clear as we knew it in the earliest days reactive bank at all thetan experiences sense of unfamiliarity at this level and he runs into problems like how do you handle body he has to learn to postulate with great rapidity it is condition of too aware he has to get used to reading peoples minds he finds that absolute zero is proper temperature everything else is hot it is in tiny but observable motion and it is bothersome at first he needs refamiliarization he is not quite sure what he can do his framework on whom he must fight changes he can start wondering about his sanity because previously sensible things seem foolish he can also get solutions he can do analyses of situations that were previously blank puzzles the road to ot is one of familiarity clear has trouble trying to reconcile what has been going on in his life with what he is now he is not really able to think very straight about how confused he was sometimes its hard to understand why somebody else is confused for instance try to wrap your wits around some guys saying but we gotta get the republicans back in power you know they are nutty too since you erased your confusion and dont have it around anymore as standard clear is not necessarily very tolerant state but it is not very antagonistic state either its not negative one is far more positive about things than he ever was before his reactions are far more vivid you have to realize that thetan can become aberrated without being implanted or having gpms but what really made him unable was gpms which gave him wrong purposes and smashed him down so that he couldnt have any purpose of his own all his own real purposes are suppressed when you get out into the open your own purposes show up and you start doing what you would like to do not what your bank wants you to do in scientology we have been working with what the thetan wants we only fail with other people when we treat them as other than thetan being all thetans want out even those that are in an insane asylum who fight everybody who comes in the door beings are basically good one reason why the being has consented to have bank is that it prevents everyone else from being bad that is so farfetched that one would ever look for it as the philosophical fundamental in back of the aberration of man there is aberration that thetan can get into based on his ignorance his unfamiliarities his decisions based on data etc scientology is built straight around what might happen to thetan gpms gave him reverse purposes he decided that to keep others and himself good he should have bank to prevent himself and them from being bad the idea was that man is bad and we have to do something to him to make him good so we all have to agree to have bank to keep us from being bad but the bank cut off the thetan from all familiarity with himself as he was the decision to do that to create bank somehow put him into condition where he couldnt conceive of how he had been it was cutoff he is like guy in coal pit who doesnt believe that there is sun or platos cave metaphor in the republic he thinks that what he is in is normal environment he will say look you can see there is sun or light thats proof that was the barrier that made someone unsalvageable before we knew about it as you come up the line your r gets violated by the wog world the higher you get the more your r is susceptible to violation but fortunately the more capable you are of standing up to invalidation it doesnt mean anything to you it is vital that someone improve on gradient since pcs case gain must not outrun his capability of handling the new reality you cant travel the road to truth halfway see the tape 6211c01 shspec207 the road to truth pp 325329 above it is vital that lrh reorganize and perfect organizations now because we are at the makebreak point where it requires hard push at first shifting over to runaway forward motion if we released public book right now we would cave ourselves in the orgs have to be able to expand rapidly before flood of new people hits it we can push the boombutton any time all of sudden lrh made discovery that found the answer to cases that wouldnt run successfully on level 0 power processing there are two levels below level 0 1 conditions processes 2 existence processes existence is below conditions this antiquated the plans for boom so there have been changes there are three conditions processes auditing the case on these belowzero processes is walk in the park however it may take class vi to run them because what flies off the case comes off so fast that the velocity might be too much for coauditor or lowerlevel auditor these processes handle the nocasegain case they were developed to handle cases that lrh had formerly handled with justice and ethics these are the new conditions processes which could be run at any point on case and which have an exact endpoint beyond which they wont run further below the conditions processes is existence processing an existence process is one in which person recognizes something about existence mimicry gets at this sideways having these processes makes it hard to write new public book because they should be included in the discussion but not enough is known about them yet to write about them since the new membership pricing system was created based on the idea of having new public book the pricing is premature which backs it up on the orgs we will get the orgs to back up and get their organization and signup line well in hand look around here and find something really real to you is process at the existence level it was wildcat process from upperlevel tech that belongs at or towards the bottom you get person to find one thing that is really real in the room basic undercutting command might be are you something like that its familiarity without contact or communication and without an awareness of what familiarity is arriving you get the shutoff because as youve gone south youve dropped orientation youve dropped perception communication conditions and youre now in existence that existence must be without any of th other thingsso what is this level called existence how would you audit something without understanding orientation perception communication or the recognition of condition what do we have left we dont know but we will the new organizational plan is going in faster than it has been released you cant keep an org out of it despite its current incompleteness it is big magnet that is trying to take existing departments and put them on it it is unique and it works because it is parallelline org board not vertical org board it operates left and right not up and down one odd characteristic is that each repeating department as you go across the board from left to right has nothing to do with the functions that follow it but includes all of the functions which precede it just try to squeeze into department comfortably some action which follows it on the board to the right you get trouble try to get into the orientation department something about understanding well that has its own departmental functions but the next one to the right is purposes now lets put purposes under understanding in other words were going to have purposes before we have understanding you get mess organizationally or in auditing eg if you try to put something about promotion under understanding why people just sit around and understand that there should be some promotion it was working with the org board that brought to light the lower subzero levels because the org board is not an org board at all its philosophic machine to which an organization is easily adapted its an alldevouring monster anything that comes near it gets changed for the better it gives answers to questions that we have had trouble with before like personnel an ad is kept placed people come in they get hired they work for two weeks with staff hat they go to review etc it all gets done without having to go through any executive an applicant who calls up for job gets call two days later saying come on in he gets metercheck for ta then he is routed through fp to his place of work for two week temporary assignment at the end of which he goes to review and is either kept on or told that he needs more training for the job even if review boots him out he remains an applicant needing some more preparation before he can have the job review also tells the labor exchange about him to see if he can get other employment right away review also has displaced person division to give him meal ticket get him on pe course or coaudit until he can function then he is hired on provisional basis for year review maintains file of these people for periods of crush labor the only way this whole system wont work is if you dont man up the posts this employment system is also great for procurement people come to work and stay to study thus anything that gets near the organization begins to move this new organizational structure improves things for the better whether people like it or not it has to be completed before we release the field staff member program which will give backup to field auditors private practice mds must be wrong since it is failing it takes quite team to process pcs it is possible to process pcs in an organization but not in individual practice suppose you had dissemination technology that would make it so anyone you talked to would immediately become scientologist it exists it is only two or three weeks old not yet released the person who resists and protests it is the easiest to get and if fsms are sending in all sorts of cases even very lowlevel cases the organization must be able to handle them right off the bat all auditors that were ever trained are now to be called fsms the pay is ten percent of the fee of the person you send in center is nucleus of an organization if it moves even vaguely in the direction of an org board it will wind up becoming an organization so fast it wont know what happened there is policy that you cant be retrained for level that you have already obtained this goes along with the policy that checksheet cant be changed once you are on it there are at least twelve levels above level vi and st hill will be teaching those
