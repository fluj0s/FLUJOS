cooperation and development oecd with gross domestic product gdp in 2007 of about 118 billion as indicated in table 1 historically iceland s economy has been based on marine and energy resources more recently iceland has developed strong services sector which accounts for twothirds of the economic output since 2000 iceland has experienced particularly strong growth in its financial services s ector trade accounts for large share of icelands gdp with imports and exports of goods nd services equivalent in value to 46 and 35 respectively of gdp fish and other marine products were icelands

development recent economic activity combination of economic factors over th early to mid2000s led to icelands current economic and banking distress in particular access to easy credit boom in domestic construction that fueled rapid ec onomic growth and broad deregulation of icelands financial sector spurred the banks to expand rapidly abroad and eventually played role in the eventual financial collapse iceland benefitted from favorable global financial conditions that reduced the cost of credit and sweeping liberalization of its domestic financial sector that spurred rapid growth and couraged icelands banks to spread quickly throughout europe in 2004 icelands commercial banks incr eased their activity in the countrys mortgage market by competing directly with the staterun housing financing fund hff which had been the major provider of mortga ge loans in contrast to the housing financing fund the commercial banks began offering loans with lower interest rates longer maturities and higher loan to value ratio also the banks did not require real estate purchase as precondition for loa n which made it possible for homeowners to refinance existing mortgages and to access the equity in their homes for consumption or investment purposes these measures spurred an expansion in credit and caused real estate prices to soar in addition the impr oving economic conditions led to an expansion in consumer spending which resulted in rising inflation and larger trade deficit as further stimulus to the economy the icela ndic government reduced both direct and indirect taxes which provided furt her impetus to consumer spending by 2004 icelands central bank began tigh tening monetary policy by raising interest rates in an attempt to curtail inflationary pressures between 2004 and 2007 the bank raised nominal shortterm interest rates from 5 to 15 the increase in interest rates however was not reflected in the inte rest rates the housing financing fund charged for mortgages as result the comparatively low interest rates charged by the hff pushed up demand for housing which in turn further inflated the price of homes in iceland in addition since the

icelands financial system quickens the new york times october 9 2008equity in home the rising equity values in housing allowed consumers to finance higher level of consumption with the attendant pressure on inflation and interest rates at the same time the higher domestic interest ra tes made bond issues in krona attractive to foreign investors who could borrow abroad at low interest rates which placed upward pressure on the value of the krona and worsened the trade deficit as iceland deregulated its commercial ba nks those banks expanded to the united kingdom the united states sca

the end of 2007 valued at 9 billion after iceland deregulated its commerc ial banks the banks expanded their operations abroad by acquiring subsidiaries in commercial banking and in securities brokerages at the end of 2007 lmost half of the total asse ts of the largest commercial banking groups were accounted for by foreig n subsidiaries most of them located in northern europe and in 2007 bout 58 of their overall inco was generated from their subsidiaries located abroad by the end of 2007 icelands three largest banks relied on shortterm financing for 75 of their funds mostly through borrowing in the money markets and in the shortterm interbank ma rket icelands banks are hybrid between commercial and investment ba nks with relatively large exposure to market risk by march 2008 investors had become wary of icelands banks due to their large funding needs and high dependence on s hortterm funds in money ma rkets even before the financial crisis erupted in fall 2008 the ce ntral bank of iceland and other institutions forecasted slowdown or contraction in i celands rate of economic growth in 2008 and 2009 banking collapse between october 7 and 9 2008 icelands fi nancial supervisor authority fsa an independent state authority with respons ibilities to regulate nd supervise icelands credit insurance securities and pensi on markets took control of without actually nationalizing them three of icelands rgest banks landsbanki glitnir banki and kaupthing bank the takeover occurred prior to scheduled vote by shareholders to accept government plan to purchase the shares of the banks in order to head off the collapse of the banks at the same time iceland suspended trading on its stock exchange for two days2 the takeover of the banks was orchestrated in an attempt to quell sharp depreciation in the exchange value of the icelandic krona the krona depreciated relative to the euro and the dollar between january 2008 and july 2008 the depreciation became more pronounced after july 2008 for icela nd which relies heavily on trade sharp depreciation in its currency increases the costs of its imports and adds to domestic inflationary pressureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22988crs4 3 portes richard the shocking errors behind icelands meltdown financial times october 13 2008 p 15 4 buiter willem h and anne sibert the icelandic banking crisis and what to do about it the lender of last resort theory of optimal currency areas policy insight 26 centre for economic policy research october 2008 p 2 5 the economy of iceland p 911the demise of icelands three largest banks is attributed to an array of events but primarily stems from decisions by the banks th emselves some observers argued that the collapse of lehman brothers set in motion the events that finally led to the collapse of the banks3 but this conclusion is cont roversial some have argued that at the heart of icelands banking crisis is flawed banking model that is based on an internationally active banking sector that is large relative to the size of the home countrys gdp and to the fiscal capacity of the central bank4 as result disruption in liquidity threatens the viability of the banks and overwhelms the ability of the central bank to act as the lender of last resort which undermines th solvency of the banking system by the time of the acknowledged start of the global financia l crisis in mid2007 icelands central bank and icelands banks themselves had begun to recognize the vulnerability of the banks in particular officials in iceland as well as financial observers in europe had begun to reasse ss the risks associated with various financial instruments and to raise questions about th asset strength of the banks and the asset size of the banks relative to the size of icelands economy in addition by late 2007 various organizations had begun to recognize the imbalances that were becoming apparent in icelands economy and had forecast slowdown in icelands torrid pace of economic growth for 2008 and 20095 when lehman brothers collapsed the inte rnational financial markets had already begun to reassess the risks associated with broad range of financial instruments eventually this reassessmen t of risks unde rmined the remaining amount of trust that existed in the credit markets which cause d banks and other fina ncial firms to grow unwilling to make loans to shortterm money markets and to engage in interbank lending which caused those activities to freeze up for icelands three largest banks this collapse in shortterm borrowing meant that they f ound that it was increasingly difficult to finance debts in the interbank market in addition icelands landsbanki and ka upthing bank experienced sharp rise in the cost of private deposit insurance this withdrawal of credit eliminated major source of the banks funding and threatened their ability to finance the nations trade deficits typically this situ ation is remedied by the central bank which stands as the bank of last resort in icelands case how ever the debts of th commercial banks were so large that icelands central bank was unable to guarantee the banks loans which lead to the collapse of the banks in turn the krona experienced serious depreciation in its value which raised the cost of imports and threatened to fuel domestic inflation the large foreign debts held by icelands banks proved to be unsupportable once they could not utilize the interbank market to refinance their substantial loans the fsa transferred part of the three banks operations to new bank entities that it formed and that are fully owned by the icel andic government as part of these actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22988crs5 6 anderson camilla

system of daily currency auction to facilita international trade wit hout viable currency there was way to support the banks which have done the bulk of their business in foreign markets the financial crisis also created problems with great britain because hundreds of thousands of britons hold accounts in onlin branches of the icelandic banks and fear those accounts will all default the governme nt of british prime minister gordon brown has used powers granted under antiterrorism laws to freeze british assets of landsbanki until the standoff is resolved on november 19 2008 iceland and the international monetary fund imf finalized an agreement on an economic st abilization program supported by 21 billion twoyear standby arrangement from the imf6 upon approval of the imfs executive board the imf released 827 llion immediately to iceland with the remainder to be paid in eight equal installments subject to quarterly reviews as part of the agreement iceland has proposed plan to restore confid ence in its banking system to stabilize the exchange rate and to improve the nations fi scal position also as part of the plan icelands central bank raised its key interest rate by six percentage points to 18 on october 29 2008 to attract foreign investor s and to shore up its sagging currency7 the imfs executive board had postponed its decision on loan to iceland three times reportedly to give imf officials more time to confirm loans made by other nations other observers argued however that the delay reflected objections by british dutch and german officials over the di sposition of deposit accounts opera ted by icelandic banks in their countries iceland reporte dly smoothed the way by agreeing in principle to cover the deposits although the details had not be finalized in joint statement germany britain and the netherlands said on november 20 2008 that they w ould work constructively in the continuing discussions to reach an agreement8 following the decision of imfs executive board denmark finland norway and sweden agreed to provide an additional 25 billion in loans to iceland conclusions the failure of icelands banks raises stions about bank supervision and crisis management for governments in europe and the united states this incident raises questions about how national g overnments should address the issue of supervising foreign financial firms that are operating within thei r borders and how to protect their depositorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22988crs6 9 benoit bertrand tom braithwaaite jimmy bu rns jean eaglesham et iceland and uk clash on crisis financial times october 10 2008 p 1when foreignowned firm may attempt to withdraw deposits from one market in order to offset losses in another one approach focuses on broad levels of cooperation between national governments with each governme nt addressing the crisis from its own perspective and in its own limited way for number of governments in europe this approach is appealing because their economie s and their banks have felt little direct effect from the crisis an alternative approach argues in favor of more integrated and coordinated response from national governments and centr banks proponents of this approach argue that coordinated systemic approach is necessary because financial markets in the united states and europe have become high ly integrated as result of crossborder investment by banks securities brokers and other financial firms as result of this integration economic and fina ncial developments that ffect national economies are difficult to contain and are quickly transmitted across national borders as attested to by the financial crisis of 2008 as fi nancial firms react to financ ial crisis in one area their actions can spill over to other areas as they withdraw assets from foreign markets to shore up their domestic operations for instance as icelandic banks began to default britain used an antiterrorism law to seize the deposits of the banks to prevent the banks from shifting funds from britain to iceland9 banks and financial firm s in europe have felt the repercussions of the us fina ncial crisis as bank balance sh eets have deteriorated and as us firms and european firms have adjusted their operations in response to the crisis the icelandic case also raises questions about the cost and benefits of branch banking across national borders where banks can grow to be so large that disruptions in the financial market can cause defaults that outstrip the resources of national central banks to address such branch banking across national borders has si gnificantly expanded financial opportunities for indivi dual investors and firms alike and is unlikely to disappear as result of the current financial crisis nevertheless if some financial institutions are deemed to be too big to fail financial regu lators and national gove rnments may be called on to address the issue of how such ins titutions should be supervised when their operations span national borders and they are engaged in vast array of banking and investment operations
