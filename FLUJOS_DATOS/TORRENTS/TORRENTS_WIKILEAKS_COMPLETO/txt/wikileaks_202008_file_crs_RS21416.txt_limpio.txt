the stated purpose of improving the management and performance of the federal government1 the agenda consisted of five governmentwide initiatives described below and several specific program activities according to president bush these five main initiatives were selected as addressing the most apparent deficiencies where the opportunity to improve is greatest the presidents initiatives reflect the view that management in the federal government might be improved by adopting more businesslike principles and practices from the private sector which emphasize performance and results strategic management of human capital the office of personnel management opm has defined this initiative as transforming how the federal government employs deploys develops and evaluates its workforce by focusing on results discussion in the fy 2007 budget suggests that with this initiative agencies are strengthening their performance appraisal systems nurturing future leaders ensuring their 1 us office of management and budget the presidents management agenda fy2002 washington omb 2001 p 1 subsequently referred to as agenda for an online update about developments related to agenda initiatives see httpwwwresultsgov crs2 employees have the necessary skills and reducing how long it takes them to hire new staff competitive sourcing entails publicprivate competitions for federal activities considered commercial and possible contracting out to the private sector of work currently performed by federal employees and related revisions of omb circular a76 improved financial performance seeks to enhance the quality and timeliness of financial information available to the agencies and congress when making decisions about federal programs two other facets originally subsumed under this initiative later were designated as separate program initiatives improving management of real property assets and eliminating improper payments expanded electronic government focuses on strengthening agencies management of information technology resources and using the internet to improve service delivery the latter effort involves some two dozen httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21416 activities such as govbenefitsgov and grantsgov performance improvement formerly budget and performance integration entails efforts to integrate performance reviews with budget decisions in the federal government increasingly agencies are to use program performance information such as that generated by the program assessment rating tool part when making budget and management decisions development of the management scorecard and part president bushs budget submission for fy2003 transmitted on february 4 2002 sought to incorporate the five management initiatives into agencies budgets and introduced management scorecard to measure progress in each of the five reform areas grades for the agencies on each of the initiatives based on traffic light motif of green for success yellow for mixed results and red for unsatisfactory have been updated quarterly by omb opm and omb jointly determine the grades for the management of human capital initiative for each initiative there are multiple standards for success or core criteria which an agency must meet in order to get green rating there are likewise listings for each initiative of conditions amounting to fatal flaws if an agency displays any one of these it receives red yellow grade applies when an agency is free of red conditions and has achieved some but not all of the core criteria for example with respect to the improving financial performance initiative an agency must meet four core criteria to get to green as listed in the fy2003 budget submission financial management systems meet federal system requirements and applicable federal accounting and transaction standards as reported by the agency head accurate and timely financial information integrated financial and performance management systems supporting daytoday operations and crs3 unqualified and timely audit opinion on the annual financial statements material internal control weaknesses reported by the auditors2 as of december 31 2007 three agencies department of labor environmental protection agency and the social security administration had attained green for all five initiatives3 on the other hand two agencies the department of veterans affairs and omb still had three reds and the department of homeland security received green on any initiative there also have been differences in reaching the standards for success among the respective initiatives in december 2007 financial performance displayed the most red grades nine followed by competitive sourcing six reds the human capital initiative arguably reflected the most progress to date with17 agencies at green none failing at red and nine receiving transitional grade of yellow performance improvement followed with 14 green 12 yellow and red in addition to the current status grades agencies also receive progress score for each initiative green for implementation proceeding as planned yellow for some slippage and red warning of an initiative in serious jeopardy ombs grading of the agencies on the scorecard for progress in implementation as of december 31 2007 is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21416 higher overall than that given by omb for current status of the initiatives with green predominating and only nine of 130 total grades being red eleven agencies have green for progress in implementation on all five initiatives while eight have green on all but one of the initiatives the administration also developed new program assessment rating tool in 2002 known as part for evaluating program performance the part questionnaire contains four sections which focus on program purpose and design strategic planning program management and program results and accountability4 for various reasons omb translates part numerical scores into qualitative ratings as listed below in table 1 part was first used by agency program managers and omb budget examiners to evaluate some 20 of federal programs in the fall of 2002 during the budget review process for the presidents fy2004 budget each subsequent year an additional 20 of programs were to receive part reviews with the goal of reaching virtually 100 coverage in the fy2008 budget5 on february 3 2003 president bush transmitted his budget for fy2004 which contained separate volume devoted to the scorecard and part titled performance and management assessments on february 2 2004 the budget for fy2005 was released containing brief discussion of part in the analytical perspectives volume but with the 2 omb fiscal year 2003 budget analytical perspectives washington gpo 2002 p 413 3 electronic

programs representing approximately 96 of the federal budget see fiscal year 2008 budget analytical perspectives washington gpo 2007 p14 crs4 detailed information on part reviews now provided on cdrom this format has continued access to part data was facilitated in 2006 when omb launched new website expectmoregov which contains part summaries for all programs assessed to date as of february 2008

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21416 as indicated in table 1 half of the 234 programs subject to part evaluations in 2002 were rated as results not demonstrated due to inadequate performance goals or unavailability of data to provide evidence of results programs in this category declined each year until 19 fell in this category in fy2007 from fy2002fy2007 programs in the effective group increased from 6 to 18 programs deemed moderately effective increased from 24 to 31 and programs in the adequate category increased from 15 to 29 the percentage of programs rated ineffective declined from 5 to 3 implementation and oversight in his message to congress accompanying the agenda in august 2001 president bush observed these proposals will often require the cooperation of congress congress agenda is crowded one and there is an understandable temptation to ignore management reforms in favor of new policies and programs however what matters most is performance and results in the long term there are few items more urgent than ensuring that the federal government is well run and resultsoriented p 1 on march 26 2003 the house subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management held an oversight hearing on management and the presidents budget with regard to accomplishments of the agenda to date officials from omb offered this assessment the scorecard is working clearly it still shows lot of agencies in the red for status and that reflects the nature of the problems we are trying to solve chronic longstanding management challenges that defy quick fixes however there is significant improvement since our initial evaluation6 6 us congress house committee on government reform subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management management and the presidents budget hearing 108th continued crs5 testimony from the general accounting office likewise was supportive of the effort overall there has been continuing progress in implementing the governmentwide pma initiatives this progress however has been uneven and continued focus is needed to improve the management and performance of the federal government and to ensure accountability7 at an oversight hearing on february 11 2004 omb deputy director for management clay johnson iii testified that due to efforts associated with the agenda agencies are better managed and achieving greater results than they were twoplus years ago as reflected in the scorecard further according to deputy director johnson the part process offers vehicle for improving program performance while building on the foundation provided by the government performance and results act gpra the strategic and performance plans prepared by agencies pursuant to gpra provide basis on which to judge an agencys performance management practices or the goals by which it measures success the part reinforces the laws important requirements to set outcomeoriented goals and measure progress against those goals8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21416 in his opening statement at the hearing subcommittee chairman todd platts suggested an interest in discussing how best to codify the requirement for coordinated programbyprogram evaluation such as part pledging continued attention to gpra implementation mr johnson noted codification of the requirement to conduct assessments of program performance would be welcome complement to the statutory management framework laid by gpra on february 25 2004 representative platts introduced hr 3826 the program assessment and results act to amend gpra and establish statutory requirement for program reviews the bill would have required omb to review each program activity at least once every five years but not mandated the use of part specifically hr 3826 was reported favorably in the house and senate companion bill was introduced but further action occurred early in the 109th congress representative platts reintroduced bill as hr 185 which was again reported favorably by the government reform committee hrept 10926 but saw further action9 the 109th congress considered other measures relating to the presidents management initiatives in the fy2006 and fy2007 budget submissions the president had called for establishment of two new types of statutory commissions results commissions would consider and revise proposals from the president to restructure or consolidate overlapping programs and then submit the plans to congress for consideration 6 continued cong 1st sess mar 26 2003 washington gpo 2003 p71 7 testimony of patricia dalton

108th cong 2nd sess feb 11 2004 washington gpo 2004 pp 9 12 9 for further discussion of this measure see crs report rl32671 federal program performance review program assessment and results act and other developments by virginia mcmurtry crs6 under expedited procedures10 president bush also called for creation of sunset commission to conduct systematic reviews of federal programs according to set schedule absent action by congress to reauthorize them programs would terminate following the reviews several states including texas have sunset commissions and for many years sunset commission bills have been introduced in congress11 outlook in the 110th congress president bush issued executive order 13450 eo 13450 improving government program performance on november 13 2007 the order requires agency heads to set clear annual and longterm goals and to prepare specific plans for achieving the goals including the means to measure progress and efficiency in use of resources eo 13450 also requires agency heads to designate an agency performance improvement officer and establishes new performance improvement council to be chaired by ombs deputy director for management the order arguably reflects an effort by the bush administration to help ensure that the performance improvement initiative of the pma becomes lasting legacy following httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21416 the unsuccessful efforts to advance legislation to provide statutory basis for part in the 108th and 109th congresses as discussed above in the budget for fy2009 omb provided this rationale for eo 13450 to institutionalize the resultsdriven culture of the pma bush issued an executive order eo on november 13 2007 that formalizes the commitment of the government to spend taxpayers money wisely and effectively every year the eo ensures agency and program performance is transparent so that taxpayers have the critical information needed to hold government accountable p 29 some seemed less certain however about its favorable impact according to an article appearing in daily report for executives eo 13450 appears aimed at institutionalizing within the executive branch much of the controversial program rating tool part used by omb to evaluate federal programs12 congressional oversight of the agenda initiatives seems likely to continue and possibly to increase in light of interest generated by eo 13450 the 110th congress may choose as well to revisit sunset legislation such as s 1731 introduced by senator cornyn on june 28 2007 or other program review bills 10 in the 109th congress hr
