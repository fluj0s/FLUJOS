other states at the time of the lawrence decision twel ve other states in addition to texas had antisodomy laws on their books however of the thirteen states with anti sodomy laws only four states including xas had laws that criminalized sodomy between samesex couples but not between heterosexual partners9 the remaining states with antisodomy laws criminaliz ed sodomy for all couples regardless of whether they consisted of same sex or oppositesex partners notably the number of states with an tisodomy laws had declined significantly in the nearly two decades since the landmark bowers v hardwick case upheld georgia law that outlawed homosexual s odomy in 1986 at that time 24 states and the district of columbia had antisodomy ws on the books but half of those states including georgia

v hardwick12 and romer v evans 13 are of particular significance to the outcome in lawrence and are therefore discussed in greater detail in this section14 in bowers v hardwick the supreme court considered challenge to georgia statute that criminalized bot h homosexual and heterosexual sodomy ruling that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment did not provide fundamental right to engage in consensual homosexual sodomy even in the privacy of ones own home the court upheld the georgia statute15 although other supreme court rulings have recognized due process right of privacy that protects personal decisions regarding activities such as marriage contraception and procreation from government interference16 the bowers decision essentially refused to recognize similar right of privacy to protect indi viduals engaged in homosexual sodomy the other supreme court case shaping the courts decision in lawrence is romer v evans decided in 1996 romer held that amendment 2 of the colorado constitution which barred localities from enac ting civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment17 although classifications based on sexual orientation do not receive the heightened constitutional scrutiny normally reserved for review of suspect classifications such as race or gender the court in this case nevertheless determined that the colorado amendment violated the guarantee of equal protection because the law was motivated strictly by animus for homosexuals and because there was otherwise rational basis for enacting such sweeping restriction on the legal rights of gays and lesbians according to the court we must conclude that amendment 2 cla ssifies homosexuals not to further proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else this colorado cannot do state cannot so deem class of persons stranger to its laws amendment 2 violates the equal protection clause18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31681crs4 19 lawrence v texas 539 us 558 579 2003 20 petition for writ of certiorari at i 21 bowers v hardwick 478 us 186 190191 1996 see also lawrence v texas 539 us at 57374despite the fact that bowers and romer were decided on different constitutional grounds both of the cases involved i ssues that were raised in the lawrence case ultimately the supreme court overruled its decision in bowers holding that the due process right to privacy extends to protect private consensual sexual activity although justice sandra day oconnor who or iginally voted with the majority to uphold the georgia statute at issue in bowers did not join in the 54 decision to overrule that case she did agree with the majoritys decision to strike down the texas statute for different reasons in separate opinion re miniscent of the courts ruling in romer oconnor indicated that she was vo ting to strike down the texas sodomy law as violation of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection19 the courts opinion oconnors concurrence and the di ssents argument are detailed in the following section ii supreme court review in their petition seeking supreme court review attorneys for lawrence and garner posed three questions to the court 1 did the texas stat ute violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendm ent 2 did the texas statute violate the right to privacy embedded in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and 3 should bowers be overruled20 the courts considera tion of these and other issues is discussed in the following section bowers v hardwick and the right to privacy under the second question presented in lawrence which formed the basis for the courts eventual ruling the supreme court was faced with the question of whether or not the homosexual sodomy statut violates the right to privacy embedded in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment because the bowers v hardwick case specifically considered the same issue the courts decision on the privacy question likewise affected the cour ts decision on the third and final question whether or not to overrule bowers the court ultimately overruled bowers and held that government interference with private and intimate consensual adult activity is violation of the due process right to pr ivacy this section describes the courts reasoning and discusses the dissents response the court began its analysis in lawrence by summarizing its substantive due process privacy doctrine under the supr eme courts privacy jurisprudence the court has recognized constitutional right to privacy despite the fact that this right is not specifically enumerated in the constitution in bowers for example the court noted that the due process right to privacy protects from government interference wide range of personal decisions regarding issues such as child rearing family relationships procr eation marriage cont raception and abortion21 this right to privacy is grounded in the notion that certain freedoms are so fundamental orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31681crs5 22 palko v connecticut 302 us 319 32526 1937 23 moore v east clevel and 431 us 494 503 1977 24

sacrificed22 alternatively certain liberties may be deemed fundamental because they are deeply root ed in this nations history and tradition23 because these two tests do not always articulate clear standards for determining when liberty is so fundamental that it dese rves constitutional protection under the due process clause extending the right to privacy to liberties that have not previously been deemed fundamental by the court ch as right to engage in consensual homosexual sodomy can some times prove c ontroversial after outlining its privacy jurisprudence the court set forth its reasons for reconsidering its decision in bowers of primary importance to the court was the idea that the bowers court had misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it24 in the lawrence courts view the issue in bowers was about more than fundamental right to engage in homos exual sodomy rather the case was about whether or not individuals have the right to make personal choices regarding their intimate relationships free of government interference25 although the lawrence court did not explicitly deem homosexual sodomy to be fundamental right the court nonetheless concluded that the bowers court had failed to properly define the liberty interests at stake when individuals make private consensual choices about their sexual conduct the court criticized the bowers decision on several additional grounds first the court noted that bowers had relied in part on history of condemnation of homosexuality but the court countered that argument by citin g several legal and historical sources demonstratin g that there is longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexua l conduct as distinct matter26 second although many believe homosexuality to be immoral the court noted that public perceptions on this issue have shifted over time the court pointed to changing trends in state law and international law as evidence of an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adu lt persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex27 indeed half the states with antisodomy laws have legislatively repealed or judicially overruled such statutes over the last two decades including georgia the state whose anti sodomy statute was upheld by the court in bowers and number of western democracies have recognized the right to sexual privacy28 finally the court noted that its own constitutional doctrine has evolved over the years that have elapsed since the bowers decision was handed down specifically citing its decisions in romer and in planned parenthood of southeasternhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31681crs6 29 id at 57374 30 id at 57576 31 planned parenthood v case 505 us 833 85455 1992

speci note of the stigma imposed by state laws that criminalize sodomy30 after finishing this critique of bowers the court next considered whether or not to overturn the case in determining whether or not to overrule precedent the supreme court typically considers four factors 1 whether the precedent establishes workable rule 2 whether the public has relied on the rule 3 whether legal doctrine has changed and 4 whether facts in the case or public perception of such facts has changed31 although the court which recognizes need for continuity and respect for the rule of law does not ligh tly overrule precedent neither is the court willing to refrain from doing so when it determines that previous case has been incorrectly decided32 in lawrence the court determined that there has been individual or societal reliance on bowers of the sort that could counsel against overturning its holding once there are compelling reasons to do so bowers itself causes uncertainty for the precedents before and after its issuance contradict its centr holding the rationale of bowers does not withstand careful analysis bowers was not correct when it was decided and it is not correct today it ought not to remain binding precedent bowers v hardwick should be and now is overruled33 after noting that the lawrence case involved consensu relationship and did not involve minors public c onduct prostitution or other legitimate state concerns the majority concluded its opinion with the following strongly worded statement in support of its holding the petitioners are titled to respect for their private lives the state ca nnot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct crime their right to liberty under the due process clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government it is promise of the constitution that there is realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter the texas statute furthers legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual34 in an equally strongly worded dissent justice antonin scalia criticized the majoritys decision in lawrence he accused the majority of being inconsistent for failing to adhere to the precedent established in bowers after some of the same justices had insisted on strong adhere nce to the rules of precedent in the 1992 casey decision in which the court upheld abor tion rights and refused to overturn roe vhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31681crs7 35 id at 586592 36 id

texas 539 us 558 580 2003wade 35 he also accused the majority of misapplying the courts substantive due process doctrine sserting that homosexual sodomy has not achieved the status of fundamental constitutional right in the years since bowers was decided 36 and he warned that the majoritys opinion signal ed the end of all morals legislation37 arguing that the court has taken sides in the culture war the dissent concluded by arguing that the majoritys opinion opens the door to legal challenges against an array of laws that regulate sexual activity and personal relationships including laws that prohibit samesex marriage38 equal protection although justice oconnor did agr ee that the texas statute was unconstitutional she did not agree with the majoritys reasoning rather than ruling on due process privacy grounds oconnor based her concurring opinion on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment39 under the supreme courts qual protection jurispruden ce the general rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to legitimate state interest40 laws based on suspect classifications such as race or gender however typically receive heightened scrutiny and require stronger if not compelling state interest to justify the classification41 because sexual orientation is not considered to be suspect category state need only advance rational reason for enacting statute that treats individuals differently depending on their sexual orientation42 since lawrence involved statute that crimin alized sodomy when engaged in by samesex couples but not identical conduct by differentsex couples oconnors concurring opinion relied on the rational basis standard of review acknowledging that most laws that are reviewed unde r the rational basis standard survive constitutional scrutiny oconnor nevertheless noted that when law exhibits such desire to harm politica lly unpopular gr oup we have applied more searching form of rational basis review to strike down such laws under the equal protection clause43 citing romer oconnor extended this argume nt further contending that moral disapproval of this group like bare desire to harm the group is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational ba sis review under the qual protection clause the texas sodomy law raises the in evitable inference that the disadvantagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31681crs8 44 id at 58283 45 id at 585 46 id at 57475 47 id at 599600 48 linda greenhouse justices 63 legalize gay sexual conduct in sweeping reversal of courts 86 ruling ny times june 27 2003 at a1imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected44 as with the colorado constitutional amendment at issue in romer therefore oconnor concluded that the texas st atute violated the equal pr otection clause despite this conclusion oconnor was careful to note that not all laws that distinguish between heterosexuals and homosexuals would viol ate equal protection specifically noting that an interest in preserving nationa l security or the traditional institution of marriage could constitute legitimate governmental interest45 although other member of the cour t signed on to oconnors concurring opinion the majority opinion which found th equal protection argument tenable appeared to favor the privacy approach because of its broader effect46 the dissent however disagreed with oconnors equal protection analysis arguing that the texas statute does not discriminate because it applies equally to men and women as well as to heterosexuals nd homosexuals all of whom are subject to the same prohibition against engaging in samesex sodomy47 iii conclusion because many observers had expected the court to issue ruling on the more narrow equal protection grounds favored by oconnor the courts privacy ruling was more sweeping than predicted48 the broad decision in lawrence is sure to have lasting consequences for other cases invol ving among other issues sexual privacy and gay rights some of these potentia l consequences are highlighted below immediate consequences one immediate effect of the courts ruling in lawrence was to invalidate all thirteen of the existing state antisodomy ws regardless of whether they applied to homosexual couples only or to all couples both heterosexual and homosexual had the court issued its ruling on the more narrow equal protection grounds favored by oconnor the effect of the decision would have been to invalid ate only those state statutes that discriminated against gays by prohibiting homosexual sodomy exclusively since the court issued broader ruling that the government cannot criminalize private consensual adult sexual behavior the lawrence case appears to create more expansive right to sexual privacy that prohibits the states from making sodomy crime for anyone hom osexual or heterosexual in another development the

partner is an older teenager of th opposite sex but the same act is punishable with prison sentence if the partner is an older teenager of the same sex as result of the kansas statute 18year old matthew limon received 17year sentence for engaging in consensual gay sex with 14y ear old boy despite the fact that he would have received far lighter sentence for gaging in similar conduct with youth of the opposite sex the supreme court ordered the kansas court to reconsider the case in light of the lawrence ruling50 but the court of appeals of kansas distinguished the lawrence case and upheld the sentence rulin g that the states interest in protecting children provided rational basis for crimin alizing homosexual sodomy more severely than heterosexual sodomy51 the kansas supreme court subsequently issued petition to review the lower cour ts decision but has not yet ruled in the case52 implications for future cases involving gay rights the courts broad decision in lawrence is likely to prompt series of challenges to an array of governmental po licies involving privacy interests andor gay rights indeed the case which appears to greatly expand constitutional protection for sexual privacy may give rise to challenges against statutes that prohibit samesex marriage gay adoption gays in the military or similar issues how the courts will resolve these controversies however remains unclear on the one hand the courts ruling em phasized that our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to pe rsonal decisions relating to marriage procreation contraception family relationships child rear ing and education and that persons in homosexual relations hip may seek autonomy for these purposes53 if lawrence is viewed as establishing broad constitutional right to sexual privacy then the courts decision may be interpre ted as supporting challenges to laws that prohibit activities such as same sex marriage or gay adoption on the other hand the court also distinguished the lawrence decision from cases involving minors or prostitution and it noted that the case does not involve whether the government must give form recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter54 indeed the courts may point to other government interests such as an interest in preserving marriage or national security for example to distinguish the private sexual conduct involved in lawrence from the issues at stake in cases involving gay marriage or gays in the militaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31681crs10 55 see eg hjres 39 hr 1100 sjres 1 and sjres
