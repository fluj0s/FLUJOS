reporter thursday 17 september 2009 share print email british oil trading giant has agreed to multimillionpound payout to settle huge damages claim from thousands of africans who fell ill from tonnes of toxic waste dumped illegally in one of the worst pollution incidents in decades trafigura londonbased company which bills itself as one of the worlds largest oil traders said it was in talks to reach global settlement to the claim by 30000 people from ivory coast who brought britains largestever lawsuit after contaminated sludge from tanker ship was flytipped under cover of darkness in august 2006 the incident caused at least 100000 residents from the west african countrys most populous city abidjan to flood into hospitals and clinics complaining of breathing difficulties and sickness investigations by the ivorian authorities suggested that the deaths of at least 10 people were linked to the waste trafigura has always insisted the f oulsmelling slurry dumped without its knowledge by subcontractor could not have caused serious injury or illness related articlesthe victims my nose bled and i was sick for months the company the shadowy history of slick oil giant the bitterly contested legal action has seen trafigura repeatedly deploy one of britains most aggressive firm s of lawyers to dispute reporting on the case by media outlets including the bbc under the deal thousands of iv orians who suffered shortterm illnesses including vomiting diarrhoea and breathing difficulties receive payout understood to be set at several hundred pounds but the settlement which is likely to be confirmed by the end of this month will mean that claims of more serious injuries caused by the waste including miscarriages still births and birth defects will now not be tes ted in the 100m court claim which had been scheduled to start in londons high court next month trafigura privatelyowned multinational which has 1900 staff working in 42 offices around the world last year claimed turnover of 73bn 44bn the figure is double the entire gdp of ivory coast where half the population of 21 m illion live on less than dollar day martyn day the solicitor leading the massive class action told the independent over the last few weeks we have been exploring with trafigura the possibility of resolving the 30000 claims we have reached point where we are now in the process of putting global deal to the claimants i am optimistic as to the outcom of that process the claimants are very pleased and are keen to see the issue resolved at the heart of the dumping incident which at times seemed to owe more to the novels of john grisha m than 21stcentury commerce lies an oil deal spanning three continents internal trafigura emails obtained by greenpeace show that trafigura struck series of bargains on the international markets in 2005 and early 2006 to buy cheap and dirty petroleum called coker gasoline which the company believ ed could then be cleaned up at profit of 4m per cargo rather than send the oil to refinery trafigura used the probo koala panamanian tanker chartered by the company since 2004 as floating processing plant while it was anchored off gibraltar using an ad hoc process of adding c austic soda and catalyst to the coker gasoline the oil was cleaned to produce sellable fuel and toxi c sludge which sank to the bottom of the ships tanks the precise composition of the waste is strongly disputed with trafigura vigorously denying it contained high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide potentially lethal poisonous gas the presence of mercaptan sulphurous chemical that is widely recognised as the most foulsmelling substance known to man was confirmed problems began for trafigura when it needed to dispose of the slurry when the probo koala arrived in amsterdam in july 2006 and tri ed to unload the contaminated slops allegedly described as watery cleaning liquids the process caused health alert and trafigura was informed the cost of dealing with its byproduct would rise from 17 per cubic metre to 800 rather than pay the estimated bill of 500000 trafigura ordered the waste to be pumped back on to th probo koala and the vessel travelled to west africa laden with cargo of unleaded petrol collected from supplier in est onia the first the four million inhabitants of abidjan knew of their role in trafiguras project was after darkness on 19 august 2006 fleet of 12 trucks hired by local waste contractor compagnie tommy which had only rec eived its operating licence weeks earlier offloaded the sulphurous sludge from the cargo vessel and deposited the waste at 18 loc ations around the sprawling overcrowded city hospital records showed that within hours thousands of patients were treated for complaints including nausea breathlessness headaches skin reactions and range of ear nose throat and pulmonary problemspost commenta united nations report yesterday found that there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping the study by the special rapporteur on human rights professor okechukwu ibeanu levelled series of crit icisms against trafigura including claims that it had failed to check the ability of compagnie tommy to deal properly with the waste the report said that trafigura went ahead with the arrangement despite being told by tommy that it int ended to dispose of the sludge at akouedo vast openair waste site where hundreds of ivorians earn living by picking over the rubbish professor ibeanu said akouedo was not in any way equipped to treat the waste from the probo koala bellpottinger the london pr company working for trafigura responded by saying the report was inaccurate and potentially damaging in statement trafigura said the company has always maintained that the probo koalas slops could not possibly have caused deaths and serious or longterm injuries independent expert witnesses firmly support trafigura in t his stance compagnie tommy was fullylicensed contractor recommended to trafigura by an experienced and reputable iv orian shipping agent to handle the slops in legal and responsible

accompanying the report the report concluded there is evidence indicatin g serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by israel during the gaza conflict and t hat israel committed actions amounting to war crime s and possibly crimes against humanity the mission found that in the lead up to the israe li military assault on gaza israel imposed block ade

houses factories wells schools hospitals po lice stations and other public buildings were destroyed more than 1400 pe ople were killed during the military operation the report concludes that the israeli military oper ation was directed at the people of gaza as whole in furtherance of an overall and continuing policy aimed at punishing the gaza p opulation and in deliberate policy of disproport ionate force aimed at the civilian population the destruction of food supply installations water sanitation systems concrete factories and residential houses was the result of deliberate and systemati c policy which has made the daily process of living and dignified living more difficult for the civilian population the report underlines that in most of the incidents investigated by it and described in the report l oss of life and destruction caused by israeli forces during the military operat ion was result of disrespect for the fundamental principle of distinction in international humanitarian law that requires milita ry forces to distinguish between military targets nd civilians and civilian objects at all times the report describes number of specific inciden ts in which israeli forces launched direct attacks against civilians with lethal outcome these are it says cases in which the fa cts indicate justifiable military objective purs ued by the attack and concludes they amount to war crimes number of other incidents the report concludes ma constitute war crimes include direct and intent ional attack on the quds hospital and an adjacent ambulance depot in ga za

at military targets breaches the fundamental principle of distinction the report says where there is intended military target and the rocket s and mortars are launched into civilian areas they constitute deliberate attack against the civilian population the prolonged situation of impunity has created j ustice crisis in the occupied palestinian territory that warrants action the report says the mission found the government of is rael had not carried out any credible investigation s into alleged violations it recommended that the security council require israel to report to it within six months on inve stigations and prosecutions it should carry out with regard to the violations iden tified in its report the mission further recommend s that the security council set up body of
