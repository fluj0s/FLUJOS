discovered in june 2007 the taliban used prcmade hn5 surface toair missiles in afghanistan in some cas tracing to the producer of the arms is challenged by the intentiona l removal of serial numbers from the weapons or parts also adding to the challenge of identifying the source of weapons is the fact that iran has manufactured an antiaircraft missile called the misagh1 that is similar to the qw1 antiair missile made by the prc s stateowned defense industrial company the china precision machinery import and export corporation cpmiec94 even while us officials have pointed to china as the origin of some of the weaponry found in afghanista n another question concerns whether the supplies are new since operation enduring freedom bega n in 2001 or left over from the years when various countries transferred weapons to mujahedin fighters in afghanistan during its soviet occupation in the 1980s or later in the 1990s chinas cpmiec exported the hn5 antiaircraft missiles for years and china previously supplied them to the mujahedin in afghan istan iran and other countries95 defense secretary donald rumsfeld told reporters in au gust 2002 that afghanistan is filled with weapons and that

in its approach the bush administrati on has focused concerns and questions on iran rather than china and how the wea pons ended up in afghanistan some through iran rather than where they were made i n china iran or other countries focusing on iran under secretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns specifically said on june 13 2007 theres irrefu table evidence the iranians are now transferring arms to the taliban in afghanistan and its pattern of activity its coming from the iranian revolutionary guard corps command which is basic unit of the iranian government after just retiring as deputy under secretary of defense richard lawless told reporters on july 6 that identifying how the weapons came through iran into afghanista n and who is facilitating that transit through iran is the key issue for us right now it is really not the issue of where they ultimately were manufactured nonetheless despite the primary focus on iran the administration sent demarches to beijing lawless confirmed that the united states expressed concerns to china about exercising greater care in its arms sales to iran deputy assistant secretary of defense for east asia david sedne also said at meeting of the uschina economic nd security review commission on july 12 that the united states has repeatedly asked china to stop its transfers to iran of conventional weapons nd technologies but beijings response has been irresponsible he also warned partn ers do not provide weapons to people who support those who kill our troops and thos of our allies while in kabul on september 11 deputy secret ary of state john negroponte acknowledged that he raised concerns with china about its arms sales to iran and requested that china refrain from signing any new arms sales contracts with iran99 the united kingdom also asked beijing about the talibans us of prc weapons against uk troops in afghanistan100 it is uncertain as to whether china has stopped arms transfers to iran or prevented any new arms sale s contracts with iran as negroponte urged the prc has not denied its arms sales to iran and has conveyed nse of business as usual in 2007 when questioned by reporters about prc arms sales to iran that have been found in afghanistan and iraq the prc foreign ministry characterized its arms sales as normal military trade and coope ration with other countries the ministry stated chinas position that its arms sa are beyond reproach and responsible because china follows these principles for arms exports they are for legitimate selfdefense they do not undermine inte rnational peace and stability they do not interfere in the internal affairs of the recipients and they are exported only to sovereign countries in addition the fo reign ministry claimed that china has

ministry also argued that china has complied with international laws and united nations security counc il unsc resolutions101 however china could contend compliance with the letter of unsc resolutions because china along with russia objected to unsc sanctions targeting irans arms imports thus only after di plomatic negotiations on add itional sanctions against iran for its nuclear enrichment program during which china and russia objected to banning irans arms imports and export credit guarantees for doing business in iran102 china voted with all other unsc members on march 24 2007 for resolution 1747 which included ban on ir ans arms exports not imports aside from the issue of whether the prc has been responsive to us concerns the complicity of chinas government in allowing or acquiescing in the arms flow to iran is another question part of that question concerns whether the pla has been involved the arms manufacturers were p rc stateowned defens eindustrial plants rather than the pla itself although the pl might have role in any vetting of the arms exports regardless of whether the prc government did or did not know about these arms sales to iran or prc wea pons found in afghanistan and iraq us demarches have now raised the problem with beijing continuing into 2008 the director of national intelligence dni testified to congress that the prcs arms sales in the middle east are destabilizing and threat to us forces while missile sales to iran pose threat to us forces in the persian gulf103 at hearing in june 2008 defens department officials testified to congress that although the united stat demanded that the prc stop transfers that violate sanctions nonproliferati on norms and prc law us efforts met with mixed results ch inas cooperation was une ven
