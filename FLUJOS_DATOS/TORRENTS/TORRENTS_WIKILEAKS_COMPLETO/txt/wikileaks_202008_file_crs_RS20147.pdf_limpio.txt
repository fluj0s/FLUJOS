accepted practice in the united states congress since the first congress convened in 1789 it was used earlier in many of the colonial legislatures as well as in the continental congress the custom has its antecedents in english parliamentary practice alva stanwood alexander an historian of the house of representatives and former representative himself wrote this committee has long history it originated in the time of the stuarts when taxation arrayed the crown against the house of commons and suspicion made the speaker talebearer to the king to avoid the chairs pionage the commons met in secret elected chairman in whom it had confidence and without fear of the king freely exchanged its views respecting supplies the informality of its procedure survived the occasion for secrecy but to this day the house of commons keeps up the fiction of concealment the speaker withdrawing from the hall when the committee convenes and the chairman occupying the clerks desk 1 use of the committee of the whole in the current practice of the house of representatives has changed considerably from the form first used in 1789 until the early 1800s the house used committees of the whole to work out the broad outlines of major legislation select committee would then be appointed to draft bill when th select committee reported the bill to the house the house would then refer the measure to committee of the whole for debate and amendment before itself considering the question of passage2 historian ralph volney harlow commended on th committee of the whole as forum in which the broad outline of legislation could be discussed the committee of the whole is really compromise between regular session and an adjournment for purposes of discussion the latter method could not be used to advantage in any large assembly because some restraining influence would be necessary but the primitive form of the committee of the whole was probably short adjournment during which members could move about from one to another and freely discuss the merits of the matter under consideration 3 gradually the standing committee system grew up in the house of representatives replacing the temporary select committees of the earlier era standing committees assumed the overview and drafting functions previously divided between committee of the whole and select committee as result the purpose for convening in committee of the whole began to change the concept found in current practice is that of the principal forum for discussion and amendment of legislation contemporary committee of the whole procedures are not without some restriction but they are more flexible than those employed in the formal sessions of the house of representatives 1 alva stanwood alexander history and procedure of the

representatives resolves itself into the committee of the whole two simple rituals mark the transformation first the macea column of ebony rods which sits on green marble pedestal to the right of the speaker on the podiumis moved to white marble pedestal positioned lower on the podium the mace represents the authority of the sergeant of arms to maintain order in the house when it is re moved from the higher position on the podium it signals the house is longer meeting as the house of representatives in regular sessi on but in the committee of the whole second the speaker descends the podium and designates majority party colleague to take his place and assume the duties of the presiding officer during the deliberations of the committee of the whole the member designated by the speaker thus becomes the chairman of the committee of the whole and is responsible for recognizing members maintaining order and ruling on points of order during meetings of the committee of the whole members address the chair not as mr speaker but as mr chairman or madam chairman under the standing rules of the house measure that raises revenue directly or indirectly appropriates money or authorizes the expenditure of money must be considered in the committee of the whole other types of measures may be considered in the committee of the whole if the house so decides or if rulemaking statute so requires in either case the house of representatives must first agree to resolve itself into the committee of the whole it does so in three ways by unanimous consent by adopting motion to resolve into the committee of the whole or by adopting special rule that authorizes the speaker to declare the house resolved into the committee of the whole for the purpose of considering specified measure in addition to making the consideration of specific measure in order in the committee of the whole each of these three approaches will most likely limit general debate time and assign its control they may also specify the number and types of amendments which may be offered may designate debate time on amendments and may waive points of order against house rules if provision in the measure could otherwise be held in violation of them g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g138g149g561g3g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g156g561 once the house resolves itself into the committee the measure before the committee is debated and amended in general the committee of the whole observes the rules of procedure of the house of representatives insofar as they are applicable there are several important differences between proceedings in the house of representatives and proceedings in the committee of the whole that make legislative deliberation in the committee an attractive alternative httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20147g5g152g150g150g146g157g157 g142g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g25g145g152g149g142g497g561g3g151g561g11 g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 g561

is required to constitute quorum to conduct business if all 435 seats are filled majority is 218 members in the committee of the whole however only 100 members are required to constitute quorum the chairman may vacate further proceedings under quorum call as soon as 100 members have answered the call and the minimum 15minute period allowed for quorum call need not be used in its entirety as is the case in the house in addition the chairman of the committee is generally allowed the discretion of whether or not to permit quorum call during general debate furthermore if the presence of quorum has been established once during any days deliberations in the committee the chairman need not entertain quorum call unless pending question has been put to vote during the amendment process g6g142g139g138g157g142g561g152g151g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 the basic rule governing debate in the house is the onehour rule in theory this means any member receives one hour to debate when recognized on any question by custom this hour is divided between the majority and minority with each side receiving 30 minutes members often yield time to one another but normally only for the purpose of debate and not for the offering of amendments or procedural motions it is unusual for the house to proceed to second hour of debate under the onehour rule in the committee of the whole however the basic rule governing debate of amendments is the fiveminute rule supporters of amendments offered in committee receive five minutes of debate time and opponents of the proposition receive five minutes thus more members are likely to participate in debate under the fiveminute rule in committee than is possible under the onehour rule in the house to gain five minutes of debate time on pending amendment member may offer nonsubstantive amendment also called pro forma amendment to strike the last word or strike the requisite number of words thus member overcomes the rule applicable in the committee of allowing only five minutes for mber to speak in support of an amendment and five minutes for member to speak in opposition to an amendment member may also seek unanimous consent to continue for short specified period of time g7g151g141g146g151g144g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g561 in the house debate can be ended by moving the previous question however the previous question not only ends debate it also brings the matter before the house to an immediate vote this precludes the possibility of any further amendments or discussion neither debate nor amendments to the motion for the previous question are in order the previous question is not in order in the committee of the whole however additional and more flexible choices exist motion either to close debate or to limit the time for further debate eg to 20 minutes to 400 pm etc may be offered in the committee either motion is debatable and can be further refined through amendment in practice the floor manager of bill will more often ask unanimous consent that debate be either closed or limited and offer motion only if unanimous consent cannot be obtained httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20147g5g152g150g150g146g157g157 g142g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g25g145g152g149g142g497g561g3g151g561g11 g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 g561

committee members may still offer amendments they have filed at the desk these will be considered but without debate however if members had their amendments printed in the congressional record in advance of floor proceedings they are guaranteed 10 minutes of debate on those amendments in practice this protection can be overturned by special rule adopted by the house prior to the commencement of proceedings in the committee if the special rule provides other amendment procedures g20g142g140g152g155g141g142g141g561g24g152g157g142g156g561 smaller number of members are required to support call for recorded vote in the committee than are required in the house in the house onefifth of those present and supporting recorded vote constitutes sufficient number to trigger recorded vote if the minimum 218 members necessary to constitute quorum in the house are present the number needed to call for recorded vote would be 44 in committee 25 mbers are needed under any circumstances to support the call for recorded vote g20g146g156g146g151g144g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561 the committee of the whole dissolves itself by rising if the committee has not completed consideration of the measure before it the floor manager may offer simple motion to rise at later time the house may choose to resolve itself again into the committee of the whole to resume consideration of the same measure if the committee has completed its deliberations members may agree to motion to rise and report to the house of representatives the actions and recommendations of the committee once the decision to rise has been made the chairman of the committee descends the podium and the speaker ascends to take his place as presiding officer of the house of representatives the mace is returned to its original location the chairman then reports to the house those amendments that were adopted in the committee and the committees recommendation on the question of final passage of the measure neither seconddegree amendments nor substitutes that were adopted nor any first or seconddegree amendments that were defeated in the committee are reported to the house the house must then formally agree to any amendments reported by the committee therefore it is possible that amendments that were adopted by the committee of the whole could be defeated by the house of representatives the house may agree to all the amendments reported to it by the committee of the whole through one vote gros or separate votes may be demanded on any amendments agreed to in the committee the votes on amendments could also be structured pursuant to the provisions of special rule adopted earlier v otes are put on such amendments in the order in which they appear in the bill not in the order by which the request was made the house then considers with the possibility of several intervening motions such as motion to recommit the question of final passage of the measure
