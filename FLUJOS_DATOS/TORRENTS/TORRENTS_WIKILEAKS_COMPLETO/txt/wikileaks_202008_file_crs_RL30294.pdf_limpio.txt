tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan face common security challenges from crime corruption terrorism and faltering commitments to economic and democratic reforms however cooperation among them remains halting so security in the region is likely in the near term to vary by country kyrgyzstans and tajikistans futures are most clouded by ethnic and territorial tensions and corruption in kazakhstan and turkmenistan could spoil benefits from the development of their ample energy resources authoritarianism and poverty in uzbekistan could contribute to succession crisis on the other hand kyrgyzstans growing but still fragile civil society might help the relatively small nation safeguard its independence kazakhstan and uzbekistan might become regional powers able to champion policy solutions to common central asian problems and to resist undue influence from more powerful outside powers because of their large territories and populations and energy and other resources internal political developments in several bordering or closeby states may have large impact on central asian security these developments include more authoritarian and globalist russia ethnic and political instability in china and iran and resurging drug production and islamic extremism in afghanistan since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states the administration has established bases and other military access in the region for usled coalition actions in afghanistan and it has stressed that the united states will remain interested in the longterm security and stability of the region us interests in central asia include fostering democratization human rights free markets and trade assisting the development of oil and other resources and combating terrorism the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and drug production and trafficking the united states seeks to thwart dangers posed to its security by the illicit transfer of strategic missile nuclear biological and chemical weapons technologies materials and expertise to terrorist states or groups and to address threats posed to regional independence by iran some critics counter that the united states has historically had few interests in this region and advocate only limited us contacts undertaken with turkey and other friends and allies to ensure us goals they also argue that the regions energy resources may not measurably enhance us energy security most in congress have supported us assistance to bolster independence and reforms in central asia the 106 th congress authorized silk road initiative for greater policy attention and aid for democratization market reforms humanitarian needs conflict resolution transport infrastructure including energy pipelines and border controls the 108 th and 109th congresses imposed conditions on foreign assistance to kazakhstan and uzbekistan based on their human rights records the 110th congress has continued to address concerns about what should be the appropriate level and scope of us interest and involvement in the region

central asian regionbordering regional powers russia china and iranis an ageold eastwest and northsouth trade and transport crossroads1 after many of the former soviet unions republics had declared their independence by late 1991 the five republics of central asia followed suit since this beginning of independence surprising to most of the regions population the central asian countries have taken some uneven steps in building defense and other security structures and ties in some respects the states have viewed their exposure to outside influences as mixed blessing while welcoming new trade and aid the leaders of central asia have been less receptive to calls to democratize and respect human rights this report discusses the internal and external security concerns of the central asian states security concerns faced by the states include mixes of social disorder crime corruption islamic extremism terrorism ethnic and civil conflict border tensions water and transport disputes the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd and illegal narcotics the central asian states have tried with varying success to bolster their security forces and regional cooperation to deal with these threats the united states has provided assistance for these efforts and boosted such aid and involvement after the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 but questions remain about what should be the ppropriate level and scope of us interest and presence in the region

consolidated and extended their relations with neighboring and other countries and international organizations that seek to play influential roles in central asia or otherwise affect regional security these include the bordering or closeby countries of russia afghanistan china iran turkey and the south caucasus states see below appendix and others such as the united states germany india israel pakistan saudi arabia south korea and ukraine in terms of ties with closeby stat turkmenistan may be concerned more about bordering iran and afghanistan than with nonbordering china while kazakhstan may be concerned more about bordering russia than wi th nonbordering afghanistan while soliciting and managing ties with these states the central asian countries also seek assistance through regional and international organizations including the world bank international monetary fund imf economic community organization eco organization of the islamic conference oic the european union eu the commonwealth of independent states cis the shanghai cooperation organization sco and nato outside powers while sometimes competing among themselves for influence in central asia also have some common interests after september 11 2001 russia china and the united states cooperated somewhat in combating terrorism in the region this cooperation has appeared to ebb in recent years but if the security

trafficking manage water resources develop and deliver energy and tackle infectious diseases iran and russia collaborated during the latter 1990s to keep the united states and turkey from becoming involved in developing caspian sea oil and natural gas resources though this collaboration has ebbed russia and iran continue in varying ways to oppose such involvement some observers warn that increasing cooperation or similarity of interests among russia iran and china in countering the west and in attempting to increase their own influence could heighten threats to the sovereignty and independence of the central asian states others discount such threats stressing the ultimately diverging goals of the three states

and civil strife and tensions jeopardize the security and independence of all the new states of central asia though to varying degrees kazakhstan has faced the potential of separatism in northern kazakhstan where ethnic russians are dominant although this threat appears to have ebbed in recent years with the emigration of hundreds of t housands of ethnic russians tajikistan faces the stillfragile peace that ended its 19921997 civil war and the possibility of separatism particularly by its northern soghd formerly leninabad region kyrgyzstan has faced civil turmoil in creating greater balance between northern and southern regional interests in central political and economic decisionmaking turkmenistan faces clan and provincial tensions and widespread poverty that could contribute to instability uzbekistan faces escalating civil discontent and violence from those whom president islam karimov labels as islamic extremists from large ethnic tajik population and from an impoverished citizenry ethnic uzbeks and kyrgyz clashed in 1990 in the fergana valley this fertile valley is divided between kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan and contains about on efifth of central asias population all the states are harmed by drug and human trafficking and associated corruption and health problems despite these problems turkmenistans oil and gas wealth could contribute to its longterm stability also its location at locus of silk road trade routes potentially could increase its economic security uzbekistans large population and many resources including oil natural gas and gold could provide basis for its stable development and security kyrgyzstans emerging civil society could facilitate entrepreneurial activity and good governance which eventually might permit the country to increase its budgetary expenditures for defense and security it would seem that affinities among the current regional elites would facilitate cooperative ties many of the officials in the states learned common language russian and were communist party members in actuality however regional cooperation has been halting the vast majority of the people in the central asian states suffered steep declines in their quality of life in the first few years after the dissolut ion of the soviet union the gap widened between the rich and poor accentuating social tensions and potential instability social services such as health and education inadequate during the soviet period declined further in the new century however negative trends in poverty and health have been reversed in much of central asia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30294g5g142g151g157g155g138g149g561g3g156g146g138g514g156g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g497g561g11g156g156g158g142g156

far below that of western countries2 lingering poverty could exacerbate social tensions separatism and extremism although large percentages of the states populations remain employed in the agricultural sector where economic gyrations have been somewhat buffered this sector has surfeit of manpower however and cannot readily absorb new workers as the populations continue to increase substantial outmigration by many workers to russia and the return of remittances to relatives in central asia have somewhat eased poverty and tension russias equitable treatment of such guest workers has been major issue in diplomacy between the regional states and moscow 3 g11g156g149g138g150g146g140g561g7g161g157g155g142g150g146g156g150g561 calls for government to be based on sharia islamic law and the koran are supported by small but increasing minorities in most of central asia most of central asias muslims appear to support the concept of secular government but the influence of fundamentalist salafist and extremist islamic groups is growing 4 tajikistans civil conflict where the issue of islam in political life contributed to strife has been pointed to by several other central asian states to justify crackdowns they also point to russias conflict with its breakaway chechnya region and other areas in russias north caucasus as evidence of the growing threat in many cases government crackdowns ostensibly aimed against islamic extremism have masked clan political and religious repression in some regions of central asia such as uzbekistans portion of the fergana valley some uzbeks kept islamic practices alive throughout the repressive soviet period and some now oppose the secularoriented uzbek government islamic extremist threats to the regimes may well increase as economic distress continues heavy unemployment and poverty rates among youth in the fergana valley are widely cited by observers as making youth more vulnerable to recruitment into religious extremist organizations 5 although much of the attraction of islamic extremism in central asia is generated by factors such as poverty and discontent it is facilitated by groups in afghanistan pakistan saudi arabia and elsewhere that provide funding education training and manpower to the region some of these ties were at least partially disrupted by the usled coalition actions in afghanistan and the us call for worldwide cooperation in combating terrorism 6 the central asian states impose several controls over religious freedom all except tajikistan forbid religious parties

literature and sermons according to some analysts the close government religious control may leave spiritual gulf that underground radical islamic groups seek to fill officials in uzbekistan believe that the country is increasingly vulnerable to islamic extremism and they have been at the forefront in central asia in combating this threat reportedly thousands of alleged islamic extremists have been imprisoned and many mosques have been closed restrictions were tightened when the legislature in 1998 passed law on freedom of worship banning all unregistered faiths censoring religious writings and making it crime to teach religion without license the uzbek legislature also approved amendments to the criminal code increasing punishments for setting up leading or participating in religious

often linked to islamic extremism some analysts caution that many activities the regimes label as terroristsuch as hijacking kidnapping robbery assault and murderare often carried out by individuals or groups for economic benefit or for revenge rather than for political purposes also socalled counterterrorism may mask repressive actions against religious or political opponents of the regime 7 us

delineation russia because of concerns that it would be conceding that kazakhstans heavily ethnic russian northern regions are part of kaza khstan and kazakhstan because of concerns that delineation might inflame separatism in 1998 russia established border patrols along its 4200 mile border with kazakhstan for security reasons and determined to delineate the border by late 2004 most of the russiankazakh border had been delimited to head off separatist proclivities in the north kazakhstan reorganized administrative borders in northern regions to dilute the influence of ethnic russians

with kyrgyzstan and tajikistan in 1999 intending to protect it against terrorist incursions but in fact leading to many civilian kyrgyz and tajik casualties kyrgyzstan has demanded that uzbekistan clear mines it has sown along the borders including some allegedly sown on kyrgyz territory but uzbekistan has asserted that it will maintain the minefields to combat terrorism kyrgyzstan too has raised tensions by sowing mines and blowing up mountain passes along its borders with tajikistan border tensions between uzbekistan and turkmenistan also flared in late 2002 after turkmenistan accused

at the end of 2004 in an attempt to get higher gas price but settled for allcash rather than partial barter payments in early 2006 turkmenistan again requested higher gas prices from russia because russias statecontrolled gazprom gas firm had raised the price it charged for customers receiving the gas that it had purchased from turkmenistan in june 2006 turkmenistan threatened to cut off gas shipments at the end of july unless gazprom agreed to price increase from 65 per 35314 thousand cubic feet to 100 for the rest of 2006 in early september 2006 gazprom agreed to pay 100 per 35314

requested still another price increase and the two sides agreed on price of 130 per 35314 thousand cubic feet for the first half of 2008 and 150 for the remainder of 2008 and price thereafter based on market principles seeking alternatives turkmenistan in late 1997 opened 125mile gas pipeline from turkmen gas field to the iranian pipeline system for use in northern iran turkmenistan provided 2825 bcf of gas to iran in 2006 and reportedly larger amount in 2007 at the end of 2007 however turkmenistan suddenly suspended gas shipments causing hardship in northern iran the national iranian gas company allegedly termed the suspension immoral behavior and iranian legislators also criticized turkmenistan it was widely reported in iranian media that turkmen demands for higher payments were the

proposals from the psg consortium formed to build the tran scaspian leg of the pipeline turkmenistans efforts to interest investors in building gas pipeline through afghanistan to pakistan have been unsuccessful because of the afghan governments uncertain control over its territory and questions about turkmenistans stability according to some analysts kazakhstans development of multiple oil

although there were some signs in 2005 that perhaps the tide was beginning to turn in combating drugs according to the state department the city of osh in particular is primary transfer point for narcotics into uzbekistan and kazakhstan and on to markets in russia western europe and to minor extent the united states tajikistan claimed to seize more illicit drugs in 2006 than the previous year but the amounts smuggled also had increased 48 turkmenistan is centrally located for smuggling opiates from afghanistan and iran northward and westward but its somewhat successful efforts to control smuggling may have persuaded some smugglers to use the tajik route instead however largescale smugglers may use bribes and links to turkmen officials to facilitate trafficking through turkmenistan heroin use is widespread in smoked form increasing the need for antidrug education and drug treatment in uzbekistan the national center for drug control attempts to coordinate antidrug efforts carried

states particularly toward uzbekistan he stated that russia had careful relations with them since they were still weak and vulnerable instead of trying to impose standards on them he argued that i

and investment strengthen the independence of the states and their openness to the west and forestall russian or chinese attempts to resubjugate the region those who object to more forward us policy toward central asia argue that the united states has historically had few interests in this region and that as peace is established in afghanistan the region again will be less important to us interests they advocate limited us involvement undertaken along with turkey and other friends and coalition partners to ensure general us goals of preventing strife fostering democratization and regional cooperation and improving human rights and the quality of life some objections to forward us policy might appear less salient given september 11 2001 and other recent developments for instance it longer seems possible to argue that antiwestern islamic extremism will never threaten secular regimes or otherwise harm us interests

september 11 2001 transformed the us security relationship with central asia as the region actively supported usled coalition antiterrorism efforts in afghanistan these efforts were top us national security concern but major question is how the region may be regarded if afghanistan becomes more stable some observers advocate maintaining the us security relationship even if afghanistan becomes more stable and the threat of qaeda and other terrorism based in the area recedes they stress that central asia was host to sovietera weapons of mass destruction and associated research and development facilities and that residual technologies materials and personnel might fall prey to terrorist states or groups they view military education and training programs as fostering the creation of professional westernstyle military and democratic civilmilitary relations and reducing chances of military coups training that these militaries receive through pfp is multinational in scope involving cooperation among regional militaries with the purpose of spurring these states to continue to work together they also argue that as iran increases its military capabilities including missiles and possibly nuclear weapons the central asian states may necessarily seek closer countervailing ties with the united states they argue that major dilemma of current policy is that while the united states proclaims vital interests in the region it also states that military basing arrangements are temporary this makes the us commitment appear uncertain spurring the central asian states to continue their search for security ties with other outside powers these analysts warn continued support independence friendly relations conflict resolution democracy free markets integration with the

central asia is also topical before uzbekistan requested in mid2005 that the united states vacate k2 it seemed that some in the administration emphasized the strategic importan ce of building ties with uzbekistan others emphasized ties with kazakhstan in the case of uzbekistan its central location in the region and sizeable population and other resources including energy were stressed energy and other resources were also stressed in the case of kazakhstan as well as its huge territory and lengthy borders some observers argued that uzbekistan was more likely to become unstable because of its more authoritarian government so was less suitable us strategic partner recently it appears that the administration is emphasizing security ties with kazakhstan some observers argue that kazakhstans long border with russia makes it likely to continue close security ties with russia 91 critics of greater us security involvement in the region argue that the united states should primarily seek to encourage regional demilitarization they oppose providing formal security guarantees to regional states and urge the pullout of us bases once the taliban threat has abated and qaeda largely rousted from afghanistan some analysts warn that increased us engagement in the region including military basing is unlikely to soon turn the countries into free market democracies and will link the united states to the regimes in the eyes of the local populations this may exacerbate antiamerican islamic extremism place us personnel in danger stretch us military capabilities and antagonize china and russia longterm us basing in the region could in particular harm usrussia ties by giving russian hardliners ammunition in their efforts to encourage president putin to take harder

although central asias leaders have appeared to counterpose stability to democratization and opted for stability except perhaps in kyrgyzstan the bush administration and other observers generally have viewed the two concepts as complementary particularly in the long term in recent years the bush administration has appeared to place greater diplomatic emphasis on democratization in the region in parallel with policy toward iraq and the wider middle east to some degree this emphasis has tracked with increased congressional concerns over human rights conditions in central asia according to some critics the administrations protests over human rights abuses at andijon contributed to the loss of us military access to k2 and other security ties with uzbekistan these critics suggest th at simultaneous emphases on democratization and security ties proved corrosive to both goals and that the united states instead should carefully engage with the central asian states to maintain important security relationships and cautiously encourage them to eventually emulate the positive features of turkish or other islamic democracies 93 supporters of the administrations reaction to the events at

russia without allowing it undue influence this concern is most evident in kazakhstan and uzbekistan kazakhstan because of its shared 4200 mile border with russia and its relatively large ethnic russian population is highly vulnerable to russian influence uzbekistan is interested in asserting its own regional power alternatively tajikistans president rakhmanov has relied to some extent on russian security assistance to stay in power russias behavior in central asia partly depends on alternative futures of russian domestic politics though regardless of scenario russia will retain some economic and other influence in the region as legacy of the political and transport links developed during tsarist and soviet times the longterm impact of september 11 2001 on russias influence over the central asian states depends on the duration and scope of us and coalition presence in the region russias countervailing polices and the fate of afghanistan prior to september 11 2001 the putin administration had tried to strengthen russias interests in the region while opposing the growth of us and other influence after september 11 2001 uzbekistan reaffirmed its more assertive policy of lessening its security dependence on russia by granting conditional overflight rights and other support to the usled coalition nudging reluctant putin regime to accede to coalition presence in the region in keeping with russias own support to the northern alliance to combat the taliban russias other reasons for permitting the increased coalition presence included its interests in boosting some economic and other ties to the west and its hope of regaining influence in posttaliban afghanistan on september 19 2001 russian foreign minister igor ivanov indicated that the nature of support given by the central asian states to the usled coalition was up to each state and president putin reiterated this point on september 24 2001 giving russias accedence to cooperation between these states and the united states russia cooperated with central asia in supporting us and coalition efforts including by quickly sending military equipment and advisors to assist the northern alliance in attacks on the taliban russian officials have emphasized interests in strategic security and economic ties with central asia and concerns over the treatment of ethnic russians strategic concerns have focused on drug trafficking and regional conflict and the regions role as buffer to islamic extremism russias economic decline in the 1990s and demands by central asia caused russia to reduce its security presence president putin may have reversed this trend although the picture is mixed about 11000 russian border troops mostly ethnic tajiks under russian command formerly defended cis borders in

in late 1999 the last russian military advisors left turkmenistan in 1999 uzbekistan withdrew from the cst citing its ineffectiveness and obtrusiveness russia justified 1999 military base accord with

cst summit approved the creation of central asian rapid deployment force composed at least on paper of nine russian kazakh kyrgyz and tajik countrybased battalions of 4000 troops and headquarters in bishkek this initiative seemed in part aimed to protect russian regional influence in the face of nascent us and nato antiterrorism moves in the region regional branch of the cis antiterrorism center composed of intelligence agencies opened in bishkek kyrgyzstan in january 2002 this organization reportedly has proven ineffective in sharing intelligence data russias threats of preemptive strikes against the taliban prompted them in may 2000 to warn the central asian states of reprisals if they permitted russia to use their bases for strikes at the june 2000 u srussia summit the two presidents agreed to set up working group to examine afghanrelated terrorism and the group held two meetings prior to september 11 2001 these events prior to september 11 2001 helped to ease the way for russian

its troop presence in tajikistan by reported 1500 in midjune 2002 russia also signed military accords with kyrgyzstan extending leases on military facilities to fifteen years including amazingly naval test base opening shuttered kyrgyz defense industries and training kyrgyz troops most significantly kyrgyzstan also agreed that its kant airfield outside its capital of bishkek could be used as base

million ethnic turkmen residing in afghanistan and its hopes for possible energy pipelines through afghanistan led it to stress workable relations with both the taliban and the successor government tajikistan was especially challenged by the talibans growing power taliban victory in afghanistan threatened to present it with regimes in both the north uzbekistan and south afghanistan that pressed for undue influence iran and uzbekistan backed different sides in the tajik civil war but both opposed the taliban in afghanistan tajik opposition ties with iran provided friction with the taliban

the signing of framework agreement in december 2002 by the late president niyazov afghan president hamed karzai and pakistans prime minister mir zafarullah khan the problems of drug production in afghanistan and trafficking through central asia have increased however in part because the afghan government remains weak despite the hopeful success of the 2004 presidential and 2005 legislative
