6204c17 shspec133 how and why auditing works the twopole nature of the universe has to do with why auditing works there is mathematics connected with it developed by buckminster fuller dimaxian geometry this proves that the universe could not exist without two poles the lowest level of observation is being something at this level you cannot see something because you are being it know thyself has been introduced as trap for thetans the only way you could know yourself seemingly would be to view yourself but then how could you be yourself the very definition of observation appears to involve the communication formula duplication but how can you duplicate something without an intervening space between the thing and its duplicate unless you are asising the thing so unless observation is asising it must involve space and therefore separateness the gpm contains in it anything you need to know about the nature of problems problems are balanced forces in opposition hung up in time world war i for instance in gpm the intentions of one kind of beingness oppose the intentions of another type of beingness exactly equally if two sides of problem are not equal they dont hang up because one side overwhelms the other this is rare situation hence the fewness of items person has been many more beings than are in the gpm the gpm stays with person because of the balanced timeless quality of it there is also free track which can contain engrams that can be run out the gpm is the unfree track it is really quite unlikely that two valences would balance like that they would tend to get unbalanced or wear out but gpms are stuck in pt each gpm has lots of minds in it each with an accumulation of locks if each valence had two hundred lock items and gpm had say twenty packages in it you would have four thousand minds in the gpm the locks can be just as effective as the items themselves the lot of it plus the free track on both sides is the reactive mind running free track unravels lot but never quits explains everything packages composed of terminal and oppterm tend to lock up the rest of the track other things collide with them right in the middle you have the waterbuck and the tiger adjacent is the priest and the vestal virgin then there is god and the devil all these oppositions each pair perfectly balanced accumulate to themselves other identities that are hanging around and you get collapsed track these are represented in the bank by spherical masses inside each spherical mass there are compartments of thought because the person usually had head in which he did his thinking so the gpm tends to approximate head with thinkthinkthink in the middle of it and it is usually empty all through the gpm there are little compartments with ideas in them so you get trapped thought ideas enclosed by force these can be dramatized when spherical shapes are counterposed against other spherical shapes these things are hung up one against the other to such degree that neither one can go away this is the final material form the gpm takes all this comes down to fixated attention concentration upon the oppterm electronically power can be generated until you have two poles fixed in separate positions in space the mind is composed of energy which exists in space and condenses down to masses in the reactive mind there is time all time is now we must assume that if we have flows electrical masses current standing waves etc there must be two poles involved otherwise there would be flows people would never have somatics this has lot to do with cchs auditing is effective only in the presence of at least two poles this doesnt mean you cant ever selfaudit but it does mean that when you do it effectively you have two poles the pc who never cognites is bugaboo to auditors he is running on one pole pole that has thought in the middle of it and standing energy waves outside of it he is in the thought area and he keeps running through the energy when he has ideas they are the ones packaged in that thought zone he is being that mass not viewing it he is not viewing another mass either he is also not viewing the auditor he is being something and observing nothing only if he can observe other things will he make gains because then he has another role if he is just being that one thing he will be unable to change it would be ok if he could view something like glass there he would have two poles he could asis the cigarette lighter in this situation you would get tons arm action also in session if you can get the pc to look at the auditor you have twopole situation if that isnt happening you get change on cchs on 3dxx you will get ta action as long as the pc can look at the masses in his mind giving at least two poles there are two ways cchs could be run 1 dummox style the auditor makes the machinery work to do the process this will still produce results in 500 hours or so 2 right style get the pcs attention on the auditor and the environment by maintaining 2wc with the pc you handle the pcs attention towards his mind by taking every twitch as an origin this gets him to look at what he is doing and exteriorizes him from it then you can get change because he is looking at what he has teen and done and isnt still being it it is good idea to key out as many masses as you can before starting 3dxx you want to key out looks inverted loops etc you dont want to mess around with this in 3dxx otherwise he is always dramatizing these locks and has ptps when the pc is listing items he has been every one of those items or raised hell with them in getting him to list you have made him exteriorize to some degree from say five hundred identities the one the pc is being in pt does not discharge because he is being it if he wasnt in it it would discharge and quit reading this is the one that hangs up in time the hardest the oppterm is what he is concentrated on now you have twopole situation right there in the bank and the two will start to discharge the thing that makes the gpm hard to tie down and makes 3dxx sometimes hard to do is that he is obsessively being the internal items and sometimes so slightly being the initial ones you find that sometimes the terminal and the oppterm are widely separated in the gpm early on commonly you get terminal and plausible oppterm only there are twelve items between before they meet each other when they dont hit square on the nose and go poof you have intervening packages the pc has noknowingness of his beingness he may think that he is being man but actually he is being waterbuck andor tiger ask joe why he is biting his fingernails hell say oh am i he never thinks to ask himself who or what would bite fingernails it is probably to scratch out waterbucks eyes person starts worrying about himselves well he has to step back and look all processes are exteriorization processes just exteriorize the pc from different things cchs make pt comfortable enough so the pc can exteriorize from various parts of the past in which he has been sitting for trillenia cchs dont go all the way but the pc sure feels like they do all the way up from cchs to 3dxx you have twopole situation first with the pc as an object then on up to the pc being being stepping back to look at mass on routine 1 we were exteriorizing somatic the pc exteriorized as mass 3dxx exteriorizes people out of past identities the pc hasnt even been in his head for an incalculable period of time if you run cchs smoothly and correctly the pc can asis old facsimiles and come gradiently out of old bits and pieces of the past he goes through sequence of exteriorizations it shifts the bank and the pc feels better about pt when we have him as close to pt as possible he should move on to 3dxx he will come out of masses as mass duplicating those identities ta action comes from the pc looking at something whether or not he is being something else feelingness is lowerscale substitute far lookingness touchyfeelies work for that reason knowing this you could invent some new cchs but these would only be as good as they cause twopole situation to exist in the session you must keep directing the pcs attention to his bank or else he will never come out of the bank for any think process to work the pc has to be one mass in his mind looking at another mass in his mind when you have that you can have ta in the cchs the auditor and the environment act as the other pole if the auditor audits cchs like steam engine they will work even then but more slowly than when the auditor makes pt ok to the pc on cchs you must 1 keep pt attractive to the pc 2 do them precisely 3 keep in 2wc 4 keep the pcs attention on what is happening with his somatics if you do these things the pc will just sail on the cchs they are not slow process they are very fast process an instant before somatic turns on the pc is being it then when he feels it he is exterior from it so you are setting up twopole situation in the bank by getting the pc to exteriorize sufficiently to stop being the somatic and to see it in 3dxx you are finding out what the pc has been and when he sees it he ceases to be it 3dxx exteriorizes the pc from the past identities he has been and does this in assessing very fast it is like telephone poles flying past he has been in every one of the items he gives you you can actually thus kick pc out of his bank you will only get ta action as long as the pc is looking at something or at least feeling something ta action twopole situation you are doing something wrong
