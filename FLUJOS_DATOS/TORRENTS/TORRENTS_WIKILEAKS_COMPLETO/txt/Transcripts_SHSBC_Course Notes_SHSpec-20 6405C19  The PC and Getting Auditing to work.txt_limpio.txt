6405c19 shspec20 the pc and getting auditing to work any auditor who is having hard time making auditing work has mystery about how auditing can occur whether he knows it or not he has assigned some value to auditing that is different from and extraneous to the actual value of auditing he looks for something more complicated than what is there if student is having trouble third of the time it will resolve if you ask him why auditing doesnt work and remove that barrier to his understanding of why it does work the session will be unmanageable to the auditor if he has trouble with his comm cycle doesnt understand why auditing works and the pc introduces normal or extreme amounts of randomity into the session with his own outcommcycle as an instructor you have to get as much confusion out of this as possible person who cant get auditing to work is likely to have hidden standards you can ask why doesnt auditing work and why does auditing work and 2wc it person cant understand why it works because he understands why it doesnt work and he is caught in this discussing why auditing doesnt work is not quite auditing because you are taking ta blowdowns on what he has told you and getting him to relate these blowdowns to the question of why auditing doesnt work you are steering him towards cognition that will straighten out his auditing another third of the time you can fix the erring auditor by getting him to discuss help you do rot get him to discuss failed help because you will run into the line plot he may spot some weird stable datum on help that impedes his ability to help or be helped take up whatever bds you get independently and clean them up so he will start using the comm cycle the comm cycle is almost too easy to use as long as the auditors intention towards the pc is good and he is trying to assist the pc the things that make person unable to use the comm cycle are those things that make person believe that he cannot or should not assist pcs who get ta action also have one of these buttons awry so this procedure works well on pcs too the third category is more esoteric it is very interesting it could be called life among the lowly this was the subtitle of uncle toms cabin people who are being hounded by life who are under duress tend to offer up supersympathy and grief at the same time that they are knocking someones head off there is mechanism here by which the lowly hold the lowly down which is pretty vicious it is the poor you mechanism how you he or they were wronged it is the victim syndrome you are victim this is the common denominator of sociology it is why someone can never get out of the slum it is how people get trapped we had this ourselves in the early days of dianetics lrh got away from it seeing that if you cant take responsibility for your own actions if you cant recognize the cause of your own difficulties then you are in trap and will continue in trap forevermore for any war against poverty to be effective it would have to contain an understanding of why people in groups remain poor an individual must accept his own responsibility and his own ability as cause before he can run off his overts you cant get off overts if you cant recognize yourself as cause you cant get out of rat race unless you recognize your overts you keep someone in rat race if you dont let him recognize his overts eg by saying poor you look how you have been wronged you are telling the person that he was incapable of cause you are directing his attention to moments when he was not at cause and pointing out to him that he doesnt cause things they just happen to him you put him into the dwindling spiral and hold him on the bottom of the heap forever by convincing him that he has been wronged and that he himself never wronged anybody you never had chance how does person become obsessed with problem obsessed with problem describes 90 of your pcs they are stuck in some problem via the om sequence they never recognize their own overt in the area so they get stuck in it there are several systems that can be used to unpin them chief among these is the ow system you cant get your hand cut off in buzzsaw without reaching for the buzzsaw and somehow putting yourself in the vicinity of the buzzsaw invented overts as in guilt complex that is just another alteris so watch out for this and be sure that the pc doesnt give you untruths all dwellingness on subject is associated with overts against that subject you cure it with one or another version of ow this is something that is part and parcel of life which is senior in its power even to gpms you could be free of gpms and still be subject to the consequences of your overts so it is always safe and indicated to audit ow auditors do this industriously but not always well they can make complete mess of it chopping comm cycles buying trivia as overts having mutual outruds etc the reason tacit consent enters auditing when it does is because of the victim syndrome mentioned above it has entered the session to some degree when this happens there is some thread of poor you youve been wronged in the session if the auditor sits there and buys motivators he is not auditing the pc at cause he is auditing the pc at effect and so the pc will not get better nothing can hold onto thetan if he gets caught he must have grabbed hold and forgotten that he has grabbed hold to be trapped what he grabbed hold with is overts it is his own actual gpms that are holding him if you dont get him to spot his overts you are dramatizing life amongst the lowly the reason why people cannot get out of slums the victim syndrome slums operate on the basis of you cant do anything about it luck is all that can help how you have been wronged etc that is why you see numbers rackets and lucky charms in slums you cant do anything is the message of social welfare labor relations the war on poverty etc thetan basically doesnt want to commit overt acts when he does commit them he pulls himself back and withholds himself how does this affect the auditor who cant audit it is not as simple as they believe that they have been wronged so you have to get their overts off it is that this person has been so wronged that he has longer any concept of an overt the christian ran into this from another angle with the idea of repentance he wanted people to admit guilt which is an inversion people get off false overts in an effort to repent enough this doesnt free them the guilt complex leads to an inversion where the person isnt getting off actual overts but is really bragging about overts that he would never have the guts to commit dont let the pc do this check for untruths if guy is in victim valence you get him to define an overt act and then get him to tell you why it isnt an overt you will get an automaticity there is reality on it as an overt act so you have to follow the reality scale and find something possibly quite mild that he knows and feels is real overt act do this on discussion basis getting why it wasnt an overt act not as an auditing action once you get something the person really considers to have been an overt act you might run out his justifications for having done it see hcob 7ju164 scientology iii and iv justifications and hcob 8ju164 scientology iii and iv more justifications you then proceed on gradient nobody in prison has ever committed crime
