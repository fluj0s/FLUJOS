government and its in ternational partners have become increasingly aware that issues and challenges surrounding subnational governance in afghanistan are cru cial to national development stability and security this period has also been time of ex traordinary change in subnational governance structures with the election of provincial councils the establishment of provincial develop ment committees pdcs increases in public administrative reform par efforts and the expansion of the national solidarity programme nsp into large number of communities to assess the changes produced by these devel opments and reform efforts and to address the need for an improved understanding of subnational governance areu conducted extensive field and policy research on subnational govern ance beginning in april 2005 this research built on prior areu work on subnational administra tion nsp and par the research objectives were to better understand how governance works in afghanistan at subnational levels and in particular governance domains to understand how governance is changing at subnational levels particularly in re sponse to programmatic interventions fieldwork was carried out in six provinces over an 18month period and covered issues at the provincial district and community level this synthesis paper presents findings from this research programme it identifies and analyses key issues affecting statebuilding interventions at subnational levels and their implications for current and future governance programming key findings and recommendations the lack of subnational governance policy to date statebuilding at subnational levels in afghanistan has been characterised by the lack of subnational governance policy instead disparate initiatives have been introduced in re sponse to pressures relate d to the political tran sition but without suffici ent reference to their relation to the whole the nsp the election of provincial councils and the formation of pdcs all responded to particular dynamics and pressures but did not emerge as part of subna tional governance framework that coherently connected resources responsibilities and accountability while broad strategy is emerging through the ands proce ss this strategy is forced to accommodate the range of initiatives and activities that have been layered onto the subnational governance landscape over the past five years these initiatives have produced some very im portant gains in increasing the presence of the afghan state in the provinces and districts of the country but some fundamental aspects of the nature of that state remain unresolved in such situation the management of expecta tions on the part of the population is made dra matically more difficult and the perceptions of afghan people are more vulnerable to the ob served inadequacies of the overall framework recommendations the reform of different subnational govern ance structures in afghanistan must be sidered together the independent director ate for local governance idlg may present an opportunity in this regard if it can take the leading role in coordinating the dispa rate efforts at community district provincial and municipal level it must do so in close collaboration with other institutions of the afghan state and society the idlg must pay attention not only to the imperatives of executive summary to date statebuilding at subnational levels in afghanistan has been characterised by the lack of subnational governance policy subnational statebuilding in afghanistan v shortterm stabilisation and security but also dedicate sufficient material and intel lectual resources to comprehensive policy development over the next few years the most important aspect of this policy velopment process is not to do everything in one office but to ensure that more logical sequence of initiatives emerges crucial area for sequencing involves the determination of the relationship between representa tion resources and accountability for elected bodies at all levels the corresponding reform of electoral systems and calen dars and the holding of the next elections implementation of subnational governance programmes nationallevel statebuilding initiatives produce wide variety of outcomes due to the varied political social economic and institutional environments in the country as well as the differ ent actors responsible for implementation the outcomes of nsp particularly its governance implications are therefore widely varying the idea of consistent persistent institution of the cdc that operates in the same way every where is not yet accurate pdcs introduced to bring consistency to chaotic coordination and planning environment in actuality range from quite effective to insignificant recommendations nationallevel statebuilding should not ways be equated with uniform nationallevel programmes new institutions should be given adaptive and open architectures to accommodate asymmetrical roles and development across the country and over time the implications on that flexibility of any legislative action on cdcs should be carefully considered and overly prescriptive so lutions should be avoided in the shortterm the positing of national policy choice be tween formal or informal systems is an arti ficial one as both will invariably coexist programmes should be oriented toward creating effective and viable alternatives to unsuitable aspects of the current govern ance arrangements attempting to entirely replace such arrangements will only produce perverse outcomes barriers to reform and the art of the possible there is fundamental duality to the system of government in afghanistan on the one hand government of relationships operates through the system of provincial and district governors it functions through mixture of informal and formal gubernatorial powers over expenditures coordination appointments and control of access to state bodies and functions this system has had important roles in managing the influ ence of local powerholders in extending the reach of the presidency and in meeting various shortterm counterinsurgency counter terrorism and counternar cotics needs on the other hand the primary formal mechanism for the delivery of services other than security to the population is through system of vertically independent and highly centralised ministries the interaction between these two systems has yet to receive sufficient attention recommendations the relationship between governors and po lice chiefs and the servicedelivery arms of the government must be progressively defined and circumscribed in law and practice this may have to occur at varying pace in varying locations and must recognise the importance of local leadership in producing results in the remote areas of afghanistan central aspect of this process will be bal anced and gradual reexamination of the place of governors at both provincial and district level this reexamination should not be seen as weakening or removal of gov ernors or simply search for the right or good governors it must instead involve an appraisal of the legal and actual power of governors in relation to the systems by areu synthesis paper series vi which they are made accountable to the population reform and deconcentration of service delivery responsibilities of the service delivery arms of the state should be signed to reduce the confusion caused by these coexisting forms of governance for mally integrating the role of governors with rationalised forms of servicedelivery representative bodies involve aspects of both systems of governance and can thus play more important role in reducing the contradictions between the two strengthen ing both the representative basis and the monitoring role of subnational elected bod ies should be priority developing subnational governance policy the piecemeal statebuilding efforts of the past must be knitted together and altered where necessary into fabric of subnational governance this framework must be guided by coher ent and nationallyagreed goals about the na ture role and reach of the afghan state this kind of holistic view cannot emerge through single consultation but must be arrived at through series of carefully sequenced steps and it must always consider the possibility of varying progress and future changes to the sign this process is not matter of single programme or given institutional design it is journey toward state in which legitimacy is gradually strengthened through effectiveness and accountability reach is extended through legitimacy and sustainability is gradually cre ated through efficiency and steadfast support to coherent and comprehensive vision recommendations range of disparate subnational governance issues must be brought into single policydevelopment framework the institutional focus of this policy process should be the idlg in interaction with the partners out lined in the idlg strategic framework the idlg must work to insulate this longer term process from the demands of short term security and stabilisation initiatives and work to ensure that contradictions are minimised s om is th t mu s t b in clu ded i n thi s policy include the number and nature of elected bodies their access to resources and the system by which they are elected the relationship between those elected bodies and the governors at provincial and district levels the eventual nature of provincial and national budgeting and its relation to both elected bodies and governors should be developed before elections even if not fully established the final status of municipalities and the system of accountability for their important revenueraising and servicedelivery functions needs to be progressively narrowed and codified planning at subnational levels must correspond to the resources available there and the procedures for allocating those resources in the long run consultative planning structures as presently being constituted will not substitute for the representative accountability brought about by elected representation and the role of prts and locally implemented governance initiatives in the overall strategy should be progressively subjected to this national policy process the key to answering these questions is to establish process by which they can be re s l ve d i n s q u n ce t h t i s c n d u ci ve t coherent policy subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 1 1 introduction issues and challenges surrounding subnational governance in afghanistan are crucial to the countrys development stability and security the period since 2004 has been time of ex traordinary change in subnational governance structures during 200506 provincial councils shuraiwolayati were elected and seated provincial development committees pdcs were established public administrative reform efforts reached some provinces and districts and the national solidarity programme nsp with its associated community development councils cdcs expanded into large numbers of communities throughout afghanistan the centrality of governance and statebuilding issues to the development agenda of both the afghan government and its international part ners in combination with the number and com plexity of initiatives affecting subnational governance have created need for improved understandings of governance at subnational levels there is need to assess what changes the new developments have produced and will produce in the future to address this situation areu conducted extensive field research on subnational governance over approximately 18 months from april 2005 to november 2006 this synthesis paper presents findings from that re search the research on subnational governance has benefited from previous and parallel areu work on subnational administration the nsp and public administration reform par 1 these re search projects gene rated some important knowledge about technical aspects of subnational administration the implementation of specific programmes and reforms and the challenges to both these studies have since been supplemented by important work by other or ganisations and combined they provide broad overview of the evolving formal institutional landscape at subnational level 2 this report complements that knowledge with insight into the political dimensions of the intro duction of new state structures at the provincial district and community levels it provides picture of the interaction between state building initiatives during the research period and the complex realities of afghanistan it is hoped that this picture will inform policy makers about the outcomes on the ground of governance programming and statebuilding ef forts and help them to anticipate future chal lenges it is also intended that this research can complement the ongoing process of developing national policy and framework for subnational governance in afghanistan 11 background and rationale an emphasis on governance in general and democratic governance in particular is now central feature of development practice and discourse increasing attention is paid interna tionally to issues of local governance and communitydriven developm ent much of this attention however focuses on decentralisation or technical aspects of administrative reform areas that are significantly complicated by the afghan political consti tutional institutional economic and security contexts 3 the

synthesis paper series 2 tual dimensions of subnational governance have received less attention in the international velopment literature than technical ones at the same time there is broad recognition that context greatly influences the outcomes of sub national statebuilding initiatives in fact attempts to create governance institutions that are functional legitimate and sustainable through external assistance have frequently failed stagnated or produced perverse out comes when confronted by the complex realities of postconflict and conflict settings this attention to governance has been reflected in successive strategic frameworks for reconstruction and development in afghanistan since 2001 the 2002 national development frame work ndf identified good governance admin istrative reform and financial management as key crosscutting issues underlying development efforts in all sectors position reflected in the march 2004 update and recosting exercise curing afghanistans future saf 4 both the interim afghanistan na tional development strategy iands and the afghanistan compact with the international community emphasise the need to improve governan ce across the country and at all levels of the state highlighting issues such as local participation improved subna tional administration and service delivery and local access to justice the world bank consid ers statebuilding to be at the core of afghani stans reconstruction 5 the governance rule of law and human rights pillar of the iands sets out to to establish the basic institutions and practices of democratic governance at the national provincial district and village levels for enhanced human development by the end of the current presidency and national assembly terms 6 most recently the independent directorate of local governance idlg was established by presidential decree on 30 august 2007 to take broad responsibility for administration and creation of policy frameworks for subnational governance in afghani stan 7 while significant progress has been made to wards establishing new institutions many issues remain in making subnational governance structures sustainable coherent and effective enough to meet the iands goal the revival of subnational administrative structures and recent changes still confront problems of persistent insecurity informal power relations corruption and patronage and inadequate state capacity beyond these contextual difficulties the devel opment of legitimate and effective subnational governance will increasingly depend on coherent strategy incorporating shared vision of the role of subnational government entities in vari ous sectors and their relations with nonstate actors and informal governance arrangements 12 key concepts given the attention paid to governance issues internationally and in afghanistan it is worth clarifying the conceptual framework used in this research by briefly discussing the concept of governance as well as related concepts like centralisation and statebuilding governance governance concerns ways of organising re sources and responsibilities toward collective ends at this broad level governance can be defined as the process whereby societies or organisations make important decisions determine whom they involv and how they render account 8 all governance analysis therefore involves

25 february 2 008 subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 3 accountability the analysis of how governance takes place however is not meaningful without considering the context an d domain that is be ing analysed in short one must always consider the question of governance where and for what this research examines several subna tional contexts that is how decisions are made and implemented that affect populations below the national level the contexts that have been examined are the community the district and the province the governance domain refers to the collec tive ends that are the object of governance these can include broad range of public and quasipublic goods such as security health and education an enabling economic environment including infrastructure social capital and regulation and more intrinsic values such as justice citizenship and legitimacy 9 this study focuses on several domains of govern ance based on two criteria what types of decisions are currently made in given subnational context which of these governance processes are likely to be changing given current interven tions the domains that are the focus of the research were chosen from among those where subnational governance was both active and changing due to attempts at statebuilding interventions on the provincial level these domains are provincial development coordination and planning on the one hand and representation and ac countability on the other at district level they are primarily conflict resolution and justice in communities they are dispute resolution and community development with some attention to related areas such as social protection governance systems may differ depending on the domain considered for example the gov ernance of security in given context may involve local commanders state security actors and international military and police personnel each with mixture of goals responsibilities and resources the governance of health provi sion will be different perhaps involving ngos provincial or regional health departments international donors and traditional local actors governance analysis thus goes beyond analysis of government to include range of actors structures and processes 10 it is this distinction that is important in helping understand better the outcomes of formal institutional statebuilding programmes when they are imple mented in the real world and the political eco nomic factors that may support or hinder the success of such efforts statebuilding statebuilding refers to efforts to increase the importance of state actors structures and processes in governance systems to shift govern ance towards government it is the attempt to reform build and support government institutions making them more effective in generating the abovementioned public goods since govern ance systems are configuration of resources and responsibilities there will always be inter ests in both generating and resisting changes to that configuration statebuilding is inherently political as well as technical the gap between these political and technical dimensions can be compounded by the urgent imperatives of postconflict reconstruction which reduce the abil ity to tailor programmes to local realities and the easier transferability of technical lessons than complex political or cultural ones 11 ma jor theme of this report is the interaction be tween the political and technical dimensions of statebuilding 9 see for example i johnson redefin ing the concept of governance gatineau quebec canadian international

state building governance and world or der in the twentyfirst century london profile books 2004 areu synthesis paper series 4 one aim of this research was to analyse issues that emerge when statebuilding interventions in subnational governance contexts interact with the complex governance context of afghanistan the next section discusses how this translated into research objectives and methods and the next chapter discusses that context and the initiatives examined in this research 13 research objectives and methodology the primary objective of this research was to identify and better understand key issues af fecting statebuilding interventions at subnational levels and their implications for current and future governance programming this ob jective is about how governance works in subnational contexts as well as how it is changing in response to programmatic interventions objective 1 understand better how governance works in afghanistan at subnational levels and in particular domains objective 2 understand how governance is changing at subnational levels particularly in response to programmatic interventions research methods the design of this research aimed to identify key issues in subnational governance with par ticular focus on changes taking place in relation to statebuilding interventions such as the national solidarity programme nsp the election of provincial councils pc the establishment of provincial development committees pdcs and public administration reform par including the afghanistan stabilisation programme asp box 11 decentralisation an d subnational statebuilding decentralisation is one area where technical b est practices approaches come into contact with the political realities of the afghan contex t there is considerable consensus internation ally that decentralisation is an appropriate wa to improve local governance in many domains efficiency and responsiveness in the provision of public goods can improve by moving decision making and resources closer to the affected publ ic decentralisation can be political decision making administrative service delivery and fiscal resource allocation it can also take dif ferent forms in deconcentration responsibility and resources ar moved to local levels while retaining accountability rela tionships with the centre devolution involves the transfer of au thority to subnational units with some autonomy eg in federal systems and delegation involves the allocation of functions outside state structures eg to ngos and quangos12 in afghanistan the appropriateness and applicability of different forms of decentralisation is complicated by several political an d contextual factors the first is the limited capacity of the afghan state and its low degree of penetratio n to local levels without the generation of more state capacity at local leve ls and consideration of the effe cts of preexisting governance at those levels decentralisation may unde rmine both legitimacy and effectiveness13 the sec ond is that in afghanistan there is considerable desire on the part of both government and citizenry for strong centralisation in part because of historical legacies of fragmented power and fear of further fragmentation and in part the result of centralised state structures that were not destroyed by conflict14 12 see s lister caught in confusion local

the technical studies of subnational administration carried out by areu beginning in 2002 by intro ducing political economic dimension to the analysis of subnational governance change 15 it therefore focused on the same provinces as those studies with the exception of kandahar where security concerns prevented local govern ance research paktia was added to the field work programme but work was limited to the provincial context due to security concerns the research thus focused on six provinces and sev eral districts within each of those provinces with the exception of paktia where district work took place the intention was to have 12 sample districts though these were not ultimately evenly distributed across provinces the community level was defined in accordance with the definition of community in the nsp operations manual meaning at times only part of contiguous settlement corresponding to single cdc was visited 16 it is important to note that this selection was designed to maximise varia tion in local conditions within the constraints of security but is not statistically valid sample for quantitative analysis the governance domains selected reflected sultations with stakeholders prior to the re search regarding areas of subnational governance of key importance and most subject to change under ongoing st atebuilding interven tions in addition review took place

groups were used with social organisers in each district the community and cdclevel data was coded and analysed using qualitative data analysis software according to an adaptive coding scheme while

are the province district and community this does not mean that the study is comparison of provinces districts or communities rather it uses range of prov inces districts and communities to explore key issues in subnational governance for each context and describe the kinds of variation to be found within these contex ts field visits were distributed over approximately 18 months during which time subnational governance changes were ongoing the data from one province may thus not be strictly comparable to that from another finally the municipal context did not form part of the subject of

in afghanistan is an interrelated complex of features relating to its condition as postconfli ct state experiencing continued conflict the prevalence of poverty and vulnerability and regional illicit and war economies the functional weakness of its state structures and penetrability of its borders and longstanding fragmentation of power at the subnational level exacerbated by the effects of recent conflicts 17 these features combine with unique ethnic tribal religious and social dimensions to generate challenging environment for statebuilding interventi ons these factors tribute to the dependence on and penetration by external actors creating further effects for statebuilding activities that are often funded designed and implemented by such actors 21 social and economic context the persistence of armed conflict over the pre vious quartercentury in afghanistan has had profound effects on afghan society driving many to leave the country and leaving popu lation that is disproportionately young and with less than quarter of adults being literate 18 there are constraints on the availability of qualified afghans to fill roles in formal govern ance structures and relative lack of successful capacity development within those institu tions be they the security forces administra tion public service organisations such as health and education departments the national as sembly or the judiciary the porosity of af ghanistans borders and the involvement of regional and global actors in its conflicts have contributed to the wide availability of arms and in combination with history of violent conflict the normalisation of violence as means of resolving disputes the capacity of the state to provide security and hold legitimate monopoly on violence is thus heavily restricted 19 the conflicts in afghanistan have contributed to politicisation of islam and new institutional initiatives must consider interpretation by com munities and religious figures in relation to local religious doctrine and practice historically disputes are interpreted and mediated through is lamic lenses and the increasingly internecine conflicts of the 1990s and beyond are excep tion 20 the politicisation of the multiple ethnic identi ties in the country is an important historical re ality nevertheless simple accounts of ethnicity in afghan politics are insufficient due to the complex coexistence of ethnicity with other tribal communal and patronage relations eth nicity itself is defined relatively and has become increasingly mobilised through years of conflict for example the emergence of tajik identity is relatively recent and has been driven by conflicts in the 1980s and 1990s tribal identity important to some ethnic popu lations but not to others operates in seg mented manner meaning tribal affiliation has different effects depend ing on the scale and type of issue at stake or the degree of territori ality of the tribe in question 21 in general the observation that the actual operating units of sociopolitical coalition among rural afghan populations are rarely genuinely ethnic in 17 see for example b rubin the fragmentation of afghanistan state

the political unity of the hazara community in the 1990s in the face of continued repression has subse quently broken down somewhat with competing factions evident in the post2001 period in addition ongoing conflict has depleted the social capital of communities as populations have been displaced or poverty and economic distortions brought about by conflict as well as assistance have prompted

represent the essence of traditional political culture and popular sciousness in contemporary afghanistan 23 fi nally the social context in afghanistan is af fected by the degree of international involve ment in military political humanitarian recon struction and development affairs the presence of foreign military forces in both offensive and peacekeeping capacities the introduction of rightsbased and democratising processes and the role of foreign nongovernmental organisa tions and international organisations in service provision all influence afghan social dynamics in the areas of governance religion family life and gender relations and roles afghanistans economic environment is compli cated by its geographic location and borders the effects of prolonged conflict the historical and continuing weakness of central or subna tional state capacities in regulation revenue collection and allocation and intensive foreign involvement in the country these factors have contributed to an economic context characterised by various types of economies one study has identified coping war and shadow economies as the most important 24 in such context the importance of patronage nonmonetised goods and services remittance relationships debt and credit structures and involvement in informal or illicit economic ac tivity are very important in shaping incentives these economic dimensions combine with the social dimensions of lineage patriarchy islamic knowledge or religious charisma and patronage to produce complex relationships of social trol and determine patterns of economic oppor tunity traditionally patronage is used by local powerholders known as khans or arbabs to cement ties of lineage and political support influence the practices of local councils known as jirgas or shuras as well as provide some pub lic goods 25 these relations may exist in combi nation or in competition with networks maintained by religious leaders either mullahs talibs or pirs who are members of lineages linked to the main sufi schools or tariqat 26 the economic context is also heavily influenced by the dynamics of the ssistance economy this situation goes well beyond the distortions of the economy in the kabul area the current situa tion of service provision in many areas and in particular health is one of intensive non governmental activity with implications for the

debate 28 22 political and institutional context the afghan political context is characterised by formal state centralisation combined with ac tual fragmentation of power among variety of local and regional actors 29 this fragmentation has been expressed in recent areu work in terms of the distinction between the jure and facto state30 this model emphasises the divergence between formal and actual govern ance in afghanistan formally speaking there are 34 provinces in afghanistan divided among 398 rural districts although that number has not been definitively ratified by national institutions despite its determination being short term benchmark in the afghanistan compact 31 there are approximately 217 municipalities di vided among 34 provincial municipalities com prising the capitals of each province and an unclear number of rural municipalities often but not always corresponding to the seat of district government the number of rural communities or villages in afghanistan is matter of inter pretation the central statistics office counts 40020 rural villages however the national solidarity programme co nsiders the number of communities to be 32769 for the purposes of establishing community development councils 32 provincial government consists of the line partments of the main sectoral ministries the provincial governors office the elected pro vincial council and in some provinces the local offices of other agencies such as the national security directorate nsd the afghanistan in dependent human rights commission aihrc or the independent administrative reform and civil service commission iarcsc districts are currently the lowest level of for mally recognised administration in afghanistan there are three grades of districts in theory based on population and geographic extent in practice however this grading system has not been consistently applied across the country their administrative structure reflects that of the province consisting of district governor or woleswal and district offices of some central ministries the number of which is function of the district grade the number of these depart ments can vary from only few such as health education and rural rehabilitation and development up to as many as twenty in ad dition there is typically police department and prosecutor in each district currently not all districts have primary courts municipal administration is led by mayors the most important of whom are currently appointed by the president of afghanistan municipalities have functional and service delivery responsibility mainly for urban services and revenue collection responsibilities larger provincial municipalities are divided into urban districts nahia and have varying repre sentative systems sometimes including

statebuilding in afghanistan 11 community governance in rural afghanistan thus remains largely informal and varies widely across the country there are certain general types of institutions and actors that play role in most but not all communities these can be roughlyspeaking divided into individual actors collective decisionmaking bodies and behav ioural norms and customs often mediated through individuals such as mullahs or collec tive bodies such as jirgas shuras and jalasas in some communities individual powerholders play important governance roles these may be maliks arbabs and qaryadars that retain au thority through combination of community ac ceptance and linkages to formal authorities historians and anthropologists have noted the wide divergences in the motivations loyalties legitimacy and effectiveness of such local lead ers during other periods 35 in other areas local commanders have gained influence during two decades of conflict through their role in jihad or combination of protection and predation there has been much disc ussion of collective decisionmaking bodies in the afghan context and debate continues over the precise bounda ries of concepts such as jirga jalasa and shura jirga is often presented as an archetypical and immemorial afghan institution the central traditional means of local governance particu larly among sedentary pashtun populations but in some form among both nomadic and non tribal groups as well the jirga unites legisla tive as well as judicial and executive authority on all levels of segmentary society by means of its decisions the jirga administers law 36 jirga is generally understood as gathering of m l l d r s to r s l ve d i s p u t r to m k decision among or between qawm groupings ac cording to local versions of pashtunwali or tribal codes it is thus flexible instrument with an intermittent and varying rather than persistent membership petitioners to jirgas may rep resent themselves or make use of advocates and for disputes between family or larger qawm groups sometimes third party known as jir gamar is called in to assist in decisionmaking s m k fe r s f t h jirga are its confor mity to segmentary patterns its generally ad hoc nature and its reliance on local enforcement if necessary during the twentieth cen tury however pattern of contact between state institutions and jirgas began to appear either as state functionaries used jirgas to com municate policies or as they referred disputes to them in place of formal institutions of justice which remained highly suspect in the eyes of most local populations in nonpashtun areas similar meetings may be known as jalasas or shuras each conforming to the local types of customary law 37 in the latter case there is conceptual overlap with the cept of local council of elders with more per sistent membership and leadership under mullah malik wakil or other figure in addition during the 1980s and the 1990s many ngo pro grammes established local shuras to manage local input to specific development activities new phenomenon that has frequently been flated with more traditional structures in addition the peshawarbased mujahidin parties introduced varying changes to local self government either along the lines of shuras or elsewhere through the imposition of more hier archical party and commanderbased struc tures 38 in part as resul t of th dynam i cs the traditional antipathy for the involvement of centralised state in local areas by an inde pendent periphery has been tempered by an 35 for example see the

other bodies called for however and at the time of writing there were firm public plans to do so outside the constitutional frame work the establishment of pdcs and the expansion of the national solidarity programme and the creation of cdcs ve altered the institu tional landscape considerably more recently the national areabased development pro gramme nabdp has turned its focus to estab

service delivery and governance at the subnational level in afghanistan 3334 the challenge of improving governance through institutional change in afghan provinces has thus far been approached in piecemeal fashion new structures such as provincial coun cils and provincial development committees pdcshave been created and administrative reform and support efforts have taken place the result however has not been an overall strengthening or clarification of the formal institutions of state but rather simply the creation of confusing and incoherent array of institutions with unclear responsibilities re sources and relationships 44 these efforts did not emerge into vacuum as previous areu work indicates skeleton structure of civil servants persisted in many areas after 2001 despite unclear working responsibilities habits and often unpaid sala ries 45 between 2001 and 2005 there were many varied efforts to improve representation coor dination and planning and administrative functioning there was immense variation in the governance outcomes of these statebuilding efforts these new structures were introduced into environments with varying customary governance patterns often with remnants of traditional systems overlain with newer ones resulting from conflict or history of activity by ngos 31 formal institutions in provinces as briefly noted in section two above the for mal institutions of provincial government include the governors office the departments of various ministries and the office of some inde pendent agencies of the government such as the afghanistan independent human rights commis sion aihrc and the independent afghanistan reform and civil service commission iarcsc there are now elected pc s and coordinating bodies for the departments known as pdcs the ministerial departments have responsibility for service delivery in areas such as policing health rural development and education they receive quarterly allocation determined in the budget request of the central line ministry and in almost every case have significant local powers of resource reallocation appointment or programming the ministries represented their staffing and the size of the provincial governors office discussed next is in theory function of the provincial grade i ii or iii pending on size and other factors recent research has shown large discrepancies in approxi mate per capita spending across provinces and also shows little correlation between salary and nonsalary expenditures undermining service delivery performance in key areas such as health and education 46 the governors office in each province has had the dual role of representing the president and reporting to the ministry of interior while for mally the governors role is coordinating one exercised through provincial administrative assembly paa or the similar provincial devel opment committee pdc governors also enjoy improving governance in afghan provinces has

province this contradiction not only represents systemic contradiction but also shows how political structure of appointments and power distribution led by the office of the president co exists alongside ongoing technical attempts to improve the coherence of subnational institu tions through statebuil ding interventions provincial councils pcs were elected in 2005 simultaneously with the national assembly with an unclear mandate comprising advisory flict resolution and oversight roles provincial council law has been ratified after modifica tion to earlier versions to strengthen pc moni toring functions these councils are elected from provincewide constituency on single nontransferable vote with reservation of one quarter of seats for women issues surround the resources available to them whether they rep resent their constituencies effectively and their relationships to provincial government and provincial planning bodies and processes that have also been established in recent years provincial development committees pdcs are not constitutionally mandated but were estab lished to bring order to range of disparate coordination and rudimentary planning activities that sprang up around the country since 2003 and to create structure for provincial input into national planning processes such as the ands they are formally the responsibility of the ministry of economy and chaired by the provincial governor or his representative the practical capacity of th pdcs varies the range of quality of provincial plans emerging from them attests to this variation it is not yet clear in the long term how the planning function of pdcs will link with the budgeting process which is highly centralized nor exactly how they should relate to the pcs or to the provincial ad ministrative assemblies 32 provincial governors and provincial administration provincial governors play important roles be yond their coordinating mandates often related to their status as loca l representatives of the presidency the provincial governor is the sub national locus of government of relationships that reaches to district level and below for precisely that reason the provincial gover norships are highly valued positions that have been used as carrots to gain the cooperation of locallybased strongmen just as ministerial and other central government posts have been used to coopt regional warlords in other cases less prominent governors have been appointed but with the purpose of using relationships to deal with crises and achieve stability counterterror or counternarcotics goals in given provinces this government of relationships is more prominent in areas where the immediate cerns of stabilisation insurgency and counter narcotics are the most acute represented among the case provinces by paktia nangarhar and badakhshan in addition it seemed to be most important where strong tribal networks and relationships formed the primary means for the provincial governor to influence local events as in paktia and nangarhar the provision of relatively unaccountable funds to reinforce relationships through governors has been an important feature of this system of governance these funds include socalled operational funds or hospitality money box 31 on next page as well as portions of com manders emergency response funds cerp given to or directed by governors towards particular beneficiaries 48 the provision of such 47 world bank service delivery and governance at the subnational level in afghanistan 3132 48 b stapleton means to what end why

note that the reliance on such funds is reported to have diminished in 2007 public administrative reform and the governors office similar contradictions have troubled formal statebuilding efforts focused on provincial and district administration one prominent example was the afghanistan stabilisation programme asp asp to be led by the ministry of interior began in 2004 with an ambitious agenda of in frastructural development provincial block grants and administrative reform of provincial and district governors offices the purpose of asp was to link the central government to the provinces the provinces to the districts and the districts to the villages provincial official herat september 2005 when it began asp had components for admin istrative reform as well as district infrastructure development and block grant for develop ment projects but it soon became predomi 49 areu interviews paktia and nangarhar 2005 50 see for example ho spitality by tribal khans b rubin the fragmentation of afghanistan 41 box 31 governing relationships hospitality49 one manifestation of the governors place in the political government of relationships is in the provision of an independent budget some times known as hospitality money to gover nors in provinces based on their size and the problems they face in terms of insecurity in tended to be used in supporting the appropriate clients this term while not official echoes the historical role of hospitality in securing patronage relations in afghanistan 50 this money delivered during the research period through re latively opaque channels of the ministry of interior may have amounted to us100000200000 per month in paktia the case province where this system seemed to be most significant the funds were used to convene meetings of tribal leaders in other provinces of the southeast region the funds have been used for these leaders to travel to kabul to lobby the office of the president directly in general without good data it ca n be assumed that the role of hospitality money is primarily to encourage local leaders to support the governor and in turn the cen tral governments efforts to meet stability counterterror and counte rnarcotics goals the research was unable to determine what systems of accountability exist to monitor the use of these funds one source noted that governors pa id significant kickback to the ministry of interior on receipt of the money and that in fact only some 2030 percent of the money may be spent in the provinces in question concern raised by some respondents was that the lack of accountability regarding these funds provided other actors with kind of ammunition to constrain the reform efforts of gov ernors in one province informants noted that despite the generally positive impression of the decency of the governor his use of these funds provided the means for police chiefs in particular to threaten him with revelations about its use when reform efforts placed their own positions at risk subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 17 nantly focused on infrastructure projects in herat in 2005 asp had funded through its district infrastructure development window the construction of five district governors buildings and refurbished others but had not initiated significant administrative reforms within any of those offices 51 in bamyan it was noted that this window of asp was building district infrastructure without it fitting into any coordinated plans for maintenance and staffing 52 the block grant known as the provincial stabili sation fund psf consisted of us1 million per province for use in development projects largely at the discretion of the governors office as it happened such funds were only distributed to six provinces in 2004 and it has been supposed by some that the primary aim was to provide kind of slush fund to secure support in ad vance of the 2004 presidential election contention supported by the fact that the promised 34 million dropped off after the election and in the end only six provinces received the psf in herat the only case province where the psf had been delivered at the time of research it had funded the construction of some schools in theory the process of project selection was to involve delegates to the constitutional loya jirga or department heads the provincial gov ernor the central line ministry and the ministry of interior respondents noted however that asp projects were chosen more by frequency of petition by local officials or consultative shuras than coherent planning with line minis tries 53 the experience of the asp demonstrates the difficulty of purely technocratic approach to statebuilding at the subnational level when this agenda coexists with the governors role in maintaining or creating relationships with individual officials and local powerholders while it did not yet play prominent role in the case provinces similar contradictions appear to have affected different pu blic administration reform effort the priority reform and restruc turing prr programme in cases of prr in governors offices or line departments the pro gramme was very much focused on

two case provinces the governor was alleged to have interfered in prr decisions opposing the replacement of certain personnel in addition in one case province it was observed that the partial or incomplete application of prr sal ary scales in given provincial line department was creating internal problems in that office governors offices themselves noted the diction between the relationship dimension of governance and the technical one some provin cial governors or deputy governors noted that having all appointments approved by line partments in kabul limite d their ability to coor dinate and appoint competent local staff or re tain those they wanted these problems are frequently compounded by understaffing according to the existing tashkil the staffing establishment detailing

place low government salaries were consistently given as the pri mary cause for understaffing suggesting that effective pay and grade reform remains crucial challenge to increasing subnational capacity in government offices the longterm institutional health of provincial level administration will eventually depend on further clarification of the role of the provincial governor in relation to the executive the pro vincial line departments the provincial council the budget process and expenditure processes in this clarification it will be important to sider the balance between formal responsibili ties availability and sources of resources and the systems of accountability both upward and downward in place for governors offices 33 provincial development committees coordination and planning during the period of research considerable changes were introduced at the provincial level to improve planning and coordination among the different line departments and the governors office while provincial councils discussed be low were given some role in this regard the principal mechanism was to be the introduction of provincial development committees pdcs established by decree approved by the govern ment in november 2005 the role of pdcs as outl ined by the decree in cludes coordination and communication among government departments with provincial coun cils and between the government ngos international organisations and provincial recon struction teams prts they are also tasked with planning responsibilities including establishing provincial budget though in fact such budget is currently foreseen other pdc responsibilities include approving provincial development plans and public and private invest ment strategies and supervision of counter narcotics work the decree states that the governor or his representative chairs the pdc while the local department of economy should provide secretariat services thou gh resources for that were not specifically identified as noted in an earlier areu briefing paper the planned organisational structure of pdcs tailed some potential co mplications or dictions 54 probably most important are poten tial duplication of responsibilities with elected provincial councils the relationship between the two bodies is left unclear the provincial department of economy is to serve as central office of the development committee but has limited capacity to do so and it is unclear where the ministry of economy and the provin cial governor exactly divi their duties in rela tion to pdcs even the mbership of the pdc is not clear with some variation being observed in the inclusion or not of provincial council mem bers and the role of international actors the research behind this report about half of which took place prior to the order establishing pdcs demonstrated that these bodies were in most cases not being introduced into vacuum in all the case provinces some form of coordinating forum had been in place before pdc was introduced but the nature origins and ef fectiveness of such bodies varied widely in herat in 2005 bimonthly meetings took place among the department heads and the governor with representatives of donors or implementers involved in projects also invited the results varied with the provincial health office estab lishing with ngos and the prt system for clinic project selection

development plan lacked prioritisation and costing its existence oriented coordination efforts heav ily to the governors office and very much placed the newly formed pdc in secondary or duplicative role particu larly as the department of economy did not seem to have taken up leadership role in run ning the pdc 57 in bamyan by contrast biweekly or monthly meeting of the pdc had become established by late2006 including heads of departments and provincial council members here the department of economy had been very proactive adding defined membership role for the pro vincial council into its plan for the pdc thus locally clarifying one of the major ambiguities in the enabling orders this relatively successful coordination effort was achieved despite consid erable understaffing in the department of econ omy which with only 9 of 17 staff in place noted that we have grade iii tashkil but grade ii work 58 pdcs can be seen as an attempt to standardise response to the tension of sectoral expenditure at subnational levels and the supposed coordi nating and planning functions of the provincial governors office they were introduced into an ambiguous and changing environment compli cated by preexisting efforts at coordination and the establishment of pcs in november 2005 pdcs appear highly dependent on the coopera tion of governors and their role in planning and budgeting beyond coordination remains unclear potential way forward for instituting role in relation to budgets can be found in the provincial budget pilots underway in balkh panjshir and kandahar and to be expanded in the 1387 budget process the deep contradiction between provinciallevel planning and budget set at the centre remains however even if par tially mitigated by these efforts we have plan but

when provincial councils were seated in novem ber 2005 after their election in september their legal and regulatory framework had not yet been created the formation of this new subnational representative body reflected pressure to meet an already delayed constitutional requirement to form both subnational represen tative bodies and the upper house of the national assembly the meshrano jirga which was to be partially drawn from subnational repre sentative bodies pcs were the only subnational elected body elected at the same time as the lower house of the national assembly 56 areu

staff bamyan september 2006 areu synthesis paper series 20 consequently the roles and functions of the provincial councils remained unclear before and even for some time after the election in june 2005 herat pc candidates were frequently approaching the joint electoral management board jemb office for information about the role and especially the compensation of pc members 59 the functions eventually determined for the provincial councils were participation in provin cial development planning monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institu tions and participation in conflict resolution the elimination of customs contrary to the law and sharia or human rights standards environ mental protection and the reduction of illicit drug activity 60 this varied and vague list of responsibilities re flects the rush to find role for body that was created without clearly defined place in an overall framework of subnational representative institutions in particular this lack of framework raises number of key issues for the roles and capabilities of the councils issues with pc roles planning and budgeting the first issue is the lack of framework defin ing provincial planning and its relation to budg ets and the absence of mechanism for monitoring the administration in particular it is necessary to clarify the relationship between the provincial councils the pdcs and the governors offices in the two case provinces visited after the establishment of both pdcs and pro vincial councils two very different models of pc participation were ev ident in bamyan the ministry of economy the governors office and the pc had all supported the institutionalisation of the pcs role in planning and potential future budgeting through inclusion in the pdc the bamyan pc has six commissions responsible for liaison law finances cultural internal moni toring and monitoring of administration they consult and monitor the provincial administra tion consult with the prt participate in diag meetings participate in the pdc participate in emergency incident councils resolve disputes meet ulema and work with the aihrc in their own view the head of the pc is the second most important person in the province 61 in badakhshan by contrast the prior drafting of provincial development plan the relatively weak pdc role and the governors vision limited the institutionalisation of provincial council role several info rmants reported that the pc was trying to be assertive and become real provincial assembly while it was entirely dependent on the governor for operating ex penses and facilities in contrast to this ambition the governor had determined that the pc would remain consultative and not challenge or insult government officials as result the badakhshan pcs monitoring function appeared limited to receiving and dealing with petitions of which there were about hundred per week many of these petitions involved problems with the provincial or district administrations but the solutions found were always local and related to the specific case and did not confront any systemic problems in the government partments in question 62 issues with pc roles accountability in addition to their lack of clarity the budget and staffing of provincial councils is not inde pendent of the provincial administration that they are meant to monito r article 17 of the pc law determines that the administrative af fairs and service needs of provincial councils shall be organised and provided by the cerned province there is an evident conflict of interest where

22 an assertive role for the council as was the case in at least one of the provinces studied interestingly while all the other provincial councils pointed to lack of resources to carry out their daytoday duti this council was the best provided for by that particular governor in one assessment the pc members are bought off within the bounds of the law 63 related issue with the monitoring role of pcs is that legal and regulatory frameworks do not yet guarantee the cooperation of the provincial administration presidential decree 4116 re quests that provincial governors must take actions and design organise and implement programmes in cooperation with provincial councils in addition the provincial council law and rules of procedure do allow meetings be tween the governor or other members of the administration and the council however because the pcs have been installed into rela tively undeveloped legal framework there are not corresponding obligations in law on the administration particularly law enforcement bodies to attend meetings or respond to in formation requests such legal instruments will eventually be required so that the oversight function of pcs can be properly exercised and they must form part of coherent framework for subnational accountability to be effective there is therefore need for specific ways for the elected councils input to be included in the provincial planning process and mechanisms for using evaluating and publicising that input there is also need for clear mechanisms to enable representative bodies to contribute to government accountability independent of their support from the provincial administration issues with pc roles representation the basis for representation the system by which pcs are elected also affects their representative functions in particular as the election is based on prov inciallevel single non transferable vote sntv system there is guarantee that council will have members from all districts in the province concerns pointed out by areu in 2006 that the resulting view of representation may be partial appear to have been borne out 64 in all the case provinces visited that had pcs in place it was common for people to conflate the presumed support base of given pc member whether political tribal or geographical with their constituency in short the view of pc members and pro vincial residents about who these members are representing is more limited group than residents of the province as whole in nan garhar there was strongly tribal dimension to the election at the inauguration of the provincial council in nangarhar the election of offi cers and the selection of the delegates to the meshrano jirga featured tribal alliances and di visions as determinant through the rounds of voting 65 similarly in paktia the pc was very unsure of its role as most of its functions were already carried out by consultative groups of tribal elders assembled by the governor where actual pc activity could be observed as in bamyan and badakhshan pc members and district officials both considered that members represented their districts of origin not the province as whole in the large district of waras in bamyan local officials noted that since three of nine pc members hail from there the district enjoys frequent visits by contrast in yakawlang large nearby district actually located on the main route from bamyan centre to waras officials explained that actually we dont have any members on the provincial council on ly one on the wolesi jirga and one in the meshrano jirga so we dont have

badakhshan where pc members had visited some districts several times and others not at all factional affiliation also seemed to influence the view of representati on in both bamyan and badakhshan despite the lack of politicalparty involvement in the electoral system the affilia tions of pc members were well known as unama officials pointed out however factional affiliation was not the only predictor of political behaviour 66 in short rather than developing system of rep resentation that can truly bring bottomup dimension to provinciallevel planning it may be that the pcs remain mainly an instrument of potential and actual patronage the pc is an aggregate of personal interests either through relationships or districts representative of an international organi sation badakhshan october 2006 system of election based on wards sub district entities and focusing on districts might be more likely to ensure that the full range of provincial conditions is reflected in development planning alternatively the eventual framework for other levels of subnational repre sentative bodies may be able to mitigate this issue by integrating districtlevel and provincial level representation for example the current phase of the national area based development programme nabdp operated by the ministry of rural rehabilitation and development does sider the role of provincial councils in integrat ing priorities from the district level the third broad category of pc responsibilities includes some functions of judicial nature and requires clarification of the relationships with judicial law enforcement and customary dis puteresolution institutions relationships between pcs and other actors should be consid ered as part of discussions on judicial reform and the place of customary institutions in dispute resolution the prom otion of human rights and other goals it is apparent that provincial councils have not yet found common role and that they lack the legal framework and material resources to play that role much has yet to be accomplished to address the ambiguities surrounding their role in planning and budgeting the relationship to the governors office and other government depart ments the source and quantity of their re sources and the basis fo r their representation these issues can now only be effectively ad dressed in conjunction with other issues such as the framework for district level representation the fiscal status of the province in the budget process and the accountability of provincial governors the introduction of new institutions will demand further consideration of these rela tionships 66 areu interview unama provincial official 2006 areu synthesis paper series 24 as noted in section 2 the district is currently the lowest level of formally recognised administration in afghanistan the district government consists of district governor and varying number of district offices of central ministries in addition there is typically police depart ment and prosecutor in each district and of ten primary court the district governor or woleswal until recently representative of the ministry of interior formally plays coordinat ing role in actuality woleswals are the most important government actors at the district level 67 the informal role of the woleswal often includes dispute resolution and other problemsolving activities depending on relations with the provincial authorities local customary and informal powerholders in most cases woles wals maintain some kind of semiformal advisory shuras or liaise with maliks arbabs or qaryadars where these remain significant throughout the 1990s and since 2001 there has been proliferation of unofficial districts these are created when the centrally recog nised districts are divided reflecting either claims for additional resources or local management of tribal heterogeneity through split ting districts along tribal lines 68 this process is aided by the informal authority of the woles wals office and more recently may have been supported by access to relatively unaccountable resources delivered for assistance counterinsurgency or stabilisation purposes the official number of districts has not been definitively tablished though at the time of publication it was variously reported as 364 or 398 41 district governors the gatekeepers the office of district governor has some fea tures in common with that of provincial governor despite relatively limited formal powers the district governor is pivotal figure in the organisation of governance in all domains at the district level beyond supposed administrative duties of the office such as registering births deaths and marriages it is apparent that the district governor plays considerable role in resolving local disputes or determining where they will be resolved convening customary rep resentatives to discuss local issues and receiving petitions of all types from residents of the district the district go vernor plays the central local role in the political government of relationships alongside and at times in contradic tion to efforts at technical statebuilding at dis trict level the district governor is in essence gatekeeper to local government visitors to district governors office will usu ally find themselves among crowd of residents waiting to see the governor clasping pieces of paper used as forms for all kinds of petitions these petitions may be related to community problems or civil and criminal disputes or they may be requests for material assistance in the event of crises or natural disaster in all dis tricts studied the distri ct governors office was pointed to as the first point of contact for people who had petitions for the formal govern ment departments department here will take action even the police in the case of crime without the governors signature district official pashtun zarghun herat 2005 the woleswal as the crucial interlocutor be tween the society and state at the district level is able to decide what the appropriate response to any given petition may be when it first reaches the formal institutions of the state by controlling access the district governor has im mense influence over the treatment of the citizenry by the state role with origins in the expansion of state influence under amir abdur 67 district governor is used here in place of the sometimes us ed term district administrator reflecting the similarities in in formal func tions between walis and woleswals outlined below 68 areu interviews provincial and district offici als

increase as unofficial prisons run by commanders we re reduced on the other hand both police fficials and foreign police advisors noted th at much of the petty corruption was aimed at providing running costs for police activities not only for personal gain areu key informant interviews 2006 71 these data do not indicate representative or statistically vali d sample for all district officials but rather indicate siderably shorter time in post among district go vernors and police chiefs than district level public servants as whole 72 areu interview io official nangarhar november 2005 rahman khan at the end of the nineteenth cen tury69 by controlling or heavily influencing how and when the state and external actors deal with or react to local issues such as insurgency or local conflict narcotics production and traf ficking or disputes the influence of the woles wal extends well beyond his formal powers this role is key to derstanding the value of the post of district governor to the executive to the provincial governors who influence their appointment and to the woleswals themselves the executive can use the position to extend the government of relationships to the local levels at least to the extent that it can control the behaviour of woleswals through the appoint ments system that system in turn is generally acknowledged to be heavily conditioned by pro vincial governors the district governors themselves can access resources and influence ei ther through petty corrupti on relating to access to services or largescale corruption relating to illegal detentions or the narcotics industry there are widespread reports of district gover nor posts being purchased in opiumproducing or opiumtrafficking areas 70 these factors may also ex plain why the post of district governor appears to change hands with considerable frequency as the arm of the minis try of interior in the local area and the gatekeeper to services the woleswal has so far been able to project the influence of the provincial governor as well as his own influence the post of provincial governor has been used by the ex ecutive as way of encouraging participation of local powerholders in the government and the movement and reassignment of these governors among provinces has been part of that process it is less known that the post of district governor as well as chief of police the next most important districtlevel post have been oper ating in much the same way this has resulted high turnover among woleswal titleholders with changes often happening in step with changes at the provincial level the average time in post for all district officials interviewed for this study was 26 months but the average for woleswals was only eight months an almost identical interval was found with chi efs of police by tr as t judge s an d department heads were in place for much longer periods indicating that the appointments mechanisms in place for woleswals and police chiefs may well be operating under different influences than the process for department staff this is reflection of the difference be tween the posts related to the government of relationships and those that are engaged in the actual or hypothetical delivery of services the data indicate that the woleswal and police chief posts frequently change hands in response to aspects of relationship politics or corruption this is supported by the research through quali tative commentary in several provinces in nan garhar an international official noted that the district governor and police chief posts were way to carve up the province according to tribal influences 72 in badakhshan and faryab the political allegiance of the district governors type of official avg time in post of cases all district officials 26 months

appointment it should be noted that in some cases the use of relationship politics could also be seen to serve more technical statebuilding goals kohistan one of the districts of faryab has been under the control of the remnants of jamiat unit from the army when district governor with junbesh support was sent he was not accepted the province accepted only the appointment of district governor loyal to jamiat and through this process it became possible for the prt to patrol and for the anp to establish presence for the first time in this way the government has increased its presence in the district while working in tune with peoples wishes not against them provinc ial official faryab august 2005 the research thus indicates that the distinction between the relationship politics and other technical reforms is echoed at the district level this finding has important implications for pub lic administrative reform while technical reform efforts are increasingly being viewed from servicedelivery point of view improvement to the functioning of district administration is still subject to the gatekeeper role of the dis trict governor as the world bank notes there have been efforts to block reforms aimed at increasing accountability in the appointment process for these posts 73 while police courts and other line departments may be reformed and perform increasingly well in delivering their services in many areas access to the services appears to remain controlled by the district governor situation that will obviously condi tion the effectiveness of any reforms in altering statesociety relations good example of this dynamic is the role of the district governor in dispute resolution box 41 as with provincial governors the powerful roles of district governors high lights the difficulty of pursuing technical statebuilding and reform initiatives in parallel with political dimension of governance exercised through governors of fices without comprehensive approach to fining the subnational governance system any such reform will be diluted or may even be counterproductive once again the need for the development of subnational governance policy is evident this need for framework however still confronts other obstacles related to district administration 42 how districts are governed there is significant variation in the size and geographical profile of existing districts in bamyan the single distri ct of waras claims to comprise 150000 inhabitants and district officials request to be divided into two or three dis tricts due to the large population and difficult roads in badakhshan by contrast some districts in similar geographic circumstances are much smaller numbering around 10000 inhabi tants while these differences are to some degree reflected in the grading of districts there appears to be wide variation even within single grades of district though more research is 73 world bank service delivery and governance at the

official 2006 subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 27 box 41 district governors in the governance of disputes and crime the systems for the governance of disputes and cr ime at local levels in afghanistan illustrate the relationships between customary institutions formal justice institutions and the role of governors discussed in this section the relationships between these actors vary from place to place but share certain common features the first feature is relatively wellknown tendency for the majority of pro blems to be resolved within or between communities where possible in some places such as nangarhar respondent s note that up to 70 percent of killings and 90 percent of other issues may be dealt with in jirgas or through feuds without involving the formal authorities 74 in other provinces more disputes or crimes reach the formal authorities though more research is needed to determine the proportions75 while the explanations given for this tendency are so metimes related to values of islam or custom they are also often in strumental the corruption and inefficiency of the formal justice sector were cited much more often than valuebased reasons if conf irmed more systematically this finding has im portant implications for justicesector policy suggesting that improvements to the function ing of courts would itself increase their utilisation an additional issue for formal justice in stitutions is the lack of judges qualified to pply both hanafi and jafari jurisprudence despite the constitutional provision that this be available to shia communities76 when disputes or reported crimes do reach the authorities they have nearly always gone to the district governor first the district governor determines if petition should be sent back to the community for resolution be resolved by himself or be referred to the police prose cutor or court while there was variation in the decisions of the governors in all cases studied they played this role in few cases woleswals would send almost any dispute back to the community before allowing it to be referred to the formal authorities unless it was serious criminal case usually defined as murder rape and serious assault one district governor in bamyan sent about half of his 60 petitions w eek back to communities and bamyan district governors generally seemed to prefer the ulema shura over courts for resolving criminal mat ters sometimes the woleswal would pass cases on to prosecutors or courts but these would still send them to communities for resolution before addressing them in one faryab district two thirds of civil matters were ndled this way and in one nangarhar district the prosecutor claimed he did the same with 40 percent of crimes such as small assaults 77 in few districts this resulted in dramatic underuse of existing court staff and capacity though understaffed courts were the more common finding78 in other places such as one district of badakhshan and one of herat the district governor referred cases to communities but claimed to have replaced the prior system of qaryadar or commander decisionmaking with nspcdcs thus second feature of the governance of disputes is that there is considerable degree of interaction between customary and formal state practices and institutions and that this interaction begins with the gatekeeper role of the district governor discussed above this finding suggests that policies for the developmen t of the rule of law in afghanistan must sider preexisting patterns of integration between the state and nonstate justice institutions and practices for example citizen access to any improvements in police prosecutors and courts will still be subject to the influence of governors again the pr ospect of technical re form in afghanistan is heavily influenced by the two coexisting forms of administration rep resented here by the governors on the one hand and the justice institutions on the other areu synthesis paper series 28 source

population is not the only factor in prompting desire to revise district boundaries provincial officials in paktia noted that some districts with populations drawing from different subtribes should be divided to better align tribal politics with district boundaries 82 in reality several provinces were operating unofficial districts during the study period in paktia four unofficial districts operated each with governor and police post within larger district di vided among several subtribes given that these unofficial districts were recognised provincially but not centrally they further highlight the autonomy in appointments enjoyed by at least some provincial governors in relation to central regulation 83 any consideration of the future role of district administration in particular regarding the form of the representative bodies called for in the constitution will have to tend with the continuing discrepancy between the jure districts and facto realities below the provincial level the coexistence of political governorled sys tem of relationships with efforts to introduce new institutions does not end at the level of the district the district governor as the centre of the government of relationships often maintains system of consultation with local lead ers these systems of consultation vary widely and may be more or less institutionalised despite not being recognised as formal level of government in the constitution at the same time institutions created by nsp nabdp various ngo development activities and alternative livelihoods programmes are seeking defined role in governance that may or may not inte grate with the governor system district governors advisory shuras commanders and customary leaders in many districts the woleswal convenes some kind of shura to advise and inform him on local issues and also to pass directives downward these bodies can vary quite widely in their composition and the role th at they play they can be roughly divided into four categories unstructured politicalpartybased or commanderbased in some districts such as one in faryab this consultative body was described as quite unstructured involving influential people who met when necessubnational statebuilding in afghanistan 29 sary84 it was apparent that the majority of people involved had links to the two main political movements in the province in ef fect many were smallscale commanders of either jamiat or junbesh in similar vein some woleswals in bamyan respond to po litical shura linked to the main political movement hezbe wahdate islami consti tuted at the provincial level 85 arbab or malik based several of the dis tricts studied featured system where rec ognised representatives of communities subdistricts or informally recognised geographi cal subdistrict zones are convened by the woleswal in herat one woleswal structured his shura with four representatives of each of eleven locally recognised manteqa sub district division in other cases these representatives are on the shura by virtue of their position as the arbab or malik elder in given area for example the district governor of one faryab district convened the 331 arbabs f th d i s tr i c t i n g r u p s n b i weekly basis and the shura in one nan garhar district was made up of the recog nised maliks of each subdistrict 86 ulemabased in other districts such as those in bamyan woleswal advisory councils were made up primarily of ulema these shuras seemed to be less regularly used than other types noted above and tended to fo cus on disputes as noted above sometimes an ulema shura may be accompanied by political shura triballybased in paktia the consultative body is made up of local notable male tribal leaders in tribal areas of paktia and nangarhar government relations with these tribal leaders is of transactional nature their support for the government requires the government to provide them corresponding support something perceived as lack ing on the issue of security in paktia and opium cultivation in nangarhar 87 while these categories may help in distinguish ing the range of participants in district governance some district governors spoke of combi nation of these in making up their shura in one herat district the district governor noted that arbabs commanders and ulema all were in cluded in his advisory shura similarly these bodies were undergoing change during the course of research in one herat district the ad visory shura had only been formed in 200405 by the new woleswal and in nangarhar the change of provincial governor and in turn many woles wals had decreased reliance on solely tribal leaders in favour of system in which maliks played more prominent role 88 the presence of armed commanders was fac tor in district governance beyond their role in districtlevel advisory councils of the six prov inces reviewed the importance of local armed strongmen was most significant in faryab in one district the woleswal was also the local commander and exercised influence beyond his formal responsibilities through this role for ex ample by providing the local administration with additional supporters in another district the local commander was running parallel and official prison system against the wishes of the woleswal the woleswal had only been able to challenge this situation intermittently with the backing of the prt forces 89 this was the only district among the cases however where 84 areu interviews district officials faryab august 2005 85 areu interviews provincial and distri ct officials bamyan

place of the arbab who had previously played that role 91 in another herat district the woleswal had begun including cdc members in his advisory shura the strongest examples of woleswal knowledge and legitimation of cdcs were in herat potentially reflecting the strength of the nsp facili tating partners as discussed in section 5 below maliks and qaryadars malik or qaryadar is essentially the interlocu tor between district administration and communities dating from the monarchy and republican periods to 1979 these figures had roles in rep resenting the central government indirectly and in

re to be paid 2000 afghani each per month provincial interlocutors including unama and ai hrc staff viewed this development generally positively but stressed that arbakai were pplement not replacement for the police the work of arbakai is different from police work as they are derived from the local tribes they have help from residents they know people in the area and know who may be active among the insurgency department of border and trib affairs official paktia june 2006 historically and in the context of pashtunwali the customary pashtun tribal code arbakai are also mobilised in order to enforce jirga decisions where necessary arbakai are tribally based and therefore to play community defence function they are most suited to areas mostly or only populated by one subtribe as pertains in most districts of paktia with the exception of zurmat their effectiveness in multitribal districts or areas where tribal leadership is mixed with other forms of authority such as land ownership or armed militias is not as clear and therefore extending the concept to other areas ne eds careful consideration arbakai have also been erroneously compared with the afghan nati onal auxiliary police anap in certain prov inces of the south subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 31 nontribal areas and more or less conflictual areas means the term may denote considerably different structures in different places in three districts studied in faryab and badakh shan district authorities and communities claimed either to have abandoned the system of maliks or that the system had faded away by contrast in other places the malik remained central figure in governance arrangements below the district according to one woleswal in nangarhar maliks are the bridge between the district administration and the community from among the study provinces the role of maliks appeared to be most important in nan garhar there they play role in jirgas regis tration of births and marriages represent fami lies in marriage contracts and according to one woleswal carry out development work through nsp in place of cdcs due to their influ ence the relationship between status as tribal leader and as malik requires further study but as maliks are often appointed by communities it may be presumed that some overlap with tribal roles exists in terms of their selection cases were found of maliks that were both appointed by communi ties or had inherited the post from family mem bers appointed before the recent decades of conflict in the study di stricts in nangarhar where the system seemed most significant dis trict officials claimed that new maliks are ap pointed by the consensus of the heads of every family in one case where competing maliks vied for position the solution was to include both on the district advisory shura demonstrat ing continued integration there between maliks and district governance 93 the scale of maliks influence also varied they could be associated with single community or small cluster of villages in these cases the term qaryadar was often applied inter changeably as in badakhshan in other cases such as nangarhar district authorities described fixed and recognised system of subdistricts termed manteqas each with fixed number of maliks interlocutors in districts where maliks played leading role ted that these figures do not have any financial support for their post from either the community or the government respondents claimed that the result was that sometimes some maliks take bribes when they solve the problems of two parties in conflict or from ngo programmes when they distribute assistance to communities these officials noted that if the government gave salaries to maliks they would be able to avoid corruption 94 in some of the provinces studied the term ar bab is used to indicate influential persons in communities or among several communities while in few areas there were few differences between an arbab and malik in general the former was associated with influence derived from land ownership which may or may not be matched with role representing communities to local authority in some areas decline in the influence of arbabs has been reported as result of the introduction of structures like cdcs 95 the variation in the organisation of governance functions below the district level implies that statebuilding efforts are likely to have varying outcomes in different places while the search for standard model for interactions between districts and lower levels of social organisation 93 areu

the organisation of governance functions below the district level implies that statebuilding efforts are likely to have varying outcomes in different places areu synthesis paper series 32 is tempting the outcome of such efforts will vary for example where cdcs have been intro duced the relationship between them and dis trict governors is conditioned by the existing subdistrict arrangements this observation is also relevant to districts that have seen the tablishment of district development assemblies under the national ar eabased development programme nabdp where it can be expected that the roles taken on by these new bodies will be dependent on local subdistrict practices in practice district authorities both governors and court officials do not attempt to extend formal government auth ority too far into com munities instead they refer disputes to communities and rely on advisory structures to in fluence through informal means the decisions in those settings extending the presence of the state relies on delicate balance of formal and informal authority this is consistent with his torical patterns dating back to the nineteenth century noellekarimi observed in the 1970s aware of their position as outsiders govern ment representatives perceived the accus tomed local councils as the more appropri ate venues for the settlement of disputes and the communication of government poli cies 96 the likely result of any technical reforms at this level is that they will be conditioned or work in parallel with political dimensions of local governance through the informal institutions scribed section 5 describes the outcomes of one such reform the national solidarity programme as it interacts with these local political dimensions 43 governors and contradictory statebuilding the previous two sections demonstrate that pro vincial or district governors have both jure and facto roles in afghanistan formally they play largely coordina ting role in their ju risdictions with some administrative responsi bilities they are also the local representative of the national executive and as such promulgate decrees or other directives from the centre while reporting back on local events this ambiguity surrounding the true role of gov ernors has historical roots in their powerful role throughout the twentieth century and has been compounded by the fact that they have been representatives of both th ministry of interior and the office of the president simultaneously in addition provincial and district governors have an ambiguous role in directing police activ ity although the police law specifies that police operate under the guidance of governors at both levels ministry of interior directive re stricts governors from directing activities at tactical or operational level while also making them responsible for conveying executive orders to the police commanders 97 crucial feature of formal subnational govern ance in afghanistan is thus the existence of an administrative system with dual faces that of the governors offices and that of the other partments of ministries at the subnational level as noted by the world bank these two sets of actors do not form division of powers that comprises coherent local government but rather exist in kind of systemic contradic tion with each other 98 some key features of that contradiction are the role of provincial governors in influencing districtlevel appoint ments developing provincial development plans in the absence of provincial budget and signing off on expenditures by local line depart 96 c

or preservation of stability and the related chal lenges of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency contrasting technical kind of change institutional reform expresses itself through line ministries efforts to create representative bodies and the wide range of interna tional efforts to reform and restructure the pub lic service the origins of this dual system of contradictory statebuilding lie both in the historical role of governors and in the pursuit since 2001 of both shortterm crisisman agement agenda and longterm statebuilding agenda 99 the simulta neous persistence of both these approaches increasingly hampers the development of coher ent resourced and effective system of formal governance at the subnational level and dis torts the balance between executive and representative authority in august 2007 responsibil ity for the administration of governors offices was moved by presidential decree from the ministry of interior to the independent directorate of local governance at the time of writing it is unclear what significance this major structural reform will have on the overall place of the governors offices in the framework of sub national government structures until the government of relationships can be better reconciled with state built on institutions such contradictions and incoherence will tinue this is government of relationships provincial official paktia

their promises and this is why we didnt believe them we thought that if they were really helpin g us they would give us money directly and not projects but once we saw the start of the programme we realised we should participate and help this programme move forward cdc members nangarhar 2005 initial community reactions the first interaction between the community and nsp comes as communities are selected for mobilisation and the programme is introduced to them in the research sites the community responses to the introduction of the nsp varied widely some communities responded with ex treme scepticism while others sent representatives the local drrd or the fp to proactively petition for nsp to be introduced in their com munity interviews with community members cdc members and focus groups of the social organisers suggested thr ee factors as important in determining the community reaction to the introduction of nsp 1 history of ngoun involvement in community or district the most frequently mentioned factor shaping initial community response s to the introduction of nsp was previous experience of ngo and cdd activity in the district or the specific commu nity in the majority of cases where people discussed their initial reactions in these terms this experience was cited as negative factor so cial organisers from three of the five fps involved in study communi ties cited previously unfulfilled ngo promises as reason for initial scepticism in most cases these problems did not refer to specific organisation but rather to generic distrust of ngo activity rooted in experiences from both before and after 2001 this conclusion is supported by assertions in small number of communities that their accep tance of the programme was heightened by the fps effort to clarify that the nsp was in fact government programme and not simply an ngo initiative in one case in bamyan the cdc noted that the community was more accepting upon understanding that the programme was gov ernment initiative and in one remote part of badakhshan one community reported that government radio advertisements had convinced them that the nsp was government initiative and prompted them to actively express their interest previous ngo involvement does not always work against programme acceptance however some communities under two particular fps cited the longstanding efforts of these organisations in their districts as contribu ting to positive reac tion when nsp was introd uced in short the his torical reputation of ngo or unagency involvement was an important factor shaping commu nity receptiveness and could work in both posi tive and negative ways in very small number of cases the opposite was true lack of previ ous experience with ngo activity contributed to suspicion about the motives of the fp 107 one fp noted that their implementation plan called for mobilising less remote communities before re mote ones so that these communities would gradually become familiarised with the value of nsp 108 2 local implementation of nsp the research also found geographic effect in the acceptance of nsp at the time of introduc tion that is communities that had seen nsp implemented in nearby areas showed more enthusiasm for the programme in cases across two provinces the community petitioned ac tively for nsp to be intr oduced on the basis of seeing it implemented in neighbouring commu nities or neighbouring districts for two facili tating partners this effect was reflected in 107 areu focus group nsp social or ganisers bamyan december 2004 108 areu focus group nsp community organisers faryab august 2005 areu synthesis paper series 38 implementation strategies rather than mobilis ing on the basis of needs assessment the or der of mobilisation was based on geographic cri teria either communities were mobilised across an entire district or contiguous communities were mobilised generally starting with the least remote in general the research found that the most common problems of gaining community acceptance were scepticism and apathy sometimes coupled with objections to the requirement to include women in the elections and resulting cdcs this latter issue however usually arose after initial acceptance of the programme 3 increasing acceptance over nsp phases even when the community agreed to nsp par ticipation relatively quickly about half the cdcs interviewed reported that they did not take the programme seriously until later phase of im plementation this effect was reported more from cdcs formed earlier in the life of the nsp in year 1 and 2 of the programme scepticism in the early phases of the programme was often overcome only when the first instalment of money arrived in the community although in few cases the holding of an election may also have been an important milestone in accep tance and active participation at first we didnt think it was real pro gramme we thought these people just wanted to keep us quiet or keep us from our work we began to trust the programme when we received the first instalment cdc member and white beard badakhshan 2006 after the election when they took photos was also an important moment cdc mem ber waras bamyan 2006 the connection between resources and legiti macy is strong it is supported by the finding that late disbursements of nsp funds had very negative effect on community perceptions of the programme and its implementers 109 it is important to consider that the acceptance of cdc creation is intimately related to their role as channel for additional resources for the community the fact that the cdc is elected is also legitimating factor pointed to by some communities and fps but not as clearly as the arrival of resources 110 facilitation times after the introduction of the programme and the agreement of communi ty leaders to partici pate there was also great variation in the amount of time required to proceed from the introduction of the programme to the election of the cdc in the study districts this period ranged from one to six months facilitating partners identified two factors that influence the length of time between the introduction of the programme to the community and the hold ing of cdc elections 1 fp staffing in many cases the time period between the ini tiation of the programme and the election were differences in the staffing levels and capacity of the fp almost all nsp communities studied had between two and five civiceducation meetings with the fp before holding an election but the time it took to conduct these meetings pended on the number of communities the fp covered and the number of staff available to do so for example in badakhshan reaching the election phase took one and half months in one district and six months in another despite community members having proactively re quested the programme in both because the two fps were not able to visit the community with the same frequency in most cases the variation in the introduc tion period reflected staffing levels and ease of travel more than the communitys reaction 109 on some reasons for late nsp funds disburseme nt see h nixon aiding the state 8 110 areu interview fp district nsp c oordinator bamyan september 2006 subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 39 2 female participation another issue that could influence introduction times was that of female participation in the election and the shura in two study communi ties this issue was cite d as problem in the civiceducation phase of the programme in both of them the realisation that nsp came with real resources and benefits aided in break ing what had been deadlock when we first started the nsp there was resistance to womens participation but now people have heard of it and have seen the benefits so the men allow the women and even encourage the women to participate female cdc members pashtun zar ghun herat 2005 in one case in badakhshan mixed community of ismaelis and pashtu ns were motivated to come to mutually acceptable compromise on womens participation due to the insistence of the fp that neither could benefit unless they were able to agree on meeting the requirement to form mixedsex cdc 111 the election of such council was dramatic change as previ ously women from the pashtun portion of the community had not even been known by name in the rest of the community this example il lustrates the integrative aspects of the pro gramme at both gender and communal levels interestingly nangarhar with its predominantly tribal pashtun population did not feature lays of this type upon examination the reason appears to be that the fp mostly operated under an assumption that bringing women into the election process would be fruitless and relied on selection instead women do not know about the elections we did not hear about it we were not called to have elections nothing 112 shortage of female staff is common fp staffing problem that exacerbates delays by making it difficult to access and mobilise female members of the community113 in sum the positive monstration effects aris ing from nsp implementa tion means that the introduction of nsp in communities becomes progressively easier over both space and time there is some evidence that geographic ap proach to implementation is more successful as it provides comprehensible rationale for the order in which nsp is introduced and because the positive demonstration effect means that communities are more likely to accept the pro gramme when it comes to their turn related question is whether because commu nity perceptions are changeable and heavily in fluenced by local experience poor programme performance may result in rejection occurring in the same manner this is an important consid eration given the problems cited by cdcs surrounding late block grant disbursements cor ruption and the overruling of project selection without proper explanation in short the acceptance of nsp will only remain as good as its per formance and poor performance and negative perceptions will have dramatic repercussions through the spread of distrust in neighbouring areas it is also important to note that the resources that cdcs can access for the community are an important source of acceptance of their role over time while this connection may seem ob vious the removal of second block grants in the nsp ii programme and the slow disbursement of funds during 2006 show that it has not been adequately reflected in programme design when funding or administrative barriers at the central level come into play an other factor behind cdc legitimacy is the fact that they are elected so fa r l i t tl tt n n h s b n p i d to n s u r i n g 111 areu cdc focus group badakhshan october 2006 112 female community members

nsp approach to inclusive community development iw boesen from subject s to citizens 57 areu synthesis paper series 40 that cdcs are regularl reelected though there are now increasing reports of reelections taking place establishing community development councils the process for electing cdcs is well defined in the operations manual for nsp the election should be held among all nationally eligible voters as secret ballot candidate lists and elec tioneering are prohibited and 40 percent of eli gible voters must vote for the election to be valid in addition the programme stipulates that the election be based on clusters of not more than about 20 families divided on geographical basis by neighbourhood each of which elects one representative the manual outlines some steps to deal with especially large more than 300 families communities and lows flexibility in how the ballot boxes and bal lots themselves are ma naged to best allow womens voting and ensure secrecy of the bal lot 114 electing the cdc members the principal finding of the research on the election of cdcs is that despite the guidance in the operations manual elections in reality were conducted in variety of different ways and that great deal of variation marked the way that cdcs were formed this variation was most often related to the way that womens participation was handled but also involved the use of clusters and candidacy in the research the fol lowing types of elections were identified standard in these cases the elections were conducted largely in line with the manual the community was divided into clusters of families based on location and each cluster elected one representative from among its number all electors were able to vote for people of either gender and candidacy and campaigning were prohibited in four of 14 standard elections this method resulted in all votes going to men and thus required additional measures to ensure womens par ticipation in the cdc either in mixed or separate councils 115 approximately half the 30 cdcs visited were elected in line with the requirements of nsp and the resulting coun cils were sometimes mixed sometimes seg regated and sometimes allmale standard with separate male and female elections this method echoed the standard election but in addition to dividing the community by geographic criteria the elections for men and women were separated men voted only for men and women only for women this method was used with variations in eight of th 29 communities stud ied five study communities held separate elections for separate male and female councils of equal size using the same clus ters for each in three of five communities studied in faryab province three or four additional femaleonly clusters were formed to divide the women of the community into voting groups this guaranteed representation for women but also institutionalised their minority status in the cdc standard with consociational and gender specific clusters in one case visited the male clusters were organised by subtribe rather than spatial location to ensure rep resentation of all community groups at least among males in addition three female clusters were identified to ensure female repre sentation and the outcome was single mixedgender cdc male only elections in two cases standard election was held but with only male voters who elected an allmale council where this 114 national solidarity programme operations manual 1517 115 this pattern of significant minority of elections resulting in allmale winners was broadly reflected in aggregate data where available for example in one district 5 of 45 standard elections resulted in females being elected areu interview district nsp mana ger badakhshan 7 october 2006 subnational statebuilding in

l i g i b l t vo t i n b th l ctions effectively casting one vote for men and one for women candidacy in one confirmed case the com munity voted for candidates who had pre sented themselves to the community as whole there was separate election for women based on clusters cluster selection in four cases all in nan garhar the social organisers identified candidate for each cluster and either through voting or selection this candidate was confirmed as the representative selection in one case there was elec tion the community and social organisers simply selected the council this also took place in nangarhar and reflected general but not total pattern of deviance from nsp guidelines in study sites in that province the districts in question were considerably insecure and this may have affected the process chosen consideration with implications for the implementation of the nsp in insecure areas these eight election types represent confirmed cases among the study sites and are not an ex haustive list some of these methods do not constitute elections at all while others such as separate male and female elections violate uni versal principles for free vote this finding is important to consider in efforts to scale up nsp or formalise cdcs outside the context of the programme it is particularly important if cdcs are considered as possible precursor for the village councils called for in the constitution since the majority of these observed variations cannot be considered general elections as called for in the constitution 116 types of cdcs not only did the study communities feature range of election types but the way that the cdcs were subsequently organised also varied fp staff and communities almost always scribed this variation in terms of the way that representation communication and influence between male and female members was organ ised these types do not capture variation in the patterns of inclusion an d representation of other groups there were four types of cdcs formed in respect to their organisation of gen der representation standard mixed cdc the nsp operations manual indicates that ideally each nsp com munity should have single cdc and that measures should be taken to ensure that women are able to participate in both elect ing and being elected to that council in one case where women were elected single allmale cdc was in place segregated elected male and female shuras while formally single cdc in prac ce m s t c d c s h ve t w b d i s t h t m t separately one for men and one for women this is the most common outcome among the study sites the way that communities describe these councils varies the womens council may be called the womens cdc or womens shura or subcdc segregated elected male and appointed female shuras in some cases the elections resulted in an allmale cdc this could occur either because voters elected only men or because the election pe rmitted only men to vote and be elected in most of these cases the fp and the community selected female shura in an attempt to meet nsp require ments 116 constitution of the islamic republic of afghanistan art 140 areu synthesis paper series 42 maleonly cdc in two cases maleonly cdc was formed in one community in faryab this was because mixed election produced single allmale council in nangarhar one community simply selected male council summary of election and cdc types range of different election types and resulting cdc structures were found in provinces across the country the standard model of cdc elec tion defined in the nsp procedures was found in four of the five provinces where communities were studied but at the same time this model only accounted for half of the communities overall this variation is due to local factors that cannot be generalised to the provincial level possible exception is nangarhar where communities studied held standard elec tion the second most common model was separate election among men and women for male and female members respectively this model could lead to th creation of either mixed or segregated councils except single case where only male council was formed the more dramatic deviations from the standard nsp model were relatively infrequent the forms of cdc formation that were least in clusive or participatory or that were not elections at all tended to be adaptations to restric tive gender norms at the community level womens councils were ppointed whether at cluster level or community level to offset re strictions on womens ability to vote in nan garhar the fp did in three cases forgo an elec tion altogether 117 in many cases it appeared that the fp adjusted the elections procedures away from the stan dard model in order to facilitate some womens participation in the councils by adopting separate male and female elections the facilitating partners were able to create female councils where it might not otherwise have been possible in less restrictive areas where it was possi ble to form mixed cdc through mixed elec tion some fps took steps to ensure women would be represented via female clusters but by community consent limited the number of female clusters to three or four out of com mittee of ten or twelve members communities willing to create mixed councils generally felt that female representatives s h ou l d b in th rity forming about one third of the council 118 communities that were planning on creating separate male and female shuras as in herat and nangarhar allowed for equal numbers of women to be elected via two equivalent but sexsegregated elections there is thus potential tradeoff between the degree of participation of women in an election and their participation in the council the more womens participation in the council was lowed the less democratic was the structure of their participation in the election 119 by the same logic the combination of fully mixed election and mixed cdc sometimes resulted in lower number of female representatives than other arrangements 120 the flexibility of fps in adapting the election system to community views on female participation is one of the fac t r s th t h v l l w d c d c s t b fo r m d i n such wide range of locations but also has implications for the standardisation of electoral processes where fp facilitation was weak and 117 other studies indicates that careful facilitation and use of is lamic teachings can be successful in overcoming local restrictio ns even in very conservative settings but require time i w boesen from subjects to citizens 57 118 this ratio was described as appropriate and consensual by the co mmunities and fps the reasons for the acceptance of two to ne ratio of men to women are unclear but it does echo some provisions of hanafi jurisprudence in relation to witnesses and inheritance rights 119 this finding is reinforced by work by former nspfp employee interviewed for this study who finds that

elec tion in herat even in the absence of systematic conclusions it is clear that wide range of interpretations exist among fps and regions about how to choose cdc officers the various operations manuals give relatively little guidance on this issue it may be that attention to this is war ranted as the selection of the cdc chair was matter of contention in some communities interviewed particularly when there was contro versy surrounding the efficacy of the chair the primary finding regarding the early phases of the programme is great variation in the ac tual implementation of nsp provisions regarding the formation of cdcs the next two sections examine the findings rrounding the two core functions of the cdcs set out in programme documents community development and local governance 53 cdc roles in communitydriven development project selection upon the establishment of the cdc fps assist i n fa ci l i ta n g s r i s f b t h c d c n d community meetings to establish community development plan cdp this cdp consists of list of subprojects chosen and prioritised by the community from the approved list of projects in the nsp manuals and documents this plan should also detail community contributions and the manner of inclusion of women and vulnerable individuals among project bene ficiaries 121 these latter requirements have changed over the course of the nsp and have been interpreted in different ways ranging from an enti tlement of 10 percent of the block grant for womens project typically humancapital development to selecting second sub project of varying cost focused on female bene ficiaries an important departure from the original entitlements for women was the curtailment of the proposed topup or second block grants which were often never disbursed due to extended times administering the first grant and the subsequent removal of these topup grants from nsp ii 122 information was collected both on the projects selected and the dynamics of project selection within the communities the data do not repre sent projects approved or implemented as in 121 nsp operations manual 2004 11 and 24 122 ministry of rural rehabilitation and

by broad category in table 52 though the sample is not statistically represen tative the heavy emphasis on infrastructure over livelihoods education and health projects mirrors the pattern found for all subprojects nationally 126 in the areu sample irrigation fig ured lower and electrification higher than in national total perhaps due to the lack of sam ple communities in the arid south due to the difficulties of collecting comparable data simultaneously from both male and female councils where they met separately limited in formation is available on the incorporation of expressed female priorities into the cdp where there were separate female councils their pri orities often differed from men focusing more on livelihoods and education an additional gen der dimension of subproject selection involved how the location of an infrastructure project influenced its benefits for women 127 the majority of the 18 segregated councils re ported that family gobetweens were the pri mary means of communication between coun cils in only one case did female council report that this system did not function in four of the six cases with good data on female priorities these did make it into the operative part of the cdp so this form of communication should not be discounted five councils noted however that the female council also provided written minutes or notes of their deliberations on the cdp to the men one noted that single female acted as the appointed gobetween and others noted that exceptional joint meetings were held for project decisions key factor in generating some of these joint meetings seemed to be the presence of the fp when the fp is there it is an extraordinary meeting and women participate but the women are not told about other meetings fp nsp manager badakhshan 2006 the separation of male and female councils need not prevent womens priorities being represented but generally in subordinate posi tion the existence of family gobetweens

governance activities of cdcs dynamics of project selection while the researchers did not directly observe the process of developing cdps qualitative ac counts of project selection provided interesting insight into the process of choosing develop ment priorities within afghan communities der nsp in all cases but two the cdc members described process of consensusbuilding in ciding on the subprojects to be included in the cdp this process always involved repeated meetings to achieve co nsensus and sometimes large number of meetings or considerable troversy discussion about the cdp took long time about three months of weekly meetings we brought all the villagers together and we made list of all the village problems which were 18 acted suggested we reduce the number of projects to the most impor tant by comparing with the budget and referring the list back to the whole village we gave priority to the three projects of greatest need cdc member of mixed cdc pashtun kot faryab 2005 the discussion for the cdp was very heated everyone presses for hisher specific pro ject after 21 days of long argument we all agreed cdc member of mixed cdc yakaw lang bamyan 2006 box 52 norm of equity in project selection in few of these cases this process appeared to be informed by norm of equal benefit projects which might have been initially higher on the list were rejected in favour of those that would benefit households equally we chose solar panels for four reasons fuel for lamps is expensive and bad for our health we want to enjoy more modern life and everyone receives equal benefits cdc mem ber waras bamyan 2006 question why did you give priority to these projects electrification literacy and tailor ing response the benefits of both are the same for all residents poor and rich landown ers and landless cdc member and cdc chairman pashtun zarghun herat 2005 our first priority was electricity for three reasons we have much water it was the only project that all the villagers can benefit from and we dont have much fuel for light and heating cdc member ishkashem badakhshan 2006 interestingly all three cases in which norm of equity was explicitly noted as guiding selec tion involved electrification possibly indicating that this particular form of development is viewed as particularly equitable in its benefits by contrast research in herat where communi ty buildings appeared frequently indicated that the benefits of these projects were limited for the marginalised management plans called for fees to be collected for baths and the community centres were used by those who were most able to hold larger li fecycle events such as weddings areu synthesis paper series 46 this process of consensus building appeared to aim at choosing projects which would benefit the widest range of community members and its prevalence suggests that the attempts to build nsp on existing afghan norms of consensus decisionmaking are quite well founded this process indicates some potential for propoor development represented by participation of the community in cdp development as box 52 shows in few cases this norm of equity was specifically referred to as reason for the pri oritisation agreed despite being more common than other proc esses consensus was not used in all cases to choose projects in at least one community the cdc described subproject selection as occur ring by majority vote in community meetings we announced the projects by number and then asked all the villagers about them fi nally we listed those projects that the majority wanted cdc member ishkashem badakhshan 2006 in another case the cdc itself determined the cdp priorities in combination with customary leaders first akf gave us wr itten list of projects and told us to select those of the highest need then the cdc together with the white beards met about the cdp we held three meetings at the first we 50 percent agreed at the second we 75 percent agreed and finally at the third we all 100 percent agreed on our projects cdc member waras bamyan 2006 this last case also was one of the three where norm of equity was expr essed indicating that such principles may still form part of discussions between elected cdc members and community elders as in most other aspects of nsp opera tion considerable variety seems to be the norm in the way that subprojects are chosen multicommunity projects and appeals outside nsp throughout the first three years of implementa tion nsp focused on projects within single community nonetheless in four of the commu nities visited there were projects either planned or underway jointly with neighbouring nsp com munities these joint efforts were sometimes single shared project sometimes separate projects for joint use in one case the community anticipated trading project outputs to help fund their own project operations and maintenance some communities combined their community block grants for joint project in faizabad badakhshan three communities agreed to do nate land they held in common for school to be shared among them importantly this was viewed as appropriate in part because these communities had once shared school that had been destroyed system of budgeting and compensation was established which took into account each communitys population and also the third communitys need to construct drinking water project by excusing them bour contribution in exchange for cash 128 simi larly in paktia six communities were reported to have combined budgets to build two high schools 129 in almar faryab one community also reported planning joint projects with neighbour to provide both electricity and drink ing water in other cases the communities agreed to build separate projects but for joint use these latter arrangements seemed at first glance more prone to cause conflict or dissatis faction among one of the parties see box 53 it is important to note that these examples of joint project selection took place before the introduction of formal programmes to group cdcs together such as jicas intercommunal rural development icrd initiative or the broader national areabased development pro

their role in implementing nsp cdcs are an institution in the society in our area for example we take plans from the cdc as input to our microarea development programme for capacitybuilding we hold

faryab the cdc contacted the provincial education department directly after agreeing to donate land for the building of school which was later built by turkish organisation 132 in most cases the fp pointed to manteqa level common interests derived from geographical or resource interdependence as determining the scale of the clusters ther is potential to build on these nascent linkages through future programming such as the implementation of the national land policy which mentions the use of cdcs despite these cases which seemed to depend on solid facilitation and the availability of other fp or nonfp programming in the area the rela tive infrequency of joint projects and the ap p r n ce f s m co n fli ct i n b u t h l f f th cases where they appeared suggests the goal of intercommunal solidarity is still somewhat dis tant from the reality of nsp implementation 130 mihrab is niche indicating the direction of mecca and marking the spac where religious leaders lead pr ayer in mosque

one public bath the female members of the cdc in the community which built the bath expected that their community would be able to use the other space for wedd ings and other gatherings we wanted community centre because we have problem of space for weddings and funerals we made an agreement with ne ighbouring village that we would build the hamaam which was second priority in our cdp they would build the community centre and we would share the two but they made the community centre into mosque an elder secretly had mihrab pulpit put into the community centre so when it was unveiled it was mosque 130 female cdc and youth group member zin dajan herat 2005 this conflict appears from supplementary information gathered to have two dimensions the deception of at least the fe male members of the second co mmunity by the first and the subversion of programme rules as religious buildings are not permitted under nsp rules areu synthesis paper series 48 54 cdc roles in community governance as outlined in the introduction to this chapter nsp is not only aimed at introducing and managing development projects it is also local gov ernance initiative aiming to lay the founda tions for strengthening of communitylevel governance as the first section of this report notes governance can cover range of public and quasipublic goods cdcs affect the process participation and accountability involved in managing development resources both internal and external to the co mmunity they therefore play role in the governance of community velopment crucial initial point is that govern ance and development should not be considered two autonomous domains of activity as much of governance involves the management of com mon resources the intention of cdc activity in community gov ernance is not limited to managing nsp block grants these committees are intended to alter the participation process and accountability involved in community decisionmaking in other areas of these two goals of nsp there has been far more emphasis on evaluating the pro grammes cdd aspects than its governance aspects this gap is in part due to the different nature of the data involved 133 nevertheless there is significant evidence that cdcs are playing role in other aspects of community govern ance the most prominent domains of commu nity governance activity emerging from the study were dispute resolution community bour ashar and social protection for the vul nerable these domains are discussed next followed by an analysis of the place of the cdc in the systems of local governance dispute resolution claims of the involvement of cdcs in some form of community dispute resolution are wide spread the elected and collective basis of the cdc appears to contribute to their role particularly in areas where previous disputeresolution mechanisms focused on influential individuals and not collective measures much more common however is kind of hybrid arrangement where cdc members may act in concert with customary leaders or other community repre sentatives of the 29 communities studied members of only four cdcs claimed that the council did not play any role in dispute resolution three of these negative responses were located in single district of nangarhar under single fp in this district clear distinction was drawn be tween the cdcs cdd function and other govern ance and problem solving cdcs are different from other shuras or jir gas in that they plan and organise develop ment projects cdc members nangarhar 2005 the various data collected on this district how ever indicate that the lack of involvement of the cdcs was only partly due to prevailing social norms about the appropriate role of such council and may also be related to generally weak facilitation in that district 134 while some involvement of cdc members in dis pute resolution is widespread the disputes in volved and the characteristics of this involve ment vary quite widely all of the disputes re ported fell into one of three broad categories the first type of dispute related to the nsp programme or development activity more generally these often took the form of intra or intercommunity concerns over the allo 133 j mcarthy 2006 spaces of power and part icipatory development in afghanistan 24 134 areu interviews cdc members social organise rs community members nangarhar august 2005 our purpose is to create

other disputes were not directly related to new development activities but had com munity resource dimension for example access to common paths roadways or water supplies third category was personal family or civil and even at times criminal matters be tween community members in many cases the lines between these types of disputes are blurred as can be seen in box 54 two characteristics of cdcs appeared to tribute to their role in dispute resolution 1 their elected and collective basis and 2 the contribution of nsp resources as incentive to solve conflicts in areas where disputes were previously resolved by single arbab woleswal police or local command er communities fps and local authorities noted that cdc decisions over small land and livestock disputes were more accepted due to the elected and collec tive nature of the council conflicts or disputes were previously solved by the arbabs personal decision or both sides were obligated to go to the woleswal for solution now that the cdc is elected by the people they bring problems there for solution cdc members almar faryab 2005 in two cases cdc members noted the impor tance of project funds in helping resolve dis putes between communities both of these communities had longstanding conflicts one of them deadly indicating poor disputeresolution capacity in such cases the incentive of the project funds can play role in reconciliation several nsp communities in talking about previ ous systems also pointed to bribery or costs associated with disputeresolution services by district officials or local appointees such as box 54 examples of disputes with cdc involvement in dispute resolution three small villages combined under the nsp to form single cdc and cided on three projects from their budget but before they began the prt came and completed drinkingwater project in one village with prt funds this created conf lict between the three villages because one already had their project completed before beginning nsp work the cdc resolved the problem by allowing the first village to have second project in road construction reconciliation was the key factor the sec ond two villages did not gain anything new from the solution fp nsp manager badakhshan 2006 b we have solved conflict between us and another village over water we have built dam to hold water for our use but the excess had caused damage to their cultivated areas and they wanted us to keep the water away as we were poor it was difficult to rebuild the water source elsewhere the cdcs selected representatives and estimated the value of the crops and gave them compensation for this year for the long term we approached ministry of agriculture and ngos to help construct sound water source to solve the problem cdc mem bers bamyan 2006 c one

qaryadars or maliks as factor not present with cdcs135 related finding is that where customary dis puteresolution mechanisms are organised col lectively rather than being absent or individu ally focused they are more likely to be combined with cdc activities rather than being re placed by them in an interesting illustration of this phenomenon three interviewees in badakhshan community gave three different an swers to question ab out dispute resolution the first suggested that community elders resolved disputes the second that the cdc re solved them while the third explained that be cause the elders participated in the cdc both were in fact right 136 s ci l or ga n is rs so times described this model in terms of conflict resolution committees including both cdc members and community elders while other cdc members described meeting together with elders to solve particular problems 137 ten of the 25 cdcs who claimed role in dis pute resolution clearly stated that they performed this role in combination with elders or religious figures in some way based on the ob served frequent attendance of noncdc elders in cdc meetings during interviews it is likely that these figures understate the amount of in volvement of elders in dispute resolution activities it seems probable that hybrid form of customary and rational authority is applied to dispute resolution in at least half of the commu nities studied these characteristics of cdcs even when acting in concert with other actors appeared to in crease the acceptance of council decisions even when they did not benefit one of the parties the element of consensus and reconciliation seems to be repeated pattern and may form the link with the authority deriving from the representative character of the cdc notably the one district where none of the study sites reported conflictresolution role for cdcs was the district where their members had been ap pointed not elected despite the potential benefits of cdc involve ment not all cdc disputeresolution efforts were reported as positive general tendency to obscure unsolved conflicts due to sense of privacy or collective shame was noted in num ber of interviews so it is likely that the re search underplays the prevalence of outstanding conflict it is important therefore not to over state either the changes or potential for dispute resolution brought by nsp nevertheless taken as whole the evidence supports the idea that cdcs or cdc members in combination with oth ers can play role but without displacing the procedures and legitimacy of more customary means particularly where these have collec tive quality limits to female participation in dispute resolution an important caveat to this finding is that it ap plies primarily to the role of male cdc members in part this has to do with the role of fps the election of cdcs and decisions about com munity development priorities occur through heavily facilitated process with procedures em phasising the participation of women without the fps presence this participation declines 138 in most places the meet ings on disputes were considered somewhat separate process and in some cases the use of predominantly male spaces like guesthouses or mosques reinforced this separation of the 25 cdcs performing some dispute resolution only two sets of female cdc members reported some participation in this process 135 areu interviews cdc and community members nangarhar ba myan and badakhshan august 2005 septemberoctober 2006 136 areu interview cdc members faiz abad badakhshan

gender dimension or other womens and chil drens conflicts beyond these four communities where women spoke of their role in solving conflicts further discussion revealed these functions were actually more related to social protection for poor and vulnerable women cdc involvement in ashar and social protection in six of the 29 communities visited the cdc identified itself as having role in organising ashar or community labour tasks typically cleaning of irrigation canals and road repair although ashar was acknowledged as prensp institution ashar was also explained by some cdcs as means for mobilising the labour portion of the communitys contribution to nsp sub projects ashar is relatively widespread phe nomenon in afghanistan and in the cases where the cdc identified this role it often represents continuation of previous practice where ques tioned further most of these cdcs did not differentiate between traditional ashar and the community labor under cdc leadership more prominent and novel role of cdcs was in the area of social protection one working defi nition of social protection is that it includes initiatives both formal and informal that provide social assistance to extremely poor individuals and households social services to groups who need special care or would otherwise be denied access to basic ser vices social insurance to protect people against the risks and consequences of liveli hoods shocks and social equity to protect people against social risks such as discrimi nation or abuse 139 while not all these roles are seen in all places there is significant evidence that most cdcs were able to formalise and expand some social protection functions ac ross these categories 140 social assistance and social insurance occurred through the creation of beneficiary lists for various activities such as nsp training projects or relief in the case of natural disasters and the collection of money for people suffering illness social services and social equity were mani fested in some cases by the creation or identifi cation of jobs in the community for particularly vulnerable individuals such as widows in many communities cdcs maintained community box which served either to collect money for poor families facing unusual hard ship or to support future community projects several cdcs acknowledged that the community box function was an extension of customary function of collecting money for mosque functions funerals and other immediate needs of families faced with shocks due to illness or death 141 while the collection of money for the poor and vulnerable on an ad hoc basis may be seen as an extension of traditional activity its institution alisation in community box was only seen der two fps this may indicate that as with dispute resolution where customary practices are merged or formalised with cdc functions through active facilitation they may be more accepted than when introduced entirely anew as small but versatile initiative the commu nity box was also viewed in some cases as an 139 s devereux and r sabateswheeler transformative social protection brighton uk institute of development studies 2004 140 thanks to

cdcs claimed to carry them out the female cdc members were aware and usually active in performing these functions in the cases of employment and several of the beneficiary lists this function was in fact carried out by the female cdc members s ci l p r t ct i n i s t h u s n r w i th m r womens participation than dispute resolution an overall conclusion can be drawn that womens participation is most prevalent in the areas where fp involvement is more intensive suggesting that facilitation is not only important for the scope of cdc activity but also has important gender implicatio ns in the absence of good facilitation or at the end of fp involve ment it seems likely that the level of womens participation may suffer even more quickly than cdc activity in general 55 conclusions cdcs in local governance cdcs have introduced dramatic change in the development resources available to many com munities in the country and where these resources have been converted to successful sub projects the acceptance and legitimacy of the programme and by extension the government has been expanded however the role of cdcs as new institution within the governance sys tem as whole is complex and varied several key conclusions can be drawn from the research to date community acceptance of cdcs depends on past experience material and human re sources available for facilitation and local implementation patterns it is also heavily dependent on the delivery and use of re sources and declines with delays or misuse of resources the implementation of all phases of nsp has been carried out in va ried ways including elections cdc composition and configuration cdp development and scope of activi ties outside project selection and implemen tation many cdc members claim to be involved in governance functions such as dispute resolution but these functions are not universal and where they occur they are often carried out in combination with customary structures the partial exception may be where previous governance structures were focused on one powerholder the genuine participation of women in cdc development and governance functions faces problems womens part icipation appears to be very dependent on the quality of facilita tion and is generally more limited in governance functions than in nsp project selection in the absence of facilitation womens par ticipation will likely suffer at an even faster rate than overall cdc activity great deal of attention is currently being paid to the current and future place of cdcs in local governance systems but this attention has yet to produce coherent and clear strategy consideration of how to combine the role of cdcs in community development with permanent place in subnational governance has lagged behind the advance of the nsp itself the result has been debate over cdcs that is polarised and restricted to the terms set by the constitution over village councils debate that is both premature and excludes more gradual and prag matic strategies to capitalise on the presence of cdcs ongoing efforts to review and improve the nsp the increased attention to subnational govern ance by the afghan government and its interna tional partners and the formation of the idlg in late 2007 are creating new opportunities to subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 53 define the future role of cdcs doing so success fully is crucial step in afghanistans current transition to developm ent process that real ises the strategic interdependence of community governance and development through the establishment of the the basic institutions and practice of democratic governance at the national provincial district and village levels for enhanced human development as demanded by the interim afghanistan national development strategy iands 142 several key questions are central to any effort to develop widely accepted policy for the fu ture of cdcs should they be formally recognised as state institutions bylaw calling for increased formalisation of cdcs is in circulation this bylaw calls for the recognition of cdcs by formal state authorities their designation as the community interlocutor for all development interventions and grants them some administrative functions this proc ess is largely driven by mrrd and is yet to enjoy wide political acceptance it may be that this approach in the absence of more comprehensive framework stresses the formalisation of cdcs without paying suffi cient attention to the local variations in cdc functions the most appropriate mix of functi ons for them and the benefits that may accrue from their status as communitybased and not government entities at the same time institutional means for sup porting cdcs should form part of the mixture of policy options available when determining the future role of these councils what will be the resour ces both material and in terms of technical assistance and facilitation available to cdcs after nsp it is clear that cdcs have functioned most posi tively in the selection and implementation of subprojects and their acceptance legitimacy and ability to perform other tasks are all related to the resources they bring to communities consideration of their future role must include discussion of the range of resources that will be available and the mix of governmental and non governmental involvement in providing these if cdcs are to continue to function in wide areas of the country they will require resources from an expanding set of sources coupled with the technical support to take advantage of these while deepening community capacity as well as that of the council itself what will be the appropriate scale for the delivery of such resources cdcs are already in some areas combining ef forts through joint projec ts and in other areas programmes to group or cluster cdcs are underway these efforts suggest that clusters that respond to locally appropriate development scales appear more naturally due to infrastructure or resource interdependencies that may be present at that level this raises questions about the organisation of development representation below and at the district level cur rently addressed piecemeal by nabdp and other clustering programmes without clear link to plans for district and villagelevel representa tion in the long run should they perform administrative governance tasks as well as development tasks mandating single universal governance role for cdcs would produce mixed outcomes due to the variation in how cdcs currently function in relation to customary structures while there is evidence of fruitful go vernance improvements linked to cdcs this is often achieved through the implicit or explicit recognition of pre existing governance patterns not wholesale at tempts to replace them 142 government of afghanistan goa interim afghanistan national development strategy vol i 122 areu synthesis paper series 54 how can the impact of cdcs on the inclu sion and representation of women and other marginalised community groups be strengthened and deepened t h r l f c dc s i n em p w r i n g w m n nd other vulnerable groups is dependent on active facilitation and cannot be assumed to be per sistent gains just as the cdc itself cannot be considered persistent institution without consideration of the factors just mentioned as nsp comes to close the support of broadened in clusion and representation seen in the context of cdcs must continue these questions can longer be answered in isolation from many other questions in subna tional governance policy including the roles and relationships of district governors in relation to other bodies the form of districtlevel elected representation in the future the fiscal status of subnational state units and the sequencing of changes in all of these areas subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 55 this study aimed to draw together observations and evidence about range of statebuilding initiatives at various subnational levels in af ghanistan since 2002 as such it is not com prehensive review of single initiatives such as the election of provincial councils or the imple mentation of the national solidarity pro gramme there is growing awareness that subnational governance as whole is crucial to pro gress in the governance economic and security transition challenges still facing afghanistan subnational governance is system that has many components at different levels compris ing both formal state institutions and range of less formal actors structures and processes by examining together the political and techni cal dimensions of various subnational state building initiatives as they have been imple mented this study aims to draw general conclusions about the system of subnational govern ance in turn these observations can illustrate what has been missing from statebuilding efforts to date and generate recommendations for the establishment of better subnational govern ance and an increasingly effective accountable and legitimate state this chapter outlines some of these general conclusions and recommenda tions 61 the lack of subnational governance policy governance policy and the statebuilding initia tives that can be loosely said to form its opera tional basis have been introduced and imple mented in piecemeal fashion often driven by factors external to the search for the most appropriate and sustainable institutions for the af ghan context more accurately to date subna tional statebuilding in afghanistan has been characterised by lack of subnational governance policy instead disparate initiatives have been intro duced in response to pressures related to the political transition but without sufficient reference to their relation to the whole the national solidarity programme flagship national priority programme with many positive results to show for it was introduced to fill gap in the provision of development resources to com munities on national basis at time when state structures were unable to do so directly as communitydriven development initiative however it has also been presented as having important governance dimensions the uncer tainty surrounding this role and its appropriate ness remains prime feature of the uncertainty in the subnational governance landscape provincial councils while called for in the stitution were elected less to take considered place in the framework of subnational govern ance than to fulfil constitutional requirements for local representation and the formation of the national assembly subsequent development of the pc role has worked around or avoided solid definition of the crucial relationships that normally should link representative bodies with legislative functions ccess to resources and representative accountability in the same way provincial development com mittees were formed to bring some order to dis parate both functional and dysfunctional coordination and planning mechanisms in provinces in some sense they also were an inter mediate solution to the inherent contradictions between the vertical structure of state service delivery the line ministries and the influence both formal and informal of the provincial gov ernors as such pdcs present an improvement over the preexisting situation but not yet comprehensive solution to the question of the role of provinces in planning in effect the theoretical sequence for policy development that begins with strategy and moves through policy programme and project has been reversed in the case of subnational governance while broad albeit incomplete strategy is emerging through the ands process this strategy is forced to accommodate the range of initiatives and activities that have been layered onto the subnational governance 6 conclusions and recommendations areu synthesis paper series 56 landscape over the past few years each of the parts examined in this study as well as range of activities by prts and other governance ac tors are now being accommodated into framework however the crucial link between the broad strategic goals of the iands and the policy to reach those go als has not yet been suc cessfully built there have been some sound or at least intelli gible reasons for this reversal of rational policy making the desire to do things quickly arose from the pressures of shortterm relief and reconstruction soon after the fall of the taliban the need to accommodate regional and provin cial powerholders in the absence of robust security assistance regime and divergent goals on the part of major actors between counter terror and development in afghanistan the lack of comprehensive political settlement enabling sufficient security for nationbuilding processes to take root has its legacy in the diverse and incomplete subnational governance system while these initiatives have produced some very important gains in increasing the presence of the afghan state in the provinces and districts of the country quite fundamental aspects of the nature of that state remain unresolved in such situation the management of expectations on the part of the population is made more difficult and the perceptions of afghan people are more vulnerable to the observed inadequacies of the state consistency and quality of service delivery appointments or security they are also more prone to adopt the idea that local governance structures and inter national involvement in statebuilding are particularistic inconsistent and respond to concerns other than the provision of services to the population the recognition of the importance of subna tional governance must be accompanied by the understanding that piecemeal initiatives cannot produce effective results in the majority of the country as long as the overall shape of the subnational governance system remains undetermined in important respects the continuing imperatives to generate shortterm initiatives to confront the crises the country faces must be increasingly reconciled with longerterm proc ess of statebuilding th at remains openended an important dimension of this reconciliation will be the balance between the current frame work of the constitution and the opportunity presented by relatively open set of goals out lined in the iands recommendations the reform of different subnational govern ance structures in afghanistan must be sidered together the idlg may present an opportunity in this regard if it can take the leading role in coordinating the disparate ef forts at community district provincial and municipal level to do so the idlg must pay due attention not only to the imperatives of shortterm stabilisation and security but also dedicate sufficient material and intellectual resources to comprehensive policy development over the next three or more years encompassing upcoming elections such policydevelopment process must be insulated from daytoday crises and re quires political will that may have to extend to the promotion of renewed political peace or even constitutional process in the future the most important aspect of this policy velopment process is not to do everything in one office but to ensure that more logical sequence of initiatives emerges crucial area for sequencing involves the determination of the relationship between representa tion resources and accountability for elected bodies at all levels the corresponding reform of electoral systems and calen dars and the holding of the next elections in afghanistan this requirement holds for all levels from the village to the national an important implication is that any changes to the fiscal relation ships among different levels of government should be linked to the framework for the roles of representative bodies subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 57 62 implementation of subnational governance programmes what is obvious from the examination of the statebuilding initiatives in this study is that na tionallevel initiatives produce wide variety of outcomes when implemented in the afghan context this is due to the varied political social economic and institutional environments in the country as well as the different implementing actors the nsp while providing detailed set of pro cedures and rules for its implementation is in troduced into variety of local contexts by variety of facilitating partners the outcomes of the programme particularly in its less discussed governance implications therefore vary signifi cantly the idea of cdcs as consistent and persistent institutions that operate in the same way everywhere is not yet accurate provincial development committees introduced to bring consistency to chaotic coordination environment in actuality range from quite effective to insignificant when examined on the ground efforts to link them to some form of budgeting process may bear fruit but their role remains largely contingent on governors at tempts to build nationallevel systems on such interventions may underestimate the varied re alities created by them on the ground recommendations nationallevel statebuilding should not ways be equated with uniform nationallevel programmes new institutions should have adaptive and open architectures to accom modate asymmetrical roles and development across the country and over time one sired result may require different starting points and paths in different contexts for example policy on cdcs should allow these bodies both to continue what they have been good at smallscale development assistance and to expand and increase that role through flexible opportunities to access resources group together to cooperate on development issues and engage in govern ance functions such as security management in cooperation with local government the implications of any legislative action on cdcs for that flexibility should be carefully considered and overly prescriptive solutions should be avoided in the short term this recommendation also applies to reform of the justice sector and the allocation of concentrated servicedelivery responsibili ties to provincial departments varied configurations of nonstate actors structures and processes play an important role in subnational governance in afghani stan these configurations will remain in the short term whether in respect to justice provision dispute resolution security issues credit or social protection the positing of national policy choice between formal or in formal systems is artificial because both in variably will coexist programmes should be oriented toward creating effective and vi able alternatives to unsuitable aspects of the current governance arrangements attempting to entirely replace such arrange ments will only produce perverse outcomes 63 barriers to reform and the art of the possible one of the central findings of this study is that there is fundamental duality to the system of government in afghanistan on the one hand government of relationships operates through the system of provincial and district governors this system has its roots in the prewar arrangements and has been revived since 2001 it oper ates through mixture of informal and formal gubernatorial powers over expenditures coordination appointments and control of access to state bodies in the context of post2001 state building this system has helped manage the influence of local powerholders extend the reach of the presidency and meet various short term counterinsurgency counterterrorism and counternarcotics needs as system it has been intimately linked to both the office of the president and the ministry of interior relationareu synthesis paper series 58 shipbased governance contradicts and has fused efforts to reform public administration into rational bureaucracy on the other hand the primary formal mecha nism for the delivery of services other than security to the population is through system of vertically independent and highly centralised ministries some of these ministries have undergone considerable reform through the efforts of various programmes driven and funded by international statebuilding assistance while considerable challenges remain there are signs of improving performance in several ministries with responsibility for services the interaction between these two systems however has yet to receive sufficient and sustained attention the former system should not be abandoned in favour of the latter but rather the inconsistencies and perverse outcomes arising from the interaction of the two require analysis and measured attention here the foregoing recommendation about the possibility of open and asymmetric approaches is most important recommendations the relationship between the system of gov ernors and police chiefs and the servicedelivery arms of the government must be progressively defined and circumscribed in law and practice this may have to occur at varying pace in varyin g locations and must recognise the importance of local leadership in producing results in the remote areas of afghanistan given political and topographical realities central aspect of this process will be bal anced and gradual reexamination of the place of governors at both provincial and district levels this reexamination should not be seen as weakening or removal of governors or simply search for the right or good governors it must instead involve an appraisal of the legal and actual power of governors in relation to the systems by which they are made accountable to the population crucial dimension of this is the role of governors in controlling access and influencing expenditures enhancing down ward accountability of governors need not take the form of direct elections though this should not be ruled out as longterm goal but can be derived from altering relations in the other government branches in cluding the representative bodies and ser vicedelivery units reform and deconcentration of service delivery responsibilities of the servicedelivery arms of the state should be signed to reduce the confusion caused by the coexisting governance structures formally integrating the role of governors with rationalised forms of servicedelivery representative bodies involve aspects of both systems of governance and can thus play more important role in reducing the contradictions between the two by linking representation to resources and accountabil ity elected bodies may be able to help increase the accountability of the government of relationships at the same time that it can bring improvements to the work of service delivery strengthening both the representa tive basis and the monitoring role of subna tional elected bodies possibly over the next election cycle should be priority 64 developing subnational governance policy all of these conclusions point to the need for subnational governance policy any such policy must contend with the realities on the ground and must be subject to the kind of policy formation outlined in 61 above the piecemeal ef forts of the past must now be knitted together and altered where necessary to form part of fabric of subnational governance that is guided by coherent and nationallyagreed goals about the nature role and reach of the afghan state this kind of holistic view cannot emerge through single consultation but must be arrived at through series of carefully sequenced steps and it must always consider the possibility of subnational statebuilding in afghanistan 59 varying progress and future changes to the design as the asia foundation has already re marked the fundamental challe nge to subnational governance reform is the lack of coherent vision for practical implementation of subnational governance framework within context where local go vernment efforts are diluted and confounded by local politics with strong wartime legacies143 this core challenge however is much easier to point out than to resolve systems of local gov ernance throughout the world are continuously undergoing changes of direction reversals and dramatic transformations this process is not matter of single programme or given institu tional design it is journey toward state in which legitimacy is gradually strengthened through effectiveness and accountability reach is extended through legitimacy and sustainability is gradually created through efficiency and steadfast support to coherent and increasingly comprehensive vision while this may appear somewhat optimistic der current circumstances there are some concrete steps that can assist in making subnational governance policy reality many of these steps build on recent developments such as the ands and the formation of the idlg which have brought the possibility of development of sub national governance policy much closer than it was at the time of research recommendations range of disparate subnational governance issues must be brought into single policydevelopment framework the institutional focus of this policy process should be the idlg in close interaction with the partners outlined in the idlg strategic framework through the formation of policy group particular attention must be given to the sustained inclusion in the process of the ministry of finance the ministry of interior the ministry of economy the mrrd the presi dency the ands and the national assem bly the idlg must work to insulate this longer term process from the demands of shortterm security and stabilisation initiatives and work to ensure that contradictions are minimised some issues that must be included in the subnational governance policy include the number and nature of elected bod ies their access to resources and the system by which they are elected the relation between communitylevel repre sentation and districts is complex one that involves the future structure of cdc type bodies therefore while cdcs should be supported both materially and technically under an open framework final policy on cdcs should not be rushed the relationship between elected bodies and the governors at provincial and district level these relationships should be defined in respect to the resources that flow to subnational jurisdictions and to the accountability of governors the sys tem and calendar of election of these bodies should be suited to these rela tionships not the reverse the eventual nature of provincial and national budgeting and its relation to both elected bodies and governors should be determined before elections even if not fully established the final status of municipalities and the system of accountability for their im portant revenueraising and service delivery functions needs to be progres sively narrowed and codified 143 the asia foundation taf an assessment of subnational governance in afghanistan 2 areu synthesis paper series 60 planning at subnational levels must cor respond to the resources available there and the procedures for allocating those resources in the long run consultative planning structures as presently being constituted will not substitute for the representative accountability brought about by elected representation the role of prts and locally imple mented governance initiatives in the overall strategy should be progressively subjected to this national policy process all of these questions cannot be resolved si multaneously the first st ep is to establish process by which they can be resolved in sequence that is conducive to coherent pol icy144 such process might include the constitution of policy group as tailed above and the definition by this policy group of the thematic areas of the subnational governance policy these thematic areas shou ld be integrated where possible with ands and compact benchmarks for governance and with any supplementary benchmarks on subnational governance the current strate gic framework for idlg draws on these benchmarks heavily but more attention must be given to their sequencing the commissioning of research and pol icy support to the idlg and the policy group in the thematic policy areas pos sibly including an assessment of the current institutional state of subnational governance this objective can be largely met through the synthesis and presentation of existing information compilation and gap analysis of the ex isting legal frameworks for subnational governance comparative analysis of cal governance policies in other coun tries with particular focus on islamic tribal and postconflict cases and iden tification of range of policy options on the basis of the thematic areas identified by the policy group the definition and implementation by the policy group of mechanism for na tional and subnational consultation based on policy options available the consideration by the policy group of results and recommendations of studies and that of subnational and national sultations and the development of strategic policy framework on subnational governance outlining strategic goals specific to each thematic area identified above and paying close atten tion to appropriate sequencing of goals the development of the legal and regu latory instruments necessary to imple ment this policy framework potentially with ratification carrying over to sec ond term of
