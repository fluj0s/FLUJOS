policy division june 28 2004 abstract recent improvements in information sharing technology and concern over the safety of americas children have increased the amount of criminal background checks performed on potential adoptive parents foster care families and other people that are in close contact with children such as child care providers and youth program volunteers these background checks are not for criminal justice purposes meaning that the people under review are not being investigated for particular crime but are performed with the cooperation of law enforcement agencies the persons required to undergo background check and the procedures needed to complete each review vary greatly by state but often include series of searches in state and federal criminal history databases as well as state child abuse and neglect records systems while previous criminal conviction does not always mean that person is unsuitable to work or live with children state social service agencies and child care providers use this information as part of wider process to help ensure the safety of children served through their organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32430congressional

organizations states have considerable flexibility to implement their own laws and procedures for conducting background checks for child care and child welfare purposes however federal laws and grant programs provide some assistance and guidance to the states for example the national child protection act of 1993 ncpa does not mandate that states enact any legisla tion requiring background checks but does provide the legal framework for states to require the federal bureau of investigation fbi to perform background checks in accord ance with any existing state legislation for people that have responsib ility for the safety and wellbeing of children the adoption and safe families act asfa requires that criminal records check be conducted before approving prospective foster or adoptive parent for child who is eligible to receive fede ral foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payments title ive children finally the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta has recently been amended to provi that later than 2006 states must perform background checks on all adults residi ng in prospective adoptive or foster parent household states vary greatly in the types of persons required to have background check and the procedures needed to comple each background review some states examine only the criminal history records located in their own law enforcement databases while other states have the fbi perform criminal history records check that includes information from other federa l and state databases these checks also vary by situation for example stat often have different background check requirements for potential child care providers and their families than they have for potential foster care and adoptive parents an important decision each state must make in creating its background check process is whether to require applicants to submit fingerprints or to search criminal history records solely on basic identifying information such as persons name social security number and date of birth law enforcement experts consider fingerprint submissions to be more co mprehensive though sometimes more costly and burdensome than basic checks some local law enforcement agencies have been able to use some federa l grant funding from the national criminal history improvement program nchip to help pur chase electronic fingerprinting equipment and implement

their organizations federal legislation states have considerable flexibility in implementing their own laws and procedures for conducting background checks however federal laws and grant programs help guide the way states or ganize and operate their background check systems this section is intended to pr ovide an overview of the laws and programs most relevant to the noncriminal backgr ound checks usually conducted for child care and child welfare purposes national child protection act of 1993 the national child protection act of 1993 ncpa pl 103209 encourages st ates to improve the quality and increase the use of their criminal history and child abuse records for child protection purposes although the legislation does not mandate that states act any legislation requiring background checks it does encourage stat to create their own background check process for certain child welfare and child care purposes it also provides the legal framework for states to re quire the fbi to perform background checks in accordance with any existing state legislation in ddition ncpa llows states to establish procedures that mandate checks on pr ospective employees and volunteers for organizations serving youth the elderly and individuals with disabilities in an effort to increase the usefulness of the information being examined in these background checks ncpa encourages interstate information sharing of criminal history records and requires states to submit or index certain child abusehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32430crs2 crime information in fbi criminal history record systems it further mandates that the us attorney general establish ries of procedures and deadlines for improvements in each states criminal hist ory records system generally states satisfy the submission requirements by reporting all feloni and particular misdemeanors to the fbi the ncpa was further amended by the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 s ection 320928 to establish maximum charge by the fbi of 1800 per background check and in 1998 pl 105251 to provide that youthserving volunteer organizations and institutions may contact an authorized state agency to request national criminal fingerprint background checks in those cases where the state lacks regu lar procedures for requesting such checks victims of child abuse act enacted as title xx of the crime control act of 1990 the victims of child abuse act requires background checks for federal government employees or em ployees who work at f acility operated by or under contract with the federal government w ho provide child care services to children under the age of 18 for these purposes th law defines child care services to include child protective services incl uding investigation of abuse and neglect reports child day care foster care resi dential care social services health and mental health care education recreationa l or rehabilitative prog rams and detention correctional or treatment services the law further requires that these background checks be based on fingerprints and other identifying information and that they be conducted through the fbi and through each states criminal history records for which an employee lists current or former residence on an employment application under the act federal agencies may deny employment to any individual convicted of sex crime an offense involving child vi ctim or drug felony finally the act encourages federal agencies and fac ilities to perform voluntary background checks on volunteers who provide any of the lis ted child care services and on adult household members in places where child care or foster care services are being provided in home adoption and safe families act the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 provisions were devel oped to increase the safety of children placed in foster or adoptive homes and to shorten the amount of time children stay in foster care as part of asfa congress mandated that criminal records check be conducted before pproving prospective foster or adoptive parent for child who is eligible to receive fede ral foster care maintenance or adoption assistance payments title ive children asfa does not expr essly require that states conduct these checks for prospective foster or adoptive pa rents of children who are not eligible for title ive payments however state criminal background procedures are assessed as part of the us department of health and human services child and family services review under asfa states have considerable flexibility in the types of records checks needed eg one or more of fbi state local child abuse and neglect registry and the procedures used to finalize each check however asfa does list several criminal offenses that must disqualify pros pective foster or adoptive parents of title ive eligible children if found in the background check process these offenses include any felony convictions for child abuse or neglect spousal abuse crimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32430crs3 1 section 106 asfa 2 us congressional affairs office depa rtment of health and human services 3 section 408 of the indian child protec tion and

final approval be denied for persons that have felony conviction within the past five years for physical assault battery or drugrelated offense asfa also allows states to go beyond these minimum requir ements by denying approval because of other convictions1 states are eligible to optout of these specific asfa background check mandates to make this choice state must either have its legislature enact law or have its governor provide written notification to the secretary of the us department of health and human services hhs that explains the states decision to optout of the background check requireme nts and provide an alternative plan to ensure childs safety as intended in asfa according to the latest data available from hhs april 2003 nine states had chos to optout of asfa although all of these states continued to perform background checks under state mandates2 i n general states optout to avoid th requirement that applicants be automatically rejected if they had felony conviction of one of the specific crimes listed in the act indian child protection and family violence prevention act the indian child protection and family violen ce prevention act title iv of pl 101 630 requires background checks for federal nd tribal agency employees that have regular contact with or control over am erican indian children the department of the interior has interpreted the law to include prospective foster and adoptive parents the legislation provides some minimum guidelines and requires that an applicant be denied if he or she has been found guilty of or entered plea of nolo contendere to any felony or any two or more misdemeanor offenses under federal state or tribal law involving crimes of violence sexual assault molestati on exploitation contact or prostitution crimes against persons or offenses committed against children3 under the legislation states and tribal g overnments retain cons iderable flexibility in the databases they search and the pro cedures

perform some sort of background check on prospective foster or adoptive parents the laws most significant impact appears to be its requirement that other adults residing in the household must have background checks crime identification technology act of 1998 the 105th congress enacted the crime identification act of 1998 cita pl 105251 to upgrade criminal history record systems and to improve the ability of law enforcement agencies to share information across juri sdictions as part of cita congress continued funding for the national criminal history improvement program nchip which uses series of grants to improve the quality timeliness and immediate accessibility of criminal history r ecords for both civil and criminal justice purposes nchip grants may be used for variety of data impr ovement projects such as upgrading electronic fingerprinting capacities integrating criminal history data systems improving states ability to co mply with section 103b of the brady handgun violence prevention act 18 usc 922 and improving participation in the fbis interstate identification inde x discussed below in 2000 pl 106177 child abuse and prevention enforcement act amended nchip to specify an additional purpose for these funds to impr ove the capability of the criminal justice system to deliver timely accurate and comp lete criminal history record information to child welfare agencies organizations and programs that are engaged in the assessment of risk and other activities related to the protection of children including protection against child sexual abuse and placement of children in foster care technologies supported by nchip grants may assist the background check process for child care and child welfare purposes by speeding up the processing time and reducing the staff needed to complete the background checks in the relevant law enforcement agencies most st ates receive at least some nchip funding every year which totaled appr oximately 439 million between fy1995 and fy20035 interstate identification index iii cita also encouraged states to participate fully in the fbis interstate identification index iii system the iii is national identification index that allows states to operate their own criminal history records repositories while storing copies of the names and basic identification information of the people in those records in national fbi database6 queries to the iii use persons name and identification information to search for fbi indexed record if found the record will point the inquiring agency to the state or federal agencies that are in possession of those databases thereby allowing inter jurisdictional exchange of criminal histor information without requiring the fbi to maintain duplicate copies of the records in centralized database the fbi provides records to the iii system for federal and foreign offenders as well as persons arrested in the district of columbia and us territorieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32430crs5 7 us department of justice federal bureau of investigation criminal justice information services division interst ate identification index iii national fingerprint file nff program revised mar 2004 8 many states have ratified the national cr ime prevention and privacy compact but are not yet exchanging records through the iii for noncriminal justice purposes because of administrative and technological reasons twenty one states have ratified the compact ak ar az co ct fl ga ia ks mn mo mt nc nh nj nv oh ok sc and tn httpwwwsearchorgpolicycompactprivacyaspwhile all states may request criminal history information via the iii system not all states are providing their own records to the system as of march 2004 47 states were providing at least some record access to the iii alt hough some states were only partially participating and had not integrat ed all of their records with the system7 records that cannot be provided dir ectly from states repositories for iii uses are sometimes available to requesting agencies through other federal databases consisting of state record submissions sent to the fbi however criminal history records exchanged directly from the state repositories through the iii system are some times more current than records obtained from fbi duplicate files because information from the state repositories reflect the late st changes in each records information cita also recognized that existing state policy and legal barriers prevented some states from sharing their records directly with other states through the iii for purposes other than criminal justice inve stigations including background checks for child care and child welfare to address this cita created the national crime prevention and privacy compact to regulate the use of the iii system for noncriminal justice purposes participation in the compact is not mandatory and requires that it be ratified by states legislature in iden tical form once adopted the compact takes precedence over other state policies and states are able to exchange the most current state records with other agencies authorized through the iii system states that have not ratified the compact cannot directly provide their criminal history records to other state agencies for noncriminal purpos although they can provide duplicate records to the fbi which then can exchan ge some information in those records with the requesting states as of march 2004 ven states had ratified the compact and are providing records to the iii for authorized noncriminal uses8 types of background checks describing the noncriminal background check process in generic terms is difficult since state governments organize and operate their child protection and child care services in very different ways ho wever enough similaritie s exist across states to describe the basic types of back ground checks performed and the fundamental procedures needed to complete the proce ss although some states perform personal interviews with an applicants family or place of employment in some cases most of the background check process for potential child care providers and foster care and adoptive parents consists of searching st ate and federal govern ment databases for criminal history records as well as statecontrolled child abuse and neglect registries every state performs background checks alt hough some states will not perform all of the types of checks listed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32430crs6 9 the fbi background checks described in this report should not be confused with the checks performed to comply with the brady handgun violence prevention act which uses the national instant criminal background chec k system nics nics is specifically designed to perform background checks for transf ers of firearms and is not used for child care and child welfare purposes for additi onal information on the nics background check system see crs report rl32842 gun legislation in the 109th congress by william j krousestate and local criminal history checks the most common type of background check performed for child care nd child welfare purposes consists of state database search of its criminal hist ory records although states vary on what they store in these systems the databa ses normally contain r ecords documenting most felony and some misdemeanor offenses committed within the state some states retain only the most basic case information such as the date and purpose of arrest while other states keep more indepth info rmation such as the disposition of the case and the sentence served some background checks for child care and child welfare issues also examine criminal history data bases from city or county law enforcement agencies but this process may be unnecessary if the states main criminal history database is regularl updated by local court systems and law enforcement agencies federal fbi database checks while state database s generally contain the most accurate and current data on criminal activity within state individual state records systems do not provide information reported by other fe deral and state law enforcement agencies since people may m ove across state lines some states require that background checks performed for child care and child welfare purposes utilize the more comprehensive background check systems facilitated through the fbi these federal checks require fingerprinting and can be used to share certain criminal history information housed in other state and federal data bases the information in these databases includes most of the felony and some misdemeanor criminal records as well as some information related to few specific homeland security databases9 child abuse and neglect registries many substantiated cases of child abuse or neglect do not lead to criminal c onvictions and may not be included in state and federal criminal history files therefore most states have central registry for the reporting of certain child abuse and ne glect cases that may not have resulted in criminal conviction states vary in th way they organize and operate their registries and not all states use the info rmation in the registry during the background check process at the current time national mechanism exists for the interstate sharing of information stored in state child abuse and neglect registries although individual states and localities sometimes create their own information sharing agreements fingerprinting an important decision each state must make in creating its background check process is whether to require applicants to submit fingerprints or to search criminal history records solely on basic identifying information such as persons name social security number and date of birth law enforcement experts consider fingerprint submissions to be more relia ble and comprehensive than basic checkshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32430crs7 10 exceptions to the fingerprinting requirement are sometimes made for people with serious hand injuries or physical conditions that make fingerprinting difficult 11 each fbi background check costs between 18 and 24 although state and local agencies may also charge their own fees for the service the fbi is allowed to charge slightly higher fee for states that have just recently passed their state stat utes requiring background checks to help cover technological improv ement expenses fbi congressional affairs office department of justice telephone conversation apr 20 2004 12 dunhem and oppenheim understanding criminal records checks 13 few states do not have the ability to electr onically transmit fingerprints to the fbi even though some law enforcement agencies in those states have livescan equipment in these situations state law enforcement agencies rece ive the electronic transmissions from the local governments then print out paper copies of th fingerprints before mailing them to the fbi for more information on fingerprint submi ssions see us general accounting office law enforcement information on timeliness of criminal fingerprint submissions to the fbi gao04260 jan 2004since many criminals use an alias to hide th eir true identity in addition states that do not require fingerprinting are unable to perform fbi background checks for most child care and child welfare purposes10 therefore background checks that do not include fingerprint submissions will have only minimal information bout crimes committed in states other than the one initiating the background check many states however choose not to re quire fingerprints for their background checks because the fingerprinting process is usually slower more expensive11 and places additional burden on both the agencies performing the check and the applicant child care organizations and child protection agencies cite the fingerprint process as reason for delays in the approval process12 unlike background checks that rely on persons name and social security num ber alone fingerprinting often requires person to make an additional trip to law enforcement agency for the printing service this process may be burdensom for people with busy work schedules or who live in rural areas without fingerpr inting location nearby in addition some organizations that are dependent on volunt eer support have expressed concern that lengthy background check process may discourage people from applying for needed position some of the delays and administrative burdens associated with fingerprintbased records checks are reduced when submitted to state and fbi databases electronically paperless rather than on 10finger print cards electronic submissions are faster because they do not have to be converted to electronic format before the check can be made they also reduce some of the rrors associated with 10finger cards such as misprinted or smeared submissions that can cause considerable delays in foster care and adoption placements as well as the hiring of new child care employees for electronic submissions people usually visit local law enforcement agency and are fingerprinted using an optical scanning machine called livescan these machines put the fingerprints in electronic format for quick transmission to state and federal crime information centers13 this potentially can shorten the background check process several days or weeks since th cards longer need to be physically delivered between agencies while electronic submissions are generally preferred over 10finger cards the large cost of li vescan equipment is the main reason thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32430crs8 14 in fy2003 the fbi received total of 17736541 fingerprint submissions 86 million 48 of total of these submissions were for civil purposes of these 86 million civil submissions 73 were submitted electronically for more information see testimony of michael d kirkpatrick assistant director in charge criminal justice information services division federal bureau of investiga tion mar 30 2004 http wwwfbigovcongress congress04033004kirkpatrickhtmmany local lawenforcement agencies are still using 10finger print cards some local law enforcement agencies have been able to use grant funding from nchip and other sources to help purchase livescan equi pment and improve data integration to decrease transmission time between local state and federal law enforcement agencies the background check process every step in background check process varies by state and the reason for the check therefore this section is intended to describe generic process that an applicant might complete in typical background check process but this overview will not apply to all situations this example assumes that an applicant is required to submit two 10finger print cards for identification purposes in state and fbi criminal history database systems for visual flowchart of this example see figure 1 at the end of this paper the first step in the background check pr ocess is usually for person to go to local law enforcement agency to be fingerprinted on two separate print cards some states require fee for this service wh ile others may not assuming the person is fingerprinted correctly the fingerprint cards are then forwarded to the states central law enforcement agency either directly or via local and state social service agencies once the fingerprint cards arrive at the states criminal history repository the state usually enters the persons name social security number and fingerprint card data into an identification system and searches for any criminal history records in the system after the state examines its own criminal history files the state sends the fingerprints to the fbi if it wants the fb i to look for criminal history records located in other state and federal data bases some states mail one of the print cards to the fbi while other states first convert the 10 finger print card into electronic format and digitally transmit it to the fbi back ground check requests electronically submitted to the fbi take on average about two hour s to process whereas requests submitted with 10finger print cards require an add itional five to 10 busin ess days to process14 since the fingerprints are submitted to the fbi using 10finger print card in this example the fbi forwards the fing erprint card upon its arrival to contractor who scans the card and enters the data into electronic format once electronically entered into the database the fbi uses both fingerprint and personal search data information such as the persons name date of birth and social security number to locate any matches in the system if the fbi receives record match in its central identification database it takes the necessary steps to locate the criminal history records through the iii network these records are some times housed directly in fbi databases and are sometimes located in individual state databases if requested record is located in state
