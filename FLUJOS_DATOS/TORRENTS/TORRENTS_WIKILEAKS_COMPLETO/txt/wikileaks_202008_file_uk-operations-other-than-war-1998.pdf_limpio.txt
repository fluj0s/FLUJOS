actions that fall short of general or regional war the term ootw seemed to lose significance as catchall term because of its lack of clear focus and definition and bmd uses the phrase other uses for armed forces nevertheless ootw continues to have currency within the army as whole and in this publication the term is used to cover counter insurgency coin peace support operations pso peacekeeping maca neo and other associated activities these military activities fall well short of general and regional war but are activities in which the application of military experience and often military force may well be necessary on occasions in order to maintain stability or to prevent bloodshed aim 2 the aim of this handbook is to provide guidance for commanders of major units and below of the tactics and techniques which may be appropriate in the conduct of ootw these operations could include pso coin maca neo observer missions and other related military activity to assist the reader the handbook is divided into 4 main sections section the nature of operations other than war b section b techniques to promote cooperation and consent c section c force protection measures d section d operations to gain the tactical initiative use of the handbook 3 normally the preparation of any military plan in an ootw setting will involve some or all of the techniques described in the four sections listed in 2 above and there are techniques that are common to all operations of whatever type the selection and application of those techniques which may be appropriate and how robustly they are applied has to rest with commanders on the ground they have to make suitable judgements based upon their task and how it is developing within the environment in which they are operating for example in hostile environment more robust force protection measures may be required and the emphasis may need to be given ini tially to those techniques designed to gain the initiative as prelude to switching to consentpromoting techniques such switches in priority or emphasis can be dem onstrated at the tactical level by the posture of the force the manner in which weap ons are carried and the amount of personal protective equipment that is worn the selection of techniques how effectively they are applied and the profile of the military force in general and individuals within it will all be potent political signals an under standing of these perceptions by all parties involved including the international comissue 10 dec 98 ivmunity as well as any civilian agencies involved could be fundamental to the tactical success of any military force 4 ootw can cover an extremely wide spectrum of different types of operation the conduct of an unarmed military observer acting on behalf of the will vary widely from that of soldier forming part of peace enforcement force in counter insur gency operation or to provide humanitarian relief for refugees there can be formal military guidance that precisely covers all circumstances it is helpful to pro vide some general tactical guidance for use at major unit level and below even to section commander which can be used selectively to suit situation rather than try to prescribe how every tactical activity should be conducted in addition each theatre of operations is bound to be different from others both in geography climate social conditions and acceptance or otherwise by the local community the chain of com mand the status of forces and the legal position is also likely to vary considerably 5 this handbook is designed to avoid citing tactical guidance for particular circum stances but to move section by section through operations that are permissive and have the tacit consent of the appropriate authorities and the local population to situ ations where operations have to be conducted against serious hostility or where law and order does not exist at all 6 in other military publications the enemy is the term generally used to define the mili tary opposition in ootw it is most likely that the term enemy cannot be used for many reasons some of which may have legal connotations in this handbook the term enemy is best described as the potential adversary singular or hostile groups plural to denote those who do not comply with the mandate for an operation and may oppose its implementation additions and replacements

operations coin 1 throughout its history of empire the british army has gained vast amount of expe rience in the control of internal conflict and internal security operations first dubbed imperial policing and later countering insurgency these operations took place in every type of terrain as troops engaged in all types of operations from jungle warfare to urban counter insurgency action the response to the confrontation with indone sia in borneo in the 1970s was based on lessons from the malayan campaign in the 1950s and soldiers in the radfan during the 1960s drew on the experience gained on the north west frontier in the 1930s and 1960s combating terrorism in northern ireland has drawn on experience gained earlier in jerusalem nicosia and aden city and the successes in oman during the 1970s were built upon wide range of experience gained in many previous counter insurgency campaigns 2 the overriding experience gained was that military forces alone could not provide an effective counter to an insurgency insurgency usually stemmed from political eco nomic and social grievances which could only be successfully countered by fully integrated and coordinated strategy which involved the local population it was quickly learned that military forces could play an invaluable role in redressing security cerns but as insurgents generally operated clandestinely within the civilian popula tion they should be dealt with in the first instance by police forces and military forces only called upon when the situation had moved beyond their control such opera tions in support of the police had always to conform to the principle of minimum force and led to the development of refined doctrine for operations which incidentally placed great reliance on junior leadership initiative and flexibility respect for the law civilmilitary cooperation leadership and tactical initiative and flexibility are recognised main principles which underpin the conduct of british forces in any ootw situation 3 during the last 30 years military operations were essentially focused on the orderly transfer of power back to the local population and the creation of self sustaining means of government countering insurgency generally involved the creation of secure setting in which civilian agencies could build an environment and infrastructure and allow the orderly withdrawal of british rule since those days it has become discern ible that this process has much in common with peace support operationsissue 10 dec 98 2 1serial a2 the development of doctrine for peace support operations pso peacekeeping and evolution of pso 1 during the cold war peacekeeping evolved as pragmatic means by which the united nations could manage the aftermath of inter state conflicts without them escalating and drawing in other international parties with the ending of the cold war in 1989 the strategic environment changed 2 inter state conflicts became less common than intra state conflicts as some nations and their governments lost their superpower support and collapsed although the legal right to intervene into such situations is limited such as when there is threat to international peace and security or genocide there has been an increasing willing ness within the to respond to such challenges not surprisingly experiences in these new and difficult situations quickly demonstrated that traditional peacekeeping practices were not adequate as consequence new doctrinal thinking has been developed for these grey areas which has now been promulgated into an interna tionally agreed doctrine called peace support operations pso and its linkages to counter insurgency operations 3 much like the main principles for counter insurgency operations but with greater emphasis on impartiality doctrine for pso also defines situation in which military activities are in support of political objectives and designed to create the conditions in which civilian agencies and the local populations can address the underlying causes of the conflict and collectively create stability 4 while the principles and practice of counter insurgency operations as they devel oped were multifunctional and designed for the management of change and transi tion within the empire and the colonies the requisite civilian functions were all pro vided by national and colonial resources in the conduct of pso however those functions are normally provided by other nations and other international bodies and plethora of nongovernment organisations these bodies and organisations may be working to different political authorities and have their own agendas which may conflict with the overall military aim and thus create enormous challenges for coordination 5 however the basic concept and principles of pso are based very much on experi ence gained in counter insurgency operations and the military features of minimum force local cooperation and keeping the peace have many common links like wise pso practice is based on combination of techniques designed to induce and coerce with view to expanding and consolidating areas of consent and coopera tion in areas of outright opposition or noncomplianceissue 10 dec 98 3 1serial a3 other military operations general 1 since the end of the cold war in 1989 pso has replaced coin operations as the main ootw activity however there have always been other ootw activities some of which do not require doctrinal guidance because they are in response to govern ment request for specific operations in support of either the government or other civil authorities this is particularly so for military operations in the uk non combatant evacuation operations neo 2 neo are conducted for the purpose of evacuating civilian noncombatants from loca tions in foreign country when they are faced with the threat of hostile or potentially hostile actions neos will normally be conducted to evacuate british nationals whose lives are in danger but may also include the evacuation of british military personnel and other nations for whom hm representative in the country has accepted respon sibility normally these will include unrepresented commonwealth and irish citizens and certain nations of european union eu countries these evacuees are known as entitled persons eps or entitled nationals 3 the responsibility for the protection and if necessary evacuation of british nationals in the first instance rests with hm representative initially he would resort to civil contingency plan ccp for his area and if appropriate effect an evacuation using normal commercial transport in benign environment neo might be effected us ing military air transport at direct from the country concerned without employing protection force when the situation in the country has deteriorated neos would require the deployment of british military forces to provide protection in order to facili tate the evacuation 4 neo is by definition raid it involves incursion into and temporary occupation of territory and ends with planned withdrawal 5 it differs from other operations in that it may be conducted in deteriorating internal security situation proceeding with neo confers tacit recognition of the worsening situation which may have political implications b the military option may be the last resort and the decision to deploy could be delayed until the last possible moment c command and control at the evacuation site may be complex hm representa tive may be unwilling to give the military free rein the military command element and the diplomatic staff have to be collocated at the earliest opportu nityissue 10 dec 98 3 2d roe will undoubtedly be constrained the commander could therefore be pre pared to defend the evacuation against dissident forces without having the au thority to preempt hostile actions with preventative military action the political sensitivity of the operation will almost certainly ensure that it will be monitored if not controlled at the highest appropriate level 6 the contingencies with which neos are designed to cope require the employment of broad principles at the higher levels and detailed planning at lower levels plans have to be flexible and easily adaptable since each neo will take place against unique set of circumstances the criteria used for planning should be based upon worst case nonpermissive environment 7 the degree of hostilities and potential for the harm of both evacuees and those forces undertaking the neo will determine the permissiveness of the operation there are 3 levels of permissiveness defined as follows apermissive there will be resistance to the operation and therefore few if any ground troops are required to be deployed ashore the military force can expect host nation compliance and support the primary mission will focus on logistic functions eg transport emergency medical support administrative sup port and command and control bsemipermissive the host government does not have total effective control of the area of operations military force will be required to protect the operation cnonpermissive the operation will have to be conducted against background of at best civil disorder at worst full scale conflict the military force may be required to establish point of entry set up defensive perimeter escort voys participate in combat search and rescue operations csar and carry out the screening of evacuees normally undertaken by diplomatic staff 8 furthermore detailed contingency planning for neo activity is controlled directly by mod and pjhq military aid to the civil authorities maca 9 background the services and in particular the army have traditionally been in volved in the provision of aid to the civil authorities in the united kingdom or any of the dependent territories the term civil authorities covers local authorities such as magistrates and police forces district and county councils and central govern ment departments of state 10military aid to the civil community macc military aid to the civil community is the provision of triservice personnel and equipment both in emergencies such as natural disasters and in routine situations to assist the community at large aspects of macc have also been useful tool in certain categories of operations such as in bosnia under the auspices of the overseas development agency examples ofissue 10 dec 98 3 3this role are the use of eod bomb disposal units and assisting the community during civil emergency such as flooding full details of macc within uk are given in jsp 373 11military aid to the civil ministries macm this encompasses the use of military forces for nonmilitary government tasks including assistance to maintain public ser vices and the essentials of life in community or to undertake urgent work of national importance recent examples include firefighting and providing emergency ambu lance and prison support services details about macm and potted history of the development of macm tasks generally are given in jsp 407 in modern times it should be noted that the armed forces are not in position to provide the appropri ate support for some of the more sophisticated public services and industries most of the public services are now in private hands which would inevitably change the na ture of how the government would deal with such forms of support for essential in dustries contingency planning for such support and assistance will however still be necessary 12military aid to the civil power macp the army may also be called upon to help maintain public order and security when the police are unable to control the situation in the united kingdom and its remaining dependencies the principle of the supremacy of the civil authorities normally precludes the introduction of any form of martial law to deal with civil strife the military force always remains subordinate to the civil author ity it may be necessary to introduce special legislation or declare state of emer gency in order to invest the security forces with the necessary powers the rescue of the diplomatic staff at the iranian embassy in knightsbridge by the special air ser vice in 1980 is an example of temporary small scale and selective use of military aid to the civil power macp on the mainland of great britain the employment of the army since 1969 in support of the royal ulster constabulary in northern ireland is an example of wider more sustained but careful controlled application of macp there are various contingency plans controlled by the director of military operations dmo which govern the precise conditions and circumstances in which the army will be employed on macp duties activities of this nature in support of foreign gov ernments would require separate diplomatic and legal instruments to be agreed be fore military activity could begin most of this type of activity is now conducted under auspices and subject to international law military support for the mounting of operations 13 this sort of operation covers the contingency planning necessary to mount variety of operations at home and overseas these include aselective mobilisation the selective mobilisation of individuals and small units for duties and tasks normally abroad the use of ta volunteers for duties in bosnia and the falkland islands are examples of this bdeployment of forces contingency planning for the deployment of national and allied forces from the uk to overseas theatres of operationissue 10 dec 98 3 4cjoint theatre plans contingency planning for the mounting of specified joint theatre plans and joint logistic plans to support operations world wide these could include allied or coalition deployment plans dcasualty reportingreception plans these would include contingencies for the reporting of casualties the reception of casualties entering the uk and the evacuation of noncombatants from threatened area 14 the joint planning staff jps at pjhq are generally responsible for the planning and integration of all these forms of military operations although any form of mobilisation would be controlled from the moda 4 1 issue 10 dec 98serial a4 aspects of the law the legal background 1 the military principles operational practices and tactical procedures covered in this handbook could apply to any ootw situation however the legal framework in which these military operations could take place could differ significantly from place to place and commanders at all levels will have to be aware of the precise legal conditions that pertain for any military operations contemplated 2 troops must at all times rigorously observe the laws and regulations under which they are operating in general terms the best way to achieve this is to have compe tent military leaders well disciplined troops and clearly defined legal position soldier who acts outside his lawful powers may be the subject of criminal proceed ings and also in this instance because the aim of operations is to help to uphold the law those who are charged with doing this must be seen to operate within the law if in their zeal to combat lawlessness some troops resort to unlawful activity they would so defeat their own purpose as to lose the confidence and respect of the community and thus make themselves better in the eyes of the law than those whom they oppose 3 to act lawfully in all situations can require courage integrity tenacity restraint and above all common sense if soldier of whatever rank acts within the law and in good faith and if the force which he uses is necessary to achieve his immediate legitimate aim and is reasonable in the circumstances he need not fear the result of any inquiry into his conduct 4 in all serials of this handbook military practices procedures and techniques are ex plained but it has to be clearly understood that some of all of these may not be gally available for use in every particular situation this depends entirely on the legal status of the troops involved and the overall rules and constraints under which they are operating legal expressions 5general there is attempt to define all the better known legal expressions that may be encountered during an ootw campaign there are however legal expressions that are fundamental to any military understanding of the legal circumstances in which troops are deployed 6jurisdiction this term determines who has the legal power to try an individual in any particular circumstances where soldiers are employed abroad this fundamental questions should be resolved by status of forces agreement sofa or memoran dum of understanding mou between governments or possibly by an exchange of letters between governments in the unlikely situation where there is an absence of any of agreement of this type commander should take prompt steps to obtain legal advice from als before operational activity beginsa 4 2 issue 10 dec 987legal basis for operations the legal basis for the deployment of troops on operation while covered in the charter itself is for practical purposes based on the political mandate for the operation these mandates generally lack the military or legal precision that commanders require in order to translate into operational orders and rules of engagement they may also change during the conduct of an operation changes could involve an escalation from mandate under chapter vi of the charter to one under chapter vii of the charter it may also affect the application of the law of armed conflict furthermore problems may arise between different national contingents with the definition of terms these legal ambiguities and widely differing interpretations will need resolution before coherent and consistent ap proach to operations can be developed the status of military personnel is ideally covered by sofa or mou or where that can not be negotiated by the 1946 convention on the privileges and immunities of the and the 1994 convention on the safety of and associated personnel 8aide memoirescoloured cards all troops involved in the area of operations should be issued with an aide memoire or coloured card to be carried at all times on duty this card would give clear instruction on the use of personal weapons the use of force 9background decisions regarding the use of force will be among the most difficult that commanders at all levels will have to take tactical difficulties will be compounded by the presence of international media and their ability to broadcast to national capitals in such circumstances tactical actions could well have an immediate impact around the world 10general military forces should not confuse the wider use of force with the inherent right of self defence the wider use of force in the achievement of mission will be governed by the loac roe and military orders in terms of the prevention of crime or in the arrest of criminals the amount of force which may be used is such force as is reasonable in the circumstances the law regarding self defence is essentially the same the practical difficulty is to gauge exactly what amount of force may be reasonable at given time 11guidelines to help overcome these practical difficulties jwp 350 peace support operations offers series of other techniques which may be appropriate to achieve mission when the wider use of force could be either contrary to roe unreasonable or inappropriate depending on circumstances it also offers guidelines for the applica tion of force when it is necessary this is covered in the term minimum necessary force which is defined as the measured and proportionate application of violence or coercion sufficient only to achieve specific objective and confined in effect to the legitimate target intended the minimum necessary use of force does not exclude the overwhelming use of force if the existence of mission was being challenged and the use of overwhelming force was within roe illustrative examples 12 it is most important that the exercise of minimum necessary force by soldier shoulda 4 3 issue 10 dec 98always be reasonable and within the current rules of engagement roe this can best be illustrated by the following examples although these are not necessarily typical of every situation they should provide some guidance but should not be used as templates for every situation aexample too much force in peacekeeping operation soldier with loaded weapon is guarding vehicle in humanitarian convoy against looting with direction only to use his weapon in selfdefence the convoy is held up and youth manages to steal some small item from the vehicle behind the soldiers back and runs away the soldier has right in law to arrest that youth for stealing but the youth being particularly fleet of foot the soldier realizes that the only way he can stop him is to open fire now it could be said that in this situation the minimum necessary force to achieve the lawful aim namely arrest would indeed be to open fire but one would say that the use of lethal force in such circumstances would be reasonable in this situation the soldier must exercise his qualities of common sense and restraint at this stage all he can do is to report the matter to his superiors and pass on description of the youth to open fire in these circumstances would be unreasonable and could constitute serious criminal offence bexample b too much force four man reconnaissance patrol armed with riot guns and rifles and operating in an urban area as part of larger composite patrol is tasked to gather intelligence in certain district during this operation the reconnaissance patrol is trapped in culdesac by gang of hooligans who engage it riotously with stones and other missiles and cause minor injuries to two of its members whilst sealing it from the immediate support of other nearby elements of the composite patrol the reconnaissance patrol commander has right in law to use force in the selfprotection of his patrol and since its members could ultimately risk serious if not fatal injury in this situation it could be argued that he would be justified in ordering rifle fire immediately to ensure the extrica tion of his patrol without further casualties however one would say that an immediate resort to the use of lethal force against stone throwers would be reasonable in such circumstances soldiers should exercise their common sense bearing in mind the principle of minimum necessary force and in this particular instance the patrol commanders first resort should be to the use of riot guns to have opened fire immediately with rifles would have been unreason able and would constitute serious criminal offence cexample c too little force in an operation designed to enforce peace agreement certain military elements of one of the signatories to the peace agreement are refusing to return to barracks as previously agreed one company of these troops is stationed in small village which has previously been abandoned by all civilians after period of negotiation the local military force commander has given these troops deadline to withdraw which he has made clear will be enforced by indirect and direct fire if withdrawal takes place as covered in the operational mandate his mission statement and roe this is the first significant incidence of non compliance and not surprisingly has attracted wide media coverage at the appointed time withdrawal has occurred and thea 4 4 issue 10 dec 98pso force commander decides that he cannot open fire in front of the media even though in terms of his mission and the law it would be legally reasonable to do so in this incidence this is almost certainly the wrong decision and the loss of face when challenged at the first instance could well undermine the credibility of the overall military operation and the achievement of mission 13 even with orders and instructions the proper use of force in accordance with the law will depend on common sense and in any event soldiers right to selfdefence is never sacrificed the soldier who acts without common sense may not only seriously jeopardize his own position but may also bring his colleagues and the military authorities as whole into disrepute and thus give valuable material for use as hostile propaganda 14 the use of force to protect guard or deny access to material possibly owned by host nation will need careful attention with regard to both the law and the appropriate roe an unficyp proposal to use lethal force to deny access to large arms cache is good example legal guidance for commanders 15senior commanders the six preceding sections are sufficient to show that it would be prudent for legal advice to be available to commander and staff officers on full time basis once pso operations are set in hand the law differs from state to state the law changes to reflect developments in society and the implications of interna tional treaty obligations human rights law and conventions on the use of some weapons all indicate that clear understanding of the current legal position and recent legal developments is necessary provided commander is aware of the legal background and basis for any planned military operations is aware of the contents of the sofa clear roe for those under his command and has rapid access to legal advice the complexities of the law in regard to pso can be tackled effectively and integrated into the overall pattern of military operations 16junior commanders when an operation is planned it is important to consider any problems which may arise over the degree of force seeking advice from the appropri ate authorities so that suitable instructions can be considered and then prepared in the course of campaign local case law will be built up and commander will have useful precedents for guidance however particularly in the early stages it will be especially important to appreciate the legal implications where it is intended to use heavy weapons aviationair support mines or booby traps or to use such tactics as ambushes or prophylactic fire it may be appropriate to issue specific orders or instructions to every soldier to assist him in exercising proper judgement according to law to tell him when on his own initiative he may or may not make an arrest and when he may or may not open fire any such instructions should be in form which can be readily understood brief enough to aid memory but long enough to achieve claritya 5 1 issue 10 dec 98serial a5 operational contingency planning general 1 in some ootw operations the public at large may have low casualty acceptance threshold media coverage of casualties could undermine support for certain opera tions which may create political pressure to place premium on force protection ac tivities force protection and other defensive measures may also need to be ex tended to cover not just service personnel and their property and equipment but also other organisations and agencies in the area 2 defensive operations and force protection can be expensive in manpower and it may be necessary to strike balance between the needs of operations and the ne cessity for protection protective measures are also often irksome and it may be difficult to maintain high standards of vigilance after prolonged incident free periods however in hostile environment any potential adversary will be alert to the oppor tunities presented by any laxity 3 any defensive operations and protective measures which affect the civil population have to be conducted within the law and restriction can be placed on the move ments of civilians nor can searches be made unless there is legal power or authority to do so if force has to be used for any lawful purpose it must always be the mini mum necessary force 4 when planning defensive measures consideration should be given to the poten tially damaging image which will result should military forces adopt significantly more defensive profile than any civilian agencies in the area commanders and their staff should be prepared for the inevitable accusations of adopting sand bag men tality by the more gung ho civilian agencies 5 this serial of the handbook gives tactical guidance when planning defensive opera tions particularly in nonpermissive or hostile environment deploying the contingent 6 once government has decided to deploy contingent to the theatre of operations national reconnaissance party would move to the area to discuss the operational role and tasks for the contingent with the force commander at the same time the legal status of national troops in the theatre of operations would be established and suitable roe prepared which have the agreement of the national government op erational tasks and the control of any designated areas would be decided upon and agreed nationally before the contingent deployed at the same time consideration should be given to other military related tasks such as police liaison civil liaison and the use of other specialist staff 7 deployment of the contingent would then be organised nationally and if the situation allowed would be started with the arrival of advance parties and then main bodies of troops to start their operational tasksa 5 2 issue 10 dec 988 if the situation is hazardous unknown or there is general chaos in the theatre of operations then operational factors would override other issues and the securing of protected point of entry would become an essential first step before any subse quent operational activity could take place 9 during the period of mounting the deployment of troops theatre briefings and spe cific training should be arranged in preparation for forthcoming tasks medical ad ministration and the possibility of some form of acclimatisation may also be neces sary types of operation 10 the background circumstances surrounding the initial need for military contingent to conduct pso activities will indicate whether these tasks are to be peacekeeping pk or peace enforcement pe and in consequence the conduct of operations will differ dramatically decisions of this sort should have been established before any contingent deploys from the uk 11 in certain types of pso activity it may well be appropriate for the force to operate in high profile nontactical manner utilising or other flags and markings coupled with white painted vehicles and the wearing of light blue berets by troops there have been many examples of this type of more traditional peacekeeping activity 12 where pe or other coercive operations are considered the military force should ploy prepared to confront and overmatch any challenges that might be offered this may require tactical deployment of combined arms grouping and with troops in combat body armour and helmets 13 it is not generally feasible to move from peacekeeping to peace enforcement without causing serious disruption and possibly some real danger to the forces involved it is however quite feasible to move from peace enforcement activity across to peace keeping duties on more traditional lines should the situation demand operational planning and readiness 14planning each contingent commander in any deployed force will need to prepare plans to conduct operations in his own designated area of operations in accordance with the force commanders directives b take account of an improving situation deescalatory measures and wors ening situation escalatory measures c use any reserve forces that may be required in his area of operations d evacuate if required from part or all of his designated areaa 5 3 issue 10 dec 98e conform with the operational readiness requirements for his contingent 15readiness once in theatre it will be immediately necessary for commander to prepare certain contingency plans and ensure that troops are capable of operating the readiness requirements of the force commander states of readiness 16general points force headquarters will normally specify states of readiness cover ing key personnel the force reserve the manning of temporary ops increased pa trolling the reinforcement of checkpoints the manning of positions and the issue of ammunition each increase in the state of readiness will probably be complemented by restrictions on leave training and movement some contingents may have states of readiness to mount an evacuation plan in an emergency these plans may be localised to cover the withdrawal of troops from one place to another within

vigilance b increased vigilance c full alert 17alterations in readiness changes in states of readiness are normally implemented only on the force commanders authority in an emergency sector commander may order higher state informing force headquarters immediately changes are nor mally notified by radio using codeword denoting the state followed by the time it is to become effective the radio message should be followed by formal signal force reserves 18aim and organization force reserve is usually composed of elements drawn from all the national contingents providing units for the force in crisis the aim would be to demonstrate multinational solidarity reflecting the collective resolve of the united nations nato or some alternative international sponsor group which the transgressor

multinational organization or allied governments to evacuate pso force in the event of civil war or the host nation withdrawing its consent to the continuation of the mandate the force commander would be responsible to the secretary general or his equivalent in nonun force for the safe and speedy evacuation of the force its dependants accredited visitors any observer group in the area and affiliated bodies such as the united nations high commission for refugees unhcr and the food and agricultural organization fao 23 it will be the responsibility of the force headquarters staff contingent and sector commanders to keep plans uptodate for evacuation by road or aviation assets to the nearest neutral country or by sea and air out of the theatre 24 similarly the commander of british contingent force would have to consider the possibility that the contingent may have to be withdrawn unilaterally in formulating contingency plans for such an eventuality he and his staff need

consideration should be given to fashioning some form of vetting system for local workers who will than require monitoring once employed 8local protective arrangements degree of protection can be achieved by extensive use of aircraft for troops and logistic movement but while this may avoid interference in transit and it can enable css support areas to be situated in safe place some installations and some movement will inevitably be in the area of operations installations should therefore be suitably sited and effectively guarded using their own resources for local protection they should be inconspicuous and the movement of equipment and supplies must not be allowed to indicate the nature and area of active operations 9compromise when operations are undertaken by purely british force their aim scope and logistic needs should not be divulged to local officials care will be required to ensure military operations are not compromised by increased requests to supply certain goods medical 10resources widely spread operations inevitably strain medical resources and it may be difficult to provide skilled personnel to cover every eventuality these problems can be

combat service support css 13general during pso operations css is usually provided from secure areas or static installations logistic units tend to be more fragmented and dispersed to support the widely deployed subunits of the security forces despite these differences the principles and outline arrangements for css support are the same as in other military operations css staffs and units are responsible for arranging supply to the theatre and for moving material from the entry points to secure storage areas they organize distribution points for commodities in operational areas and allocate dependency to units based on the nearest or most appropriate source of supply stock levels in installations or firm bases must be maintained to provide for the changing dependency and predicted intensity of operations in the area this might involve the use of convoys air movement air dropping or support helicopters units remain responsible for the movement of material between the designated installations and unit locations this movement might involve the use of convoys helicopters trains or pack animals 14location of bases the pattern of operations and geographical considerations will dictate the location of operational bases which may often be in fortified buildings in very disturbed areas there may be compelling reasons for setting up administrativea 6 5

be struck between relative safety and ease of access to the rear on the one hand and the problems of forward distribution on the other 15local resources it will be economical to use local labour and purchase food and stores locally thus saving manpower and easing the transport problem particularly where long air or sea route to an overseas theatre is involved local labour poses security problems and contingency plans must make allowance both for its with drawal possibly under political pressures and for dispensing with it should the security situation warrant this 16local purchase normally handled by the local resources section under css arrangements 17use of aviation sh and air resources air dropping is more effective where air strips or landing points are not available but it is uneconomical in comparison with air landing since air dropping equipment and despatch crews are required and the recovery of parachute equipment may be difficult and time consuming there will therefore be an early requirement for forward air strips and helicopter landing sites if an operation is dependent on air supply it is important that forward operational bases should be sited to include existing airfields or sites where airfields can be developed close cooperation between css and air staffs is essential the use of aircraft for the provision of css purposes has the following advantages forces can operate in inaccessible areas without the need for vulnerable land lines of supply b troops can move with light scales of equipment unencumbered by logistic tail they are thus more mobile and flexible c there is greater flexibility and speed in the system of supply subject to the capacity of the airlift available although the logistic lift is likely to be less than when land transport is used d reserve holdings can be reduced bases can be increased in size but reduced in number they can be situated away from badly troubled areas f casualties can be evacuated quickly which improves chances of survival and raises morale g urgent needs of the civilian population in isolated areas can be met 18training css units can never be situated in completely safe areas in most operations and they must be alert to sabotage as well as overt attack although it may be attractive to employ large civil labour force the burden of defence falls ona 6 6

extremely diverse and includes thousands of very different organizations differentiated by size maturity expertise quality and sion which makes it difficult even hazardous to generalize about ngos most of the points made in this serial are made with particular reference to the few very large international ngos 10 us ngos and 20 european union ngos that handle an estimated 75 percent of ngo emergency aid however it should be noted that there are many smaller ngos who operate in todays humanitarian emergencies 2 troops are likely to encounter both large and small ngos but will probably have more dealings with the former in most emergencies ngos will be found managing wide variety of field operations including food distribution emergency health trans port and logistics family tracing for separated children agricultural rehabilitation and water and infrastructure repair programmes to manage these programmes they usu ally maintain offices and staff in the national capital and at regional and at field levels of the theatre of operations aims of ngos 3 most ngos have humanitarian aims that drive their work these might range from general remit to alleviate poverty to specific mission to support health care ser vices in communities affected by conflict or to support child welfare in specified country an ngos mission is usually underwritten by values or principles that guide their conduct such values might include working with the full participation of the community b assisting people irrespective of race and religion c paying special attention to the needs of women 4 many ngos express their mission and values in terms of human rights emphasizing that their work promotes rights to life food water health freedom of expression etc the mission and values of an ngo usually are embodied in some form of organiza tional charter that is recognized by state authorities in the ngos country of origin the and government authorities in countries where they work the categories of ngo 5 the ngo sector falls between the government sector and the commercial sector and is referred to as the third sector it is characterized by its great diversity com prising mass of different sized organizations with various management structures and diverse missions nevertheless within the sector as whole ngos can be characterized into the following groupsissue 10 dec 98 7 2ainternational ngos there are now over 4000 development ngos in oecd countries alone whose main mission is to work overseas the oecd refers to those ngos that work in more than three countries as ingos while most are not primarily emergency organizations many will mount emergency operations if the need arises in or beyond their normal programme areas organizations like save the children and médiçins sans frontières msf are examples of ingos with strong speciality in emergency programmes bmultinational ingos many ingos now have sister organizations in countries around the world and an international umbrella organization that represents them as whole multinational structure is increasingly important to ingos if they are to influence the institutions of the international community and raise funds from them in concerted fashion cnational ngos beyond the oecd countries there are an estimated 20000 other ngos that often work as the operational partners of ingos or interna tional development donors and agencies these national ngos also are known as local ngos as opposed to international ngos the majority of these organizations are not primarily emergency organizations but mount emergency operations if appropriate ngo programmes 6 the wide variety of humanitarian emergencies requires ngos to run programmes that reflect the needs and diversity of each situation the most common ngo opera tions will include famine early warning b food supply and distribution c emergency feeding d water and sanitation public health programmes immunization disease monitoring and control f curative health programmes clinics inpatient services etc g human rights monitoring and reporting h conflict early warning i conflict prevention j peace building and conflict resolution k family tracing and the reunification of separated childrenissue 10 dec 98 7 3l psychosocial care m the rehabilitation of agriculture seeds and tools n income generating cash grants and loans educational activities school books buildings and teacher training p the reconstruction of civil society and civic institutions means of operating 7 ngos usually operate in one of four main ways adirect implementation an ingo or local ngo recruits its own staff procures its own equipment and manages all aspects of programme itself bsubcontracting increasingly ingos are being used as subcontractors to the large bilateral donors or agencies that will give them funds and responsibil ity to carry out particular relief tasks notably large scale food transportation and distribution cworking through partners ingos or ngos channel their emergency funds and resources through third party organization that acts as their operational part ner these partner organizations might be local ngo or government ministry that is best placed to implement the programme dstaff secondment some ingos work in humanitarian emergencies by sec onding members of their staff as advisers and technicians to other operational organizations these might be local ngos at grassroots level ngo operational strengths and weaknesses 8general ngos have particular operational advantages in humanitarian emergen cies and military staff have to be aware of their operational characteristics and comparative advantages over government and military humanitarian operations but it is also important for the military staff to recognize the myths surrounding ngo effectiveness western governments and ngos themselves have an interest in over emphasizing ngo strengths the international news media need stories about hu manitarian emergencies in which individuals and organizations play the role of disputed rescuer and hero ngos particularly international ngos have filled this role and will continue to do so until it suits the medias purpose to cast them in an other part 9strengths the following characteristics summarize the main strengths of the larger andor more professional ngos in humanitarian emergencies which military staff should seek to maximize in their relations with the ngo sectorissue 10 dec 98 7 4aindependent and nonpartisan operational independence and perceived im partiality are extremely important to ngos and play major part in the rhetoric of their mission most ngos aim to respond to emergencies purely on the basis of the humanitarian imperative alone servicemen need to be aware of the importance of independence and impartiality to ngo operational posture on occasion the ngos needs to reassert these principles publicly may lead them to distance themselves from the pso and its operations these principles may even draw them into open confrontation with pso staff and policy on the other hand an ngos reputation for independence and impartiality sometimes may allow pso staff to extend relief supplies into areas normally inaccessible to them or other agencies bflexible and nonbureaucratic ngos frequently can move fast into and within any situation because organizational authority and power is devolved to field level the person in charge on the ground makes many of the key operational decisions cradical ngos see their role as being at the cutting edge of humanitarian op erations more than other aid organizations they are ready to take risks and to experiment both in terms of security and new ideas some ngos operate in situations considered too dangerous by other organizations or mount cross border operations behind the lines of civil conflicts dwellinformed and committed ngos with history of experience in country tend to have depth of contacts and high level of commitment to country and its various communities ngos with this type of profile are likely to be 1 national ngos indigenous to the conflict zone that are part of that soci ety 2 ingos whose history and experience in given country is highly devel oped with national staff and extensive longterm programmes einvolved in emergencies most ngos seek to involve the maximum participa tion of the communities they are assisting this requires the mobilization of community leaders and affected populations in the management of relief opera tions ngos also focus their efforts on rebuilding the capacity of existing com munity institutions clinics schools water supply systems etc rather than re placing them with international teams outright this communitybased approach is key part of ngo practice and is associated with notions of partnership and empowerment flongterm perspective ngos with long history of commitment to country and developmental way of working usually have valuable longer term per spective on any given crisis and its aftermath many of the larger ngos fre quently work to five year strategic plans incountry their ability to look forward beyond the immediate emergency phase can be an extremely useful resource to pso staff and should be respected and utilizedissue 10 dec 98 7 5greach with the above characteristics ngos can be in position to influence the parts of an emergency with which other organizations cannot engage this attribute is referred to as reach ngos often value humanitarian principles over international sovereignty this has enabled them to pioneer for example crossborder operations but in view of the range in size and quality of ngos this image can be an oversimplified over optimistic view of the sector as whole and should be treated with caution 10weaknesses the following characteristics summarise the weaknesses inherent in ngo organisations auneven quality some ngos are better than others the standard and quality of ngos working in any emergency is uneven some ngos will have many of the organizational strengths outlined above others very few being an ngo does not automatically make an organization good ngo the success of much ngo advocacy campaigning and fundraising depends on ngos pro jecting the strengths described earlier bselfimportance because of their high visibility in so many emergencies some ngos may develop sense of importance beyond their immediate impact in particular many of the smaller ngos can lose sight of the relative unimportance of their particular operations in wider canvas of events absorbed in the ur gency and priority of their own programs they may try to place unrealistic and dangerous demands on military resources climited perspective very few ngos operate across the whole field of hu manitarian emergency as result few have an overview of the whole emer gency instead most ngos manage programmes in particular geographical areas and in particular technical sectors whereas good ngo may know great deal of detail about conditions in their area they may know very little about conditions 20 or 100 miles away dcompetition within the community individual ngos are extremely competi tive each prides its performance and seeks to outshine its rivals in its opera tional results and media coverage ngos gain kudos and profile from working in the worst affected areas of an emergency in the most dangerous places and in particularly high profile fields like emergency feeding transportation water and health such competition can affect coordination particularly in the initial division of responsibilities in an emergency when ngos compete for particular geographical and sectoral roles efashion the ngo community is prone to fashion fashionable programmes may be valuable and often prove innovative but from time to time competing ngos feel they must be seen to be involved in fashionable programmes par ticularly when donors are eager to fund them in some emergencies particular types of programme can become fashionable and there can be rush to be come involved with them to the detriment of more commonplace and perhaps more fundamental needsissue 10 dec 98 7 6ngo code of conduct 11 in the last two years number of international ngos have teamed up with the ifrc to produce code of conduct for the ngo community in emergencies to date some 52 ngos have signed up to the code including many of the largest international ngos it is hoped that eventually all ngos will be able to agree to the codes prin ciples and abide by them this is an attempt to standardize ngo operating prin ciples and encourage the ngo community to follow agreed procedures for emer gency operations 12 it is also hoped that donor governments will insist that any ngo they fund will sign up to and abide by the code the code is useful guide for military commanders who should aim to respect it as basis for future cooperation the code clarifies what military staff and others can expect from the ngo community and will enhance trans parency and cooperation in line with agreed standardsissue 10 dec 98 8 1serial a8 mission specific training general 1 the aim of this serial is to provide checklist of mission specific training topics that should be conducted for all troops as part of any predeployment training mission specific training provides the soldier with the background and information necessary to perform his assigned tasks the majority of the mission specific topics can be completed by series of lectures and briefings however topics such as the use of force have to be

emphasis on coordination at all levels this will require additional manpower the nature of such operations is that they tend to be multinational military force will normally be both multinational and multi lingual they will also tend to be made up of contingents from nations outside the standing british alliances such as nato and thus do not always have agreed procedures for operating b joint operations will often be conducted by joint forces involving naval ground and air contingents of any of the nations involved c conducted in theatre where formal military structure of cooperation exists d conducted through framework of areas of responsibility aos in which units are allocated aos within bde ao liaison with friendly military forces 2 the requirement for liaison with friendly forces will be considerable it will normally take one of the following forms across boundary liaison where units are conducting operations outside frame work of established aos liaison with friendly forces will continue to be of the type conducted in general war setting however most units involved in ducting operations will normally be allocated an ao as such there will be need for considerable cross boundary liaison with neighbouring units this liai will aim to 1 transparency of intentions and conduct 2 ensure deconfliction of patrols and other operations 3 encourage cross boundary support and medical assistance particularly where remote site in one area is adjacent to friendly location across the unit boundary in such cases movement of casevac will often be more effective via the bordering unit 4 assist commonality of force posture and military activity military force has to have the ability to be effective and consistent in all areas of opera tions 5 ensure that cross boundary operations such as escorts or convoys can be conducted effectivelyissue 10 dec 98 b 1 2bliaison across the chain of command the multinational and multilingual na ture of military force will often give chain of command liaison greater signifi cance than in general war setting this is particularly so if military contin gent is not familiar with generic operating procedures used by the lead military force such as nato chain of command liaison will also assist with the two well known liaison difficulties 1language barriers in the case where contingent speaks language not used by superior hq then the benefit to commander who can brief or be briefed by an in person who then relays orders to the unit in its own language will be considerable 2passage of information communication over the long distances will be challenge radio and satellite communications will often be unworkable and long distance travel over poor routes will take time an will often therefore be required at superior hq to brief assist with planning or just to relay likely future intentions cliaison with the civil authorities it is also essential where appropriate to ef fect good liaison with the civil authorities such as the local police coastguards air traffic controllers and any fire services and hospitals in the theatre of opera tions liaison with international organisations 3 military forces will rarely operate alone within theatre of operations they will usu ally find themselves working alongside numerous international organisations many of whom will have been working there for longer period and all will normally be working to their own independent agenda in addition military force will often work in conjunction with organisations established for example to monitor the police which may not be part of the same chain of command but working under the same mandate rather than work in isolation the military force will normally benefit considerably from coordinating its activities with those organisations involved and will often be come the lead for all such coordination military force will also have to identify any commitment it has under its mandate for the security of any international organisations liaison with international organisations such as the unhcr icrc who civpol etc will generally allow military commander to advise on asecurity military commander will often be responsible for the security situa tion the provision of secure environment and any threat of evacuation if the security situation breaks down this may require daily briefings on security given to international organisations and other contingency plans for evacuation or break down in security it will be necessary to establish whether responsi bility for personnel from international organisations falls to the military force and where necessary to advise on mine threats areas of conflict ceasefires and other related activityissue 10 dec 98 b 1 3bshared initiatives operations will often involve contributions from international organisations for example an attempt to return refugees to their previous homes may well require the military force to ensure the situation is secure the unhcr to oversee the refugees an organisation to oversee the civil police and num ber of organisations to assist with the rebuild of the destroyed houses such operations will require shared aim with coordinated planning and negotia tions to ensure success liaison with warring factions 4 liaison with warring factions wfs1 host nations of other entities should normally be attempted by all levels of command within the military force depending on the military structure there may well be div bde unit g5 and unmos all will attempt to meet and provide liaison with key civil military and police com manders liaison plan has to be adopted to ensure deconfliction of responsibilities between different and to ensure the timely and accurate passage of information up the chain of command in particular responsibilities for liaison with specific wf commandslevels of command have to be established for example unit may provide liaison with wf bdes bde may have liaison with wf div hqs and the div liaison with wf corps hqs foot patrols if deployed can be used for liaison with the civilian population and any local warring factions once confidence has improved liaison between individual staff branches can be established 5 where such framework is not established then there is potential for different to have meetings with the same wf commander several times in short space of time it is probably not necessary in this case div wanting to verify information at lower level and in person should get the unit or whoever normally deals at that level to arrange the meeting accompany the div and introduce him to the wf commander thus retaining continuity probably liaison tasks with wfs are as fol lows anegotiations the need to negotiate will depend on the mandate the force struc ture and its level of dependency on host nation support or on wf goodwill bcease fire violations the basing of at wf hq will assist in the resolution of any cease fire violations not only will it allow rapid assessment of which party is the aggressor but it will assist the military commander in preventing an escalation of the violation or reprisals coordinated and timely negotiations can be conducted concurrently with opposing military commanders to bring about return to stability or ceasefire cprotestsbriefs the requirement for briefings to host nationswf of future op erations and the requirement to protest breaches of any ceasefire or peace agree ment will depend entirely on the nature of the mandate 1 in unficyp operations the term opfor is used to denote the warring factions in british military parlance this term can

available to the liaison parties have to be considered in delicate and urgent situations the may require guaranteed secure communications with which to relay sensitive information or seek immediate direc tion or advice on other occasions communications may be deliberately absent to allow suitable time delay if required while difficult situations are relayed to head quartersissue 10 dec 98 b 2 1serial b2 negotiation and mediation introduction 1 negotiations take place when two parties with opposing views meet to resolve their differences when third party assists by acting between the opposed parties in an effort to bring them together it is referred to as mediation in practice most mediation takes the form of negotiations between mediator and one of the parties at time trying to find common ground this serial describes the characteristics of these ac tivities and the techniques needed for success in negotiations of theatre level and mediation at lower levels 2 in the context of complex emergency negotiations will be conducted at many levels and between many parties and issues will range from strategic level discussions in the security council to tactical level negotiations between officials and mili tary commanders and local militia leaders negotiations may concern political hu manitarian and military activity the parties in complex emergency will want to discuss these questions with anyone representing the different elements of the inter national community it is essential for those working to resolve the conflict to under stand the scope of the negotiations that may be taking place and how their functions relate to wider efforts to achieve negotiated solution characteristics 3 in the intercommunal violence associated with complex emergency most negotia tions will be between members of the international community and one of the parties at time these meetings often will concern relations between elements of the inter national response group and one of the parties for example in the interpretation of their mandate and to gain access to recent incidents rather than mediation between the parties three broad types of negotiations may be taking place at every level of which only one is actually between the parties negotiations between elements of the international community on external or internal theatre related problems for example between troopcontributing na tions between the civilian and military elements of mission and at local level between ngo convoys and their military escort b negotiations between elements of the international community and one or more of the parties for example on the scope and nature of the international communitys intervention or assistance in the crisis or with host government concerning which military contingents are acceptable and at lower level be tween ngo officials and the local authorities on the implementation of programme c negotiations between the parties assisted by members of the international com munity these also take place at every level and are the most important type of negotiations for members of the international community to promote it is pos sible that the parties also will meet and negotiate without the assistance of out sidersissue 10 dec 98 b 2 2negotiating issues 4general points within each type of negotiation in the context of peace support operations there are three broad areas that may be the subject of negotiations though these tend to follow the division of responsibility adopted by elements of an international response group these divisions may not be recognized by the parties to the conflict apolitical issues in crisis that results from conflict between two or more par ties the immediate priority may be to provide humanitarian assistance or achieve ceasefire but the most important negotiations will be aimed at achieving an overall political agreement between the parties successful political negotia tions provide the framework and direction within which humanitarian and mili tary activities take place once agreement has been reached to take action the countries or organisations involved have to negotiate with the host government and other parties to agree to the terms of deployment and create viable situa tion on the ground for example by reaching political accord that could lead to ceasefire as international agencies military units humanitarian agencies or ngos arrive in the conflict area they will have to negotiate with the parties for access to their territory and for accommodation and support however it may prove difficult or impossible to reach formal agreement if government has broken down or in territory where the facto government is not recognized by the international community bhumanitarian issues representatives of humanitarian agencies may need to negotiate for access to assess humanitarian needs with host government or with local military or police units having made needs assessment the hu manitarian agency may need to agree with the host government or the local commanders on the assessment and methods of supply and distribution the humanitarian agency will negotiate with donors to provide the types and quan tities of relief that are required once the humanitarian agency has the supplies it may have to negotiate with the parties on casebycase basis for access to supply relief to the target population matter what agreement may have been reached beforehand actual distribution can take great deal of negotiation as convoys can be halted locally on the whim of local militia commander cmilitary issues although the decision to become involved may be political military commanders may have to negotiate the terms on which they will deploy in support of political or humanitarian agreements it is important for the military commander to ensure that he is not committed to an operation that is militarily untenable military representatives may be involved in negotiating ceasefires that can take three stages first getting the parties to reach an internal political agreement that they want ceasefire then achieving military agreement on how to conduct the ceasefire and finally negotiating workable implementa tion of the agreement on the ground having deployed military units will nego tiate with the parties for freedom of movement to monitor and enforce political or military agreements such as ceasefires or demilitarization agreements made at higher level may need to be renegotiated on casebycase activity or establish observation posts to cross confrontation lines in order to hold meetissue 10 dec 98 b 2 3ings or resupply units or to monitor troop deployments once separation of forces from confrontation line has been agreed following ceasefire or militarization of zone military units deployed to facilitate the delivery of hu manitarian assistance will have to negotiate on casebycase basis for free dom of movement to escort convoys this may lead to linkage negotiations on other humanitarian issues and political problems that may be used as bargain ing devices by local warlords 5negotiators commanding and negotiating are both critical functions which may not be compatible although commanders will want to be fully involved in all negotia tions that are central to the success of their mission there may be scope for estab lishing negotiating team to deal with routine matters and allow the commander to step in either to add weight when negotiations are in danger of failing or to finalize agreements however negotiators should have rank status and credibility for ex ample senior military officer should engage the commanders of the parties about ceasefire and doctor should discuss medical questions with local health authori ties 6negotiating teams because negotiating can be very timeconsuming and opera tional areas are spread out dedicated negotiating teams should cover specific ar eas negotiators who are divided between several different locations while dealing with different problems may be less successful negotiating teams may include sev eral people with different expertise but large delegations should be avoided and lead negotiator is best joined by other experts as necessary 7coordinated objectives political humanitarian and military negotiators from dif ferent organisations or elements of mission may talk to the same leaders of the parties if they are going to have any success in their negotiations individually or collectively they need to be coordinated this can be achieved by providing clear direction from the highest level on what objectives should be sought from negotia tions and where it is possible to compromise in addition there needs to be regular liaison between the agencies and individuals engaged in negotiations at each level so that they are aware of progress or problems the most efficient solution may be to create separate negotiating organisation that is responsible for generating negoti ating strategy following the directions of the commander and conducting the majority of negotiations at the spectral level negotiation standpoints 8 there are fixed principles for negotiation but there are several essential features of any negotiation that are useful guidelines for achieving results that can be further developed in the future these are aimpartiality if parties believe negotiator is longer impartial their trust co operation and openhearted relationship will be lost and negotiations probably will be unsuccessful blongterm view negotiators should recognize that it takes time to change from opposing positions to common ground and to establish culture of negotiationsissue 10 dec 98 b 2 4in which the parties become used to meeting and solving small problems to gether in preparation for handling crises and tackling larger problems short term negotiating success won by conceding an apparently small point may be damaging and set longterm precedent for example paying tolls to get emer gency aid through hostile checkpoint may solve an immediate crisis but also could set precedent that results in all convoys having to pay increasingly ex tortionate tolls in future negotiators should plan ahead to exploit the impact of seasonal changes for example seeds and fertilizer for spring planting and fuel in winter as source of incentives they also should anticipate future crises and be prepared to react when they occur but also remain aware that long ne gotiations may be overtaken by events cimagination imagination and lateral approaches are vital for the identification of common ground between the parties development of incentives and disin centives and finding ways to overcome the many barriers in conducting suc cessful negotiations dacting with determination the parties will have more at stake and may have fewer constraints on their actions than negotiators from the international com munity for example militia gunman at checkpoint may have rules of gagement unlike convoy commander faced with parties under emotional pressure the negotiator or representative must also be prepared to act with determination ecultural awareness negotiations are often conducted in unfamiliar languages between parties that follow idiosyncratic customs for greeting and meeting and hold values that are peculiar to their culture when negotiators themselves also have different cultural backgrounds the possibilities for misunderstanding are great it is above all the responsibility of the negotiators to understand the cul ture of the people they are talking to so that they better understand the mes sages that they receive tasks 9 negotiating objectives should be set at the highest level and implemented by every one involved although there may be clear directions about what can be negotiated with whom and by whom to the heads of the military civilian and humanitarian elements working for the it is important to note that many organisations will not be formally under control and could conduct their own negotiations independently the following negotiating tasks may be carried out at all levels amediation negotiators identify common ground on which the parties can dis cuss and agree bfacilitation negotiators provide practical assistance to their opposite numbers in the parties for example by passing messages providing hot line or secur ing venue for meetingissue 10 dec 98 b 2 5ccommunication because negotiations can be affected directly by outside events negotiators should stay in touch while negotiating and also pass on the results swiftly if related military activity occurs while the negotiations are in progress or an agreement on ceasefire is successful it has to be communi cated as rapidly as possible to all forces on the confrontation line deducation negotiators may have to teach parties how to negotiate and to make genuine concessions the parties may be unable to see that there are alterna tives open to them negotiators also will have to ensure that the parties under stand the meaning of agreements that they reach and the resulting obligations of the international community and the parties in implementing the agreements einformation policy development manipulation of information can have seri ous impact on negotiations this may be countered by actively seeking interna tional support for negotiations and by presenting the facts as seen by negotia tors to diplomatic contacts who will report to their capitals and the local and international media the local media may be influenced by the parties and need to hear the negotiators points of view the international media will influ ence both international decisionmakers and those elements of the local popu lation who have access to it fidentify incentives and disincentives mediation and negotiation should be sup ported by comprehensive range of incentives and disincentives to the parties so that they can be encouraged to take positive steps and dissuaded from tak ing action that will be detrimental to the peace effort these incentives and disincentives will vary according to circumstances identification of effective incentives and disincentives is vital in the preparatory stage of the negotiating strategy location 10 the venue for negotiations is usually dictated by the parties particularly if negotia tors have taken the initiative to go to the parties in facetoface negotiations the selection of venue may be very difficult with each party perceiving advantages and disadvantages in each proposal and refusing to agree the following locations are commonly used aun locations headquarters and locations have the advantages of being neutral territory thereby allowing the parties are to meet with some security and good communications however space is often at premium making protracted negotiations difficult the headquarters of the parties are where most bilateral negotiations between parties will take place with the negotiator visiting their opposite sides office b embassies where parties can meet for negotiations hosted by nation accept able to all concerned have the advantages of neutrality and providing status to the negotiations however security of the visiting delegations may be prob lem as can the availability of space at the embassyissue 10 dec 98 b 2 6c when the parties refuse to meet anywhere else crossing points in nomans land on confrontation lines or portacabin at checkpoint in nomans land can be useful 11 the following factors should be considered when selecting venue asecurity the venue should be physically secure with protection provided by the host authorities or the if it is on controlled territory baccessibility time should not be wasted getting to remote venues unless this promotes either secrecy or positive approach to the negotiations ccommunications as already mentioned communications are vital if neces sary the negotiating team should provide communications facilities that also can be used by the parties to liaise with their authorities dcomfort during protracted negotiations basic level of comfort may be useful to facilitate successful outcome there should be rooms for each delegation large and small meeting rooms facilities for providing food and drinks and over night accommodations if required operational techniques 12 military commanders will need to be aware of the complications created by certain features of negotiation and will need to address and scrutinise the following issues before and during the process of any negotiations that occur the identification of decision makers at the negotiations b the use and exploitation of the media during and after the negotiations c the security of decision makers d the use of two track negotiations communications and mobility f maintaining secrecy and confidentiality g the political recognition of parties to the negotiation h the use of joint commissions i the use of interpreters and translatorsissue 10 dec 98 b 3 1serial b3 the detailed conduct of negotiations preparing for negotiations and mediation 1 soldiers may find themselves in the role of negotiator mediator and even arbitrator at the point of confrontation on occasion relations between the two parties may be so strained that third party has to act as an intermediary mediator has to be firm fair and polite if he is to gain and keep the trust of both parties the qualities required of mediator are mastery of detail tact patience sense of proportion resourceful ness objectivity and impartiality on matters of principle the mediator has to be insistent without being belligerent he should be careful not to pass the confidences of one side on to the other some helpful points for commanders at all levels conduct ing mediation include the following become familiar with the problem 1 collect all available evidence 2 determine if the point of issue has been raised before 3 determine what agreements or understandings have bearing on the prob lem 4 be certain as to the military force policies on the problem b prepare for the negotiation 1 negotiations should involve sequential process starting from subordi nate to senior level this process allows political faux pas that arise from negotiations to be blamed on subordinates while the senior leader main tains credibility 2 select and prepare meeting place acceptable to both parties 3 obtain adequate interpreters and communications assets 4 secure the meeting area and delegates from attack 5 ensure that common map edition and scale is used by both sides and the military forces involved 6 keep higher headquarters informed c conduct negotiations note the following 1 customary salutations and exchanges of courtesies 2 introductions make sure all the delegates are introduced by nameissue 10 dec 98 b 3 23 use some introductory small talk to make the delegates feel at ease and to assess their mood 4 allow each side to state his case without interruption and without making any premature judgments or concessions make record of the issues presented by each side 5 if one side makes statement which is known to be incorrect be prepared to produce evidence or proof to establish the facts 6 if there is military force preferred solution present it and encourage both sides to accept it 7 be sure to close the meeting by explaining to both sides exactly what has been agreed upon and what action they are expected to take be pre pared to present this in writing for signature if necessary conducting the negotiations 2 the following are hints that those involved might find helpful divided into 4 stages aexploration before entering into dialogue consider the following 1 the dress state in particular helmet and body armour where possible avoid giving the appearance of apprehension 2 identify yourself and who you represent indicate if you are armed 3 your own security and that of your team identify signal to effect swift exit 4 identify the leader of the group and where possible isolate him from the remainder of the group 5 creature comforts protection from the elements bbidding when entering into dialogue the following could be important 1 what is your body language what message do you wish to pass on do you wish to be confrontational 2 be polite but direct 3 state what you seek to achieve your best case but be prepared to com promise cbargaining to achieve the best case consider the followingissue 10 dec 98 b 3 31 the aim is to gain the upper hand or if not then parity therefore be persistent and compromise in gradual and deliberate fashion 2 do not show frustration or lose your temper dstriking deal consider the following 1 make it quite clear what has been agreed and execute it as soon as pos sible 2 do not gloat over any success but prepare the ground for the next phase 3 explain the deal to your successors summary 3 negotiations are not always successful agreements of all parties may or may not occur the mediator should remember to remain neutral and avoid being used by either party he should expect some of the adversaries to negotiate in bad faith they may attempt to twist the issues to prolong negotiations while they continue to violate peace agreements 4 negotiations and mediation are time consuming and often frustrating however they prevent unnecessary loss of life and offer the best longterm prospects for final peaceful settlement it is vital to remain impartial and courteous at all timesissue 10 dec 98 b 4 1serial b4 information operations planning 1 there is as yet endorsed uk or nato definitions or tactical doctrine for informa tion operations although these are under development and experience is being gained in various ootw activities information operations are governed by the following principles impartiality b timeliness c cultural knowledge d harmonisation credibility f style 2 information operations when properly applied at all levels can be very potent weapon for commander to possess and formation commander will probably fo cus the direction and thrust of information operations under his own control how ever because the target audiences for any information operations planning will vary enormously from theatre to theatre it is more appropriate for units and sub units to be briefed on any intended activities intheatre when more detailed tactical planning can then take place targets for such information operations can include the warring parties the community at large international opinion and the mediaissue 10 dec 98 b 5 1serial b5 observers and monitors general 1 since the second world war the role of observing and monitoring areas where there is hostility and misunderstanding has been taken on largely by the although this is not exclusively so nevertheless wherever trouble has occurred around the world there has normally been request for the to send observers and monitors and there have been many such teams in various places over many years in more recent times the united kingdom has become actively involved in providing indi vidual officers and soldiers to act as monitors on behalf of the 2 observers and monitors are often deployed to areas of conflict before the main peace keeping forces and sometimes remain there well after any military forces have left to monitor cease fire or resolution to boundary dispute for example in 1992 military observers preceded unprofor into bosnia and croatia and military observers are still deployed to monitor the boundary dispute between iraq and ku wait in some cases observer missions are the only international contribution to peace keeping efforts and may be sponsored by the european community or any other legitimate international organisation observers and monitors are normally military officers but may also be civilians they would normally be working to an indepen dent headquarters and are likely to be outside the military chain of command deployment options 3 there are currently four levels of commitment that cover the requirement for ob server and monitor missions they may be viewed against an increasing level of threat alevel 1 traditional method the traditional unarmed observer mission which will continue to be the first and preferred deployment option blevel 2 security force in situation where the risks are greater but still of limited nature then the vulnerability of observers can be reduced by providing suitable protection force as part of the organisational structure this low profile deterrent can be provided by 1un security force unmandated military force such as an observer mission protection group ompg 2contracted force an international body which has credible military presence in theatre which protects personnel as one of its tasks clevel 3 composite observation monitoring force comf this force might deploy to situations where the risk is deemed to be too high for the levels above and yet insufficient to gain the political support to deploy full scale multidi mensional military force in this case it is possible that military unit may be deployed with the specific observation and monitory task as single entityissue 10 dec 98 b 5 2dlevel 4 multidimensional mission in the highest risk settings where there is an overriding political need to use unarmed observers the observers would only be deployed in tandem with military peacekeeping presence tasks 4 the diversity and complexity of tasks for an observer or monitor depend entirely upon the mandate of the particular mission the political and military situation and the ditions under which the civilian population have to exist observers and monitors are generally unarmed and rely to large extent on their impartial status for any protec tion and personal security the most common observer tasks are supervision monitoring verification and reporting of casefire agreements sepa rations and withdrawals of forces and cessation of outside assistance b monitoring of checkpoints border crossings and entryexit points c monitoring of the disarmamentdemobilisation regrouping and cantonment pro cesses of military forces d assisting in the location and confiscation of weapons caches maintaining liaison with and between the belligerent factions other civilian or agencies ngos and neighbouring countries f assistance to humanitarian agencies supervising and conducting pow ex changes food distribution points and distribution of medical supplies g assisting with and monitoring elections h monitoring and reporting violations of international law personal qualities 5 the military observer has to realize that he or she will be performing his duties in an environment foreign to that of his home nation usually encumbered by difficult living conditions in high stress situations and often in language not necessarily mother tongue as representatives of the and his home country the individual nomi nated as military observer should be carefully selected so as to be capable of per forming the tasks required and that his or her actions and overall presentation will reflect favourably upon the and home nation accordingly the officer selected needs to be physically fit of sound mental character mature in attitude and outlook and possess the appropriate career qualifications for the task 6 cultural shock is not an unusual phenomena in itself it is merely the natural response by an individual when he is taken from his own national and ethnic environment to that of another within which he feels some discomfort or disorientation the profes sional military officer will be able because of his or her background and training toissue 10 dec 98 b 5 3overcome the obstacles imposed by such relocation some observers will deal with the problem more effectively than others and those officers who have the benefit of previous tours will overcome the phenomenon more quickly than firsttimers ide ally comprehensive predeparture preparation and research will assist in lessening the impact upon the individual than would otherwise be the case 7 military observers have to understand the importance placed on face ie the per sonal perception of respect that is important in many cultures this is especially important in negotiations when for example ceasefire is being discussed if one or other of the combatants is seen to be losing ground in the negotiation and conse quently will lose face amongst his peers representatives of parties may be com pelled to say one thing whilst meaning another in an effort to avoid being seen as the weaker negotiator in such circumstances leading to contradictory positions becom ing apparent at later stage to the detriment of the negotiations individual guidance for observers and monitors 8 some military points that an observer should be aware of are to keep strictly neutral and display impartiality to all parties in the dispute b impress upon local commanders that he is to be granted freedom of movement appropriate to the mandate applicable to your area c ensure that local commanders are aware of the provisions and requirements to report any breaches of applicable agreements and ceasefires d be aware of efforts to undermine his authority and impartiality consider the likelihood that all radio communications will be monitored and phrase messages accordingly f be aware that local employees and interpreters may have vested interest in matters which require sensitive handling g be aware of the possible loyalty of the host population to previous governments 9 some military points that an observer should avoid are not to criticize the host nation or the parties involved in the dispute b carry marked maps or documents openly across ceasefire lines c express political or military opinions to nationals of either party to dispute d make unauthorized press or media statements ie be aware of alleged autho rized persons enquiring about the progress of particular matterissue 10 dec 98 b 5 4e take or allow photographs to be taken in areas which are subject to dispute unless specifically authorized to do so f allow local gossip or hearsay to influence decisions or reports to his superiors unless you can certify all the facts expressedissue 10 dec 98 b 6 1serial b6 assisting in elections general 1 possible task for military force involved in pso or maca is to assist in the elec tion of new government whether at the municipal or central government level the assistance may be given at number of levels but it is likely to focus on the support given to central coordinating authority such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe osce for whom the responsibility lies for ensuring that the elections are conducted under the agreed conditions tasks 2 summary of the likely tasks is as follows ainformation campaign the military contingent is likely to play central role in publicising the elections explaining eligibility to vote how where and when to vote this may be done by leaflet or by the use of local radio or both the key is for the troops involved to be seen to be acting in an impartial manner bmaintenance of stable environment clear task for military forces in sup porting elections is the maintenance of secure and stable environment this will be achieved in the first instance by patrols and by providing visible deter rence to any form of aggression however the particular threat has to be as sessed if there is possibility of voter intimidation then routes to polling sta tions should be identified and protected the voting stations themselves should also be protected along with those civilian workers involved in the manage ment of the election ccommunications and g4 support it is possible that the central coordinating agency for the elections will require means of communicating to be estab lished along with the operators to pass information to central control there may also be requirement for g4 support such as transport both for civilian coordinators voting slips and ballot boxes as well as rations and water dmaintenance of reserves formed groups of soldiers should be ready to act as reserves at short notice they have to be mobile in sufficient strength and equipped to respond to the perceived level of threat which could include inter nal security tasks subsequent procedures 3 more difficult to judge may be the consequences of the election results and the sub sequent implementation of those results particularly if these are likely to be contro versial military forces should be prepared for public disorder in the aftermath of the announcement of the results these could be anti government rioting or interfactional activity which could degenerate into looting chaos and anarchy special contingency planning may be necessary to support and protect isolated groups of troops during any disturbances of this kindissue 10 dec 98 b 7 1serial b7 humanitarian operations 1 more recent feature of ootw and the use of troops in pso capacity focusses on humanitarian operations designed to ease the impact of conflict on civilians the role of military force in these operations will depend on its mandate but the follow ing points can be used as guidance any humanitarian assistance matter how small or apparently insignificant has to be coordinated and the policy and approach to these operations dis seminated to all ranks uncoordinated assistance can result in claims of lack of impartiality by opposing forces and lead to false expectations by those suffer ing some humanitarian organisations including the international commission of the red cross icrc will actively avoid contact with the military in order to reinforce their status as impartial operators b all soldiers participating in humanitarian operations have to be conversant with aspects of the law of armed conflict1 and in particular the rights of women and children civilians and other noncombatants c there will probably be number of disparate organisations operating in the theatre of operations the precise relationship of such organisations with mili tary forces has to be properly established many such as unhcr will have their own logistic support and means of gaining information other nongovern mental organisations ngos will have little if any support and the level of support offered to such organisations has to be made clear from the start sup port will vary from providing threat information such as minefield traces through to providing food and accommodation and ultimately safe areas and protec tion d some members of certain humanitarian organisations may be accorded spe cial status as persons of designated special status pdss specific roe and other instructions will be established in order to afford them protection and close liaison has to be established in order to be aware of their location and operations if the threat justifies it evacuation plans should be rehearsed all troops have to be familiar with the roe and in particular how they relate to the protection of aid convoys and civilian workers 2 humanitarian operations will vary considerably from place to place even within the atre and there can easily be misunderstanding about the overall purpose of these operations and the role of military forces within that purpose many agencies are usually involved and the military commander will need to expend time and make use of manpower to put in place an effective liaison and coordination organisation to cater for these additional groupings experience shows that time spent in liaison is well spent 1 ac 71130 the soldiers guide to the law of armed conflict revised and reissued in 1998b 8 1 issue 10 dec 98serial b8 separating hostile forces means of separation 1 some explanation of the types of zones and lines that have been used in the past in peacekeeping operations is necessary as preliminary to providing guidance on their use and value in separating opposing forces 2lines these normally split into one of three categories aceasefire line cfl the lines mark the forward limit of the positions occu pied by the troops of the opposing sides at the suspension of hostilities of necessity ad hoc they are often contentious and the subject of complaint when ever one side is left in possession of an important tactical or political feature moreover the former combatants may not only dispute each others cfls they may not even accept the peacekeeping forces interpretation of the ceasefire agreement as to where their own cfl runs1 while cfls are eventually pub lished openly for example in the secretarygenerals periodic report on peacekeeping force each side maintains the principle of confidentiality on the detailed deployment of its forces behind them or outside an area of limitation in armaments it is essential for any peacekeeping force to have detailed knowl edge of all the lines claimed by any warring faction for peacekeeping force to disclose one partys dispositions to the other would be considered gross breach of confidence barmistice demarcation line adl the agreement of ceasefire lines may pave the way for the establishment of buffer zone and the withdrawal of an invad ing force at some stage the parties may agree to an armistice demarcation line perhaps leading eventually to formal peace treaty2 clines demarcating buffer zone bz or area of separation aos there is not always agreement on the location of the lines on either side of bz or aos this may be because the parties to the dispute do not use the same map grid or because one side refuses to give up position near the line which it considers essential to its security3 bz or aos is normally only demilitarized zone dz from which the armed forces of both sides are excluded however the zone is the sovereign territory of at least one of the parties whose rights of ad ministration must be recognized that party may still police the area4 1 in cyprus there are areas of local disagreement between hq unficyp and both warring factions as to the position of their cfls although the ceasefire came into effect in 1974 2 such lines were drawn up between israel and her arab neighbours in 1949 at the close of the first arab israeli war 3 for ease of reference the lines demarcating bz or aos are often lettered one the golan heights the western boundary of undofs aos with israel is known as line and on the eastern syrian side as line b 4 syrian police armed with the ak47 rifle patrol the

marking and clear instructions will be necessary to avoid disputes on the ground and disputes in the diplomatic and political arena interposition stages in deployment 3preparatory work during the preparatory phase while peacekeeping force is being mounted the force and contingent commanders and their staffs must master the details of the mandate any relevant understandings and the status of forces agree ment as soon as the latter is signed ideally the force will be deployed with the agreement of both parties but should one of the parties dissent it must be prepared to deploy on one side

agreement on the ground and demarcation are covered in paragraphs 10 to 14 below the next steps will be an agreement on the bz the separation of the hostile forces and an undertaking to withdraw from the bz control of forces 5 when peacekeeping force moves into bz it is assumed that the governments engaged in hostilities have control over their forces and that the orders of the com manders in the field to their troops to cease fire and carry out agreed withdrawals will be obeyed while the assumption is likely to prove correct insofar as regular troops are concerned paramilitary organizations may not accept the arrangements and tinue to cause concern peacekeeping force may experience some sporadic re sistance or opposition 6establishment of liaison system before deploying peacekeeping force be tween the contestants armies it is necessary to establish liaison system between the force the host nation and the parties to the dispute good liaison is necessary to enable the peacekeepers to move into position in accordance with timetable ac cepted by all parties and whose troops know what to expect failure to install the liaison system first risks misunderstandings friction and perhaps outright opposition without the means to resolve problems 7deployment of force in the buffer zone the deployment of force between the armies of the two sides armies which have been locked in furious combat up until the moment of the ceasefire to secure an advantage at the negotiating table is the most critical moment it may be necessary to persuade one of the contestants to withdraw from position captured beyond the agreed cfl in the case of refusal it would be beyond both the capability and the mandate of the force to attempt to com pel compliance the breach must be reported through

confrontation area when the use of thin skinned vehicles or troops on foot is dangerous 3 to provide commander with mobility protection and communications to observe violation from distance sufficient to avoid unnecessary provo cation 4 as calculated and carefully considered escalatory step to indicate that peacekeeping force is not prepared to allow potentially dangerous situ ation to deteriorate

9liaison with the opposing parties while the peacekeeping force headquarters will set up liaison system and communications with the commanders of the oppos ing forces it is equally important to establish contact and good working relations at battalion company and on occasion platoon level officers must know the names of the commanders of the forces they are dealing with and form an assessment of their attitude to the peacekeeping force and the agreement if an atmosphere of trust can be established it should be possible to arrange informal meetings for off the record discussions contact points6 should be established where meetings can be arranged at short notice with local representatives of the parties they may be located at exist ing ops or in huts conveniently sited near the bz boundary fence if possible they should be fitted with wire terminals so that field telephone can be connected quickly alternatively hot lines may be established between peacekeeping force company commanders and their opposite numbers in the parties to the dispute the aim is to ensure that incidents are dealt with quickly and effectively at the lower level before they escalate some form

7method of control the peacekeeping force should establish ops and positions as close to the edge of the bz or cfl as possible in order to dominate the local area presence is usually effected by establishing section posts which are directly control led from company base this enables each company to rotate and rest sections and to keep sufficient troops in reserve at varying states of

will hand them over to the host nation police at check points leading into bz the peacekeeping troops on duty will observe civilians pass ing through for any obvious attempt to smuggle arms ammunition and explosives 4 this system was developed by the norwegian battalion in unfil the firing of warning shots not standard british army practice is standard procedure in some peacekeeping forces british units should not adopt it without specific instructionsb 9 5 issue 10 dec 98civilian traffic will only be stopped and searched on the orders of the force com mander when the situation warrants such action in some peackeeping forces the troops are not allowed to confiscate weapons and ammunition only to turn the carri ers back in some contingents their own vehicles and personnel will be searched on entry and exit from the bz to deter smuggling of arms contraband drugs etc the aim is as much to convince the host country that the force is observing its laws as to catch or deter criminal activity among its members 14host nations powers of stop and search host nation authorities are allowed to stop peacekeeping force vehicle to establish the identity of the occupants but are not normally permitted to search them should the host nations police or army insist on searching vehicle or individual the latter will protest but not resist forcefully if he is able to contact his headquarters he will ask for the help of the force military police should the authorities still insist on search the individual will request that the force military police carry it out witnessed by

court cases peacekeeping personnel do not normally appear as witnesses in the courts of the host nation their evidence is usually accepted in written statement the legal branch at force headquarters must be consulted in such cases 19civilian rallies political rallies might be held at peacekeeping checkpoint at the entrance to the bz to present petition to the united nations secretarygeneral or some other prominent personality the host nations police are responsible for trolling political marches and demonstrations the peackeeping force headquarters will use all its influence with the civil authorities and police at both national and local levels to provide an adequate police presence including reserves to deal with the situation in order to avoid the direct involvement of the peacekeeping force sector commanders and the force headquarters will monitor plans for rallies in case the local police are unable to prevent crowd of demonstrators entering the bz or threat ening force checkpoint or installation in this eventuality the peackeeping forces civilian police eg uncivpol if it has one will be prepared to back up the host nations police only if this fails will peacekeeping troops be committed to turning the crowd back whether large number of troops is used in an unarmed role backed up by armed troops or whether arms are used will depend on the situation and the force commanders decision in either case timely and effective warning will be given and only minimum necessary force will be used most rallies are well publicized in ad vance and there is usually ample time to activate the sector and force reserves and move them into nearby assembly area from which they can be committed without delay the local sector commander and the commander of the force reserve will reconnoitre and establish stop lines incorporating wire and other obstacles for use in case the host nations police lose control of the situation 20petitions it is preferable to avoid involvement in petitions by suggesting to the or ganizers that the proper course of action is to mail any petition to the secretarygen eral his political representative with the force or the

regard to air defence resources 22 the control and conduct of operations in nofly zone is beyond the scope of this handbookissue 10 dec 98 b 10 1serial b10 demilitarisation and arms control issues general 1 demilitarisation or arms control may be one of the tasks given to military force under the terms of its mandate or they may be local tactical initiatives attempted to reduce tension in specific area in general demilitarisation and arms control mea sures will only be possible once ceasefire or peace agreement is in place in extreme cases peace enforcement operation may be necessary to remove military forces from an area thus demilitarising it this serial will only consider the military aspects of demilitarisation and arms control once ceasefire is in place methods of demilitarisation and arms control 2 demilitarisation and arms control will normally be progressive process in that tar gets will be set and achieved in recognised steps steps which will require consider able verification and policing by the military force are likely to be as shown in the following paragraphs nofly zone can also be incorporated into any buffer zone or ceasefire line 3withdrawal from front lines following ceasefire agreement military forces will normally be deployed along the old frontlines the ceasefire line the first stage or demilitarisation will be withdrawal from these wartime positions either to barracks or more usually to behind zone of separation or buffer zone the aim of these zones are to move belligerents back beyond small arms range and ideally outside line of site this move will reduce antagonism and therefore tension and could re duce the prospect of an accidental return to conflict 4withdrawal of heavy weapons the withdrawal of heavy weapons specified dis tance from the ceasefire line will offer significant confidencebuilding measure heavy weapons should include main battle tanks towed and self propelled artillery pieces heavy mortars and armoured fighting vehicles 5decommissioning of air defence ad weapons military force has to be aware of the ad capability of former belligerents active ad systems will pose high poten tial threat all types of aircraft and helicopters and should be neutralised and then removed as soon as possible 6return to barrackscantonment sites having separated the former belligerents the next step is to return the troops to barracks or to new cantonment sites the aim of this is to move troops into peacetime locations that can be moni tored and from which potential belligerent will have to deploy from such move will also assist with the demilitarisation of the civilian population as weap ons are collected it is likely that there will be insufficient tailormade military barracks available to accommodate all troops and equipment in the appropriate areas adhoc cantonment sites will therefore have to be established these may be based around schools hospitals factories or tented camps sites thatissue 10 dec 98 b 10 2utilise the civilian infrastructure may in the long term cause problems for com munity recovery if they continue to be occupied by military forces and thus denied for the primary purpose depending on the mandate or the peace agree ment the military force may or may not have authority to allocate sites to be used 7force levels and restructuring the next stage in demilitarisation and arms control is the agreement of force levels and the restructuring of former belligerents into peacetime organisations force levels will normally be agreed at the na tional level often as part of any ceasefire agreement or peace agreement the restructuring will generally follow direction from the senior military hq and in volve suitability assessments verification and advice from units at the tactical level depending on the nature of the previous conflict it is possible that former belligerent has minimal number of trained staff officers through which to plan any restructuring similarly their peacetime command control and com munications may be extremely poor this process is therefore likely to be cha otic with many potential breaches committed often through poor administration the military force will have to identify intent when assessing whether breach was deliberate or not it will often be useful to advise and assist such restruc turing and may even be required to provide g4 support or even training restructuring 8general restructuring will normally include the following elements setting ceiling on military personnel by unit or location or both b the confinement of arms to designated armouries c the separation of arms and ammunition d military approval for proposed sites with regard to the potential for future threat the relocation of heavy weapons to authorised sites 9verification verification will depend on the mandate if the situation allows then the military force may restrict all military movement and training to that which it has authorised in such cases it would be normal to monitor those authorised activities to ensure compliance similarly the military force may inspect and monitor activities within barracks and cantonment sites this would provide an assessment of readiness capability intent morale and any attempt to deploy forcesissue 10 dec 98 b 10 310enforcement enforcement will also depend on the mandate and may involve restrictions on factions military activity training or movement it may involve punitive inspections or even confiscations of weapons or equipmentb 11 1 issue 10 dec 98serial b11 the use of non lethal weapons nlw background 1 the use of nlw is not new weapons such as batons water canon rubber bullets cs gas stun grenades and electronic warfare ew have been used by police and armed forces throughout the world for number of years in situations where the use of more lethal weapons would be inappropriate what is new and has enhanced the importance of nlw is not only the increasing number of military operations but also the high visibility of such operations including ootw situations where satellite technology makes it possible for the public to see in minute detail how the operations proceed such public scrutiny has highlighted the difficulties of military forces responding to situation because they generally have weapons capable of generating anything less than lethal force in many circumstances especially those associated with peacekeeping the use of lethal weapons are not always appropriate or could be interpreted by some as heavy handed and unnecessary public expectations 2 the public concern for casualties among the combatants and civilian population has increased interest in the potential for nlw in the expectation that they can provide armed forces with more appropriate but less than lethal response when required the public expectation has been fuelled by the increasingly high profile nonlethal technologies considered in the media operations may involve nonlethal or lethal weapons or both and one situation can be limited to specific level of lethality nlw could contribute to the application of military force in pursuit of militarypolitical aims and objectives the categories of nlw 3 although difficult to define nlw can be broadly categorized into those that are designed to impair or immobilise apersons systems targeted against personnel include 1psychological operations psyops psyops uses information warfare and the media to reduce the morale and combat efficiency of hostile groups or to influence the emotions of the populace in order to persuade them to or dissuade them from taking specific action 2acoustics noise whether it be audible or inaudible infra and ultra sound can be used to immobilize individuals or disperse crowds by causing discomfort disorientation and nausea 3calmative agents and irritants these systems are used to subdue or disperse riotous crowds or individuals and will include current agents such as cs gasb 11 2 issue 10 dec 984visual stimulus and illusion vsi vsi uses high intensity strobe lighting and holography to cause temporary vertigo disorientation and nausea 5lasers and incapacitants low energy dazzle lasers and incapacitants eg stun grenades and adhesive tape are used to temporarily blind dazzle or immobilise individuals bequipment and material systems targeted against equipment and material include those designed to impair or prevent mobility neutralize weapons exploit or disrupt communications or degrade the infrastructure such systems include 1antitraction agents combustion alteration technologies to impair or immobilise equipments 2sensor damage lasers targeted against vehicle optics to prevent mobility and target acquisition 3metal embrittlement polymer super adhesive agents to disable chanical linkages and alter material properties causing general equipment and weapon failure 4radio frequency weapons rfw to cause electronic failure in ignition systems communications radars computers and navigation aids 5conductive ribbons to short circuit power lines fuel additives to contaminate fuel supplies and the introduction of computer viruses to disrupt communication and economic centres guidance in the use of nlw 4 there are many advantages and disadvantages in using nlw should any such weapons be procured for use but in the absence of any practical experience to base firm and clear principles the following guidelines could be appropriate when consid ering their use nlw can either be used alone provided they are backed up with the ability to use lethal force or in conjunction with lethal force their use should be controlled by roe and should not be allowed to jeopardise the right of soldiers to defend themselves where necessary with lethal force for the protection of life b the employment of nlw should be consistent with extant treaties conventions international and national laws their use should also be morally and ethically justifiable c nlw should be used proportionately the least destructive way of defeating insurgents and discriminately the protection of noncombatants from direct intentional attackb 11 3 issue 10 dec 98d in planning the employment of nlw the operational response to all possible reactions should be fully rehearsed responses from the medical legal civil and public affairs authorities as consequence of unintended results and side effects caused by the use of nlw should be fully prepared f nlw should be fully integrated with lethal weapons in order to provide graduated response to situation based upon the use of minimum force and perception of the threat g nlw should not be deployed without consideration of countermeasures h nlw should not be deployed without consideration of any politicalmilitary instructions that may be given i nlw should be employed in such manner so as to minimize casualties to ones own troops 5 any use of nlw would require formal approval from the mod and agreement covering any change to current roe or the issue of new roeissue 10 dec 98 b 12 1serial b12 civil affairs and community relations civil representative 1 the role of civil affairs

general 1 language difficulties can arise at any stage in the conduct of operations in theatre where english is not widely spoken this can also be problem on combined opera tions exacerbated by differences in doctrine training military culture and capability these problems can be overcome by employing interpreters who may be uk military personnel or local nationals the latter may be locally employed or provided as part of the host nation support hns military interpreters 2 military interpreters will be required from the earliest stages of military planning through any deployment into and eventual withdrawal from theatre of operations the scale of provision will depend on the requirement to interpret between the military force and other parties on whether the environment is friendly or hostile on the lan guage of allied and coalition partners and on the nature of the operational theatre 3 the extent to which local nationals can be used will depend upon the nature of the operations but it does not remove the requirement for some servicemen to speak the languages concerned the deployed force should have number of military inter preters on strength who can assess the abilities employ deploy and monitor the performance of any local interpreters b replace local staff when security military or political considerations require in terpretation of sensitive information c deal with military vocabulary beyond the scope of the local interpreters 4 in certain situations and environments the rank of the military interpreter may be im portant if he or she is to have credibility in the eyes of the local politicalmilitary lead ers use of local interpreters 5 before employing local nationals as interpreters it will be necessary to assess their capabilities and possibly their political affiliation employing local people as inter preters has security implications both for information and for the physical security of the persons involved the use of local interpreters in policy making staff areas will generally be inappropriate in any operation knowledge of the politicalculturalreli gious affiliation of individual local interpreters could be of vital importance in certain situations 6 consideration has to be given to the basis on which interpreters will be employed as it will be rare for their services to be required on permanent basis they may alsoissue 10 dec 98 b 13 2have to be employed in other secondary roles which will require them to demonstrate wider military skills and possibly some flexibility training 7 military interpreters cannot be trained from

handling the media general 1 the journalist in an operational area has tough highly competitive and sometimes dangerous job his primary purpose is to get better story than his competitors and to get it in time for the earliest publication the basic principles to be applied in dealing with the media are unnecessary hindrance is to be offered to journalists freedom to operate it is in the interests of law and order that the press should have facilities to expose terrorism acts of violence and the intimidation of civilians b member of the media has the same rights liberties and obligations under the law as any other citizen c any entry into army premises and any contact with army personnel should be in accordance with the prevailing instructions issued by the appropriate formation hq 2 the mod have issued green book which covers many aspects of media opera tions in time of war this should be the principal guide for all media ops staff in the conduct of their work with regard to the media the rights of the media 3 journalist like any civilian has the right to speak to anyone visit anywhere and photograph anything he wishes provided this does not conflict with the law does not involve any entry into prohibited areas and does not impair operations or endanger life 4 in practice this means that members of the media may conduct their business subject to the following they have right to enter military property without the permission of the officer responsible for that property b the final decision as to whether or not to give an interview rests with the media ops staff the journalist should be reminded politely that he should contact the unit press officer or the appropriate media ops staff before conducting an interview c journalists may normally photograph all personnel and equipment in public places from public places they may not photograph personnel equipment or property within military premises without permission if there is security reason why the security forces do not wish photograph to be published eg an eod team at work this should be clearly explained to the photographer together with the consequences of non complianceissue 10 dec 98 b 14 2d if the commander on the spot believes that members of the media are prejudicing security he should deal with the matter by persuasion admonition or as last resort and only if criminal offence is suspected the police should be called to assist it is possible that reporter may deliberately wish to expose himself to danger against the advice of the security forces if he does not yield to persuasion he should be clearly warned in front of witnesses of the possible consequences of his actions and told that he must accept total responsibility for them f the media may ask for priority at check point they have right to this but their livelihood depends upon deadlines and news is highly perishable the local commander should where possible grant this priority having satisfied himself that the request is bona fide and the operational situation permits information for the media 5 all operational information for the media is to be given by the media ops staff or unit press officer or by those authorized to do so when accompanied by one of these officers 6 commanders or those authorized by them may communicate directly with the media when the information given is strictly factual where it relates solely to the commanders particular unit and when it touches ground which is politically controversial or operationally sensitive 7 media ops staff approval is required before any member of the forces agrees to give statement or interview for tv or radio before considering any request the staff must know who will do the interview which programme it is for and the agreed scope and line of questioning of the statement or interview whenever possible the best spokesman irrespective of rank should be used particularly if he can speak with first hand knowledge of the subject in question the chief media ops officer or his representative should be present during any interview with the media identification of the media 8 any person claiming to be member of the media should produce press card of which there are many versions unless the military are satisfied that journalist is bona fide facilities should not be granted 9 in certain particular circumstances members of the media may be accredited to the security forces and have authenticated credentials military families 10 in situation where service families are in the theatre of operations official restrictions can be placed on these families in dealing with the media but they should be advised by their heads of family to seek advice from the media operations staff before making statements or commenting to the media on official military matters 11 media ops staff will also have to be aware of the possibility of service family members in uk having dealings with the media in uk concerning military operations

facts of the situation are confirmed before any official statement is made it should be cleared with the media ops staff reports of shootings 2 these reports should include time b location of military forces c location of hostile groups if known d military casualties if any confirmed other casualties if any reports of bomb incidents exploded or unexploded 3 these reports should include location b time of warning and to whom length of warning time time of explosion normally given by the civil authorities if the incident is in the uk c casualties if any d estimate of damage qualify answer estimate of size of bomb by ato f outline of how planted eg mortar car bomb or ied if details are known g if possible explain any delays in taking action eg possible ambush or booby trap reports of disturbances 4 these reports should includeissue 10 dec 98 b 15 2a time and location b military forces involved including some description of the disturbance c numbers involved d types of weapons used by the rioters if any type of weapons used by military forces eg cs smoke baton rounds if used f military casualties if any g arrests if any name but numbers only reports of finds 5 reports of finds should be cleared with intelligence the eod control centre and the police before being announced the details will normally be confined to location but not so detailed as to prejudice conviction eg house in x street b description of find but not too detailed eg so many weapons pounds of explosive assorted rounds of ammunition names 6 normally soldiers are not named nor should any indication be given of rank of patrol commanders etc 7 names of arrested men are not given to the media who should be referred to the police or civil authorities for further information 8 the media ops staff has to be given full details and background information on any persons who have been detained by the military forces casualties 9 names are only disclosed to the media for fatal casualties after the next of kin have been informed suitable evidence is necessary to confirm this neither names nor units are given for seriously injured or not listed cases if asked about casualty before the next of kin have been informed the press should be politely informed that statement will be made as soon as the next of kin have been informed 10 only in exceptional circumstances are names of any injured persons made public statements on casualties should not normally be volunteered but held against enquiryissue 10 dec 98 b 15 3legal limitations 11 any legal limitations on media reporting will differ markedly from state to state the media ops staff should ensure that they are conversant with the legal nuances of handling media issues within the threatre of operations on deployment to that theatre 12 in general statement should be made by military authorities during the process of any investigation by the police or civil authorities into possible criminal or subversive activities 13 once an investigation trial enquiry arrest or charge is announced nothing must be said which could prejudice the outcome or any appeal stages these instances are sub judice and the media should be referred to the police if they make enquiries 14 once matter has been referred to minister comment can be made before ministerial reply enquiries should be referred to the media ops staff conventions 15 experience has resulted in certain conventional answers to common questions if the convention is broken then journalists are alerted to the fact that they could be on to newsworthy item conventional answers have to be adhered to rigidly and not elaborated upon once convention is broken dangerous precedent is created 16 examples of subjects on which as matter of policy the military forces cannot comment on confirm

groups of journalists 18 journalist can be guaranteed exclusive rights to any story as it is beyond the authority of any crown servant to guarantee this if journalist has discovered his own exclusive story the army must undertake not to disclose it to other journalists unless they make direct approach on the same subject in this case impartiality must be observed 19 pool facilities and how they are arranged are laid down in the mods green book media operations in time of war the same arrangements apply for any operation that the army undertakes on limited scale the media ops staff would

what law applies in given set of circumstances and what it is that triggers any changes in the law to be applied the answer to this type of question relates directly to the sort of rules of engagement roe that would be issued by the ministry of defence in pso situation the roe would have direct links with the status of forces agreement sofa if one exists 2 jsp 398 is the joint service manual which provide the ground rules and procedures for british servicemen for the incorporation and application of particular roe to suit the prevailing circumstances 3 uk government ministers provide political direction and guidance to commanders by means of roe which govern the application of force it follows that such rules which are approved by ministers may only be changed by ministerial authority com manders will in turn wish to issue roe to their subordinates these roe will be cast within the discretion allowed by the rules approved by ministers 4 roe define the degree and manner in which force may be applied and are designed to ensure that such application of force is carefully controlled roe are not intended to be used to assign specific tasks or as means of issuing tactical instructions in passing orders to subordinates commander at any level must always act within the roe received but is not bound to use the full extent of the permission granted 5 roe are usually written in the form of prohibitions or permissions when they are issued as prohibitions they will be orders to commanders not to take certain desig nated actions when they are issued as permissions they will be guidance to com manders that certain designated actions may be taken if the commanders judge them necessary to desirable in order to carry out their assigned tasks the roe are thus issued as set of parameters to inform commanders of the limits of constraint im posed or of freedom permitted when carrying out their assigned tasks the confor mity of any action with any set of roe in force does not guarantee its lawfulness and it remains the commanders responsibility to use only that degree of force which is necessary reasonable and lawful in the circumstances 6 every theatre in which uk forces operate will have particular roe profile how ever within large theatre it may be necessary to issue different profiles covering smaller areas to forces that are operating under significantly different circumstances it may also be necessary to issue different roe profiles to forces carrying out differ ent roles nevertheless in any given area of operation uk forces having similar role would normally operate under identical roe practical issues surrounding roe 7 as minimum the roe will always permit the use of lethal force in self defence provided the amount of force used is more than that required to achieve the aim ofissue 10 dec 98 c 1 2self defence beyond this commander should be aware of the following issues which may be raised do the roe extend to the use of force in any circumstance when life is endan gered thus enabling civilians to be protected b where the situation in 7a does not apply are there persons of designated spe cial status pdss such as members of humanitarian organisations or an in ternational police force who are accorded protection and so if threatened can the use of lethal force be justified it must be made quite clear who holds re sponsibility to nominate such individuals who they are and where they oper ate c can lethal force be used to prevent escape after life has been threatened d what are the criteria governing the use of lethal force in the event of the theft of property or equipment 8 in answering these general queries lethal force may only be used when life is in real danger and there is other way of preventing that danger in such circumstances minimum force may be used ie only aimed single shots should be fired where pos sible the action should be preceded by sequential escalation of force involving the adoption of more aggressive stance the tone of the voice and the firing of warning shot 9 there are occasions when troops in multinational force will be applying different national or roe during any incidents and in the course of their duties com manders should be aware of the potential difficulties that could occur1 use of weapons not associated with self defence 10 control on the use of weapons not associated with self defence such as fire from the main armament of an armoured vehicle and crew served weapons such as mortars is always retained at the highest appropriate level delegation for the use of such weapons can be given but subordinate commanders should be familiar with the means by which their release would be secured this equally applies to the firing of illuminants and the use of all types of riot control weapons training 11 all troops should be familiar and conversant with the roe that apply to them and should have briefings and instruction to complement this knowledge 1

british major consist of 5 nationalities the british use british roe the rest use roec 2 1 issue 10 dec 98serial c2 protection of bases against attack background 1 the ingenuity which can be displayed by those planning and conducting operations against static targets should not be underestimated 2 attacks may include the use of long range sniping or mortar attack on sentry posts and sangars bombs in barracks that have been rolled into the cellar of building proxy bombs left by individuals and suicide bombers who drive vehicles filled with explosives into base more recently the indiscriminate use of poisonous gas to kill people may foreshadow the use of this type of weapon on military base the use of helicopters or aircraft to drop bombs or explosives has been attempted and the use of helicopter to rescue individuals from prison could easily have its parallel in an ootw situation initial defensive precautions 3 in ideal circumstances base needs secure buffer zone of space beyond the pro tected area sufficient to counter the effects of proxy bomb left by insurgents or mortar attack distances should be commensurate with the threat roads to and from the base should be blocked or used to stop and check vehicles concrete blocks should be placed in all other areas to prevent vehicles from being placed in or near the base and screens erected at suitable points to mask the view of snipers high wire netting placed at appropriate points could prevent the passage of free flight or guided missiles 4 inside the base certain vital areas need further protection such as the entrance to troop accommodation any ammunition compound the main electrical and telephone wiring systems the main water stopcock and any gas cylinders used for administra tive purposes conversely any area inside the base utilised for screening persons or meetings with the civil community need to be near the main entrance and away from vital points within the base access to site plans and building sketches should be restricted to those who have need to know 5 to prevent unauthorised helicopter landings sentries should be briefed on how to determine whether helicopter is hostile once their suspicions have been aroused wire could be strung across areas where an unauthorised helicopter landing could take place where an airfield is to be protected these precautions would need to be expanded to include anti aircraft weapons internal vehicle patrols the use of dogs and contingency plans prepared for parachute helicopter and microlight activities 6 commanders will need to revise and change their security plans the longer the base is maintained changing exits and entrances altering the pass systems and improv ing the emergency back up procedures can all help review of defence precautions 7 it is always prudent to regularly review its security and reexamine the defensive arc 2 2 issue 10 dec 98rangements around and within the base this would normally be done in reference to the most uptodate ipb this will also need to address the risk of fire and the close protection of particularly important items of equipment or ammunition contingency plans to improve or strengthen the defences around the base if the political and secu rity circumstances for the military forces deteriorates should be made if hostile forces or groups have access to weapons or technology previously not considered within the threat assessment for the base review of overall security would immediately be necessary improving base security 8 if new or improved base is arranged which requires some form of building construc tion work it will be necessary to prepare defensive plan so that construction can be achieved rapidly without any loosening of overall security factors which could affect this defensive plan may include asecure environment secure environment will normally be achieved by trolling all roads leading to the construction site with permanent vcps pvcps augmented by satellite patrols to give depth and create unpredictability ran dom searches of personnel entering the secure area and internal patrols by search aware soldiers will help to identify suspicious objects temporary cover to protect workers from casual observation may achieve more secure environ ment bsustainability construction operations may be lengthy and monotonous and can be conducted under uncomfortable conditions to ensure efficiency and to avoid overstretch it is essential that there are sufficient troops and logistic sup port for the task reserve will provide the ability to rotate patrols through the various tasks ccommunity relations sealing roads for long period will create disruption to the local community briefing of troops and of the local population when condi tions allow forward planning and courteous behaviour are essential to mini mise the problems which can if allowed to grow unchecked attract unwanted attention and possible disruption dcommand and control construction operations will often take place within an established area of operations and will invariably require assistance from an outside unit to avoid conflicts of interest distinct arrangements for command and control have to be made which will normally entail creating small area of operations within the established operational boundaries 9summary appropriate protection for base areas is essential and needs to be stantly reviewed in the light of the many factors that could affect security in an envi ronment these factors could vary widely between peaceful and permissive condi tions and those of outright hostility and aggressiveness to those in the basec 3 1 issue 10 dec 98serial c3 guidance for guard commanders and sentries guard commanders 1 the following topics should be

eodiedd incident acategory those incidents that constitute grave and immediate threat to essential military or civilian personnel such incidents are given priority over all other incidents and disposal operations are started immediately regardless of personal risk examples of category incidents are 1 an ied placed in hospital from which patients cannot be evacuated 2 second ied discovered at the scene of previous explosion where people are trapped and rescue must be started at once to free them bcategory b those incidents which constitute an indirect threat to military or civilian

place he is responsible for obtaining all the information available and for making required any preliminary arrangements he will be advised on any additional precautions required by the eod iedd team when it arrives such as evacuating and cordoning an area to safe distance normally of at least 100 metres which for large devices and cars should extend to 200 metres and for very large vehicles to 400 metres b seeking the assistance of an eodiedd team and providing some or all of the background information about the incident evaluation by the eodiedd operator team leader 9 on arrival at the incident area the eodiedd operator should be met and briefed by the incident commander the following points should be considered the category of the incident b the circumstance surrounding the

preferably by remote means eallowing the device to function device may be allowed to function where it does not hinder operations or where risk to life or property is evident fattenuation there are occasions when only immediate attenuation action is appropriate to minimize the effects of an explosive device the use of containers shields and foam muffling procedures are still valid eod techniques

theatre sops eod trained personnel receive training in forensic handling the two main areas are aevidence care in the handling and transporting of material to be used in evidence is essential the continuity of evidence is vital in securing convictions binformation and intelligence the value of information depends on accurate and speedy incident reports the form and content of which would be

if there is large area to clear and cordon the quick reaction force qrf if available may be required therefore suitable initial rv will have to be selected early dresponsibilities the iedd operator is responsible for rendering the device safe other agencies have specific responsibilities for example re search advisor and search team may be tasked to provide safe access to the device and ensuring that its immediate surrounds are free from other devices and outside influences clearance operations present particularly serious risk and all involves must maintain high level of alertness during the operation 15types there are 2 general types of iedd operation adirect task the iedd team is tasked directly to the incident and carries out threat assessment access and render safe procedures as rapidly as possible direct tasks are not discussed further bplanned operations the iedd team is warned with other agencies of an impending iedd operation the operation is then carefully planned and information and intelligence is assembled prior to deployment the planning can take several days and the operation several days more planned operations are mounted in situations of high threat and where with regard to the device time is not limiting factor 16isolation if the target ied was not isolated in conjunction with the final icp it is isolated once the icp is occupied 17location the precise location of the target ied may be ascertained by remote controlled equipment or it may have to be done manually on one man risk basis 18final approach once the target ied has been located safe access and working area around it is established and marked where possible remote controlled equipment is used to locate and approach the target ied 19render safe the iedd operator then carries out his detailed procedures to render the device safe the process can take many hours and the detail is not recorded here after actions 20subsequent procedures once the target has been rendered safe evidence gathering agencies may need to approach it under the control of the eod operator which could mean that the iedd operator requests the search advisor to expand the marked safe area to allow more space for examinationc 4 8 issue 10 dec 98b the iedd operator requests the search advisor to search the remainder of the area that has been isolated to ensure that there are subsidiary devices 21action on further finds the action taken when find other than the original find is made depends on the situation and type of find the iedd operator in conjunction with other agencies as required will take the necessary action 22final action by the military commander withdrawal activity should start until the iedd operator is satisfied that the target area is properly clear of all devices the cordon remains intact until full clearance has been confirmed the iedd operator will then formally declare the area clear guidance for those involved in an ied incident 23 some useful tips for those involved with ied incidents are do not touch or approach an explosive device b assume that an explosion means the area is safe there may be another device c permit persons to approach ied sites until declared safe by an eod team leader d urge the eod operator to get on with the task allow the media to harry or distract the eod operator f reveal the eod operators name or permit photographs which would allow him to be identified g talk about the construction of the ied h give reasons for failure to ignite if this is appropriate i describe techniques used to disarm the ied 24 the general public may become familiar with ied threats and explosions and begin to display indifference to the potential hazard nevertheless they have to be treated with firmness and courtesy and encouraged to cooperate in minimizing the danger to lifeissue 10 dec 98 c 5 1serial c5 mine awareness 1general the proliferation and relatively easy access to all types of mines and booby traps ensures that soldiers will continue to be exposed to this growing threat while on ootw activities the following guidelines have been prepared to assist soldiers in avoiding this potential threat 2areas in which mines should be suspected all soldiers should be aware of the possibility that mines would be laid in the following places in bottle necks and defiles especially if recovery clearance or bypass of damaged vehicles would prove difficult b in potential ambush areas both for foot and vehicle patrols c in verges where grass and debris can be used for concealment and anywhere on unmetalled roads where concealment is easy d in rubble mud or debris on an otherwise clear route blockage of routes by apparently harmless obstructions which forces traffic onto verge or diversion which may then be

small isolated detachments and for local administration there is always danger of establishing regular pattern of movement it has to be matter of discipline to maintain constantly an irregular pattern in the routes followed in convoy or vehicle speeds and timings failure to do this places lives and equipment at risk and may give any hostile group successes which they would otherwise find difficult to achieve the land component handbook gives further detail on responsibilities planning control and procedures for road movement air observation should be normal feature of all convoys route if the threat is high consideration should be given for an fac to be deployed in helicopter in which case close air support should be available 2size small convoy is normally composed of packets large conoys are normally split into packets and columns allowing one of these to act as reserve or strike group if conditions warrant this precaution very small party should move with never less than two vehicles each with their own communications and personal weapons 3the lead group the task of the lead group is to clear the route of any obstruction and give warning to the main group of any danger it should travel far enough ahead to enable small obstructions to be cleared without getting the main group involved the group may include re or assault pioneers trained to recognise potential mined or booby trapped areas 4the main group this should ideally be composed of armoured reconnaissance vehicles and infantry in armoured or soft skinned vehicles particularly if there is potential threat typical order of march could be as follows armoured reconnaissance vehicles b convoyvip car c cvr containing the column commander d mounted infantry armoured reconnaissance vehicle 5the reserve or strike group this should move far enough behind the close protection group to allow freedom of action if the latter is held up or attacked helicopter borne quick reaction force qrf may be tasked as reserve force ideally this should be composed of at least two helicopters to allow for greater flexibility of movement and action 6command and control the column commander commands the column from his position in the convoy good secure radio communications throughout the column arec 6 2 issue 10 dec 98therefore essential together with working link to the local security force commander in case the convoy requires help 7liaison the staff responsible for the arrangements for move have to agree with local commanders the measures which are to be taken to protect the convoy as it passes through their areas this includes the means of travel the route timings and the size of the escort and the presence of soft skinned vehicles if there is risk of incident 8aviation support helicopters may be used to reconnoitre the proposed convoy route and for flank protection prior to vehicle movement road security can be examined for hostile activity during movement of the convoy aviation can provide flank guard and reconnaissance ahead to check for potential incidents hold ups or attack positions 9preparation of vehicles when operating vehicles in pso operation consideration should be given to adopting one or more of the following points about protection any restricting superstructure should be removed to give troops clear field of fire and observation and the freedom to dismount quickly unarmoured vehicles should be modified in workshops so as to provide some protection against mines for the driver and passengers the use of sandbags is an obvious deterrent to the risk of casualties from minesbooby traps b tailboards should be down or removed c wire mesh if fitted must be so constructed that men can debus from the rear and over the sides its use depends on local circumstances and the role of the unit as it can be severe handicap in the event of attack d all transport should be fitted with towing hooks and have adequate tool kits and tow devices mine detectors and strong cordage should be available for clearing obstacles mounts for machine guns should be fitted to unarmed transport f high wire cutters should be fitted to the front of vehicles metal grid can also be fitted to the front of vehicle to enable light barricades to be pushed aside g the soldiers in the back of troop carrying vehicle should be seated facing outwards and to the rear with any stores or packs stacked centrally 10action if attacked if the convoy is attacked an immediate action drill which must have been practised repeatedly should be applied automatically when troops in vehicles are caught and forced to stop inside the danger area of an ambush the immediate drill might bec 6 3 issue 10 dec 98a smoke dischargers are fired and sentries throw smoke grenades and engage the ambush party while the remainder debus and move to rallying point in the direction ordered followed finally by the sentries b simultaneously the commanders orders direction in which troops are to move on debussing c as soon as the troops have assembled and the commander has located the ambushers an immediate counterattack should be launched d there must be wild and indiscriminate firing at any stage particularly where there may be innocent bystanders large road convoys 11general column of vehicles is particularly attractive target especially close country in remote areas hostile groups may attack road convoy by either ambushing or placing device on or by the road large convoy is one where the column is subdivided into more than one packet many of the principles already described for small convoys apply particularly the need for meticulous planning and briefing and air observation during the movement of the convoy precautionary measures designed to forestall attacks or to minimize their effect b tactical grouping within convoys protection by armour and if the situation demands artillery and air aviation support c the immediate availability of mobile reserve which could be an airborne reaction force arf 12the need to know principle plans should never be divulged in advance to anyone who does not have need to know them and deception measures should always be considered where route is in regular use precautions may have to be taken which would not be necessary on route which is used irregularly 13intelligence and reconnaissance intelligence on potential hostile activity astride the proposed route should be obtained and there must be careful reconnaissance carried out with suitable deception measures to ensure preservation of secrecy aerial imagery and photographs can assist this process without risk to personnel or compromise this reconnaissance should include identification of bottlenecks and possible ambush sites b assessment of the escort requirement and task organisation required c the need for any special preparations such as picketing clearance of roadside cover patrolling of particularly dangerous areas etc use of aviation fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft are invaluable to conduct photographic surveillance orc 6 4 issue 10 dec 98video footage of the proposed route this would also be useful for briefing vehicle commanders d all possible diversions and alternative routes the command and communications problem f recovery needs 14organization of convoy the following terms are used aescort the force detailed to provide protection it has its own escort com mander bvehicle column the column of vehicles being protected it is commanded by the column commander cconvoy the vehicle column plus the escort the overall commander is the convoy commander 15strength of escort the strength and composition of the escort will depend upon the size of the vehicle column and the forces available the ideal is mixed escort comprising armour and infantry possibly with aviation air and artillery support if circumstances warrant this an armoured reconnaissance regiment is well suited for providing the armoured element of an escort and infantry should be mounted in apcs engineers should be included to make minor repairs to bridges and roads to detect and lift mines and to remove obstacles suitable escort for column of about six vehicles would be an armoured reconnaissance troop while larger convoy might require reconnaissance squadron with up to two companies of infantry 16grouping convoy should be divided into packets each with its nominated commander the interval between packets being adjusted so as to minimize the number of vehicles which can be caught in any one ambush the interval between vehicles within group will depend on the closeness of the country the speed of the convoy and the need to maintain control 17organization of the escort the following is an example of an escort based on squadron of an armoured reconnaissance regiment and mechanized company aadvanced patrol one reconnaissance troop as point troop one platoon of infantry and an engineer detachment these move well ahead of the convoy and try to locate trouble before the remainder of the column meets it bclose protection group squadron headquarters plus three reconnaissance troops and platoon of infantry these provide immediate close protection to the vehicle column the subdivision of the column into packets each with armour and infantry will normally be necessaryc 6 5 issue 10 dec 98creserve or strike group company headquarters one reconnaissance troop with the surveillance troops if included one platoon of infantry in apcs 18mobile reserve mobile reserve separate from the convoy should be available to intervene immediately should the convoy be ambushed it will normally consist of helicopterborne infantry on immediate standby planning for intervention by the mobile reserve should include the coordination of infantry and aviation and the provision of air and possibly artillery support if the risk is great or an ambush seems imminent the mobile reserve may have to be kept airborne for limited period an alternative means of moving the mobile reserve must be planned in case bad weather grounds the aircraft 19recovery and repair of vehicles plans should exist for the prompt recovery and repair of vehicles recovery vehicles should be included in any large convoy and there should be vehicle mechanics in each group the recovery and repair policy has to be included in convoy orders normally packet will halt long enough to take broken down vehicle in tow or for it to be handed over to recovery section travelling with the convoy there may however be circumstances when it will be necessary to abandon vehicle rather than hold up the convoy 20communications radio communications are essential between all packets within the convoy and with the mobile reserve supporting artillery aircraft and other security forces operating on or astride the route light signals and coloured smoke grenades may also be used to prearranged code for passing information and for indicating targets 21conduct and sequence of movement in very difficult circumstances where large convoy has to move through country in which strong hostile forces are active the sequence of action set out below may have to be used in less severe conditions precautions can be progressively relaxed in relation to the threat astage 1 secure firm base near the convoy starting point and deploy artillery in support establish continuous airborne fac and artillery observation over the first 1015 kilometres of the route and assemble the mobile reserve armed helicopters may also be deployed bstage 2 secure second firm base with infantry moved by helicopter or on foot this should be followed by moving some artillery to the second firm base either by helicopter or by road with armour and infantry protection cstage 3 by now artillery will be in position ready to fire from both bases and the mobile reserve on standby in the first firm base the convoy should now move in the tactical grouping previously described with the point troop supported by the airborne fac artillery observer and possibly armed helicopters moving well ahead by bounds in order to clear the route dstage 4 assuming that the convoy has reached the second firm base artillery should move there from the first base either by air or by road with the protectivec 6 6 issue 10 dec 98force which was originally established at the first firm base the mobile reserve would also move to the second firm base before the whole procedure is repeated over the next 1 15 kilometres 22action if ambushed that part of the convoy that attacked should conduct the same contact drills as indicated in 10 additional points could be concurrently with the above if appropriate artillery and air support is requested b the strike group moves forward to counterattack or outflank hostile forces c the mobile reserve is called in to assault the position or to block their escape route in conjunction with the strike group 23command and control the antiambush drill has to be understood by the commanders of each group and by all vehicle commanders so that in well spread out convoy there is always someone available to take appropriate action if the convoy commander is too far away to take local control the command and control arrangements should therefore be devised so that there is always nominated commander on the spot with the necessary communications to call for supporting fire and air support picketing route 24general picketing is the means of securing road or track by dominating the route for limited period to allow the safe passage of convoy it is expensive in manpower and time and should only be carried out when there is grave threat of ambush and when other methods of protecting the route are impracticable picketing techniques used in open mountainous areas are described in afm vol 2 part 1 mountain operations the emphasis here is on picketing in other types of terrain 25deployment of pickets pickets should where possible be positioned by helicopter or by deploying picketing force the picketing force is made up of an advance guard main body and rear guard the advance guard clears the axis by bounds the main body establishes the pickets and the rear guard calls in the pickets when the convoy has passed such force could move on foot or in vehicles depending on the terrain and the nature of the convoy and may need to include armour mortars and artillery to support pickets into position and cover their withdrawal 26distance between pickets the initial task of picketing force will be to ensure that there is ambush in position thereafter the distance between pickets will be dictated by the nature of the terrain while all intervening ground should ideally be covered by fire in some close country this may be quite unrealistic it may be necessary to picket only certain parts of the route or selected features although in this case there has to be risk that an ambush can be set up in an intervening position the existence of pickets and uncertainty amongst an ambush party as to their whereabouts is an important deterrent the distance at which pickets are established from the convoy route also depends on the nature of ground and on the time availablec 6 7 issue 10 dec 98they should ideally be sited at such distance as to prevent direct fire from small arms and hand held antitank weapons being brought to bear on the convoy 27size of pickets the size of pickets should be related to the threat and the type of terrain 28use of forces operating in the area if forces are already operating in the area through which convoy route passes they may be used to picket the route the method of their deployment will depend on their current positions such picketing force is still required to ensure that ambush has already been established and for this purpose they may need to clear the sides of the convoy route close liaison and good communications are particularly important between such force and the convoy 29communications good communications are particularly important in close country where there is an obvious danger of confusion should hostile force evade the pickets and succeed in attacking convoy each picket must either have radio or be in direct contact by hand voice or light signals with post which does have radio in this way the progress of the convoy can be made known to the pickets and any activity on or beside the route can be readily identified by either the pickets or the convoy as being friendly or suspicious where the picketing force is provided by unit different to that escorting the convoy there must be liaison officer with radio from the picketing force to the escort commander light signals can usefully be employed to recall pickets coloured flags and panels are useful for identifying vehicles packetsc 7 1 issue 10 dec 98serial c7 protection of air and rail movement air movement 1 should the operational situation allow movement of troops and some freight may be conducted by aircraft and helicopter indeed this is the prefered method of movement where this is feasible protection of airfields or termini may not be possible or appropriate but protection of aircrafthelicopters on the ground at airfields is vital security of landing stripssites is also necessary and clearance parties should check the site well before landings take place and secure the area until all arrivals and departures have been completed the land component handbook lch gives further guidance on the planning and control of air movements rail movement 2 railways may be used to move essential military reinforcements and supplies in an ootw situation an adversary will undoubtedly make use of any suitable railway service to move about the area to transport equipment and to hijack passengers and staff where necessary 3protection of military trains the close escort for train should travel in special carriage fitted with mountings for machine guns mortars and rocket launchers and protected from mines and small arms fire by sandbags and armour in addition to the escort there should be ops at other parts of the train the escort carriage should preferably be attached near the rear of the train and it should not be adjacent to any ammunition or pol carrying wagons there are two aspects of rail movement amovement of troops and stores the movement of military personnel and equipment by rail is less easily concealed than it is by road the route is predictable and loading can seldom be accomplished out of the public eye opportunities for deception are limited and physical protection becomes all important safeguarding rail movement is therefore expensive in manpower trains should only be run through dangerous country when there is real need and then they should be used to capacity in order to take full advantage of all the measures which have to be put into effect to protect them bthe protection of civil trains the difficulties of protecting civilian trains derive from their frequency and the need for patrols to avoid patterns despite the linear nature of this task these problems are aggravated when an international frontier is involved for patrols have to be mounted at likely hijacking points without themselves being set up as targets 4precautionary measures while the timing and the load of military train should never be divulged except to those who have to know it will be difficult to conceal the running of train except on fairly busy civil line precautions should therefore be directed towards ensuring the line is free of obstructions or explosives this can be done by employing search teams to check vulnerable parts of the linec 7 2 issue 10 dec 98b taking antiambush precautions c making it clear that attacks will inevitably result in quick and efficient manner d patrolling in the area of the railway line so as to locate and deter possible attacks clearing undergrowth from beside the track f picketing as for road movement particularly on crossing sites g proving the track ahead of the train h utilising helicopters to provide observation and to carry mobile strike force if the train is attacked 5pilot trains pilot trains are used to prove the line against sabotage obstructions and pressure mines they cannot guard against command detonated mines or against ambushes but they are useful extra patrol in this context and the escort should be alert and looking out for any signs of such activity pilot train usually consists of locomotive pushing one or more unoccupied wagons which should be weighted with ballast and pulling coach or wagon which should be protected against mines and small arms carrying an armed escort more than one pilot train should if possible precede military train to provide additional chances of detecting mining or ambush preparations and to confuse saboteurs as to whether an approaching train is their target 6protection of other trains in some situations armoured trains may be useful for patrolling sections of railway line where hostile activity is expected in order to protect all types of rail movement they should be operated tactically under orders of the local military commander and be manned either by specially selected railway employees or by military crew if this is feasible 7sector control the signalling system on railways relies on sectors into which trains are only allowed when the preceding train is clear these sectors may be suitable basis for ensuring that any train which is ambushed can reverse out of the ambush onto clear line or be reinforced the sector system in use should be examined with this in mind and revised if necessary 8deception measures in busy line or on one which carries even small number of scheduled services it may be possible to run military train instead of civil train at the same time as in the schedule on the less busy lines it may be possible to conceal the time of departure of train if rolling stock can be kept waiting perhaps for days or if it can be rapidly assembled loaded and despatched communications on railways have to be good and if hostile sympathizer has access to them acquiring information on train movement and passing messages is easy 9antihijacking measures covert antihijacking parties may be used as last resort because of the difficulties of recognition of friend or foe and of engaging hijackersc 7 3 issue 10 dec 98within the confined space of railway carriage without risk to passengers trains which cross an international border will cause particular problem since hijackers may be able to board from within their sanctuary every effort has to be made to engage the cooperation of security forces across the border more effective measures may be the screening of boarding passengers and their baggage b the random patrolling of trains between intermediate stops c patrols by air ops 10command control of moving train rests with the crew ambush parties can of course be engaged by security forces on the train while it is moving if train is immobilized the escort commander or senior military member aboard if there is escort as such must assume command the aim will then be to defend the train the goods it is carrying its passengers and crew troops must be positioned in or near the front and rear carriages to keep the commander in touch with the situation by radio 11communications radio communications have to be available to call for assistance in addition to the communications required within the train if military or police forces have been deployed to protect the railway line their communications should be compatible with any train radios planned light signals can also be employed to supplement radio communications and coloured panels should be carried in case it becomes necessary to mark certain coaches in an engagementissue 10 dec 98 c 8 1serial c8 use of civilian vehicles introduction 1 the use of civilian vehicles by military personnel in counter insurgency situation is now normal practice civilian vehicles allow troops to move around the theatre of operations with greater ease and degree of anonymity thus making them harder to observe and attack 2 experience has shown that insurgent organisations would not baulk at attacking civilians and civilians and civilian vehicles and thus there is still need for guidance and information on the use of civilian vehicles by military personnel the vulnerability of civilian vehicles 3 civilian vehicles are vulnerable to insurgent attack if they are not used and controlled correctly the threat is different to that faced by military vehicles because these vehicles usually operate alone b they generally have armoured protection c the crews have limited firepower 4 civilian vehicles can therefore offer insurgents soft target especially when the task is made simpler by setting patterns in relation to vehicle crews and types their routes and timings of trips the propaganda value from killing member of the army in civilian clothes far outweighs the value of taking on soft target types of attacks 5ambush these can either be preplanned or mounted speculatively they may take the form of bomb attack b weapons attack 6hijack vehicles are hijacked either by mob for burning barricade making or joy riding or by insurgents who will employ the vehicle in task hijacking occurs mainly in urban areas but the insurgent hijack can happen any where 7the illegal vehicle check point ivcp mostly used for propaganda purposes the ivcp can be set up by insurgents very

extremely important that all vehicle crews think of themselves as part of the battle and remain alert to what is going on around them at all times radios should always be on the correct channel and the vehicle should be prepared to react in the event of an incident by any suitable means ie setting up vcp finally as back up to radio all crew members should carry telephone money and cards where this is appropriate fvehicle modification useful modifications include 1 cut out switches for rear lights particularly vans so that patrols at dops pups are not illuminated 2 partition in vans between

to work efficiently and safely it allows them to communicate defend themselves and repair and recover the vehicle if required the vehicles may be already modified but undoubtedly self help and rehearsal will be required to match the vehicle to the needs of the task vehicle and crew disguises 14general there is such thing as truly covert vehicle because bases are observed and the security forces have many distinguishing features that give away their identity vehicle and crew disguise should be made to eradicate these characteristics and give aways 15crew disguise the following points

embussed troops it may be worth taking on the insurgent in aggressive action if casualties and the form of attack allows 2 inform base if possible and deal with casualties 3 be prepared to coordinate and assist in followup action bhijack hijackings are particularly frequent in urban areas and usually take place where traffic slows down although incidents such as road works and traffic accidents have been laid on to aid hijacking hijackings normally use 1 or 2 minders to cover the actual hijacker the following drills are suggested 1 if possible do not stop use driving skill to avoid the situation hijackers are more likely to wait for another vehicle rather than shoot 2 if forced to stop do not speak give the vehicle to the hijacker taking your car bag and move away 3 it may be possible to take on the hijacker at this stage bear in mind that he may be covered by gunmen and in any event wait until the hijacker is in the vehicle and at disadvantage with embussed troops the

information eefi opsec is particularly relevant to those operations where the element of surprise is vital to success it is not possible for instance to conceal major cordon and search operation but an effective opsec plan can deny the ad versary sufficient information to predict the timings and precise target of the operation thus the intended target may remain in the area instead of moving equally most patrol activity is overt but opsec will deny the adversary the knowledge of the tim ings routes and strengths of patrols to avoid confrontation 4opsec measures these fall under four broad categories adefensive measures the aim of defensive opsec measures is to counter the adversarys istar assets and abilities examples include 1 security of personnel 2 physical security locks walls wire mines and fields of fire 3 document security 4 emissions control emcon 5 camouflage and concealment including the use of civilianised military vehiclesc 9 2 issue 10 dec 98bactive measures active measures include the disruption of the adversarys istar capability by 1 increased military activity to counter surveillance by the adversary seal borders and areas 2 direct observation and disruption of known adversary locations cdeception and psychological operations psyops where eefis cannot be effectively concealed deception can be used to lead hostile forces to believe that for instance only routine activity is taking place similarly psyops can be used to influence an adversarys perceptions of security forces moves and intentions dchange of plan move timings locations and units to disorientate and confuse an adversary 5application the level of opsec appropriate for the setting will depend on the type of ootw operation in pso for instance the need for operational opsec has to be balanced with the need for transparency as the basis for trust and legitimacy in the community or theatre of operationsissue 10 dec 98 c 10 1serial c10 guidelines for tactical deception measures guidelines 1 there are seven main guidelines to utilise when planning successful deception measures at all levels of combat they are listed below these guidelines are not prescriptive and consideration should be given to ensuring that deception measures constantly reviewed in order to remain credible acentralized control deception tasks must be controlled by the headquarters of the formation within which all deception measures will be carried out bpreparation success presupposes detailed prior knowledge of an adversary and his procedures and some calculation must be made of his reaction to each activity or phase of activity ccredibility the adversary has to be capable of believing the deception story which should be within capabilities and compatible with doctrine the deception story should reinforce his expectations dcollaboration the deception story has to be fed to the recipient through 2 or more independent sources sources or personalities which could compromise elements of the deception plan should be neutralised eg by temporarily detaining the individuals concerned eflexibility in one sense flexibility is essential to take advantage of the recipients reactions both predicted and unforeseen in another sense in the event of the deceptions failure or only partial success flexibility is required either to abandon or change the plan without revealing its original aim ftiming the recipient has to be given time not only to notice interpret and react to false information but also insufficient time to analyse it so thoroughly that the deception and its purpose become apparent gsecurity deception plans must be kept secret and only disseminated to the minimum numbers on strict need to know basis changing techniques and procedures 2 there are many minor ways in which changing techniques and procedures within tactical operations can help to deceive an adversary about military activity and its target these complement and provide collateral to the more important guidelines given above and are the essence of keeping others guessing about military activity patrolling is probably the biggest single activity in any ootw activity and examples of elementary deception in patrolling activity are given below take additional numbers out on patrol eg female searchers or dog handlersissue 10 dec 98 c 10 2b use midpatrol moves by helicopter both day and night this acts as force multiplier as the same patrol can cover 2 widely separated areas c deploy on long term operation with only normal patrol equipment then have extra equipment stores brought out by helicopter or vehicle d task helicopters to carry out dummy drop offs and pick ups when in transit deploy 4 teams from the base one secures exit point for the remainder who deploy on patrol before returning to base f cross grain patrolling over the ridges road or rivers rather than moving parallel to them g carry strange equipment such as l96 rifles or additional dummy pieces of ecm equipment h deploy urban patrols by helicopter to the edge of the urban area and move back in i use green field sites for helicopter moves j deploy on night patrol in the evening without night viewing devices fitted these can then be fitted after last light 3 similar elementary tactics and precautions can be taken in other military activity which can all be designed to keep others guessing about actual intentions in the next few days aheadissue 10 dec 98 c 11 1serial c11 inspections searches and confiscations general 1 inspections searches and confiscations will normally be conducted as part of the verification process and will often be linked to demilitarisation steps or arms control inspections 2 inspections may be prearranged or at notice their aim may be monitoring veri fying or punitive inspections will tend to follow standard pattern and are likely to be expected and accepted by the faction being inspected because of this there will normally be little cause for confrontation and therefore of limited potential for trouble inspections will take place in stages and in the case of the inspection of canton ment site they may take the following form aprior warning prior warning may or may not be applicable it may be given via the chain of command to the faction and then disseminated to the site to be inspected alternatively prior notice may be given at the tactical level by pa trol briefing the site commander on the day prior to the inspection bplanning when planning the conduct of an inspection consideration has to be given to 1 comprehensive briefings on the inspection site 2 timings to ensure prompt arrival time on site report writing and depar ture formalities 3 force posture both vehicle type and dress and weapons states for in spection troops 4 communications from site to own ops room 5 interpreter acceptable ethnic origin 6 parking where vehicles will be left by inspecting troops 7 inspection equipment 8 protocols cliaison liaison can be conducted with the site commander the tone will be governed by the purpose of the inspection if necessary the inspecting troops should confirm access to the entire site and all buildings and ask the site com mander if there have been any changes to unit or weapon holdings site plans and weapon registers should be requestedissue 10 dec 98 c 11 2dinspection the time taken for the inspection will depend on the size and com plexity of the site if large then contingencies should be prepared for relief inspection team when conducting the inspection the following considerations may be required 1 actions on locked buildings or rooms 2 whether serial number check is required 3 whether vehicleapc interiors require checking 5 the inspecting team has to be capable of weapon recognition including local weapon variants 6 safety when handling old or unstable ammunition 7 safety when handling weapons that may be loaded 8 faction sensitivity to photography 9 security of inspection information and faction opsec econsolidation once the inspection has been completed the site holdings should be consolidated and any discrepancies identified once consolidated discrepancies can then be clarified with the site commander for any explana tion fconfiscationsprotests the response to any breaches or discrepancies in hold ings following an inspection will largely depend on the purpose of the inspec tion and the mandate of the military force searches 3 searches may be conducted for number of reasons such as to prove security for route area or building b to find contraband material weapons or vehicles 4 unlike inspections searches will not generally be conducted in the same formalised manner expected or accepted by those being searched as such cooperation is likely to be less if at all and the threat state to searching troops consequently higher the fact that search will often be conducted without local cooperation and maybe of an unoccupied area or building means that there could be significant threat from mines unexploded devices or ied in order to minimise the risk to searching troops cordon may be required to provide secure sanitised area and the area may re quire eod clearance prior to any search taking placeissue 10 dec 98 c 11 3confiscations 5 the ability of military force to confiscate arms vehicles or heavy weapons from particular faction will depend on the mandate under which they are operating fiscations will normally be either planned in nature or conducted onthespot planned confiscations will often be punitive in nature in response to unauthorised activity by particular faction onthespot confiscations will generally be conducted by troops who come across breach and are able to act immediately there are number of considerations to be considered when conducting confiscation whether of ve hicle weapon or ammunition confirmation of legitimate confiscation b explanation for confiscation c safe confiscation and force levels of confiscating troops d removal of weapons vehicles or ammunition appeal procedure f destruction of weapons vehicles or ammunitionissue 10 dec 98 c 12 1serial c12 nbc and toxic chemical protection background 1 servicemen are trained in protection procedures for the nbc hazard during opera tions in combat experience has indicated that some of these hazards most notably the chemical biological and radiological hazards could be present in ootw opera tions and hence the need to be properly trained in all aspects of nbc protection both for individuals and for units decontamination drills are also particularly relevant 2 many states now process industrial chemical plants or production facilities where the release of toxic chemicals could be hazard either from an industrial accident sabo tage or insurgency action the potential publicity and international attention that this could raise is bound to increase the attractiveness of such sites to an insurgent or ganisation particularly if it is owned or sponsored by the state authorities the infor mation and instructions in this serial is designed to help both commanders and indi viduals to plan for and protect themselves against this type of hazard an nbc haz ard should be dealt with by nbc drills and procedures appropriate to general war setting identification of hazardous facilities 3 some chemical plants and transportation facilities may be marked with international hazchem symbols these take the form of diamond thus these signs are colour coded with supporting words and symbols hazchem decode booklets should be issued in theatre siting of positions 4 most of the chemicals that could be released into the environment would initially appear as liquids or powders subsequently turning into vapour either through evapo ration or fire these vapours would tend initially to concentrate in lowlying areas and positions valleys ravines cellars dug outs etc and would form the strongest concentrations when confined by buildings woods tree lines or other obstructions subsequent hazard travel would be determined principally by the surface wind sub ject to overriding operational requirements troops should therefore seek to occupy positions which are at maximum elevation b on open ground c upwind of possible sources of hazards 5 to assist in planning commanders should be aware of the prevailing winds in the area however it will also be necessary to monitor continuously actual conditions and for that reason some units should be provided with wind speed and direction measuring devicesissue 10 dec 98 c 12 2personal protection 6 most of the chemical vapours of concern smell strongly and some but not all cause immediate irritation to the breathing passages and eyes some though not all might be visible to the naked eye two possible hazard substances are of particular cern because of their high toxicity and the difficulty in detecting them via the human senses each has faint smell though this could be masked by the smoke from an accompanying fire these agents are phosgene smells faintly of new mown b hydrogen cyanide smells faintly of bitter almonds 7 the standard service respirator provides full protection against both these agents immediate action ia drills 8 the defence against all the hazards which might result from an incident involving industrial chemicals is to comply with the following drill 9 note that the standard inservice chemical detectors naiad cad rvd detector papers are designed only to detect war gases not industrial emissions they are not to be used in the present situation an industrial chemical detection device the drager testkit should be issued in theatre probable scaling one per each static location and independentmobile subunittoxic hazard first aid drill if chemicalindustrial plant pipeline or roadrail tanker in your area is subjected to bombardment catches fire sustains damge in any form or if unprotected civilians birds or animals show sud den signs of physical distress immediately put on your respirator warn those around you where possible using the toxic alarm provided scrupulously avoid contact with any leak ing liquids or powders on command move upwind and uphill of the point of chemical releaseissue 10 dec 98 c 12 3whole body protection 10 unless there is immediate risk of coming into contact with chemical in liquid or pow der form it will only be necessary to use the respirator for immediate personal protec tion the nbc suit boots and gloves will not be required if however there is delay in withdrawal from the area of chemical release even briefly for instance to rescue casualties then an nbc suit should be worn note that the standard respirator and mk 4 nbc suit are designed to defend against war gases and droplets only they are not to be used in an attempt to protect against sustained exposure to industrial spillage early withdrawal from the hazard area will always be required reentry into an area of gross contamination if ordered and essential should be accomplished by personnel equipped with decontamination suits worn over the standard nbc suit decontamination suits will be issued in theatre unmasking 11 once clear of the immediate hazard area ie upwind and uphill of the point of release the local commander may order unmasking if drager test has been carried out with negative result and either b unprotected civilians birds or animals in the area are seen to be unaffected or c 2man snifftest has been completed without ill effect 12 if drager equipment is not available locally then both of the last two tests must be applied decontamination 13 persons or equipment that may have been contaminated with chemicals in liquid or powder form are to be decontaminated using copious quantities of cold soapy water these persons should then be referred for medical examination contami nated clothing is to be discarded and sealed by burial or enclosing in polythene bags in the case of contaminated equipment that has to be reused eg vehicles it must first be cleansed with copious quantities of water and then be marked with the standard gas warning symbol shown here red lettering on yellow background 20 cm 20 cm28 cmissue 10 dec 98 c 12 4thereafter it may only be operated by crews wearing full individual protection respirator nbc suit gloves and boots 14 under circumstances is contaminated clothing or equipment to be taken into any building or left upwind of any location occupied by unmasked personnel 15 respirator canisters are to be changed on command after each period of exposure discarded canisters are to be damaged beyond repair eg with hammer to pre vent inadvertent reuse first aid guidance for toxic hazards 16prevent further exposure by moving away from the danger area aim to end up on high ground that is not downwind of the hazard source the respirator should be removed but see treatment for hydrogen cyanide 17eye injury is treated by flooding with gentle stream of water for about 10 minutes saline drip is ideal 1 litre for each eye but any source of water will do remember to pull the eyelids apart and if possible get the casualty to move the eyeball during insertion of water only in this way will the eyeball be properly flushed 18skin contamination can result in burns or allow absorption of the chemical drench ing with water and the careful removal of contaminated clothing is essential all chemi cals should be regarded as hazardous unless proven otherwise and if doubt exists drench immediately soapy water helps to remove the last remnants of skin contami nation chemically burnt skin should be thoroughly washed then simply be covered with loosely applied sterile dressing taking care to handle the area as little as pos sible to reduce the risk of infection 19inhalation toxic gases are often acutely irritating to the respiratory tract this prop erty and any odour can act as warning limiting exposure in all cases removal to fresh air is essential provided the casualty is still breathing and is conscious little else need be done simply monitor his condition if breathing has stopped adminis ter artificial respiration until it resumes naturally or medical help becomes available if the casualty is unconscious he must be placed in the recovery position the casu alty should be rested as exertion may make later respiratory complications worse 20ammonia is colourless gas with pungent odour it intensely irritates the eyes respiratory tract and skin treatment consists of washing followed by despatch to further medical help 21benzine and toluene are both clear liquids with characteristic smells they irritate the eyes and respiratory tract systemic absorption can cause headache dizziness lack of coordination staggering collapse and coma treat the eye and inhalation injuries as above soapy water is best to decontaminate the skin and to reduce sys temic absorptionissue 10 dec 98 c 12 522chlorine gas irritates the eyes respiratory tract and in high concentrations the skin there is usually delay between exposure and first symptoms so early eye irritation and skin washing is essential in suspected cases followed by removal to medical help in case later respiratory complications occur 23hydrogen chloride fumes in moist air with pungent suffocating smell it causes severe eye and skin burns and irritates the respiratory tract treatment for eyes skin and inhalation injury is as above 24hydrogen cyanide vapour is invisible and has faint odour of bitter almonds or peach kernels people react differently to the same dose inside the body it prevents the cells and tissues using oxygen the first priority is to remove the casualty from the hazard decontamination after vapour exposure is not necessary mild cases may develop only headache vertigo and nausea but severe exposure will cause dramatic air hunger and death any casualty who is fully conscious and breathing normally more than 5 minutes after presumed exposure will recover and does not require treatment as cyanide is very rapidly detoxified in the body if treatment is required this should preferably be with the drug amyl nitrate the contents of one ampoule of amyl nitrate is dabbed on the face near the nose and the respirator re placed to ensure the maximum amount of its vapour is inhaled if the drug is not available administer artificial respiration while arranging for emergency evacuation to medical facility 25maleic anhydride vapour fumes are intensely irritating to the eyes and lungs the cornea of the eye may ulcerate and an asthma like condition may develop copious irrigation of the eyes is needed and the casualtys respiration should be closely moni tored 26mercury vapour when inhaled can cause headache shortness of breath tight chest cough nausea and vomiting treatment involves irrigation of the eyes and washing the skin 27methyl isocyanate vapour is highly irritant to the eyes and respiratory tract and high concentrations will irritate the skin it decomposes in water to harmless prod uct hence treatment consists of washing on burning it produces oxides of nitrogen the treatment is the same as for skin and eye contamination 28nitrous fumes oxides of nitrogen are usually redbrown in colour and in high concentrations can irritate the eyes and respiratory tract the greater risk is from respiratory failure from an asthma like condition if the casualty is conscious he should simply be observed worsening situation will require artificial respiration in many cases there are immediate respiratory effects but the casualty should be moved to medical help anyway because respiratory failure from lung cedema may occur hours later 29phosgene odour like new mown is vapour above 8c and liquid below that temperature although evaporation will occur it may cause coughing choking tight chest and nausea soon after exposure in some people although sometimesissue 10 dec 98 c 12 6symptoms do not occur for several hours many will suffer lung oedema the casu alty should be rested and taken to further medical help decontamination is not re quired except in very cold climates 30polyurethane on burning produces wide range of toxic chemicals including hy drogen cyanide oxides of nitrogen and isocyanatesc 13 1 issue 10 dec 98serial c13 protection of high risk persons 1 prominent citizens government officials members of the armed forces may all be at risk from hostile action by bombing shooting or kidnapping the scale and extent of precautionary measures have to be related to the threat but contingency plans should always be prepared in case this should increase this serial deals with the guide lines for personal conduct and for the movements of individuals and small bodies of troops or civilians outside safe areas 2assessing the threat prominent individuals are usually classified as vips within the theatre of operations threat assessments against such persons and recom mendations for their protection are the responsibility of the security staff normally military and police drawing upon information experience and regular review of the overall assessment from their own and other reliable sources 3planning protective measures the cost in terms of manpower and special equip ment of protecting high risk personnel has to be carefully balanced against the ad vantage to an adversary of successful attack security staffs are responsible to the operations staff after full consultation with all other branches likely to be involved for the planning and coordination of suitable security measures to be adopted 4protection the close protection of vips is normally carried out by trained and equipped bodyguards only the general protective arrangements that would be nec essary for those persons who are designated as vips are dealt with here some vips may have special medical parties available to them but if this is not the case then suitable medical plan should be prepared to cater for any emergency 5movement of vips by air the movement of vips into and around areas where the risk of hostile activity is high can cause additional security problems the quickest and often the safest method of moving one or more vips is by helicopter and this should always be considered in preference to road movement security measures are needed for helicopter movement and include protection of take off and landing points and clearance of booby traps or mines from them this is based on the as sumption that the risk of attack from the air is very slight although it should not be entirely discounted most hostile groups have precluded the use of air as medium in which to attack specific targets probably for practical reasons the risk normally lies in the ability of any hostile group to mount attacks on aircrafthelicopters from the ground with small deception covering the movement of vips 6altemative travel plans where weather or lack of suitable aircraft prevent move ment by air the choice for moving vip then turns on the use of small convoy or the prospect of using unmarked vehicles and suitable escort the senior security force commander should make the final decision for movement based on the prevailing security threat and then take all the subsequent precautionary measures to ensure safe travel this could include searching part of the route if necessaryc 14 1 issue 10 dec 98serial c14 individual security when off duty individual troops off duty 1 movement off duty may need to be restricted in order to avoid casualties b prevent hostages being taken by kidnapping c avoid incidents provoked with the intention of involving off duty servicemen 2 precautionary measures should be designed both to reduce the danger to off duty troops and to enable prompt action to be taken should troops be overdue in returning from any off duty activity such measures might include proper booking in and out procedures b restrictions on the size and number of parties of troops allowed out of safe areas c whether or not plain clothes are permitted or are compulsory d provision of special patrols in shopping or recreation areas guarding of sports fields etc while games are being played f the arming of all or of specified number of troops in each group troops carry ing arms should never move singly g restriction of movement to particular areas h

attention should be paid to the following points keep strict check on house keys b do not allow duplicate keys to be made without permission c if key is lost in suspicious circumstances it is better to have new lock fitted d working keys should never carry any form of written identification if keys need identifying system of colour coding could be used never leave keys under the mat or in other obvious hiding places it is better to give key to each adult member of the household f spare keys should be held in central location not normally accessible to visi tors 5doors and windows points to note are keep any possible access windows locked at night or when out b make safety check each night before retiring to ensure that doors and win dows particularly on the ground floor are properly closed and locked c after dark keep curtains or blinds closed remember to close curtains before switching on lights and to switch off lights before opening curtains in order to avoid being silhouetted at windows d when answering the door do not automatically open it try to check who is there by observing through an adjacent window or by using door viewer or entryphone if installed when answering the door do not put the hall light on do not stand behind the door when trying to ascertain who the caller is stand to one side f if you have glass panes in door consider preventing observation by the fitting of thick curtainc 14 3 issue 10 dec 98g discourage children from opening outside doors 6garden garage and outbuildings particular points are doors and windows of garages and outbuildings should be kept locked except for specific access b doors and windows of garages and outbuildings should always be checked for signs of unauthorised access before entering c bushes trees and undergrowth providing cover especially close to the house footpaths or driveways should be removed or trimmed to make it more difficult for an intruder to operate or to conceal an explosive device

handle anything suspicious call the authorities g remove or lock away anything that may be used as climbing aid especially ladders 7telephone some useful points are site your house telephone in such position that you cannot be observed through windows or doors consider an additional handset in the bedroom b if your telephone is out of order report is immediately and be especially vigilant until it has been repaired c keep list of emergency numbers and pen and paper near the telephone d other members of the household should exercise discretion when answering the telephone the caller should be asked to identify himself first informa tion should be given concerning anybodys whereabouts movements or future appointments or those of friends and colleagues unless the identity of the caller is

are vips the threat will vary with time and place it is up to each driver to ensure that heshe knows and understands what is required 2types of attack the determined assailant is extremely difficult to combat how ever for the attack to be totally successful the target vehicle needs to be encouraged into prearranged position if the driver by his security awareness alertness and preparation can keep his vehicle and occupants out of such position then the at tack will be unsuccessful the type of attack could vary considerably the following are the most likely forms of attack aexplosive devices fitted to or thrown into the vehicle or placed close to it when it is static or on the move in order to injure or kill the occupants or to immobilise the vehicle to allow kidnapping

disclosures and the handling of evidence general points 1 in recent years it has become necessary for troops to be aware of the possibility of incidents which could be regarded as war crimes the development of international judicial agencies to deal with allegations of war crimes make the issue of providing evidence an increasingly difficult and complicated process expert policing patho logical and forensic skills are essential in the gaining of evidence which could lead to successful prosecution 2 within the army the royal military police rmp are the most appropriate agent for dealing with such incidents which in certain circumstances could have important international significance rmp resources should invariably be called immediately if and when such incidents or disclosures are discovered the guidance below pro vides few basic drills and procedures to follow in such circumstances guidelines on how to deal with crime scenes 3 in general two kinds of suspected scenes can occur in the first place there are sites when bodies are present and then there are sites where destruction of property has occurred at both categories of sites certain basic common procedures are recom mended after these have been dealt with more specific actions with regard to each kind of site can be recommended aim 4 at whatever kind of site actions are taken for recording or preserving evidence the ultimate goal of these actions is to collect evidence which should be admissible in court of law at some indeterminate time in the future to large extent the basic principle that should be followed is that whatever actions are taken should be clearly documented the precise conduct of the investigative actions should be noted and recorded for use in the future if the history of the investigation is not clear it opens the way for challenging the reliability of evidence 5 in dealing with physical pieces of evidence it is imperative that an evidentiary chain be created which starts at the site of the investigation and will ultimately end in court upon production of the evidence the chain consists of clearly documenting the collection handling processing and storage of potential evidence at all stages upon submission of piece of evidence in court the precise trail of that vidence must be traceable directly back to the site of the investigation any brak in that chain may result in that piece of evidence being compromised basic procedures 6 the following actions are recommended for the recording and preservation of evi dence at all categories of sitesc 18 2 issue 11 jan 00a make photographic andor video record of the site b make detailed report of all observations at the site c make sketches and diagrams if possible d record measurements and distances where appropriate record the details of any witnesses to the events f record details of any surviving victims g record any details or information on the identity of the alleged perpetrators names descriptions details of insignia or uniforms worn 7 the particulars of those persons undertaking the above activities should be clearly documented it should be clear who these persons are in what capacity they were acting and where they can be traced 8 the safe preservation of all evidence and material that is collected until the arrival of an investigation or prosecution authority is important this entails keeping the evi dence and material in such manner that it cannot be tampered with or be contami nated essentially the evidence and material should be kept under seal until it can be handed over to the appropriate investigative or prosecution authority dead bodies 9 it is important for the investigation of scene where dead bodies are present to establish the cause of death and to identify the deceased if possible the basic common procedures describes in the previous paragraph should be undertaken with this in mind important are therefore matters such as the number and position of bodies b are the bodies manacled or blindfolded c are there any indications of battle are the bodies uniformed are they armed is there battlefield debris d can any injuries be identified the clothing on the bodies often identification can be done on the basis of the clothing f documentation found on bodies or at the site g jewellery or other items found on the body or at the sitec 18 3 issue 11 jan 00h is any physical evidence present which could indicate the cause of death bullet casings weapons 10 if possible pathologist should conduct post mortem with view to determining the cause of death and the identity of the deceased 11 in some instances the nextofkin of persons killed in the conflict may want to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones for burial or cremation once site has been found it is likely that very little time will be available to record evidence at that site especially where formal investigation not yet been sanctioned it may be very difficult to delay handing over of bodies to next of kin as it may not be possible to send off site with view to proper examination at later stage it is important that as much information and evidence as possible be collected at such sites sites of destruction 12 the main object of investigating sites of destruction is to determine the cause of the destruction and identify the perpetrators the cause of destruction is often matter of observation was the cause burning artillery fire bombing etc the data the observation is based on must be thoroughly documented along with any additional evidence that may be found which could substantiate the observationc 19 1 issue 11 jan 00serial c19 interviewing witnesses in criminal investigations general points 1 in recent years it has become necessary for troops to be aware of the possibility of incidents which could be regarded as war crimes the development of international judicial agencies to deal with allegations of war crimes make the issue of providing evidence an increasingly difficult and complicated process expert policing patho logical and forensic skills are essential in the gaining of evidence which could lead to successful prosecution 2 within the army the royal military police rmp are the most appropriate agent for dealing with such incidents which in certain circumstances could have important international significance rmp resources should invariably be called immediately if and when such incidents or disclosures are discovered the guidance below pro vides few basic drills and procedures to follow in such circumstances guidelines for the screening and interviewing of witnesses 3two phase approach during the process of identifying and recording potentially valuably evidence for use later in criminal prosecution twophase approach can be adopted initially wide screening of potential witnesses should be undertaken the purpose of this is to identify persons who can give direct firsthand evidence with regard to events that may fall within the jurisdiction of the tribunal b subsequently detailed statements should be taken by investigators from those witnesses who have been identified during the first phase as being able to give direct and relevant evidence pertaining to events relating to the investigations 4initial screening this phase is undertaken at the outset of the investigation it serves to provide the investigators with some idea of the amount of information potentially available and its quality and consistency it helps the investigators focus their attention on the events they are investigating and identify direct witnesses to relevant events apart from identifying witnesses who can give direct evidence detailed biographical information concerning those being interviewed with view to tracing persons in the future must be collected during this phase as well it should be borne in mind that it might not always be immediately apparent during this phase whether information being provided will be relevant to investigations of subsequent trial proceedings good biographical information will therefore while facilitating keep ing tabs on persons who have been identified as potential direct eyewitnesses allow the tracing of persons who are only identified as relevant witnesses at later stage 5biographical information as much biographical information as possible should be obtained from the witness this includes the following comprehensive personal detailsc 19 2 issue 11 jan 00b full details of relatives c full details regarding where the person lived during the conflict d full details of where the witness intends to go in the future identifying witnesses 6 during this first phase it is worth the effort to establish whether the individual to be interviewed is able to relate events that fall within his or her own direct knowledge or events which have been related by others hearsay 7 it should be borne in mind that persons being interviewed are likely to be traumatized by recent events that they have personally experienced but which may not necessar ily be relevant to investigations in the desire to speak out about what has been experienced or vent outrage and frustrations interviewees are prone to rely heavily on information obtained second or third hand through discussions with other per sons such information is generally not reliable with view to ultimate prosecution of criminal cases before court 8 the time spent on clearly establishing whether person is indeed direct witness to relevant events or potentially relevant events is therefore an investment in the future of the investigation and may ultimately save considerable time and resources at later stage taking statements 9 once potential witness who possesses direct information has been identified comprehensive statement should be obtained from that person the statement should include the following information in as much detail as possible full particulars of the incident or event in terms of what the witness saw felt heard experienced etc b full particulars of the time and place of the event c if relevant particulars of the weather and lighting conditions and distances or measurements diagrams or drawings by witnesses may prove useful d details of other witnesses details with view to identification of alleged perpetrators nameuniform unitdescription format for statements 10 the format of the statement would depend to large extent on what the evidentiary requirements of the tribunal ultimately responsible for trying any cases emergingc 19 3 issue 11 jan 00from any investigation where the tribunal has not been determined the format is in the discretion of the head of the investigation 11 whichever situation pertains careful consideration should be given as to whether it is necessary to require witnesses to sign or attest their statements while the imme diate advantage is the perception that the witness personally agrees with what is contained in the statement there is also disadvantage the problem is that should the witness make later statements that appear to contradict or conflict with that earlier statement this could compromise credibility of the witness in manner that could not allow for easy explanation an alternative approach would be to not require the witness to sign the statement but simply to rely on the investigators notes of the interview the draw back with such procedure is that it is less likely to be able to get witnessess statement into evidence if the witness dies or cannot be locatedissue 10 dec 98section d operations to gain the tactical initiativeissue 10 dec 98 d 1 1serial d1 intelligence considerations background 1 the successful conduct of ootw will always rely on the consent and cooperation of the populations directly involved greater priority and awareness will be needed to understand the motivation of the parties involved in the conflict and the population as whole of particular significance is an understanding of the background and devel opment of the conflict into which the military force is intervening this may well re quire close understanding of the cultural environment in which the military force will be operating and places heavy reliance on the use of human intelligence humint in operations in which the promotion of cooperation and consent is mount the use of covert intelligence sources may be perceived as indicating lack of trust which will have significant negative effect on the goodwill of the community likewise the requirement for impartial status of any military force in pso may limit the ability to conduct intelligence operations in pso the ability to deny the inevitable accusations of partiality and bias requires degree of transparency in the conduct of operations which may preclude the more traditional means of intelligence gathering in other situations this constraint may not be present in which case all the traditional means of gaining intelligence can be applied scope 2 this serial provides guidance for the acquisition of tactical intelligence in ootw this guidance should be read in conjunction with afm vol 1 part 2 battlegroup tac tics and jsp 120 manual of service intelligence volumes 1 and 3 types of intelligence 3general intelligence is classified as human intelligence humint imagery intelli gence imint and signals intelligence sigint and is described in the following paragraphs 4humint in ootw the most critical information and intelligence will come from the population and those in direct contact with them the quantity and quality of this information and intelligence will be dependent to some extent on the credibility of the military force the security that it can provide to the local population and also to the ability to understand and speak the local language every member of the military force whether on or off duty has to be aware of the overall intelligence requirements and how his interactions and observations may assist in the collection plan this awareness can and should be developed by regular briefings and debriefings asources information and intelligence may be gained from open source mate rial from the day to day interactions with the civilian population who may well make comments in more benign operation from which local attitudes public opinion and general acceptance may be assessed other information may come from deliberate observation and surveillance operations both overt and covert from local forces informants agents and interrogations and from other techni cal means such as imint and sigint sourcesissue 10 dec 98 d 1 21open source material much basic background information and intelli gence can be gained from open source information for example on the internet concerning the particular theatre of operations academic inter est and the involvement of the press and reporting about ootw will open up large amount of historical and current data that could be useful for analysis and cross reference many civilian agencies may even be pre pared to offer useful information and possibly intelligence if it is used sen sitively and for the common good 2surveillance operations observation and surveillance operations may be conducted by special or regular forces technical means or combina tion of all three these may be conducted overtly not only to gather infor mation and intelligence but also to act as deterrent against hostile or unhelpful actions covert surveillance activity can also be conducted but with central control and authorisation to avoid confliction and possible embarrassment they may be static such as permanent observation posts op or mobile patrols there are wide variety of observation and sur veillance devices available ranging from those on the open market such as video cameras to highly specialised and technical pieces of equip ment usually only issued to special forces commanders at all levels should be aware of the technologies and devices available and ensure that their subordinates are familiar with their usage 3informants if individual security cannot be guaranteed and the local popu lation has little trust in its own security forces consideration should be given to establishing an information conduit directly between the local population and military force confidential telephone numbers and post office box numbers will permit anonymous reporting but care should be taken to ensure that calls cannot be overheard by uncleared manned ex change operators 4agents and informers while all members of the military force may have role to play in the initial identification of potential agents and informers their handling will be the responsibility of specially trained personnel care has to be taken to ensure that as far as possible all such activities are co ordinated with any ongoing operations involving other security agencies whether local or from other nations 5interrogation and debriefing interrogation is used to extract information from an unwilling person debriefing is used to extract information from willing person such as an expatriate worker who is familiar with the the atre of operations the joint services intelligence organisation jsio is responsible for providing interrogators debriefers and advice on both the usual operational practice is to deploy either joint forward interrogation teams jfit or defence debriefing teams ddt to formations or units in the field as appropriate 6captured material captured documents and equipment may prove use ful source of information on some aspects of the theatre of operations andissue 10 dec 98 d 1 3all members of the military force should be made aware of their potential intelligence value where

acquisition of accurate and timely intel ligence in much the same way as other combat operations at unit level information will be analysed as part of the intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb pro cess this process should produce the intelligence which when used in conjunc tion with the commanders estimate process will allow the commander to develop his concept of operations allocate resources determine priorities and define those conditions necessary for success unit commander will usually be concerned about three specific areas aarea of intelligence responsibility the area for which he is responsible for the provision of intelligence within the means at his disposal barea of influence geographical area where he is directly capable of influenc ing events carea of intelligence interest that area in which activities may occur which could have an effect on his plans 8 the process through which intelligence and targeting data is collected produced and disseminated is known as the intelligence cycle this is dynamic and cyclical process designed to meet the commanders intelligence requirementsissue 10 dec 98 d 1 4intelligence organisation at unit level 9 the use

forces units the high quality versatility and comprehen sive training of special forces troops and their capacity to work equally well as individuals or in small groups make them particularly suitable for some types of ootw activity most nations possess special forces units many of which are specially trained for ootw tasks in addition to their duties in general and regional war possible ways of employing them should be considered at all stages of planning however they should be used to complement rather than replace conventional units further general details are contained in jsp 439 special forces operations tasks 2general one of the main characteristics of most special forces is their capacity to carry out very wide spectrum of tasks ranging from discreet advisory visits of few days through to prolonged campaign involving complete special forces units some possible tasks are outlined below atraining teams their wide range of skills and language qualifications make special forces troops particularly suitable for military assistance programmes braising and training indigenous forces the raising and training of local forces is traditional and effective task for special forces troops us special forces made significant contribution to the vietnam war in this role while the sas carried out similar task with the firqat in oman when involved in this task special forces troops are often involved in leading or advising the indigenous forces on operations but on other occasions for political reasons they may be debarred from combat cdeep penetration patrolling and surveillance skills developed for operations in regional and general war can be applied most effectively in those operations where large areas have fallen under the control of hostile forces the sas operations on the jebel akhdar in 1959 in the radfan in 19657 in borneo in 196266 and the us special forces operations against the ho chi minh trail in indochina are all examples of this activity dintelligenceinformation gathering in pso special forces can be employed to provide reports from areas which are inaccessible to other troops commanders can be provided with more accurate eye witness reports on particular situation in sensitive areas which can be of assistance in delicate negotiations at instructional of theatre levels constraints 3 the main constraints on special forces operations areissue 10 dec 98 d 2 2amanpower special forces are usually few in number casualties cannot be easily or quickly replaced because of the long selection and training process breaction time although in strategic sense special forces can react promptly and with notable flexibility tactically there can be some constraint the reason is that in spite of the high level of training of the special forces soldier the precision demanded of delicate specialist tasks requires time for careful planning and preparation moreover once deployed in the field their tactical mobility could be reduced but not curtailed satellite communications and the use of different types of transport can offset the loss of mobility because communications are usually conducted on schedules for operational reasons and because movement on foot in hostile territory and difficult terrain is inevitably slow retasking and redeployment take many hours and sometimes days however these constraints need not be too serious particularly for operations within the designated theatre cendurance once deployed the endurance of special forces is limited by what they can carry on their backs unless resupply is guaranteed in hostile environments such as the desert or mountains the provision of water could be restriction on operational flexibility this should not be serious constraint within the theatre of operations incountry particularly if caches are established or if helicopter or light aircraft can be utilised principles of employment 4high value operations special forces are precious but numerically limited asset unable to absorb large casualties due to misemployment to get the most out of them they need to be used precisely for they can achieve results out of all proportion to their size 5command special forces should be regarded as strategic level assets and be kept under the theatre commanders hand tactical control should be delegated for specific operations to the appropriate level there is sometimes tendency for special forces to proliferate in coin centralised command at the highest level helps to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort and lack of coordination however careful synchronization of special forces and main force activity is essential to avoid misunderstandings 6access to intelligence the nature of special forces tasks makes it essential for them to have access to all available relevant intelligence if operations are to stand chance of success 7mission command the employment of special forces must be tied in with the overall plan for the campaign and their commanders must be given clear directive specifying what is required and stating any limitations on methods of execution special forces must be commanded by their own officers and it is these officers who should work out and execute the detailed plan providing regular progress reports to the overall commanderissue 10 dec 98 d 2 38security success so often depends upon surprise and surprise depends upon good security the inherently discreet nature of special forces makes them the ideal military arm to exploit intelligence from sensitive sources the compromise of such sources not only entails serious loss of capability but may raise acute political difficulties the media can pose particular threat to security in counterrevolutionary operations and it is essential to work out sound public information plan with the public information staff liaison 9within the security forces it is most important that special forces establish and maintain close liaison with all other security force units and formations with respon sibilities in the same area it is likely that special forces liaison officers or ncos will be attached to the appropriate headquarters and units 10on behalf of the authorities there may be occasions when the state authorities will wish to contact third parties or perhaps those acting for an adversary this unusual form of liaison may involve special forces for this role such tasks would require the full consent of the appropriate uk authorities before such duties were undertaken d 3 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d3 controlling urban areas general 1 cities and towns are the focus of economic and political power they are especially vulnerable to street violence and other disturbances both for this reason and because complex modern urban life can be so easily and effectively disrupted with consequen tial widespread publicity 2 urban operations are likely to continue to be an important feature of ootw operations in many areas of the world and some suitable tactics needed for effective results are covered in this serial the intensity of operations 3 the intensity of operations may vary from relatively passive policy designed to curtail hostile activities so that community life can continue albeit under certain constraints to more active policy which involves military forces moving against activists and their supporters the level of intensity at which operations are conducted will be the subject of careful consideration by the appropriate authorities adversial tactics 4 the broad range of potential tactics that could be adopted by an adversary in urban areas are disrupting industry and public services by strikes and sabotage b generating widespread disturbances designed to stretch the resources of the security forces c attacks against resupply routes by damaging roads bridges rail links or air bases d provoking military forces in the hope that they may overreact and provide material for hostile propaganda fomenting interfactional strife f sniping at road blocks static posts and sentries g attacking vehicles and buildings with rockets and mortars h planting explosive devices either against specific targets or indiscriminately to cause confusion destruction and lowering of public morale i ambushing patrols and firing on helicoptersd 3 2 issue 10 dec 98j attacks against sympathetic members of the civilian population or employees 5 the urban activist makes good use of the cover afforded by the population and of the many escape routes available to him he has only to step into crowded shop or house to disappear from the view of the security forces need for alertness 6 soldier in an urban area has to be constantly alert both to avoid exposing himself as target and to protect those with him sentries observers in ops foot and mobile patrols and administrative vehicles can all present attractive targets soldiers in static posts should be covered by fire and the posts themselves properly protected all movement should be carried out with fire support available 7 troops have to also be aware of the danger of discussing anything of military nature whether it be names locations or movements of themselves their friends or their units with casual civilian acquaintances the news media 8 an urban area is attractive to the news media because action is concentrated in relatively small and easily accessible area the congregation of people ensures that there is likely to be ready audience and the material for good story and hotels and communications facilities are usually available the pressures on public relations staff are therefore considerable and every member of the forces is constantly exposed to critical appraisal of his conduct the use of force in urban areas 9 the principle of minimum necessary force applies but it has to be clearly related to the political decision on the intensity of operation clearly less force is justified in any particular circumstances where the aim is to contain hostile activity than might be justified if the aim is its complete elimination further consideration is always be the danger to innocent people which has to be avoided when weapons are operated in well populated areas deployment 10 the two broad alternatives are to base troops outside the locality in which they are to operate or to base them within their operational area the pros and cons of the two are abases outside the area 1advantages secure base can be set up where men off duty can relax and rest and possibly enjoy some recreational facilities the protection of such base can be assured with less sentries and probably less defences it is reasonably accessible to administrative transport thus resupply and d 3 3 issue 10 dec 98the repair and maintenance of equipment and transport could well be carried out on the spot 2disadvantages these are that reaction time is much greater and reserves may therefore have to be kept at short notice and possibly deployed in anticipation of their being needed because troops may be unable to return to base between patrols etc there could be demand for sending some administrative transport forward into the operational area which requires an escort and possibly provides target the journey time to and from the base eats into the period available for rest and personal administration bbases in the area 1advantages reaction can be speedy and reserves can be readily deployed in response to rather than in anticipation of events thus reducing the need to hold large body of men at relatively short notice troops become more closely identified with the area in which they live which improves their chances of getting to know the local population the detailed geography and the habits of adversary groups the ability to dominate the area is probably made easier 2disadvantages troops can rest but not relax they are constantly exposed to the danger of attack and as more men will be needed for local protection their hours on duty will be longer all administrative traffic should be escorted and this also puts strain on manpower interunit boundaries 11 an operational area will usually be allocated to units and further allocated to subunits the boundaries between areas must be clearly defined and should take account of civil police areas where boundary runs down street that street should be the responsibility of one unit only the command arrangements should be such that men of one unit can cross in hot pursuit into adjacent area belonging to another unit tactics 12general troops employed in urban operations will need to be well rehearsed and practiced in the following tactical procedures all of which are covered in some detail in other serials guarding bases and installations b road blocks and check points c control points d curfewsd 3 4 issue 10 dec 98e search operations f crowd dispersal and riot control g some elementary aspects of covert surveillance 13snipers because of the need for alertness immediate action drills can usefully be devised for such circumstances as patrol coming under fire from sniper this is always particularly difficult situation as the source of the firing is seldom obvious depending on the situation it may be more suitable and appropriate to improve force protection procedures to prevent this occurring or mount quick cordon and search operation if locations can be identified in certain circumstances snipers may be deployed to reduce the risk of this type of action 14control of movement where activists are using explosives to terrorise and disrupt the general public it will often be necessary to ban vehicle movement and parking in shopping and other public amenity areas it may also be necessary to require that all pedestrians entering such areas be searched while this may well control movement and help to canalise hostile activity it is expensive in manpower and increases public resentment at the curtailment of unimpeded movement night operations 15 night patrolling may well be conducted on foot because vehicle movement may be too obvious in quiet streets however lot of built up areas are noisy and busy at night and mobile support could be vital back up to foot patrol activity at any time street lighting may be an advantage but it does make unobtrusive patrolling difficult and the balance of advantage whether or not it is used has to depend on local circumstances helicopters 16 helicopters must hover if they are to see into narrow streets and enclosed areas which makes them vulnerable to missiles and sniper fire they are however useful for observing crowds as these form and move they can act as airborne command posts and rebroadcast stations and they can resupply and reinforce rooftop standing patrols and evacuate casualties it is now routine for helicopters to be fitted with surveillance devices such as optical and sights video cameras and night vision goggles nvg which have many applications in any role however it should be noted that the prolonged use of helicopters over localized areas particularly at night will normally produce large number of protests from the population operations below ground 17 movement below ground is usually feasible in main towns and cities it may also be possible in smaller urban and suburban areas and even in some country districts operations below ground are merely an extension of surface operations and commanders have to be aware of their scope and significance underground passages provide additional approaches and escape routes which must be taken into account in planning the defence of installations d 3 5 issue 10 dec 98underground systems 18general most underground tunnels have circular cross section so that if they carry any sort of roadway or rails there will be flat decking with space beneath it this space may be big enough for movement it will certainly provide hiding places for persons and their weapons and equipment tunnels have access points usually at both ends and at intervals along them these also allow fresh air to circulate access points or fresh air shafts may however be sealed up in disused tunnels there is always danger from an accumulation of gases and foul air in any tunnel respirators may not give protection and men working in the area should be provided with breathing apparatus 19sewers these are the most common underground systems which exist in every large urban area they may be as much as six metres in diameter and they always have frequent access points where they incorporate roadway speedy movement by quite large parties is possible 20railway tunnels there may be underground railways in some large cities or tunnels to carry surface railway into city centre or under high ground in the country passage of trains and the presence of maintenance gangs make such tunnels more hazardous to anybody attempting to pass through the area they will usually be most attractive as means of access at night or at weekends when activity will be less frequent 21pipeline subways tunnels designed to carry gas water and electricity services will often be too small to admit the passage of man but they do have frequent access points and may be as much as four feet in diameter thus allowing for slow movement along them and the opportunity to hide weapons and other stores 22cellars and connection passages cellars are commonly found in urban areas and even where connection doors and passages do not exist they can easily be constructed to make an extensive underground system this of course requires the connivance or coercion of the occupants 23disused mine workings these may occur anywhere and the access they permit will depend on the depth of the workings and the pattern and extent of the galleries 24subterranean rivers any large town built in valley will almost certainly include streams and perhaps small rivers within its boundaries these may have been enclosed creating subterranean waterways which may also be used to carry off storm water for this purpose they will have frequent access points 25road tunnels because they are usually open to the public they do not offer covered approach for clandestine movement however road tunnels below key or vulnerable points may be used in an attack on them intelligence 26 maps of all underground systems including details of accessibility should be held ind 3 6 issue 10 dec 98the surveyors or public works departments of the local government the officials responsible for the services using the tunnels and for their maintenance should be able to give valuable additional information on physical characteristics fresh air supplies volume rate and time of flow useful control and blocking points etc 27 the information gained from civil sources may need to be supplemented by recon naissance subterranean access to the area of key points should be ascertained and any pattern of use of underground systems by other individuals or groups needs to be checked denial of access 28 access can be denied either by sealing entry points or by making the system unusable the methods will vary considerably with the type of underground tunnelling and their success may depend on the ability of the military forces to maintain degree of observation some methods are sealing access points this is only possible where very occasional access is needed they should be spot welded as any other form of seal is relatively ineffective b installing remote sensors or intruder alarms which will however need mainten ance and communications and their existence will be widely known amongst employees using the tunnel system c sealing off parts of the system by erecting internal barriers these have to be substantial and probably welded into place d flushing out the system with some noxious gas possibly cs smoke at low concentration or by flooding with water parts at least of tunnel system can be neutralized permanently in this way patrolling underground passages this will always be necessary in any system eg sewers or an underground railway which cannot be sealed it has the dual advantage of discouraging unauthorized use and of enabling the security forces to become familiar with the tunnel system clearance operations 29 if hostile groups use an underground system in spite of the precautions listed above then operations may have to be mounted to clear the tunnels the main points to be noted are alocating unauthorised users comprehensive maps are essential if there is indication of where to look then the tunnel systems must be searched system atically and each part which is cleared has to be guarded every subterranean patrol must be supported by coordinated surface patrolling d 3 7 issue 10 dec 98bflushing out water noxious gases or riot control agent can be used selectively in different parts of tunnel system their aim must be to force those escaping into the open rather than into other tunnels strict control must be exercised over the use of riot control agents in confined spaces the death of person when their capture would be possible may breach the principle of minimum necessary force and has obvious disadvantages both for that reason and for intelligence and public relations csiege it may be possible to block all escape routes and then wait for cold and hunger to take effect dphysical assault this is matter of applying ordinary tactical principles in cramped and unusual environment ere specialists re diving teams are trained and available for clearance operations underground command and control 30 it will probably be more difficult to maintain close command and control of operations underground the following points should be noted and simple solutions considered acommunications radio may not work well and line may have to be laid there must be good communication between troops working underground and those on the surface borientation it is easy to lose all sense of direction when underground the need for good maps has already been stressed they should be supplemented by gyro compasses and overt signposting c iff clashes between different parties of the security forces can only be avoided by good communication and strict control equipment 31 in the cramped and closedin circumstances of operating underground the following points should be noted aarms the best weapon is probably silenced small calibre pistol modern rifle however probably overcomes the problems of additional weight and deafening noise in enclosed space blighting powerful torches must be available for all unlit areas cclothing tunnels are seldom very cold and bulky clothing can make movement clumsy and ponderous in confined space clothing must be suited to the actual underground conditions pertaining at the timed 4 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d4 controlling rural areas general 1 the characteristics of rural operations are that the adversary has to rely more on force of arms stealth or fieldcraft for his protection b rural operations are thus conducted in similar fashion to those of conventional operations c while there is the inevitable difficulty of distinguishing between neutral and hostile members of the population once hostile groups have been identified by some aggressive act they can if necessary be engaged by fire and manoeuvre with less chance of involving innocent people d the relatively open nature of the countryside in comparison to the town provides more scope for mobile operations and the use where these are justified of heavier weapons and aviation 2 rural communities are often small and isolated they are thus more vulnerable to local intimidation and are difficult to protect for this reason it is often easier for hostile control to be imposed over scattered rural community than over neighbouring town also even in areas where the authority of the elected government is recognised hostile groups may be able to operate with relative freedom because local people go in fear of intimidation and reprisal 3 this gives rise to two broad types of rural operations those where control by the authorities still exists in this case relatively minor operations can be used effectively to control if not eliminate the threat of hostile activity b those where authority has been so eroded that officials can longer move freely about their business and effective control of an area may even lie in hostile hands this calls for wider scale of operation with possibly the need for measures falling not far short of those employed in full scale military operations minor operations 4 the operational objectives of the campaign to regain overall control in the situation are described in jwp peace support operations tactics for rural operations usually involve relatively small bodies of troops although large numbers may be required if several mutually supporting operations are mounted concurrently those tactics which are particularly applicable to rural setting are described as aprotection of personnel and guarding installationsd 4 2 issue 10 dec 98bprotection of vip and small convoys and large road convoys and rail movement and picketing route cmovement planning road blocks check points and curfews dpatrols and covert surveillance esearch operations operations to regain control of an area 5general more serious situation calls for wider measures and the deployment of troops in larger units in less developed areas the hold on rural area by hostile groups may be such as to require large scale operations possibly at formation level 6controlled areas controlled area is one in which the civil administration and local police are able to work effectively hostile elements may still be able to infiltrate and isolated security incidents may occur but the forces in the area should be capable of limiting such acts 7gaining control of an area in an area where the civil administration and the local police are unable to go about their duties because hostile forces prevent this operations may have to be mounted to reintroduce control the establishing of any secure base within new area could have severe operational risk and complicated logistic support arrangements and it is better to plan for worstcase situation this would imply that there is need for artillery units air resupply casevac and some degree of fortification and dumping of supplies the long shadow of dien bien phu hangs over all such forward bases and it would be prudent to consider such possibilities carefully before secure base is established the conduct of these operations will be directly influenced by the strength and organization of the hostile activity b the support accorded to hostile forces whether this comes from outside the country or is self supporting and dependent on internal assistance c the nature of the countryside its accessibility and density of population d the forces available the operating mandate 8rural areas this serial also describes the tactical operations that could be conducted by unit suitably reinforced with the aim of imposing control in rural area which is cultivated and has some small villages and isolated farmsteads in heavily forested sparsely populated or generally underdeveloped terrain the inevitably long distances and poor communications could well require the deployment of formations of several unitsd 4 3 issue 10 dec 989land borders land border beyond which hostile forces can expect sanctuary and over which arms and explosives are smuggled introduces some additional interna tional factors which will need careful consideration before overt action is taken concept of operations 10general the aim of rural operations is to create stable conditions where the law will be respected and observed where the civil administration can function without the backing of enlarged security forces and where the civil community can move and live freely without fear this requires dual approach with the overall objective of separating the hostile element from the population these tasks are normally complementary and require careful assessment of priorities and allocation of resources but their combined purpose is to achieve and maintain the neutralisation of the hostile forces b to protect the population by denying free movement for hostile forces anywhere in the operational area 11attrition the basis of successful attrition is the contact intelligence provided by constant close surveillance of suspected persons and their supporters the sur veillance plan should be coordinated with every agency at the highest appropriate level and full use should be made of the entire range of techniques and equipment available including covert ops covert patrols and the use of attended and unattend ed surveillance devices based on the information the surveillance operations will provide security forces can maintain constant pressure on these persons by instituting specific search operations and by using selective personnel checks head checks house and area searches and screening resulting from effective surveil lance activists can be tracked down and if they are not neutralised useful evidence can be obtained to assist the authorities in bringing about their eventual prosecution 12denying free movement this task is of equal importance to that of attrition and contributes to it by sealing off the activist from his support forcing him to take risks and limiting his ability to concentrate for aggressive action it is achieved by mixture of permanent and snap road blocks and vehicle check points both in depth and covering main lines of communications and on border patrols and special measures to combat specific tactics eg train and vehicle hijacking towns have to be made secure using the normal techniques for urban operations and security force bases should themselves be employed as strong points from which offensive operations can be mounted 13approach to tasks the planning principles for rural operations are similar to those applying elsewhere but because of the necessarily greater dispersion of forces and the larger distances more emphasis has to be placed on the following aplanning and intelligence all operations should be carefully planned and controlled to make optimum use of resources and have to be based on the best information and intelligence gained of hostile tactics and habitsd 4 4 issue 10 dec 98bselectivity operations whilst being firm positive and effective have to also be selective and must be seen to be so blind swipes are waste of time in large rural area and invite ridicule cstrength and reserves mutual support is often difficult to achieve and security forces can easily become isolated operations therefore must always be mounted in sufficient strength to match the threat and in addition adequate reserves have to be maintained at all times duse of aviation patrols recent experience in land based operations has shown that good use has been made of separate aviation tactical area of operational responsibility taor being overlaid on one or more ground unit areas in the event of an incident the commander who is able to control the incident more clearly would take control this is often the aviation patrol commander who can then move resources to suitable locations in order to achieve the task or resolve the incident firm base 14tactical points all operations have to be mounted from firm base which should be at either the site of the local civil administration or an area from which it can operate initially b accessible by land over routes which can be secured without too much effort c able to provide at least helicopter landing point if not suitable air strip d easily defensible with the minimum of force preferably surrounded by natural obstacles large enough to accommodate the necessary logistic support and transport but not so large as to make local defence problem f provided with physical protection commensurate with the prevailing threat 15location such base should preferably be on the edge of an already controlled area so that its rear is secure if it has to be set up outside controlled area the requirements for local defence and securing communications will almost certainly be too big for single unit 16establishing controlled areas the methods employed to establish and expand controlled areas are known as pacification operations and are launched from the base area and forward operational bases diagram illustrating the method is at figure 1 military forces are usually employed in the early stages of such operations local paramilitary forces being moved in to consolidate and eventually take over the areas which have been cleared the armed forces are thus freed for further operationsd 4 5 issue 10 dec 98designed to continue the expansion process it will however be great asset if the paramilitary forces with their local knowledge are sufficiently competent to carry out or assist with the initial operations although some activists will undoubtedly penetrate into and through controlled areas their opportunities for doing so in strength and for achieving surprise will lessen progressively as the civilian population is won over to the governments side the defence commitment for forward operational bases will be reduced as the surrounding countryside is cleared and secured thereby freeing more troops for further operations local defence 17 the commander needs to concentrate on operations throughout the operational area the responsibility for local defence should thus be given to subunit the maximum use must be made of defence stores any vantage points overlooking the base area must be secured and any ground from which an attack might be mounted must be covered by patrols 18 it is important that the local defence of the base should be effective and economical troops tied up on this task cannot be used in pursuit of the main aim of reestablishing control over the area furthermore hostile attacks on the base even if they are unsuccessful tend to undermine public confidence in the security forces intelligence 19 closely knit rural communities are difficult to penetrate and intelligence may be very hard to come by in the early stages of operations the need to set up firm base on the edge of an already controlled area may be helpful in this context because information on the operational area may initially have to come from sources within the controlled area as soon as operations can be seen to be achieving success information should become more plentiful measures must therefore be taken to provide means for those who wish to get in touch with security forces to do so without undue risk to themselves patrolling 20general the basis of operations in hostile area is patrolling aimed at acquiring information and identifying and apprehending persons and neutralising hostile groups 21reconnaissance patrols these play major role they will need to visit all outlying communities in order both to acquire information and provide the reassurance of security force presence these patrols may have to search areas and they may need to set up snap road blocks 22fighting patrols in an area where formed groups of armed men may be countered it may be necessary to mount fighting patrols in such circumstances it will usually be sensible to impose curfew so that the security forces are not placed at disadvantaged 4 6 issue 10 dec 98base area portairfieldprovincial capitalforward operational base provincial capital jfhq legend controlled area proposed new controlled area extension to controlled area which will enventually cover the whole province notes 1 the diagram shows two methods of extending the controlled area one by establishing forward operational base and the other by the oil slick method 2 the airstrip in the forward operational base will be improved as soon as possible to the level appropriate to the needs of the base figure 1 securing new controlled areanot to scaled 4 7 issue 10 dec 9823standing patrols covert surveillance is often profitable source of information in the early stages of operations it may be difficult to establish covert ops without exposing them to unacceptable risks this is not only matter of placing mens lives in jeopardy it is also most important to deny activists any successes which may bolster their morale and call in question the efficiency of the security forces covert surveillance should therefore always be conducted under cover of both mutual support and readily available reaction force 24aviation patrols aviation patrols can be used to cover large areas and gain certain types of information quickly the use of thermal imaging cameras can gain timely information both day and night for monitoring movement and activity aviation patrols should be given tasks similar to those of reconnaissance patrols ambushes 25 ambushes are sometimes useful in rural operations if they are conducted under cover of curfew and the necessary precautions are taken to ensure that innocent people do not get involved it should be possible to set conventional style ambush designed to capture hostile persons curfew 26 curfew especially at night may be very important to rural operations movement in the countryside takes place in the open and hostile groups and individuals may need to move quite long distances to communicate assemble and take hostile action such movement can be monitored by day using standing and reconnaissance patrols and aircraft at night it will always be difficult and curfew may be essential to give the security forces some freedom of action resettlement 27 isolated hamlets and farmsteads can pose difficult problems because there will seldom be enough troops to stop their use by hostile groups or to guard them if the occupants need protecting resettlement may be the only alternative although as last resort because it is seldom popular rehousing should preferably be within reach of the land being evacuated so that farming and stocktending can go on the measures will be devised and the decisions taken by the civil authorities but it is important that security force commanders are aware of the implications and are consulted during planning safe areas 28 the purpose of organizing safe areas would be to ensure control of the population b give inhabitants security from hostile actiond 4 8 issue 10 dec 98c prevent hostile elements assisting others with supplies d permit the security forces greater freedom of action 29 initially safe areas may have to be manned by military forces but in the long term the aim should be to train and organize affairs so that the civil police are able to take over any network of safe areas in controlled area have to be supported by patrols and mobile reserves also possibly by artillery and air support 30 the following may be needed for network of safe areas within controlled area the villages should be fortified and this could include perimeter wire fire trenches with overhead cover communication trenches strong points and good fields of fire b there must be foolproof system of communication between safe areas on the one hand and mobile reserves on the other including telephone radio coloured rockets verey lights sirens aldis lamps and locally improvised methods such as drums and flares c safe areas should be placed under an overall commander d regular military forces should assist the local authorities in training suitable guards to undertake the following tasks 1 daylight patrolling of the area immediately surrounding the safe area 2 checking people entering and leaving the area 3 assisting the police in enforcing control measures 4 patrolling at night within the safe area local forces 31 rural area is often suitable for the use of local forces they will usually be deployed near their own homes where knowledge of the countryside may be an asset but where they may also be vulnerable to intimidation local forces can form useful reserves in the earlier stages of operations reserves 32 mobile reserve should always be readily available it may be deployed by helicopter if flying conditions are right and enough force can be concentrated in this way the availability of reserves and the speed with which they can be moved is vital factor which must be taken into account in planning operationsd 4 9 issue 10 dec 98extended operations 33 it may be necessary to carry out concurrent operations in areas adjacent to that which is being brought under control to relieve pressure on the latter prevent reinforcement or cut off an escape route such operations will usually have limited objective and the force committed will therefore be inserted carry out its task and then be withdrawn all within comparatively short time good intelligence of hostile activities is essential firstly to ensure that the target is worthwhile and secondly to give the maximum chance of success in an area which may be largely hostile ground is seldom of importance as any position gained will have to be evacuated when the force withdraws 34 it will be usual for separate unit or formation to carry out extended operations and coordination will be needed at higher level communication between the units which are establishing control and those which are conducting these operations must be set up special forces may be particularly suitable for this type of operation 35 extended operations are often carried out by helicopter this method of introducing the force saves time clearing route and helps achieve surprise helicopters can be very useful for reinforcing or resupplying such force evacuating casualties and persons wanted for questioning for extracting the force and for local reconnaissance control measures 36 measures within an area which has been brought under control should be designed to protect the people and enable the authorities to function account should be taken of the need to redress grievances and where necessary improve standards of living b deter hostile activity particularly subversion c encourage the provision of information d make the conduct of operations by the security forces easier 37 the decision to impose such control measures as the authorities allow will be taken by the local operations committee who should weigh carefully the possible advan tages and disadvantages of various measures the reasons for imposing control measures need to be explained and the measures discontinued if they fail to produce the desired result 38 some possible measures are banning all political activities b registration of civiliansd 4 10 issue 10 dec 98c frequent inspection at irregular intervals of identity cards permits and passes d control of food crops arms ammunition explosives drugs and medicines restrictions on civilian movement f curfews 39 in this context commander should not rule out the use of infantry support weapons artillery air power and possibly naval or marine capabilities to achieve results in any campaign the roe for the use of these weapons in pso situation would be provided by the force commander and cleared by each nation contributing troops for the operation but the tactical deployment and use of the troops concerned would be on the lines of those utilised in general war artillery for instance could be deployed to support patrolling activity ops and in larger scale operationsd 5 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d5 movement control measures planning 1general prohibitions and restrictions are always distasteful to the general public unless the need for them is clear and they are fairly and equitably applied control of civilian movement is likely to be particularly unpopular and its introduction has to be correspondingly carefully planned and any likely causes of discontent anticipated the civil authorities are responsible for imposing collective measures of control in accordance with the law the military force commander is responsible for enforcing these and should therefore be consulted in the planning stages 2the methods of controlling movement the principal methods of controlling movement considered in this serial are by road blocks and check points b control points c curfews d control of border areas 3control measures the aims of applying control measures are to improve the ability of the military forces to enforce the law thus increasing public confidence in the civil authorities and by so doing encourage more respect and acquiesence for the legitimate authority b disrupt hostile groups by making the movement of individuals more difficult and subject to check c dominate an area as deterrent to hostile action and prevent the unlawful assembly of crowds d prevent crowds which do form from being reinforced discourage the illegal movement of arms explosives medical supplies or food f seal an area with view to preventing the entry of arms explosives and other subversive material g apprehend wanted persons h record movement to detect patterns and gain information i facilitate operations by the forces of law and orderd 5 2 issue 10 dec 984manner of imposition control measures should be applied firmly but with under standing it should be made clear to the population that the inconvenience and hardship is not being inflicted with punitive intent but in order to root out dangerous elements and to provide the law abiding with security and protection whenever possible action taken and explanations given should consciously promote this attitude 5lifting of restrictions control should not be continued for longer than is necessary the lifting of controls in one area may act as an incentive to the population in another area to isolate hostile forces and trouble makers 6cooperation control measures have to be planned and directed on joint police military basis full cooperation is essential at all levels as is coordination with heads of public services such as public information medical ambulance and fire 7public reaction during planning account should be taken of likely public reaction to controls both to enable suitable information policy to be framed and to weigh the advantages of any particular measure against possibly unpopular reception any adverse reaction will always be exploited by agitators while ill conceived measures may cause the collapse of public services food distribution etc and so contribute to discontent in this context planning should take into account that the balance between the advantages and the objections is favourable it should be appreciated that short term military advantages may be cancelled out by other long term civil disadvantages b measure once adopted will actually produce the advantages claimed c measure should only be continued for as long as it produces the desired results or until it is clear that such results are unattainable d it is recognized that measures which are ineffective will probably undermine confidence in the security forces 8planning measures planning will usually be initiated by the civil authorities and it is important that the military forces are involved at an early stage it should include the need for intelligence and for good liaison by military commanders with the appropriate branches within any police force b the need to establish joint police and military headquarters where this is appropriate c the division of large area into subareas should normally coinciding with police boundaries d the allocation of forces including military and police combined patrolsd 5 3 issue 10 dec 98e the allocation and positioning of central and local reserves f establishing channels for requests for military help g the siting and control of surveillance devices including radars security lights and other aids h the reception accommodation and maintenance of troops i the preparation of any special information needed eg photographs and descriptions of wanted persons or vehicles j arrangements to keep the public informed of the situation and the preparation of pr briefs k rehearsal of control measures and the testing of any new or joint communica tions 9summary the use of control measures will invariably take place concurrently with the planning of the other types of operation in the overall campaign plans should be flexible so that military forces can always be ready to switch wholly or partly from one type of operation to another the availability of central and local reserves should help to meet this requirementd 6 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d6 road blocks and check points general points 1 road blocks and check points are means of controlling movement on roads tracks and footpaths road block is used to block or close route to vehicle andor pedestrian traffic while check points may have more limited and specific purpose usually apparent from their title as vehicle check point personnel check point etc for simplicity they are all referred to as road blocks road blocks 2 road blocks may have one or more of the following aims to maintain broad check on road movement partly to reassure the local population b to frustrate the movement of arms or explosives c to assist in the enforcement of controls of movement both of people and material d to gather information and data on suspected persons vehicles and movement types of road block 3deliberate these are of permanent or semipermanent nature and may be placed on main road perhaps near border on the outskirts of city or on the edge of controlled area they are deterrent and are unlikely to produce spectacular results 4snap snap road blocks may be deployed by ground troops already on patrol or by an arf deployed by helicopter 1ground these are used for spot checks sometimes acting on some item of intelligence initially they may achieve surprise and success but once their position is generally known in urban areas this is seldom longer than ten minutes they quickly lose their usefulness 2helicopter primarily used in rural areas eagle vehicle check points evcps may be used to dominate an area for limited period of time they can take the initiative away from hostile groups and help to suppress activity on the ground deploying vcps by helicopter has the advantages of maintaining initiative flexibility of deployment and wide area coverage the opportunities for captur ing interdicting or disrupting hostile activity is high unpredictability is essential to avoid pattern setting and maintaining the initiative 5triggered this is variation of the snap road block usually used in urban and rural areas in circumstances where it is often easy for anyone to take avoiding action on sighting block in operationd 6 2 issue 10 dec 986reactionary this is version of the snap but is used in reaction to an incident or attack in another area it may be ground or helicopter based and is useful in interdicting hostile activity following the occurrence deliberate road blocks 7 tactical guidelines for setting up deliberate road block are aconcealment the road block should be sited tactically where it cannot be seen from more than short distance away sharp bends or dips in the road provide good positions provided that the requirements of road safety are met there should be room for an approaching vehicle to take avoiding action by turning leaving the road or reversing bsecurity there must be enough troops to protect the road block particularly during the initial occupation sentries should be sited as back stops on both sides well clear of the search area to watch approaching traffic and prevent evasion where the threat of an attack on road block is likely then the block itself must have back up force road block is liable to attack by car bombs counters to this can be by stopping vehicles well short of the block by using rock ramps to shake up vehicles and caltrops to puncture tyres caltrops can also be utilised to stop suspect vehicle without troops having to open fire on the vehicle the likely road block sites must be checked against booby trapping and ambushes and pattern of use of road blocks avoided cconstruction and layout simple construction is two parallel lines of knife rests each with gap across the road approximately 50 metres apart the enclosure formed can then be used as search and administrative area within the search area there could be i separate male and female search areas 2 vehicle waiting area 3 vehicle search area 4 cage for detaining persons prior to their being handed over to the local authorities 5 road block headquarters 6 administrative area dmanning the number of troops required will depend upon the number of roads to be covered and the expected volume of traffic if persons are to be searched there must be women searchers and special accommodation should be provided the military commander should where possible be of the rank of sergeant or above at military road block whenever possible and always whend 6 3 issue 10 dec 98military powers of search arrest or control of movement are limited there should be police presence an interpreter may also be necessary esurveillance devices early warning devices to give warning of an approaching vehicle may be of value use of surveillance helicopters may assist in triggering vehicles or warning of vehicles approaching the road block fsearch equipment for searching heavy vehicles or certain types of load additional specialist search equipment may be required gcommunications external communications are essential so that revised instruc tions may be given information about wanted persons passed quickly and incidents at the road block reported internal communications within large road block can speed reaction time hlegal issues troops manning road blocks must know their powers and duties under the law with regard to search arrest and the use of force 8snap road block this is essentially simple because it must be capable of being set up and dismantled very quickly it may consist of two vehicles which are placed diagonally across road with search area between them the effectiveness of the block can be increased with rolls of dannert wire in rural area snap road block can either be emplaced by helicopter in which case an obstacle such as narrow bridge cutting or level crossing gates can usefully be improved with single coil of dannert wire or the snap road block and its covert protection force may be moved in and out on foot in both cases back up force should be readily available 9triggered road block this roadblock is particularly effective in defeating the use of convoys and scout cars by hostile groups since suspected scout car can be allowed to pass through the road block which is subsequently triggered to catch the target vehicle those manning the block must take up their positions unobtrusively after which they may either lie low waiting for selected targets in what is in essence an ambush or they can stop and search people with the minimum of fuss preferably conducting this off the side of the road out of the view of anyone approaching as with snap road blocks covert protection force and helicopterborne reaction force are required insertion will usually be on foot or by covert car from carefully sited patrol base 10covert cars covert cars with suitable communications may be used in conjunction with road blocks with the following tasks providing early information of approaching traffic this is particularly appropriate when selective search policy is in operation or if specific targets are being sought b monitoring traffic approaching or leaving the blocks and reporting suspicious activities d 6 4 issue 10 dec 98c contributing to any quick reaction force qrf 11searching vehicles the following procedure should be utilised avehicles each vehicle must be dealt with separately the selection of vehicles for searching may be governed by instructions possibly based on intelligence or it may be left to the random choice of the road block commander it will seldom be possible to examine vehicle completely at block ie including mechanical stripping and it may be necessary to escort vehicles for which such an examination is contemplated to selected workshop bsearchers at least two searchers are required for saloon car larger vehicles will need more searchers and possibly special equipment there must also be an armed sentry who must not get involved in searching his task is to protect the searchers and watch the occupants of the vehicle being searched cconduct of search except when they offer an official pass exempting them and their vehicle from search all vehicle occupants must be frisked and then made to stand clear of their vehicle but close enough to be involved should the vehicle be rigged with explosives the driver should then be made to open all doors the bonnet and boot in case of car bombs this action will also show whether the driver is familiar with the car and that he has not stolen it the owner or the driver of the vehicle must watch the whole search dcompletion of search to refute subsequent accusations of theft on completion of the search it may be necessary to get the vehicles owner to sign an indemnity certificate stating that he has suffered damage or loss during the search when this is completed the vehicle is allowed to proceed unless there is reason for detaining the vehicle or its occupants longer eevidence and arrest if search uncovers anything which may lead to legal proceedings the evidence must be recorded and troops comply correctly with the law and procedures with regard to arrest 12searching people the following general procedure should be adopted unless person produces unasked an official pass exempting him from search he must be asked to produce some means of identity and then frisked b occupants of vehicle should be asked to stand facing it with their hands resting on the roof or side the search should include the armpits the stomach inside thighs and the crotch clothing should not be patted as this might result in small flat objects being missed but should be rolled between the fingers hats and hair must also be checked c women are only to be searched by female searcher particular attention should be paid to the possibility of objects being concealed in the haird 6 5 issue 10 dec 9813identity documents an identity document may be an identity card driving licence or some other official document issued by government department or firm in times of social unrest many people will probably ensure that they have some means of identification and those who have official status may have to rely on personal correspondence etc documents should always be checked against each other where there are several and against any list of wanted persons questions should be asked about details on the documents such as what is your address when and where did you license your car this depends on the language skills of the soldier or the use of an interpreter the following points may be helpful when checking documents aphotograph compare the photograph on the card with the individual when making such comparison try to recreate the conditions under which the photograph was originally taken eg if photograph was taken hatless then ask the person to remove his or her hat woman may have changed her hair style it may help to place finger across the photograph to hide the hair and compare only the features check of age will also assist in making the comparison bstamp careful examination of the stamp across the corner of the photograph will show whether the original photograph has been removed and another substituted the authenticity of the stamp itself should also be checked cfinger prints positive identification can only be made by experts for this reason mark indicating thumb print must in the normal course of events be accepted however if for any reason suspicion has been aroused it may be legally permissible to detain suspect for further questioning and for finger print check to be carried out by the police 14action on vacating road block before abandoning the position of snap road block search should be carried out alongside the road in each direction to the limit of visibility this should reveal any arms or other items which may have been discarded by their carriers on seeing the road block control points 15general control points are set up by the security forces to provide military presence on the ground in populated area where disturbances have taken or may take place 16 the tasks of control point are to control all vehicles and pedestrian traffic so that large crowds cannot assemble known offenders can be arrested and curfews can be enforced b to dominate the area of responsibility around the control point this includes maintaining law and order by local patrolling with view to preventing damage to property or injury to persons and dispersing groups of people before they have time to assemble into crowd c monitor or prevent the movement of contraband where applicabled 6 6 issue 10 dec 9817 the legal powers of troops in connection with control points must be clearly defined and observed it is particularly important that the legal requirement should be anticipated at an early stage in planning as the need for control points may arise with little warning 18composition control point should normally be manned by at least platoon but the strength required must be related to the number of roads to be controlled and the anticipated traffic the minimum scale should be acontrol point headquarters commander signaller and runner bbarrier sentries one nco for each road or lane of traffic blocked and one sentry for each barrier ccovering party two men covering each set of barrier sentries dstanding patrol where possible an op should be manned on nearby roof top esearchers the number can only be decided in relation to the policy on searching and the amount of traffic and pedestrians expected female searchers will be needed if women are to be searched freliefs reliefs are required for all the above reserve will also be required to carry out patrolling and crowd dispersal when necessary and this may be made up from the reliefs 19use of civil authorities civil police at military control points are employed to exercise their special powers of search arrest and seizure where the powers of the military forces are insufficient b take into police custody any persons arrested or property seized by the troops c act generally as link with the population d act as interpreters 20layout the layout of every control point is likely to vary slightly but all control points should cover the following requirements abarriers each road or traffic lane should have two barriers one at the beginning and one at the end of the control point the barriers should be made of knife rests and dannert wire and should cover the width of the road or traffic lane so that vehicle has to do an s turn to pass red hurricane lamps should be hung on the end of knife rests nearest the centre of the road at night stop signs in the local language if necessary should be placed ahead of all barriers and must be illuminated at night vehicles should initially be stopped outside the control point in case they contain bombd 6 7 issue 10 dec 98bcontrol point headquarters the headquarters and covering party should be sited centrally where they can see and effectively control the barrier sentries the headquarters should be constructed of sandbags and other suitable materials up to at least 15 metres from the ground to give protection against missiles if possible it should also be protected from sun and rain reserve of riot control agent should be held cstanding patrol control point should be covered by standing patrol ideally on nearby rooftop to watch for hostile activity the patrol may be armed with riot control agent and an automatic weapon the use of the latter must always be governed by the need for minimum necessary force and firing other than single shots will be unusual drest and administrative area this should be as close as possible to the control point and should be reasonably secure and out of public view this will ensure that soldiers only appear to the public when smart and alert this instils public confidence and respect etransport the need for transport will depend on the role and location of the control point in an open area vehicle patrols may be needed and in some situations local reinforcement plan could require rapid redeployment from one control point to another there may also be need for administrative transport and vehicles to chase vehicle which has evaded the check point 21method of operation control points should be operated in the following manner the commander or his second in command must be present at all times b all vehicles and pedestrians should be channelled through the barriers and checked in accordance with current orders checking will be carried out within the barriers by the civil police if available otherwise by barrier sentries or ncos c the control point commander should ensure that the area around his control point is patrolled the exact area of responsibility will depend on the type of area and the men he has available d the commander must remember that the manning of his control point is his primary task and if an incident occurs in his area with which he cannot deal effectively he must call for reinforcements the commander must maintain log of all important events and incidents f the commander must carefully assess the effect of his controls for example during the rush hour however efficient the control point crowd of impatient civilians or jam of cars and lorries can quickly build up and precipitate the very situation that the control point is designed to prevent 22orders the commander should be issued with written orders defining his responsi bilities and particularly the degree of force which may legally be employed including orders for opening fired 6 8 issue 10 dec

deploy blocking equipment if needed c the patrol is mutually supported d the area is thoroughly checked before use insertion drill 2 assuming that the patrol is of at least 12 men the insertion drill could be as follows patrol goes firm ideally with the commander watching the area of the road block the patrol commander sites the road party and cutoffs and carries out visual check of the area using binocularssusat he can then make an appreciation as to whether to put all teams on the road or have one in watch location or one conducting satellite patrol activity b the patrol commanders team which

small area such as town centre housing estate or particular series of streets the size of the area and the duration of time for which curfew is imposed will depend on the reasons for it 2 curfews may be needed to assist the security forces in reestablishing control after rioting and serious disturbances have taken place by restricting civil movement and allowing tempers to cool b prevent civil movement in selected area while search or the investigation of an incident is carried out c disrupt hostile groups by making movement of individuals difficult d allow the security forces greater freedom of operation 3 curfew should not be imposed on punitive grounds or as threat to impress on the civil population the inconvenience and hardship that could arise should hostile activities take place the population will usually obey curfew but boredom shortage of food or even the feeling that the curfew is being unfairly or ineffectively enforced can lead to curfew breaking and consequential incidents good planning based on proper understanding of local conditions is essential guidance for planning curfews 4planning the civil authorities are responsible for imposing curfew but as the need is usually military one the security forces should always be consulted especially as they will have to enforce it curfew always absorbs large numbers of police and troops if it is to be effective and an ineffective curfew is much worse than curfew at all 5area this must be clearly defined in towns where houses are close together and streets narrow it may be necessary to either enlarge the area under curfew until clearly defined perimeter is achieved or to prohibit movement into the street which constitutes the boundary the integrity of the perimeter of the curfew area is essential if full control is to be exercised the civil authorities in conjunction with the security forces must decide on the curfew area 6timing curfew can be imposed for short periods without hardship if it is unduly prolonged it can cause grave difficulties to innocent civilians study of the pattern of local conditions can be helpful in arriving at timings which are both effective and workable it will be useful to knowd 8 2 issue 10 dec 98a the time that the inhabitants normally get up go to work and return home b the time that shops normally open and close c the time it will take to implement the curfew after the public announcement has been made 7security if curfew is imposed unexpectedly hostile groups may be caught unprepared without time to adjust their plans and these and their courier services may be disrupted an unpredicted curfew swiftly imposed also avoids undesirable street gatherings where agitators may try to influence people to break the curfew security of planning is therefore essential 8sequence of events the likely sequence of events is the decision to impose curfew is made by the civil authorities in consultation with the police and military commanders b plans are made to cover timings area boundaries troops required and administrative arrangements c local representative of the police and military make detailed plans overt reconnaissance of the area should be avoided d cordon parties road and static patrols move rapidly into position the curfew and subsequent control instructions are announced by the appropri ate means eg press radio siren and police announcements by loud hailer helicopters and light aircraft can also be used as voice aircraft to make public announcements 9imposing curfew the existing security force headquarters should control curfew coordinating all aspects affecting the civil authorities the military and the police if joint headquarters exists one should be set up 10curfew passes the civil administration and the police are normally responsible for the issue of passes certain people such as doctors nurses and workers in essential services need to be able to move about more or less freely and pass system which can be easily understood by troops should be devised by the civil authorities well in advance 11patrols mobile patrols and static posts will be required to establish the curfew once it is operating the number of static posts can be reduced and the curfew maintained mainly by mobile patrols standing patrols on rooftops are usually necessary to watch for illegal movement between houses and to help cover street patrols 12surveillance surveillance devices will assist in the enforcement of the curfew and will reduce the number of static postsd 8 3 issue 10 dec 9813control of visiting vehicles and personnel when curfew is imposed on an area it will usually trap number of people who are normally resident outside it system of removing and checking such people must be prepared they cannot of course be allowed reentry into the area during the curfew 14curfew breakers the action to be taken by troops against curfew breakers must be clearly laid down they will normally be arrested searched and handed over to the civil police care being taken to ensure that evidence of their offence and arrest is recorded for subsequent production in court 15police duties the police are responsible for announcing the curfew to the general public b the issue of any curfew passes c the disposal of all curfew breakers including any that may be arrested by troops d providing police patrols in conjunction with the military forces in the operational area 16administrative issues the civil authorities are responsible for devising measures to meet administrative difficulties which will arise if curfew is imposed for long period but military help may be needed the sort of problems which could arise are lack of water in houses b shortage of food in shops c the need to purchase essential food d essential food deliveries in areas with shops clearance of refuse from houses and streets f fuel supplies for lighting cooking and heating houses g treatment of the sick and maternity cases h care of animals i lack of indoor sanitation j pavement sleepersd 9 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d9 control of border areas general 1 hostile forces often attract support from outside the country either from international organizations or from other countries willing to embarrass the authorities all external support of men and material must cross either land or sea borders and if there is an adjacent land frontier hostile operations may be mounted across it from the sanctuary of foreign soil all states have the machinery to impose some degree of frontier control and this may provide suitable basis on which to build border security border operations generally take place away from urban areas and the operating tactics for rural areas should generally be applied most of the problems which arise are influenced by local conditions land borders 2 land borders are seldom clearly defined unless marked by river the frontier may pass through dense forest chain of hills or mountains or cultivated farm land where there is physical barrier herdsmen foresters and farmers may often cross the border to carry on their daily work it will seldom be possible to seal such frontiers entirely either with physical barrier or with troops however if hostile groups are to be denied the supplies and support which they can obtain in the neighbouring territory then steps must be taken to control cross border movement on the main lines of communication the gaps should be covered by observation and patrolling 3 the desired effect is to canalize movement through areas of government choosing this in combination with good intelligence gained by constant surveillance could enable the security forces to impose control inflict casualties take prisoners intercept supplies or at worst deny access without the cooperation of security forces on the other side of the border such measures while essential will seldom show spectacular results 4 policy of patrolling is usually necessary in border area the intensity of the patrolling being related to the threat the adoption of other measures will depend on the political and security situation and the consequential degree of restriction on civil movement restrictions on civil movement 5 when in the early stages of operations there are restrictions on civil movement in frontier areas the two main problems are detection and identification if the area is sparsely populated detection of abnormal movement will be relatively easy and remote sensors night vision devices and tracker dogs can all help interception and subsequent identification may be less simple as sparsely populated area is likely to be rough and wild with few roads by day an intercept force can be deployed swiftly by helicopter by night successful interception may require an unrealistic number of patrols in well populated area with unrestricted civil movement successful detection and interception of illegal frontier crossers will depend largely on good intelligenced 9 2 issue 10 dec 986 when operations have reached the stage where the government recognizes the necessity of restricting the movement of civilians in frontier areas the task of the security forces can be made easier the types of restriction which may be helpful are imposing curfew b establishing prohibited zone which is either cleared of all inhabitants or made accessible only to those with special passes other factors 7barriers movement can be inhibited by various barriers which may be lethal or non lethal ablocked roads movement by vehicles in areas away from official crossing points can be made difficult by blowing bridges and culverts cratering roads and erecting obstacles an obstacle not covered by observation is as always of limited effectiveness bfencing barbed wire fencing will deter innocent crossers but it will not withstand determined attempt to breach it its main use is therefore to reduce the number of investigations which have to be made cut fence can of course be used to lure investigators into an ambush and this may influence the siting of any artificial barrier csurveillance devices an infrared fence or seismic intrusion alarm is not deterrent until it becomes known that crossing in certain areas covered by these devices is hazardous leading to strong probability of arrest dminefields lethal barriers such as antitank minefields and high voltage electric fences will seldom be feasible until the situation has deteriorated to something close to open warfare they usually require some sort of prohibited zone and should be supported by sensors to detect and locate attempts at breaching 8artificial barriers man made physical barrier should always be erected within friendly territory so that incursions detected by sensors and attempts to breach the barrier take place on ground within the authority of the government where the security forces have freedom of action 9curfew the main effect of curfew is the removal of the difficulty of identifying innocent from hostile people since anyone breaking the curfew may be assumed to be hostile however measures for detection followed by investigation are still necessary it will not usually be possible to make big reduction in the effort put into detection since 100 per cent coverage of the border must still be the aim however the number of intruders will probably be reduced and therefore the reaction force may also be able to be reduced in sized 9 3 issue 10 dec 9810prohibited areas establishing prohibited frontier zone may have political advantages over the often emotive imposition of curfew the degree of prohibition can be varied and may depend on the nature of the frontier any natural or man made physical barriers and the nature of the threat the more freedom of action needed by the security forces the more necessary will it be to ensure that casualties to civilians are avoided by keeping them out of the way the surveillance requirement remains the same but the number of investigations should be reduced 11force requirements with sensor based surveillance system backed by mobile reaction force and in the absence of any civil population stretches of border area covered by surveillance force backed up by reaction force at immediate readiness could provide reasonable degree of success against single infiltration attempt if multiple attempts were made or if there was significant civilian movement in the area the reaction force might need to be increased ratio of surveillance to reaction forces of between one to two and one to six can be achieved depending on the terrain conditions 12cross border operations if hostile groups are operating from sanctuaries outside the country it will be desirable for the governments of the countries concerned to discuss mutual arrangements which may include cross border operations it is always better to apprehend hostile incursion force before they escape over the border and the reaction force should be poised to achieve this if artillery mortar or small arms fire is mounted from across the border it will seldom be possible to return this and passive measures such as the use of smoke may be necessary to cover withdrawal or conceal the target 13coastlines the open sea beyond coastline provides near equivalent of prohibited frontier zone on land and comparatively simple controls within territorial waters can simplify the problem of identification the degree of physical protection which is necessary depends on the ease with which landings can be made rugged coastline with inaccessible cliffs and treacherous offshore currents needs less protection than easily approached beaches with good exits physical protection of an indented coastline is difficult and use must be made of surveillance devices and reconnaissance the four layers of coastal defence are long range airborne surveillance b offshore seaborne surveillance c inshore seaborne surveillance and intercept measures d land based surveillance and intercept measures 14intelligence customs and coastguard services will have studied the problems of countering illegal entry by sea and their experience may provide useful basis for intelligence operationsd 9 4 issue 10 dec 9815surveillance long range surveillance carried out by maritime aircraft and naval craft can be used to alert inshore and land intercept forces identification may be problem at sea and government policy on questioning and searching foreign ships within territorial waters may be needed inshore surveillance by helicopters inshore vessels land based radar and lookout stations should be deployed to cover all likely approaches 16interception interception of unidentified craft or of vessels whose mission or cargo is suspect can be made at sea or on land civil police coastguards or their equivalent may need to be embarked in inshore craft or accompany detachments on land for this purpose 17command and control coastal defence should be under the command of one headquarters it should include elements from naval forces air forces civil police including maritime police and those land forces given the tasks of surveillance and intercept communications are essential between all elements engaged in surveil lance so that targets acquired far out at sea can be passed successively to inshore craft coastal surveillance and intercept forces it may be necessary to coordinate not only the government and military agencies but also several different civil agencies which may all have part to play but who are not always accustomed to working together civil agencies such as port and river authorities customs coastguards civil police in coastal areas and fishery authorities may all need to be represented in the coastal command systemd 10 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d10 search operations the concept of search operations 1general this serial deals primarily with search operations but also covers in separate sections the tactics of cordoning an area and the use of snatch parties in ootw operations the nature and character of cordoning particular areas has undergone radical change tactics technical developments and lack of sufficient troops has seen to this nevertheless it is still appropriate to consider the tactical usefulness of cordons at suitable times the nomination of snatch parties who are free from the task in hand ready to move rapidly to arrest individuals or to provide reserve in case of the unexpected is always sensible 2concept searches are one of the opportunities on which the security forces have the initiative and can decide when where and how to act they therefore play an important part in operations constant harassment of hostile persons by searching forces them to move arms ammunition explosives and other devices so that they are placed at greater risk of discovery the concept behind search operations has developed quite extensively over the years to take account of the clear evidence that hostile groups have become more sophisticated in their ability to hide and conceal weapons and equipment and this requires more complicated search response b the effectiveness of search operations has risen markedly and can play significant role in the capture of hostile weapons and equipment belonging to hostile groups 3aim the aim of search operations is to protect potential targets b gain intelligence and information c deprive hostile groups of their resources d gain evidence to assist subsequent prosecution 4objectives such operations are usually carried out jointly by military and police forces with view to the capture of wanted persons arms radio transmitters supplies explosives or documents b the disruption of hostile activities such as bomb making or weapon manufac ture c eliminating the influence of hostile groups in specific locality particularly with regard to expanding controlled aread 10 2 issue 10 dec 985area of operations ao before any formal search procedures can be established for specific theatre the ao needs to be assessed the detailed procedures will greatly depend on the prevailing conditions in general this depends on whether the environment is benign or hostile and the technical threat the following factors will need to be assessed civil or military primacy b the level of popular opposition to the forces of law and order c the level of popular support for active opposition d the level of technical expertise and degree of extremism possessed by the hostile groups including their aims and methods access to manufactured or home made arms and other combat materials f the civil authorities ability to handle crisis and difficult situations during periods of tension or disturbance particularly with regard to casualties planning search operations 6preliminary work searches require great deal of preliminary discussion and liaison with other units and the success of most searches is dependent upon meticulous planning this is to ensure that the operation is based on good intelligence b adequate numbers of search teams and equipment are deployed c re teams can be alerted if it is believed the target is booby trapped d the search is sprung on the target at the most opportune moment adequate cordon or protection troops are available to prevent the escape of insurgents and to protect the searchers from attack or distraction 7avoiding rigid procedures it should be assumed that every search made will be observed by hostile eyes and the techniques and procedures used will be noted if searches are conducted according to rigid pattern traps will be set to catch those who use that pattern it is therefore most important that every action from establishing cordon to the arrival of the search teams and their method of searching in the target area be considered from this point of view varying procedures and drills is useful but some procedures cannot and should not be varied to ensure consistency and possible safety error 8search coordinators and search advisors search coordinator is normally an officer conducting staff type function that can be performed at any staff level aboved 10 3 issue 10 dec 98squadron search advisor has an operational function in the conduct of search he is usually an experienced officer warrant officer or senior nco and should be appointed in all major units and formations as the commanders adviser on search matters 9planning factors the main planning factors to cover when search operations are considered are as follows athe objective of the operation once this has been decided it needs to be set in context with other military operations planned in the same time frame this factor will usually provide the sort of timeduration of operation that can be allowed for the search operation the political and social effects of any intended search operation which could be considerable should be addressed when considering the oe bthe need to know caveat this caveat is probably the key to any successful search operation commanders and their staffs should be introduced to the plan according to carefully calculated planning sequence ca deception plan the need for deception plan to protect sources or to achieve operational surprise it may well be necessary to conceal the true nature of any search operation or its timing from some of those taking part as part of the need to know caveat dintelligence where good intelligence is available this should be the main reason for search operation where this is not possible or difficult to acquire then other intelligence assessment tools could be utilised etasking clear direction covering the operational legal and political consider ations of any search operation have to be established before any searching commences ftraining the ao will probably dictate the requirements for training and of the type of specialists needed for particular tasks if the task is beyond unit resources then re advice and support should be obtained gsystematic work pattern this applies both to the planning of search operations as well as to the actual conduct of the search the approach to any search operation has to be careful detailed and completely systematic to avoid error or oversight hthoroughness of work as the title implies search operations require high level of thoroughness before during and on completion of any task iequipment as with training re advice should be obtained on equipment and resources availabled 10 4 issue 10 dec 98the sequence of planning search 10general points having covered the main factors which affect the overall planning of search operation it will be necessary to consider in logical sequence the more detailed planning necessary to ensure that all points are covered these are aanticipation of hostile action every searcher needs to know the methods of disguising and hiding objects by hostile groups in order to anticipate their actions and methods he needs to assess constantly the adversarys aim in order to pre empt his actions in addition commander should also determine the threat faced by the soldiers carrying out the operation and whether by his action they have become the targets this should also include consideration of the effect of the operation on the local population and whether any action may antagonise them unnecessarily bisolation of the target area here the use of cordon or other form of protection party will have to be decided on account should any person be allowed in or out of search area once the operation has started ccoordination of action all actions must be coordinated to ensure systematic and integrated search operation this should include the following 1 the interaction of members within search team and between different teams 2 the coordination between search teams and other troops the ied dis posal operator and the local authorities dminimising risks normally the most dangerous part of search is on or soon after arrival in the area if activists are surprised or disturbed precipitate and violent action may ensue rapidly similarly if civilians are involved there may be some attempt to distract or delay the start of search operations once military control of the target area has been established then risks occur if searches move out of sequence or if sudden find leads to loss or neglect of drills and procedures emaintenance of records these are invaluable in the case of finds and the provision of evidence in subsequent prosecutions and more importantly in providing the intelligence staff with more information about the area and the way any hostile groups operate which can be recorded and used in future opera tions 11the staffing sequence the sequence for search operation is

military activity details of all types of search techniques and procedures are contained in military engineering vol ii pamphlet 6a counter terrorist search while the pamphlet is designed primarily for use in uk the search drills and procedures apply worldwide there is much useful information and guidance on wide variety of topics directly related to search operations the procedures for search operations are divided into the six categories category may consist of one procedure or series of related procedures the application of which depends on the circumstances of the search whether offensive or defensive perceived threat time available and the environment at search locations care must also be taken to ensure that searches do not become stereotyped so that the others do not learn what to expect and thus cannot take the appropriate evading action or counter response the categories of search are search of persons b search of occupied buildingsd 11 2 issue 10 dec 98c search of unoccupied buildings d search of areas search of vehicles f search of routes 3supplementary search procedures these six categories of standard procedures are supported by number of supplementary procedures which cover action on find which is common to several procedures high risk search and venue search which are covered in serial d19 4guidelines the following points refer to greater or lesser extent to all the categories mentioned above aequipment many equipments are available to assist with search operations equipments are mentioned by types in the procedures eg metal detectors explosive vapour detectors when equipment is used it should be noted that 1 equipment is not infallible and is only an aid to search where possible two or more equipments based on different technologies should be used 2 when explosive vapour and particle detecting equipment is used ideally it should be used first and the conditions disturbed as little as possible before it is used if applicable air circulation systems should be switched off and windows and doors closed to prevent dispersion of the vapour it should be used before dogs and handlers are deployed as they may be contaminated with explosives bdogs search dogs may be used to assist with the search in any of the procedures csmoking smoking should not be permitted while searching is in progress especially where vapour detectors are being used 5safety safety is paramount in search operations the points mentioned below must be reflected in all orders for search operations and other more specific aspects are covered with the relevant procedure in addition troops should be aware of the hazards that may exist in different search environments and take the appropriate precautions in outline these are do not take risks to save time equipment or property b always be alert for the unusual and be suspicious c keep uptodate with equipments used by hostile groups and always be prepared for something newd 11 3 issue 10 dec 98d do not search at night except in well lit buildings unless there are strong operational reasons for so doing always assume that suspicious objects are booby trapped do not touch anything suspicious if it has to be moved check it is not booby trapped and move it by remote means f do not set patterns vary route incident control point icp locations and timings where possible vary procedures g do not allow movement to be channelled as the threat from booby traps is greater if an obvious route is used if there is choice of route take great care and clear the route before it is used h apply the procedures correctly obey safety instructions particularly safety distances i ensure that soak times are properly assessed dependant on the local threat and specialist advice and applied j exercise care in adverse conditions eg bad weather or terrain k tired searchers should not be used unless absolutely necessary lapses in concentration are dangerous and unacceptable l heed the specialist advice of explosives officers m if there is radio controlled ied threat heed the advice of the ecm operators use the correct equipments and apply the correct safety distances action after find 6general it is very important that finds are handled correctly by searchers and any other members of the security forces mishandling can cause the loss of forensic evidence which may result in guilty persons escaping justice and also valuable intelligence wherever possible civil or military police should handle finds and record evidence however this is not always possible and all ranks should be taught the correct procedure 7guiding factors the factors which govern the actions to be taken when find is made are that the safety of the security forces and the civil population is paramount b that the integrity of the evidence should be preserved this entails two essential features 1 continuity which must be preserved so that it can be proven that the exhibit produced as evidence in court is the evidence that was foundd 11 4 issue 10 dec 982 forensic evidence which must be preserved and not contaminated c that where possible the fact that find has been made should be concealed from the insurgents 8sequence of action the ideal manner in which to handle find is given in chapter 6 and 7 of military engineering vol ii pamphlet 6a counter terrorist search if this is not practicable to conduct then well established sequence of actions to follow are given below the find must not be touched the team leader notes details in his log b whenever possible civil or military police are to be called and an eod team alerted to deal with find of explosives explosive substances or accessories c before anyone approaches or touches the find the team leader must visually check it for booby traps if in any doubt an eod team should be called d if the civil or military police are not available the team should act as follows 1 the team leader nominates one man to handle the find and record the evidence 2 if possible the nominated person photographs it in situ he also sketches the location of the find 3 the circumstances of the find are then recorded address location date time who found it description of find and other relevant details 4 after the find has been checked for booby traps it is removed taking great care not to destroy any latent finger prints weapons must not be made safe and must therefore be handled as if loaded 5 after removal the find should be labelled and placed in polythene bag or other suitable container which is then sealed and labelled 6 the person nominated to record the evidence must retain possession of the find until it can be handed over to the civil or military police this is necessary to preserve the chain of evidence so necessary for legal finding and conviction the civil or military police should arrest those individuals who possess the proscribed articles or are involved in hiding them 9documentation during every search log must be maintained of all actions taken by the search team it must be written up as events occur so that it will be valid evidence in any subsequent prosecution the original log must be retained by the unit it may be difficult to avoid doing some damage especially to vehicles or buildingsd 11 5 issue 10 dec 98where ingenious hiding places can be devised whenever possible such damage should be restored by the search team and search damage claim form must be completed at the conclusion of the search further details are in chapter 6 to pamphlet 6a counter terrorist search 10disposal of items found in searches the principles and procedures for disposal of items found in searches are based on stanag 2084 which covers the handling and reporting of captured enemy equipment and documents these may be varied by local regulations and the requirements of forensic evidence in outline these are that all documents likely to be of intelligence value which are found on suspect or in house or vehicle should be placed in suitable container such as polythene bag and clearly identified with the suspect building or vehicle concerned they must also be marked with the time date and place of discovery and there should be brief note on the circumstances in which they were found for example during search of public gardens b items found on suspects often provide valuable talking points for further use in questioning suspects and therefore particular care must be taken to ensure that anything of interest other than weapons or equipment accompanies the suspect when they are handed over to the police or other civil authorities c weapons and equipment must also be labelled with the place time date and circumstances of capture and forwarded to the nearest formation intelligence staff without delay if individual suspects can be associated with weapons and equipment the civil authorities should be informed d large quantities of documents or heavy machinery such as printing presses which are too heavy or large to be moved easily by the local resources of search parties should be guarded in situ until arrangements can be made by the intelligence staff for them to be removed or destroyedissue 10 dec 98 d 12 1serial d12 search of persons introduction 1 the specific authority for the security forces to search and perhaps detain persons in the lawful course of their military duties would be necessary in most ootw situations it is worth noting that in northern ireland there are specific provisions made for the powers of search and arrest which are covered in the relevant sections of the emergency powers act 2 the search of person is legally justified when there is some legal power held by the searcher so to do searches must only be conducted in accordance with the appropriate orders persons who conduct searches must be aware of the appropriate legislation the sort of powers usually available for persons to be searched are as follows as routine where they voluntarily enter building or area and the search is condition of entry b at security or post incident check point c when reasonable grounds for suspicion exist that the person is in possession of stolen or prohibited articles d when person is taken into custody as precautionary measure whilst person is in custody 3 great care must be taken when carrying out body searches as there is the inherent risk of alleged brutality assault or unethical treatment hostile persons and their sympathizers often try to exploit such situations to discredit the military forces furthermore as most people searched are innocent the military forces must search in manner which demonstrates their professionalism and courtesy these factors make it imperative that searches of people are only conducted in circumstances which can be legally justified b carried out to procedures which minimise the risk of fabricated accusations against the military forces categories of search 4types of search there are two categories of search for persons these are quick body search in the public eye b detailed body search out of the public eyeissue 10 dec 98 d 12 25quick body search the quick body search is normally carried out when dealing with large number of people and detailed body search is not warranted b as preliminary to detailed body search when the immediate requirement is to detect anything which could be used to harm the searcher the person being searched or anyone else c as preliminary to detailed body search when the immediate requirement is to secure any evidential material which could be jettisoned or destroyed before the detailed search 6procedure the search should be conducted as described below if possible searchers should work in pairs with one person doing the physical searching and the other observing both the searcher and the subject the second person may act as cover for the first other points are that the searcher should not stand directly in front or behind the subject so as to avoid being kicked kneed or butted with the head b the searcher should not be distracted or intimidated and should avoid eye contact with the subject c the observer should watch for nonverbal communications eg increased nervousness or tension d when weapons are being used the searcher should avoid crossing the line of fire of the covering man ideally the subject should be standing with legs slightly apart and arms extended 30o sideways do not spreadeagle the subject against wall later it may be necessary to swab the subjects hands for forensic traces and opportunity should be given for any remains to be rubbed off f the search should be conducted quickly in systematic way from head to foot down one side and up the other covering all parts of the body front and back attention should be paid to pockets and waist bands where weapons may be at hand care must also be taken to search quickly all external body depressions such as the small of the back armpits crutch areas and closed hands g the searcher should never pat the subject but use stroking squeezing movement and thus feel for foreign objects through clothing when searching limbs both hands are used with thumbs and index fingers touching h any baggage or removed clothing attributable to the subject must also be searched such items should be treated with respect i the use of equipment such as hand or archway metal detectors explosive and baggage xray machines can be an assistance at times especially when processing large numbers of people at access control pointsissue 10 dec 98 d 12 37detailed body search detailed body search is normally carried out when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the subject is in possession of illegal items b when high degree of confidence is required that the subject is not carrying illegal items 8procedure detailed body search should be conducted using the same procedure as for the quick body search but with the addition of the following points establish the identity of the subject and the ownership of baggage and other articles b ideally the search should be conducted out of the public eye the detail of the search depends on the suspicion attached and the time available c invite the subject to empty all pockets and remove all items and papers being carried d if it is necessary to remove clothing the subject may do so voluntarily this fact should be recorded or powers exist to require the removal of certain items in or out of the public eye typically in the public eye only the outer coat jacket and gloves may be removed out of the public eye there may be grounds to remove other outer clothing note that only outer clothing may be removed in conducting the search pay attention to every detail particularly clothing seams waist bands belts collars lapels padding cuffs and turn ups anywhere where small items can be secreted socks and shoes provide easily missed hiding places medical dressings are always suspect and medical practitioner should be called to examine dressings and plasters if thought necessary information from clothing name tags manufactures labels and laundry marks can be valuable f unless there is some future interview advantage in doing so emotion should be shown upon finding articles and significant articles should not be set aside from others all items should be saved out of reach of the subject 9more detailed searches other more detailed types of search are possible but require special and particular procedures to conduct effectively these are not covered in this serial constraints 10 the following are the principal constraints with regard to the search of persons the search in ideal circumstances be conducted by person of the same sex as the person to be searched and that some theatres may require that the search of child under 14 years only be conducted by femaleissue 10 dec 98 d 12 4b generally there is authority to require person to remove clothing in public other than an outer coat jacket or gloves out of the public eye and if not voluntarily done there may be appropriate authority to require the removal of other outer clothing 11 these constraints and other factors which can lead to the search of persons being carried out at various levels of detail are normally dictated by what is being sought b the legal justification c the permissible extent of the removal of clothing records and reports 12 for all categories of search apart from initial searches record should be maintained this should contain details of the person searched b the aim of the search c the grounds for the search d the date and time of the search the location of the search f details of anything significant found g details of any injury to person or damage to property which appears to the searcher to have resulted from the search h identification details of the searchers however if searches are conducted in the investigation of offences searches names are not to be included call signs or other means of identification should be usedissue 10 dec 98 d 13 1serial d13 search of occupied buildings approach and entry procedures 1 when searching occupied premises the following procedures should be followed the search team must enter the buildings as quickly and with as little fuss as possible b assemble all occupants in one room c search all occupants and keep them under guard d team commander searches his team in front of the head of the house and then is himself searched by member of the team from this point onwards the head of the house is invited to accompany the team leader f the team commander draws plan of the house and numbers each room attic passage and staircase working from top to bottom and left to right g room suitable for holding the occupants under guard is searched and cleared then the occupants and their guard are moved in h the team commander then details his team in pairs to the first areas to be searched searching 2general points listed below are the places which must be searched in occupied buildings aattics 1 roof area skylights 2 between eaves and slates 3 water tanks and pipework including gutters 4 rafters sawdust felt and roof insulation 5 attic junk brooms 1 doors remove fittings and handlesissue 10 dec 98 d 13 22 furniture interior fittings 3 walls air vents 4 windows

televisions and other electrical goods 3detailed searching of rooms this may be done in several ways but the following method is recommended to ensure that detail is missed searchers always work as pair hence if one is accused of theft the other can give evidence on his behalf b search and clear furniture and reposition to allow freedom to search floor walls and skirting boards c then search and clear the floor remove the covering check for trap openings loose floor boards and loose skirting boards use metal detector d check and clear walls by visual checking knocking and use of metal detector include all doors windows pictures mirrors cupboards fireplaces etc in this phase of the search check and clear the ceilings for trapdoors or false ceilings 4 as each room is cleared the searchers report to the team leader who will allocate them to the next room to be searched 5exit procedures on concluding the search and before leaving the premises accidental damage caused during the search should be repaired if possible deliberate disorder caused by uncovering caches eg lifting floor boards or paving stones removing wall paper during positive search does not constitute compensatable damage b if damage has occurred or the head of the house is satisfied by immediate repairs he should be required to sign form of indemnity c if the head of the house remains dissatisfied by immediate repairs or the damage is beyond the search teams ability to repair search damage form is completed d the team commander should search his team again in front of the head of the house and submit to search himselfissue 10 dec 98 d 14 1serial d14 search of unoccupied buildings preliminaries 1 it is to be assumed that all unoccupied buildings being searched are booby trapped booby trap usually of an explosive and lethal nature is designed to catch the unwary it is aimed at creating uncertainty lowering the morale of the military forces and hindering their movements successful booby trap is simply constructed often from household items such as clothes pegs mousetraps torch batteries etc it is actuated by normal human action eg opening door switching on light or walking on the floor to place it to gain the greatest chance of success the operator must know the methods of working and habits of search teams and soldiers 2 the trap can be activated in many ways the more common ones are pull opening drawer b pressure standing on floor board or sitting in chair c releaseantilift picking up book or bottle d tilt turning an object on its side to look underneath trembler any vibration or movement will activate this f collapsing circuit in an electrically initiated device the action of cutting or breaking the circuit will activate the device in addition it will go off when the battery runs flat g light sensitive device that functions when either exposed to light eg torch or is hidden from light h antisubmerge placing the device in water will cause it to be activated i antiprobe this relies on search probe or prodder complet ing circuit j combination booby trap can have more than one means of initiation approach and entry procedure 3 on arrival at the scene of the search and before entry is made to the building the team leader must carry out visual reconnaissance of the building and surrounding area check must be made for wires leading to command detonated devices inside the building control point is then set up in safe area and the team leader decides upon place of entry he details one pair of searchers only to effect an entry to the building and check for booby trapsissue 10 dec 98 d 14 24 entry is usually to be made through one of the main doors into the building although these may appear to be prime sites for booby traps it saves time and makes subsequent access easier if they are cleared early searching 5 the searching of an unoccupied building takes place in two phases the first is to check the building for any booby traps and the second to carry out the detailed systematic search 6 one pair of searchers only having made an entry to the building proceed to check for booby traps if the front door has not been used for entry they should clear path inside the house to door the team leader clears the outside of the door which can then be opened preferably remotely 7 the searchers clearing for traps should observe the following points never open any door whatever size until both sides have been cleared of traps b all doors drawers and cupboards must be left open after checking c use should be made of the pulling cable and weight dropper for remote opening of doors cupboards moving furniture or other tasks which may endanger the safety of the searchers d routes through the building which have been cleared of traps should be clearly marked using white tape 8 search teams must be alert to the presence of booby traps and the following is list of clues to assist teams in their recognition attractive items in the open b spoils wrappings sawdust etc in unlikely places c presence of pegs wires lengths of cord etc where they would not normally be expected d loose floor boards window ledges or stair treads fresh nails or screws f lumps or bulges under carpets in chairs etc 9 when the house has been cleared of booby traps the team leader enters and numbers the rooms as for an occupied house 10 the detailed searching of the building then proceeds as for search of an occupied buildingissue 10 dec 98 d 15 1serial d15 search of rural areas general 1 open areas are often used as the sites for hides as they have the advantage that they can be watched from nearby houses without being attributable to individuals although normally associated with rural environment open spaces also occur in an urban setting in the form of parks and gardens or even waste and derelict ground therefore the areas to be searched using this procedure may vary from the side of hill to back garden planning 2 area searches are especially dependent on good planning for success and the following points are particularly relevant to the planning and conduct of this type of search the use of the intelligence planning of the battlefield ipb process within the planning of operations of this type is an essential part of the compilation of information needed before search can be conducted where appropriate further planning should be reevaluated as the search progresses the location of the centre of the area to be searched is indicated by an eight figure grid reference with an address if possible the boundaries are recorded as series of eight figure grid references b the identity of the owner or tenant of the land c information gained from aerial photographs even if only library material is valuable an analysis should identify the most likely hide locations d air reconnaissance may be useful but care must be taken to avoid giving advanced warning to the insurgents details of local known insurgents and sympathisers f search dogs can cover large areas more quickly than men priorities for the use of available dogs must be decided g the division of the total area into subareas to be searched by individual search teams requires care inclusive and exclusive boundaries must be clearly defined and should be marked by obvious features such as hedges and ditches each team area should be able to be searched in one day h the location of the main icp and initial team icps hide locations 3 an appreciation of the needs of the insurgents using the hides helps in identifying likely hide locations this is often called the winthrop theory after the officer who developedissue 10 dec 98 d 15 2it these vary with the situation and the type of hide being sought but common points include aconvenience of access normally an important point for an adversary and could include 1 near road or track 2 easily located this includes the general area which must be easily identifiable such as small copse hedgerow or building and the precise location of the hide which may be marked in some fashion this applies particularly to transit hides the markers may be artificial such as painted fence post but are usually some natural landmark that is identifi able at night markers are commonly called winthrop points examples of markers are distinctive tree in the corner of field b lone tree in the centre of hedgerow c gap in hedge d telegraph pole in hedge any distinct natural object or set of objects 3 easy access into the hide itself bconcealment and camouflage the main points are that 1 the insurgent does not want to be seen when actually using the hide therefore it is likely to be in dead ground although the general area may be observed by sympathiser 2 the surroundings of the hide must provide natural camouflage and concealment 4 an adversarys local knowledge may obviate the need for markers searchers should be suspicious of anything out of place eg worn patches of grass such as broken twigs and footprints use should be made of aerial photography to identify areas of recent digging or where the normal pattern of plant growth has been disturbed procedure for search 5main points the search of areas is normally conducted on the basis that the most likely locations for hides are searched first the procedure is as followsissue 10 dec 98 d 15 3ateam icp established it is recommended that location for the icp is selected within the area to be searched it is approached on foot and the route is visually checked on entry the icp is checked out to radius of 20 metres the transport is then called forward bobservation the whole team observe the area from the icp the 2ic produces sketch map of the area showing all the prominent objects which are possible markers for hides winthrop points if search dog is available it may be deployed around the boundary of the area with an escort while the rest of the team are observing the escort notes any area in which the dog shows interest cboundary walk the whole team walks around the boundary observing inwards especially from points of access into the area for potential markers winthrop points this also allows the team commander to ensure that all searchers are familiar with their area and know their boundary during this phase physical searching is done once the whole team has walked the boundary they compare notes and the team commander completes his plan selecting his winthrop points and listing them in priority order if there is cordon the team may split with one half guarding the transport and equipment while the other half walks the boundary dpoint search the team commander details pairs of searchers to search all potential hide locations within the area out to radius of 15 metres each pair is usually equipped with metal detector and shovel if dog is available it may search the areas first eboundary search the boundary is searched paying particular attention to any prominent objects on it all boundaries should be overlapped by minimum of one metre boundaries are often fruitful areas as both the insurgent and the searcher find them easy to identify and therefore it is policy to search them twice with one pair of searchers moving clockwise and the other counter clockwise one pair of searchers works from inside the boundary and the other from the outside fremaining area search finally the remaining featureless areas are searched using the whole team in extended line formation with maximum of two metres between men alternate men have metal detector or shovel the team commander must always ensure that the whole area is searched searchers must remember to look up as well as down even if find is made they must carry on searching as there may be other hides in the vicinity 6end of search procedure when the search including documentation is complete the teams withdraw ensuring gates are secured as necessary search report should be completed for each search team taskissue 10 dec 98 d 16 1serial d16 search of routes 1general routes include roads tracks railways air corridors and waterways they provide obvious locations for hostile groups to stage ambushes as they could be widely used by the security forces civil authorities and vips therefore the route search procedure described in this serial is normally for use in defensive search operations and is designed to ensure that the route is safe the procedure described is primarily for metalled roads but the principles apply to the other types of route if routes are searched as part of an offensive search operation the area search procedure should be used 2planning the likely methods and locations of hostile attack must be given special consideration when planning and throughout the execution of route search opera tions 3vulnerable points vulnerable points are those point on the route where it is particularly advantageous for the adversary to position an ambush likely places are culverts b bridges c high banked stretches of route d routes dominated by high ground possible firing points see below junctions f buildings and walls near the route g parked vehicles h prominent markers on the route j places where vehicles slow down 4firing points the adversarys choice of ambush position may be influenced by the availability of suitable firing point firing point usually has good view of the ambush position but an observer may be employed to pass messages firing point is also likely to have concealed approach and fast escape route along the route approaching the ambush point there are likely to be one or more aiming marks which are clearly visible from the firing point or observation point 5method of attack the adversarys choice of ambush position is also influenced by the proposed method of attack the options include abombs and off route devices these may be fired byissue 10 dec 98 d 16 21booby trap booby trap device is activated by the target so that the adversary does not have to be present and therefore there is need for firing point 2command wire the adversary may choose to fire the device remotely using command wire the wire may be surface laid or buried be run through underground service pipes or be strung overhead it may be camouflaged by being incorporated into existing wire such as fences or telephone cables and often follows linear features such as ditches streams hedges etc the distance from the firing point to the ambush point is likely to be between 100 and 500 metres in rural setting but may be as far as 1500 metres consideration must be given to any permanent links such as railway lines and fence wires as these may also be used by an insurgent 3radio control the adversary may choose to fire the device remotely using radio control the firing point may be over 1000 metres from the ambush point bdirect fire weapons these include small arms and antitank weapons 6categories the procedures for the search of routes are divided into two categories aroute checks route checks may be undertaken by foot patrol as the name implies they only provide quick inspection of the route paying particular attention to the vulnerable points there is guarantee that the route checked is clear of explosive devices broute searches route searches are detailed searches carried out by qualified search teams 7route checks route checks can be carried out by vehicle mounted or foot patrols and are normally incorporated into the overall patrol programme the check is carried out by three teams each usually of four men grouped together to form patrol the operation is commanded by patrol commander who may be located with the road team or with local protection troops two teams work on the flanks and one team on the road team members may carry standard patrol electromagnetic counter measures ecm equipment depending on the local threat when deployed there should be minimum of 10 metres spacing between team members the make up and role of the team is given below it is stressed that because of the limited training and equipment of the teams route checks are not substitute for route searches aflanking teams the flanking teams are identical the front man is the pathfindercable detector man and uses patrol cable detecting equipment his role is to select safe line for the team and to find command wires the second man is usually the team commander and he and the other team members regularly scan the route using binoculars in order to identify vulnerable points and possible devices they should also look for firing points the third and fourth men act as escortsissue 10 dec 98 d 16 3broad team the road team consists of two hedgerow men and two road men the hedgerow men work on opposite sides of the road they check the hedgerows ditches and verges the road men are deployed on either side of the road and are each responsible for checking their side of the road and the verge up to the edge of the hedgerow mans area 8procedure the procedure represented diagrammatically in figure 1 is as follows astart point start point on the road is identified it should be at least 50 metres from any vulnerable point if the teams are on foot it is advisable for the start point to be approached from off the route bflanking teams the flanking teams work in series of bounds they move out at right angles to the road from the start point for minimum of 50 metres they then move roughly parallel to the road but must avoid setting obvious patterns and not allow themselves to be channelled at the end of each bound cross over of the road is made ccrossovers the flanking teams carry out crossover procedures every 80 to 200 metres in order to detect cables running close to and parallel to the road normally the first crossover is made after the minimum distance 80 metres in order to allow the road party to start the crossover drill is as follows 1 the flanking teams stop opposite each other where possible approxi mately 50 metres from the road 2 the pathfinder and team commander from one team move across the road clearly marking their crossing point they move up to the other team and the pathfinders interchange ensuring that their paths cross in the process 3 the team commander then returns to his team with his new pathfinder leading ensuring that they cross the road at the same point the two flanking teams then continue moving roughly parallel to the road dvulnerable points as far as possible crossovers should not be made within 50 metres of vulnerable point vulnerable point must not be approached closer than 50 metres until it has been isolated by the flanking team completing cross overs before and after the vulnerable point when the isolation is complete one of the team commanders checks the vulnerable point to confirm that there are devices he selects safe route to the vulnerable point avoiding any obvious defiles he approaches only as close as necessary to obtain clear view using binoculars if appropriate vulnerable points such as culverts should be checked from both sides once he is sure that the vulnerable point is clear he retraces his path back to his team eroad team the road team works minimum of one bound behind the flanking parties and should never approach closer than 20 metres to crossover pointissue 10 dec 98 d 16 4figure 1 route checkcross over markers hedgerow manhedgerow man road man

checks out to 20 metre radius of the vulnerable point figure 2 vulnerable point check 10route searches route search is carried out by two search teams commanded by search adviser whenever possible the flanks of the road being searched are secured by cordon whose commander retains overall command of the operation one search team is divided into two flanking parties each of three possibly four men the second team forms the road party members of the party or escorts may carry and use standard patrol ecm equipment depending on the local threat the make up and role of the parties is as follows

party is of three men he is also the party commander if there are four men the party commander comes after the pathfinder whoever is the party commander he must regularly scan the route using binoculars to identify vulnerable points and look for firing points 2 the two rear men are cable detector men their task is to find command wires they use cable detectors and carry shovels to dig for

their activity hostile groups are almost certain to use all types of vehicle to move their resources the search of vehicles at vcps deter movement and furthermore when finds are made they can be attributed to individuals thereby enhancing the chances of successful prosecution the large numbers of vehicles on the roads today can make the search of cars at vcps appear daunting task if it is not to rely on chance searching of vehicles must be backed up by an efficient intelligence system which targets vehicles and enables data on them to be quickly verified this involves close liaison with police records vehicle registration authori ties etc nevertheless much can be achieved by the alertness and intuition of the policeman or soldier on the spot he should be aware of the general characteristics of vehicles construction and the signs which may indicate that the vehicle is suspect and therefore not legitimate 2the conduct of searchers the searchers must be courteous efficient thorough and quick they must not be put off searching the interior of vehicles by the presence of children and babies pets old people young ladies apparently sick or drunk persons if necessary special assistance must be called 3categories vcp search techniques are divided into three categories listed below the categories vary according to the intensity of the search and are essentially weeding process generally it is better to keep person apprehensive by looking quickly into many vehicles rather than thoroughly inspecting few there is clear boundary between the categories and the extent of the investigation at each stage depends on the suspicion aroused the stages are ainitial check the initial check is the first part of the weeding process and is carried out on all vehicles stopped bprimary search the primary search is carried out on vehicles selected for more detailed examination either because of intelligence received or due to suspicion aroused during the initial check csecondary search the secondary search is thorough search of highly suspect vehicles avoidance of search 4 suspicious persons will try to avoid being searched and may be working in liaison with others those on duty at vehicle check points must watch for those trying to avoid being searched and beware of signalling to the following vehicle eg by flashing brake lights or the use of radiosissue 10 dec 98 d 17 2b pedestrians who may have left vehicles just before the check point c disturbances that cause congestion thus encouraging more vehicles to be let through without being searched initial check 5general points the initial check is carried out on all vehicles stopped the decision on which vehicles to stop may be based on the following stopping all vehicles b random selection c suspicion aroused d intelligence based 6purpose of check the main aim of the initial check is to select vehicles for more detailed examination but personnel carrying out checks at the entrance to barracks and other installations must also be aware of the threat from large vehicle mounted bombs an initial check is normally carried out without the occupants dismounting from the vehicle although the driver may be asked to open the boot and bonnet one to three men are required to check the vehicle and it normally takes about one to three minutes per vehicle 7the sequence of checking it is not necessary for the full sequence to be completed on all vehicles the parts applied should vary from vehicle to vehicle to keep an insurgent guessing it should be stopped once the integrity of the vehicle

constructed in such way that there is hollow compartment above the articulated joint where the trailer is connected to the tractor unit this joint is commonly known as the fifth wheel access may sometimes be gained underneath the trailer and can be checked with torch and mirror fibreoptic instruments have been able to get into most of the fifth wheel spaces it is simple to use and more versatile than torch and mirror in some cases the only way into the compartment is to remove the floorboards inside the trailer which are usually held down by 2 screws at each end bfuel tanks and side lockers some trailers are fitted with belly tanks for extended range there is usually space between the top of the tank and the floor of the trailer and goods can be attached to the top of the tank also check the tank for recent welds or bolted panels similarly there is often space between the back of the side lockers and the chassis member on which they are mounted cspare wheel can be used as place of concealment and is usually mounted under the trailer positions vary dchassis crossmembers most trailers are constructed with 2 u section girders running the whole length large concealment can be constructed by placing boards on the reverse ledges bridging the gap between the girders ebattery boxes there is usually space behind the battery to open the box remove the wing nuts fcrash bar

screwdriver to undo the size of this concealment varies with the different types of fridge unit but some are fairly large 3 there is usually an inspection panel on the interior unit which also reveals space plastic trunking for distribution of cold air runs the length of the trailer and has been used for concealment of goods warning always make certain that the whole unit has been switched off

formation headquarters or by re teams aexplosive detectors there are number of explosive detectors capable of analysing samples of air fairly rapidly ie in about quarter of minute the more sensitive they are the larger and less portable they are likely to be they all need to be worked by trained operators and their use is usually governed by some simple rules 1 air samples must not be taken in the open or in wet windy conditions for example doors windows must be shut before taking an air sample from aissue 10 dec 98 d 18 3car the nozzle must be put right into coat pocket shopping bag etc persons hands should be put into plastic bag before taking sample 2 samples from inside vehicle must be taken as soon as the occupants have got out 3 detector being used to find explosives hidden in upholstery door panels etc must be held close up against the surface being investigated 4 the search team leader must know how sensitive the detector is and whether it is capable of detecting wide or narrow range of explosives and in roughly what minimum quantity bmetal detectors metal detectors are able to detect both ferrous and nonferrous metals and they can automatically adjust to constant metal presence for example detector placed on the surface of metal plate will signal the presence of metal for short time then the signal will reduce to zero if the detector head is then moved slowly over the metal surface it will detect variations in metal thickness or further metal objects close behind the metal plate detectors usually have an assortment of probes for different tasks 1one metre probe used for searching loads of straw etc where metal is expected 2personal search probe used to detect metal on the person or in bags and parcels etc 3truncheon probe the shorter version of the one metre probe intended for searching aggressive personnel not to be used on females 4ground search head this will detect any metal within the area of the probe ring useful for searching loads of sacks or straw canomaly detectors there are range of detectors some of which are very expensive which are capable of detecting through walls the ground and sheet metal and are exceptionally useful aids for discovering well concealed hides dremote booby trap clearance devices these range from improvised systems or locally manufactured disruption equipment used in conjunction with pulling lines or remote battery powered vehicles exray equipment used generally as an aid to security to check suspect items fchemical test kits these provide simple cheap on the spot check for residues of illegal substances

operations which by their nature require additional skills and equipment two particular examples have general significance and are therefore outlined below these are venue search b high risk search operations venue search 2general venue search is defensive search operation mounted to assist in providing safe environment for an event it forms part of the overall security operation which is controlled by security coordinator such searches tend to be complex operations with number of features which differentiate them from other search operations therefore special planning and control procedures have been developed for them some of these procedures may also be applied to other large defensive search operations 3characteristics the characteristics of venue search operations are aresources the size and complexity of the potential target may be enormous making the operation expensive in manpower and other resources venue search operation may cover the following 1 the venue 2 routes to and from the venue 3 vehicle control and search points 4 adjacent buildings 5 surrounding areas 6 contingency plans safe housesalternative venues and routes blimiting factors the factors limiting the operation may not only be the normal ones of time manpower etc but cost commercial interest and even political acceptability may be consideration ccoordination the number of agencies involved may be extensive the whole security operation including the search phase must be effectively coordinated and the need for consultation and considered compromise must be constantly borne in mind the intentions of local police forces and military agencies alld 19 2 issue 10 dec 98influence the search operation it is vital that the principal search adviser is closely involved with the security coordinator from the earliest stage and throughout the conduct of the operation in such multiagency activity it is essential that everyone fully understands their particular responsibilities so that gaps which could give the hostile forces window of opportunity do not inadvertently develop in the security cover dprofile ideally the search and all security arrangements should be carried out in low profile for example the searchers may have to wear civilian clothes and use unmarked vehicles such action may prevent public concern or antago nism and minimise the publicity given to the search or event however on some occasions operations in high profile may be unavoidable or even desirable this may be due to the publicity or predictability of the event and consequently the search operation or to assume preventive role at times high profile search activity can be used as an attraction for the media and to divert attention from more sensitive areas of the security operation 4planning the characteristics mentioned above emphasise the need for detailed planning security coordinators should consult their search advisers at the earliest opportunity to determine whether assistance is appropriate and to allow sufficient time for planning although the lead times for planning can be very short eg for events given little or prior publicity for public events involving multiagency activity minimum planning period of eight weeks should be sought further planning details are available in chapter 6 of military engineering pamphlet 6a counter terrorist search high risk searches 5general search is classified as high risk when there is either known to be or special reason to believe that bomb or booby trap explosive or otherwise is present the most likely scenarios for high risk operation are when there is known or suspected ied or booby trap which needs to be cleared b secondary devices are strongly suspected at the scene of an explosion c an item of lost military property has to be recovered it should always be assumed that any items of military equipment found are booby trapped 6responsibility high risk search operations are the exclusive responsibility of re and must be planned and controlled by an re search adviser resa and undertaker re high risk search teams 7safety safety is the prime consideration the search advisor must consult all the appropriate experts during the planning phase in particular specialist ecm equipments and procedures appropriate to the theatre and the threat must be fully utilised 8planning the search advisor should consider all available data when making his plan particularly the reason for classifying the operation high risk the following points are relevantd 19 3 issue 10 dec 98a the ied disposal operator must be consulted and always available for deploy ment b ecm advice should be obtained ecm equipment and expert advice should be included in the search operation if appropriate and in accordance with local policy c the use of search dogs d the use of remotely controlled search or ied disposal equipment to search particularly suspect areas or to approach ieds booby traps or other suspicious items the use of searchers and the spacing between them it may be appropriate to deploy searchers singly f the maximum use must be made of suitable photography usually the search advisor himself tasks this agency in order to ensure that the tasking is correct the search advisor deals directly with the photographic interpreters once the photographs have been studiedd 20 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d20 cordon operations planning factors 1general cordon operations can be mounted at any time to protect those agencies working or searching in particular area of interest in the past there has been merit in mounting two cordons around the specific area the outer cordon to prevent interference from outside and the inner cordon to seal off particular area for search and to prevent movement out of that area this may not always be possible or practicable but should always be considered whether the operation is in rural or urban environment 2tactical features the tactics of mounting any cordon are based primarily but not exclusively on those for siting conventional defence locations these include depth b mutual support c all round defence d offensive spirit maintenance of reserve f deception and concealment g logistics communications h good coordination i flexibility siting of cordons 3general the siting of rural cordon is generally simpler than conventional defence as it is usual for the focus of attention to be point target however there are other factors to be considered which are examined below 4depth adequate depth is achieved by the use of ring of static cordon positions providing intimate protection to the agencies and roving satellite patrols around these which provide earlywarning and protection to the static positions extra depth can be achieved by the use of mobile or static vcps beyond the satellite patrolling area 5mutual support avoid the isolation of individual positionsd 20 2 issue 10 dec 98b coordinate plan for the interaction of static and mobile forces c ensure the icp is protected it should be within the ring of static positions d if direct mutual support cannot be achieved groups should have interlocking and overlapping arcs of observation 6all round defence the cordon must extend around the target and prevent infiltration and exfiltration from any direction the main effort should be concentrated towards the area of greatest threat if national border is involved thought must be given to protection available from the other side if this is possible or appropriate possible firing points against troops in the target area must be dominated 7offensive spirit consider surge activity by patrols at set times throughout the operation b top cover c joint armypolice vcp operations in neighbouring areas d surveillance plan deployment of machine gun crews and snipers f vcp operations g standing patrols at night h active patrolling by satellites to blur the edge of the operation and disrupt hostile activity 8reserves reserve should be available to respond to the unexpected without compromising the integrity of the cordon manning levels will not always permit the positioning of groundbased reserve but other reserves possibly airborne reserves could be briefed 9deception and concealment aconcealment camouflage and minimum movement avoid linear features but make best use of ground bdeception it is difficult to disguise the nature of cordon once it has been established but steps can be taken to deceive observers as to the area of the cordon and its overall strength by using satellite patrols and surge patrol activity to blur the edge of the cordond 20 3 issue 10 dec 98deploying the cordon 10general all parts of the cordon must be established simultaneously as the aim is to surround the area before the inhabitants realize what is happening this needs precise timing and the use of the maximum number of routes consistent with simplicity 11order of insertion ideally the most suitable order of insertion would be as follows aoverwatch op deploys this provides information on routine local activity suspicious activity and on the ground prior to the cordons deployment bsatellite patrols deploy these are tasked to secure helicopter ls for cordon troops and dominate ground by conducting vcps standing patrols and route checks by night satellite patrols could go into standing patrol locations or bolster reserves on static cordon cstatic cordon troops deploy the icp party usually deploy with them to ensure the correct position is occupied dreserve deploys normally to the icp eother agencies deploy on call once the integrity of the cordon is assured 12method of insertion there are two main methods either teams patrol into their own locations or employ multiple rolling drop off to allow the cordon commander to site flanking teams 13drills regardless of method used for insertion the drills for team occupation are check of cordon location anything found should be reported this may lead to cordon extraction or clearance operation b switch off ecm equipment once close to proposed trench location except for cordon vcp positions c send 8 fig gr of position and arcs covered to the cordon commander ensure that he is content with new position if the team had to move away from the location given on operation order d team commanders brief to all troops before 2 sentries are deployed sentries to be next to the trench with radio and the teams main weapon system possibly in shellscrape covering the arcs of fire remaining 2 men start to dig battle trench once completed this should be concealedd 20 4 issue 10 dec 98aviation tasks in cordon operation 14 likely tasks are monitor traffic approaching the cordon b immediate reaction to any incidents c monitor crowd levels and potential trouble spots d screenguard troops on the ground in the cordon disrupt hostile activity by use of snap evcps coordination 15range cards these should be completed as soon as possible drawn from the ground and used as commanders ground estimate and aide memoire for remainder of team the range card should include arcs b location and radio callsign of flanking cordon locations c location radio callsign and operating zones of any satellite patrols d location and nominated route to the icp location and radio callsign of reserve if nominated f danger area of task g any reaction plans 16cordon vcps where vcp forms part of the cordon the following additional points need to be followed battle trenches sited in depth and ideally on opposite sides of the road the patrol commander is in charge with police representative present to control public access b insertion as for cordon locations but the initial check must be enlarged to clear the road each location should be checked c priority to establish white mine tape chest high across the road to cordon the road with stinger lazy tongs or other suitable equipment prepared and ready for used 20 5 issue 10 dec 98d timedistance calculation is required for any potential vehicle breaking white mine tape for stingerlazy tongs to be deployed stinger or lazy tongs should not be predeployed across the road two types of access allowed 1limited access where threat to life exists within cordon thus search vehicle before monitoring through cordon 2denial of access where access is prevented due to potential loss of life within given danger area f once the position is prepared stay within trench until vehicle halts at white tape this is the signal for patrol member to move forward under cover action after deployment 17general points the following is sequence of events which could follow after deployment to coordinate and integrate all deployment activity it is likely that these will have to be adapted according to the circumstances prevailing at the time achecking the cordon the cordon commander must make an immediate check of the area and personally ensure that the perimeter is complete roads or alleys and open spaces which are likely escape routes should be sealed off with wire but must remain under observation by sentries when the troops have been on guard for short time if the cordon commander considers that the full psychological effect has been achieved more relaxed but still alert posture may be adopted binstructions to the public once the cordon is in position and depending on the circumstances of the cordon operation the police may issue agreed instructions to any local people affected by the operations cordons designed to assist in searching for hostile persons are an example where the local authorities may be needed to effect instructions for the local population both outside and inside the cordon cguarded areas it may be necessary for there to be separate guarded area for suspects weapons or other nonied finds this requirement should be covered in the operation order and suitable guards nominated for duty 18action on contact reaction to attack within cordon operation should be covered in the operation order or at the commanders group 19thinning the cordon the cordon may have to remain in position for long periods the length of time depending on the number of buildings size of the area the strength of forces available for searching and the density of the local community it may therefore be necessary to thin out the cordon to provide reliefs and to create additional local reserves the following action should be takend 20 6 issue 10 dec 98a once escape routes have been wired off sentries should be sited tactically on rooftops etc b sentries should be sited in pairs and in depth and where possible should have some shelter they require good all round observation to detect any attempt to break out c when thinning out the cordon complete sections should be removed because they can then be rested close at hand and form tactical reserve 20extracting cordon all troops involved in the cordon should be warned of the cordon extraction plan and the time it is to be effective from trenches should be filled and equipment checked and made ready for redeployment prior to the extraction aextracting the extraction is done in the reverse order of insertion that is agencies b police c static cordon teams d icp and reserve satellite patrols bstay behind parties an overwatch patrol to stay behind and observe subse quent movement in the old cordon area is often useful means of checking hostile activity action on shooting at cordon 21immediate action identify firing point and return fire with personal weapons only flanking teams to engage as well if the firing point can be established 22follow up action follow up action should only be taken by satellite patrols in the area or by the use of the reaction forces either in helicopters or from the icp area in border areas follow up action should not cross any border unless hot pursuit agreements have been authorised use control helicopter to monitor the situation and act as liaison with the state authorities if this is feasible 23cordon troops follow up action is to be taken by cordon troops to avoid the prospect of comeon b causing gap in the cordond 20 7 issue 10 dec 9824follow up action same as in 22 but not to cross the border unless hot pursuit agreements have been authorised use control helicopter to monitor situation where possible and act as liaison with the

clearance satellite patrolling 27role in any cordon operations it is prudent to employ satellite patrols to assist in the overall defence of the operation and to provide some measure of deception aggressive activity and mobile reserve for the duration of the operation 28composition satellite patrol should not consist of less than 2 teams it should be commanded by an experienced patrol commanderd 20 8 issue 10 dec 9829tasking satellite patrol should be given detailed tasks and not left to patrol aimlessly with given quadrant of the cordon tasks may include rummages b vcps c house checks d standing patrols route checks 30deployment in general terms satellite patrols should deploy before static positions are taken up b dominate the area securing landing sites prior to the arrival of any static troops c not plug gaps but complement any cordon or search activities d conduct liaison with static troop locations and positions 31control satellite patrols should be controlled to ensure that all static positions are continually aware of their location b maximum ground coverage is achieved c rest and lie up activity should be at different times 32movement satellite patrols should use unpredictable routes and should cover dead ground and likely fps onto static positions satellite patrols come under opcon of the respective commander during cordon or search operationsissue 10 dec 98 d 21 1serial d21 snatch operations 1general information could be received concerning the location of wanted person and it may be possible to effect his or her arrest by means of search operation in which cordon is mounted around the suspected location or by the tactic of snatch operation 2planning normally the information on wanted persons is fleeting and timesensi tive the time factor should never override the requirement for careful and well thought out plans snatch operations need imaginative planning good security and rehearsal to ensure that the approach and conduct of the operation is free from interference methods to obtain surprise might include using civilian vehicles or helicopters the timing also needs careful consideration the early hours of the morning are often suit able as there is normally little activity at that time and any hostile reaction from the surrounding area should be minimal planning must take account of any follow up action which will be needed or may be anticipated this might include not only ar rangements for immediate questioning but also the anticipation of any consequen tial moves which may be needed to exploit the snatch reserves should also be on hand in case of emergency 3composition of snatch parties snatch parties should normally comprise spe cially selected and trained groups which have significant nco content they should be trained in coup main operations and may require special allocation of ve hicles and other equipment eg ladders ropes and sledgehammers at least one officer or nco in each party should be able to speak the local language the inclu sion of policeman may in some circumstances facilitate the legal processes at and after the moment of arrest 4method of operation two parties should normally be organized for an operation the first party should consist of person who may be police representative to recognize the subject and few selected soldiers to provide firepower and carry out the snatch the second party forms close cordon to prevent escape and to make the area of the snatch secure from outside interference subsequent search of the area may also be necessaryissue 10 dec 98 d 22 1serial d22 the use of dogs in operations general 1 dogs can be trained to perform tasks which save manpower and time and which increase the effectiveness of search or follow up military dogs fall into two broad categories protection and specialist dogs the primary function of the protection dog is to help improve the security of installations guarded and to decrease the manpower required to provide an effective guard specialist dogs are those trained for single role and are used to detect people or inanimate objects proper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of each type is essential if full value is to be obtained from them 2 the performance of dog depends to great extent on the ability and enthusiasm of its handler who must therefore be chosen with care specialist dogs who may work in very dangerous conditions and carry burden of life and death require particularly diligent handlers who should be selected accordingly 3 the characteristics and capabilities of the various types of dog are described in outline in the following paragraphs commanders can judge the type of dog which may be useful to them but not all of them will usually be instantly available protection dogs can generally be supplied on demand but specialist dogs must be acquired and trained and consequently their need must be anticipated well in advance protection dogs 4characteristics these dogs rely on their sense of smell of air scent acute hearing visual detection of movement and aggression 5employment the dog patrols on lead with the handler it can detect at distance and when released and given the word of command will attack and bite it will also protect the handler without word of command the dog can be used as static sentry and therefore can be taken on overt or covert patrols to give early warning of hostile activity and to apprehend suspects these dogs are likely to bark and for operations where silence is required must be carefully selected the main uses of protection dogs are patrolling of enclosed areas where there is little movement of personnel or traffic b aggressivehigh visibility patrolling of open areas c prisoner escort d listening posts opsissue 10 dec 98 d 22 2f ambushes g crowd control h vcps arms and explosives search dogs aes 6characteristics this is specialist dog trained for one specific role that of searching for and indicating the presence of weapons explosives and equipment the dog can be used to search in both the urban and rural environments the dog should be deployed to every incident even if there is specific job for it as result of the incident it can be used to check cordon and icp locations 7employment aes dogs and handler may be held available on location or in central pool for tasking on request aes dogs should never be deployed to confirm some already existing suspicion however in the event of telephone warning being given that device has been planted consideration may be given to the deployment of aes dogs but due regard must be paid to soak times the reliability of information etc the principal tasks for aes dogs are searching for munitions hides and ancillary equipment in 1buildings occupied unoccupied or derelicts unoccupied and derelicts after having been checked for booby traps before the dog enters 2vehicles cars lorries buses trains ships and aircraft 3open areas fields woods hedgerows and embankments 4routes roads and railways b providing negative information by checking buildings after completion of repairs or renovations or prior to vip visits etc clearing areas of operation such as vcps and helicopter landing sites 8tasking and tactical considerations tasking is usually through the normal chain of command unless the dog has previously been deployed to specific unit or search team except in conditions of high risk search the aes dog should have access to the area to be searched before the other searchers move into it where ieds or booby traps are expected check for devices must be made before the dog moves in by searchers other than the dog handler 9advantages dog is compact mobile and easily transported it can work in variety of conditions including confined spaces and difficult terrain it can search relatively quickly allowing either the time for search to be reduced or larger area to be covered it can indicate the presence of many

unaffected by cs gas air fresheners or other aerosols 10limitations variations and limitations are to be expected when using aes dogs for instance they are of little use in detecting arms and explosives hidden on the person as dogs expect these to be carried by humans ie their handlers and other soldiers b reduced ability to detect objects more than 12 metres above working height c there is danger of aes dogs setting off booby traps d the dog should only work within the rangecover of the ecm equipment available on the ground tracker dogs 11characteristics these dogs also have highly developed sense of smell but more especially for ground than air scent the dog is only trained for the task of tracking 12employment the dog and its handler should be held in central place and deployed to task on request they should have early access to line before the scent has been confused by other troops possible tasks are aafter incidents pursuit of suspects fleeing on foot even if arrest is made intelligence can be obtained from the direction of flight and from witnesses on or at the end of track also forensic evidence can often be obtained from footprints tyre marks items dropped or left behind etc broutine the routine usually adopted is 1 stand by at planned arrests and road blocks in case of escape on foot 2 determining firing points sniper posts observation positions 3 determining routes to and from subpara 2 above and freshly dumped hidden hides or any clandestine operation 13the track track is made up of combination of scents human artificial soap toiletries polish etc and crushed vegetation and insects everywhere where human goes he leaves track if he runs his track will be more pronounced than if he was to walk away from the scene dog cannot differentiate between friendly forces and enemy targets so it is vital that on commencement of tracking task it is confirmed that the dog is following the correct track ie the enemy once on the track the dog has the ability to follow it to successful conclusion despite diversionary tracks which may be introduced either by humans or animalsissue 10 dec 98 d 22 414handler information before tracker dog can start to work on track the handler requires certain information he must know 1 where the quarry was last seen 2 in which direction it was moving b he should know 1 the amount and the limit of movement by friendly troops which has taken place in the area where the quarry was last seen 2 at what time the quarry was last seen 3 how many there were 4 whether it is thought that there has been movement by the quarry out of and back into the area where the track starts before final departure 5 the state of weather after the quarry was seen 6 the probable reaction of the quarry when encountered 15limitations the main limitations are that the tkr dog should be deployed to the scene of an incident as soon as possible time is major factor in its deployment infantry patrol dogs ip 16characteristics the dog uses its sense of smell and hearing to give silent warning by pointing the ip dog is used predominantly in close country environment and is trained to silently indicate enemy presence either moving or static and concealed as in an ambush 17employment points to be noted in using patrol dogs are that patrol dog differs from tracker dog in that it does not follow track but it is alert to the scent and sound of human beings or animals conveyed to it on the air the patrol dog is useful for giving silent warning of ambushes and attempts at infiltration and will indicate any presence before it can be detected by human the distance at which warning is given depends upon the following factors 1 wind direction and velocityissue 10 dec 98 d 22 52 prevailing weather conditions 3 density of vegetation 4 individual ability b infantry patrol dogs are normally worked on long lead both by day and depending on the environment at night c on patrol the handler and dog should lead the normal procedure is 1 the patrol commander briefs the handler on the mission disposition of own troops the general direction of advance and any special instructions before moving out 2 the ip dog and handler with escort precede the patrol at distance close enough for immediate communication with the patrol commander at night this would be at about an arms length in daylight the distance will be greater but still within visual signalling distance the dog and handler should be allowed to take advantage of any wind or other conditions which help the dogs scenting powers 3 when the dog points the handler indicates by silent hand signal and the patrol takes over 4 the patrol commander should then move quietly up to the handler and make his plan 18limitations the survival of patrol may depend on its ability to locate an enemy without itself being detected trained ip dog will always detect hidden enemy before the patrol the dog can be worked by day or night in most kinds of weather and country and is not disturbed by the noise of battle it must however be stressed that the dogs performance usually deteriorates in heavy rain and when working upwind of the enemy b the dog is apt to become perplexed when lot of activity is taking place within small area c the dog cannot differentiate between the enemy and own forces full briefing of the patrol on the dispositions of our own troops is therefore essential d the dog will point at animals but the handler should normally recognise false point of this kindissue 10 dec 98 d 22 6other specialist dogs 19limitations the following

1 this serial deals with troop reaction to minor incidents where they are employed in support of the civil authorities it is emphasised that they can only act in accordance with the relevant law experience has shown that on occasions military patrols possibly supported by police representatives have encountered minor aggressive behaviour from groups of young persons in the course of their duties sometimes this sort of behaviour can be anticipated particularly in urban areas where there may be 24 hour patrolling policy in this instance there should be general guidance given by those controlling the movement of patrols ops room on how to handle this minor form of aggressiveness 2it is important however to treat minor aggressive forms of behaviour with caution because if badly handled it could lead to more serious developments it is also time when junior ncos or soldiers are at their most vulnerable aggressive behaviour by small mob can lead to over reaction by individuals very quickly unless the situation is controlled properly by the patrolteam commander or police representative if one is present 3 aggressive mob behaviour may arise spontaneously or develop on the following lines aas comeon to draw troops into predesignated target area bas distraction to cover the move of weapons explosives or wanted persons cfor emotional reasons spontaneous aggressiveness may flare up in re sponse to an incident arrest or as result of heavyhanded patrolling dto cause interference to prevent the successful conclusion of preplanned military operation such as search 4 whether crowds are permissive neutral or hostile it would be prudent for patrol commanders to anticipate hostile situation and have some outline contingency plan available to deal with the most likely forms of aggressiveness or disturbance 5 although there will be times when patrols will be required to stand firm to maintain the integrity of cordon to protect evidence as general rule troops should avoid aggressive situations where possible if avoidance is not possible then extraction from the area must be achieved as soon as possible minor aggressiveness is carried out by gangs of youths and is therefore of little interest to military forces however it may be orchestrated by hostile forces to embarrass the military forces or show the vulnerability of those who support law and orderd 23 2 issue 10 dec 98action against hostile groups 6 should patrol teams find themselves in hostile and aggressive crowd the following action could be taken aanticipation if the patrol task is in potential flash point area or the task is likely to attract an aggressive reaction the patrol should be briefed accordingly prior to deployment if hostile situation starts to develop patrol commanders must anticipate the potential crowd build up and change of moods this information should be passed to the controlling ops room as soon as possible other team commanders should also anticipate the potential problem and ensure that they are in position to support the exposed team team members must also anticipate and consider moving closer together to avoid becoming isolated the team member with the baton gun should remain next to the commander bface up if an aggressive situation develops it is important to face the crowd facing up will ensure that missiles which may be thrown will be seen and hopefully avoided facing up will also help to identify if team member has become isolated when facing up it is essential to have at least one team member watching the extraction route to ensure that team members do not become isolated and that both the extraction route and crowd are watched the team should work in pairs the baton gunner must work with the commander cavoid bunching when aggression develops there is strong urge for the patrol to bunch to find safety in numbers this should be avoided for the following reasons 1 the more soldiers the bigger the target for the crowd 2 bunching makes command and control more difficult as more teams get involved 3 generally only two men in each team are of any real use in dealing with the crowd and they are the commander and baton gunner 7breakclean positions team commanders must get their team into positions where they can mutually support the exposed team teams must be in position to react if others gets into difficulty observe key junctions to avoid the crowd outflanking the patrol advise the exposed team with the crowd on breakclean points 8the controlled move back to have controlled move back it is essential to have buffer zone between the exposed team and the crowd when buffer zone has been achieved it must be maintained and the exposed team moves back under control looking for suitable breakclean points there is tendency to turn and run after buffer zone has been achieved this should be avoided as it is unlikely that team members will outrun any crowd and they will not see what is being thrown at themd 23 3 issue 10 dec 989the use of the baton gun use of the baton gun is essential to create and maintain buffer zone which is essential before any controlled move back use of the baton gun would be governed by the roe baton gunner must be close to the team commander who in turn will control its use the gun may also be used at break clean points to delay the crowd and to assist the teams extraction minimum force should be used 10mutual support teams should not bunch teams must however be in position to support the exposed team there is also chance that the exposed team may have casualty which will then necessitate others moving to its assistance there should be well rehearsed sops for extracting vehicles from crowds minor crowd control 11background there could however be occasions when police resources are so stretched that the army is forced to work independently or is involved in large scale inter factional situation such occasions are rare however commanders have to be prepared for such eventualities and further guidance is given in the paragraphs below 12planning and preparation the most effective way to disperse rioters is by making arrests and making it plain that further rioting will only result in further physical discomfort to the rioter whenever making an arrest either on the spot or later by use of photographs or video it is essential that the suitable procedures are followed to ensure convictions where appropriate however in dealing with either crowd dispersal or containment an escape route must be left open to the crowd in order that those who wish to escape pitched battle may do so 13graduated responses in keeping with the policy of applying minimum force the following graduated response measures could be employed first try to talk down the situation with leaders or stewards to persuade them to disperse quietly the initial approach should be made by any policeman present and if possible soldiers with them should be dressed normally ideally any troops in riot clothing should be kept out of sight b if the initial step fails then riot troops should move quickly into position it is best if this is done in positive manner with few shouted orders the arrival of troops in this manner could be decisive and will certainly affect the resolve of any crowd c having established military presence cameras and video equipment can then be used to photograph the crowd and provide evidence for future retrospective arrests where this is appropriate d before using any riot weapons warning should be given in the appropriate language as described in the relevant roe when violence starts baton rounds should be fired in volleys at specific targets and not indiscriminately under the direction of the baseline commanderd 23 4 issue 10 dec 98f other special weapons could be available but would be only authorised for use by the senior commander of any british forces interfactional violence 14 the size of the force to deal with interfactional violence depends on the local situation but speed of reaction to the violence is essential patrol on the spot may clear crowd which minutes later may require whole sub unit 15 in an interfactional situation it may be possible to contain the crowd by placing the soldiers between the factions in doing this they are separated and then forced to withdraw to beyond the missile throwing range and if possible out of sight of each other the number of soldiers used depends on the size of the crowd and the distance over which they have to be separated armoured vehicles can be used to thicken up baseline and give added protection to the soldiers whilst at the same time giving an element of cover from view however this tactic may not be possible or even desirable 16 each theatre of operations should provide specific guidance on this form of violence depending on the role of the troops the mandate and the strength and ability of local forces including the police force once the situation has calmed down control is handed back to the police the use of photography 17 in dealing with the aftermath of violence and riot in urban areas the majority of retrospective arrests can be attributed to the successful use of photography it is therefore most important that cameras photographic or video are positioned to record the violence riot and that the films are handled in accordance with the usual handling procedures 18 cameras can be positioned within the baseline or in overt or covert ops 19 once the photographs have been developed again in accordance with usual handling procedures they must be handed over to the police who will add these photographs to their own photographic coverage of events and use them together with any video film in making up their retrospective arrest sequence of events 20 possible sequence of events could be try talking down situation b deploy sniper protection and establish baseline c issue warning d snatch squads in positiond 23 5 issue 10 dec 98e open fire with baton rounds and launch snatch squads f achieve aim by stabilising the area and allowing the police to function g withdraw h retrospective arrests by the police 21 the deployment of sniper protection the establishment of firm baseline and the positioning of arrest squads would be conducted by using tactical procedures and exercising military judgementd 24 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d24 crowd control issues introduction 1 belligerent and hostile crowds may assemble in spite of measures adopted to prevent this the civil authorities may be unable to cope and military assistance may be needed it is most important that commander should select the method of dispersing crowd most appropriate to the circumstances on the one hand relatively amiable crowd may be inflamed by an ill judged show of force while on the other an underestimate of the hostile intent of crowd and the deployment of an inadequate number of troops could be equally disastrous the tactics outlined in this serial should be used as guide the military commander on the spot has to use his own judgement as to how to deal with any particular situation in the emotive situation of dealing with hostile crowds it is necessary to cover generically the various types of crowd situation that may develop these range from that of minor and possibly routine aggressive behaviour of crowds towards patrolling to the larger and more potentially serious situations when hostile assemblies prison riots or anti authority demonstrations may occur to the experienced eye some of the tactics described may seem out of date and far too pedantic when dealing with disorders nevertheless it is necessary to record all these details because every situation is different and the military com mander should have range of tactical options available to suit the need the legal position of forces 2 before any detailed tactics and procedures can be outlined it is necessary to remind the reader that whatever the situation the three cardinal tenets of british law as applied to the armed forces remain fully in force that is their legal status in the uk or elsewhere status for forces agreement the legal justification for any military actions they take and the rules of engagement roe that pertain at the time minor incidents hostile assemblies and disruptive behaviour will vary considerably and the legal means of dealing with them will be different from state to state the tactics and procedures described in this chapter use the uk position as the model for any scenario in order to show the sort of planning and other military factors that commander will need to be address in these situations likewise the legal use of riot control weapons will also vary from state to state and british commander will have to ensure that he has firm and clear legal basis and authority to use any weapons in these situations this would apply also to tactical practices and any novel techniques considered to deal with crowds or riots particularly if these concern women and children the nature of crowds 3general the size of crowd is indication of its attitude it will often consist of many more peaceful citizens and sightseers than trouble makers and women and children may be present in large numbers however crowd which has confined itself to shouting slogans and making noise can quickly become violent if it is joined by violent elements or provoked by an injudicious show of force the presence of the following can indicate impending troubled 24 2 issue 10 dec 98a gangs of youths usually lightly clothed and possibly armed with sticks stones or bottles which may be used as petrol or acid bombs they are likely to be organized and even paid to provoke trouble to spark off antiauthority or factional feeling by using hit and run tactics they may be scattered in loose formation within crowd or combined in gangs which may be numbered in hundreds b gunmen within the crowd or in the surrounding buildings and side streets their aim may be not only to cause casualties but also to provoke the security forces into firing at the crowd c women and children or large bodies of school children either used separately or as shield to the crowd once again the main aim is provocation in the hope that there will be overreaction on the part of the security forces which can subsequently be exploited 4the role of the police the role of the police in countering crowd violence varies according to their strength and organization and the policy on their employment an armed police force with strong paramilitary capability is likely to be both well prepared and trained in riot drills the military force is therefore not likely to be asked to intervene until rioting has reached serious proportions on the other hand an unarmed force with traditional good humoured and persuasive approach in their dealings with the public will be less well able to deal with hostile crowds and may seek military assistance at comparatively early stage preparations for dealing with crowd disorders 5general as general precaution commander faced with situations where troops may have to respond to disturbances and crowd disorders should take due note of the provisions of chapter 5 volume ii of the manual of military law sections 23 and 31 are particularly relevant these obligations and duties will probably vary when soldier is involved with disorders abroad and separate legal instruction may well have to be issued nevertheless these obligations and duties do provide basic guideline for any military actions taken abroad when dealing with disturbances and crowd disorders 6the role of the civil authority the civil authorities even in pso situation are primarily responsible for dealing with crowds large assemblies marches industrial action and other similar disturbances to public good order there may well be situations when the scale of civil and public disturbances gets beyond the capabilities of the local police forces in this case the civil authorities normally in the form of the senior police representative present requests the military authorities to take over certain police duties which could include crowd control 7the role of the military authority as preliminary to such request it is probable that troops will already have been positioned at strategic points it will however be exceptional for them to be called to the actual scene of disturbance until decision has been taken at the appropriate level to employ military forces for the dispersal of crowds once the troops have been called in it is still the military commandersd 24 3 issue 10 dec 98responsibility not to use more force than is necessary and reasonable whether or not he takes action is likely to depend on the information and the advice of the civil authorities while he will normally be guided by these authorities he has to make his own judgement of what military assistance is both requisite and appropriate and he remains accountable for his actions in some pso situations it is possible that police or civil authorities are present at the scene of the incident for whatever reason while this does not absolve the military commander from taking suitable corrective action this should be tempered by the criteria covering the safety and security of his own troops b the protection of innocent persons c the prevention of real damage to state property 8military restraint the military commander should not use force if the civil authorities are still in control and have not asked for help in the particular incident in question or if crowds can be dispersed without the use of force 9planning as soon as disturbances are expected which may require military assistance contingency plans must be made which should cover the establishment of joint police and military operational headquarters where this is appropriate b an assessment of the different types of disturbances likely to develop their probable locations and the strengths and action needed to control or suppress them and any likely tasks or roles the military forces may have c an assessment of the troops which will be required for each locality and the earmarking of troops for each task d the arrangements for representatives of the civil authorities who may be police officers to join the troops joint reconnaissance if possible down to platoon or squad level f the channels through which requests for military help should be made g an assessment of critical areas and centres of communication which must be securely held h the collection of evidence by photographic means or by written or tape recorded eye witness accounts i the preparation of any special stores likely to be needed eg public address equipment dannert wire knife rests sandbags fire fighting equipment and emergency lightingd 24 4 issue 10 dec 98j the reception accommodation and administration of troops and reinforce ments k the rehearsal of procedures and the testing of communications in all areas where operations are likely there should be specific military frequency alloca tions so that radio can be used immediately on arrival l provision of equipment riot control agents and maps for reinforcing units m maintenance of up to date briefs to hand to commanders of reinforcing units on arrival n plans to divert civil traffic which should include provision for maintaining cleared routes for use by military reinforcements the use of interpreters during deployment 10preliminary military action before trouble breaks out the military commander has to decide in conjunction with the local authorities whether and where his troops should be concentrated where they should move to if disturbances occur and whether or not they should be seen to be available it will often be prudent to move close to the scene of an anticipated disturbance both to ensure that troops are readily available and to enable commanders to keep in touch with the situation commander must not however allow his forces to be scattered and should keep reserve under his control joint headquarters where this is applicable should be set up during this preliminary stage and the military and civil authorities must either be together in it or in close personal or radio contact 11information required from the civil authorities when the senior civil representa tive at the scene of the disturbance decides that he is unable to deal with the crowd he will call for reinforcements if the reinforcements are military he must give the following information which should be based on common format nominate an rv near to the scene of the incident b indicate the best route to the rv to ensure arrival from the right direction without interference this route should be kept open by the civil authorities if possible c an estimate of the size of the crowd its intentions and temper d any relevant topographical details including lighting problems at night the direction in which the crowd should be dispersed 12subsequent role of the police when the military commander takes over the local forces under civil control should normally be withdrawn into reserve but civil representative must remain with the military commander possible tasks for these forces ared 24 5 issue 10 dec 98a follow up quickly after the troops have used special equipment should the crowd show signs of wavering thus reestablishing police control b cover the troops rear by blocking side streets c make arrests and take into custody those arrested by the military forces 13the deployment of troops the course of events up to the moment when the decision to commit troops is taken is described in the previous section certain preliminary planning should have been completed by this stage and liaison with the civil authorities established further planning is now needed to decide the route and direction by which troops should arrive b whether the move should be ostentatious with planned show of force or unobtrusive c the tactics and weapons needed on arrival d an rv where the military and local commanders can meet it must be well clear of the crowd but with view of the scene of the disturbances preliminary orders for troops involved 14move of military forces into the area the decision whether to move troops openly or unobtrusively will depend on the cause and degree of the disturbance when it is of minor and local nature and particularly when violence has not yet occurred the appearance of troops may have calming effect but if the disturbance is more serious and widespread it may be wise to move in troops unobtrusively if the situation is serious and the local authorities are rapidly losing or have lost control troops must be moved in by the most direct open route the preliminary reconnaissance should have identified all the likely routes and civil action should be planned to speed movement by such measures as manual overriding of automatic traffic lights etc it is essential that the move in is orderly decisive and deliberate because when tension is running high this will have steadying effect local guides and traffic escorts should be provided if available troops must move in formed bodies and officers or experienced ncos must command all small parties or detachments particularly when armoured vehicles are used neither men nor vehicles must be employed singly and sentries or lookouts should be posted in pairs 15arrival of military forces troops should be prepared to intervene the moment they arrive at the scene of the disturbance so that the situation does not deteriorate through unnecessary delay they must therefore have well rehearsed deployment drill this does not mean that troops must always be used at once and it is particularly important that armoured vehicles should not make premature appearance which may rob commander of the advantage he would gain later from the shock effect of their sudden intervention troops should never be brought to the scene of disturbance until their intervention is required if they arrive too early and then have to stand about waitingd 24 6 issue 10 dec 98to be committed the crowd may either find their presence provocative or it may get used to them and be encouraged to think that stronger measures will be used 16transport the following points should be noted adebussing point if the military force moves to the scene of the disturbance in transport it should normally debus away from the area unless armoured or special vehicles are in use and it is considered advantageous to debus close to the crowd troops must debus quickly to practised drill with all their equipment and form up at once bsoft skinned transport transport should be left under guard well clear of the incident except for one vehicle which can be used to carry small party including policeman to deal quickly with any specific diversions such as splinter crowd setting fire to property looting or attacking an individual this vehicle can also carry wire or other barriers to block off side streets entrances to building etc and is useful when dominating the area afterwards it should if possible be fitted with protection kits and fire proof canopy and may carry powerful public address system and searchlights if armoured personnel carriers apcs are employed the commander may allot them tasks in the forward areas dependent upon the local situation when apcs are used well forward certain amount of the equipment can be left in them until required 17action on arrival there can be categoric sequence of events and some of the actions listed below may have to be done during earlier stages of preparation and planning once troops have arrived at the scene of disorder certain preparations must however either have been made or put into effect at once these are information on the situation must be obtained from local police rooftop standing patrols and helicopters b an assessment must be made of the best direction in which to disperse the crowd some factors affecting this would be the mood of the crowd and its intentions the existence of attractive targets and of other crowds and alterna tive dispersal routes c the method of handling the crowd must be decided it should not be bottled up but given time and room in which to disperse d the machinery for cooperation with the local authorities must be established deployment plans must ensure all round protection to prevent rioters from encircling security forces f it must be decided whether there will be deterrent value in arresting ring leadersd 24 7 issue 10 dec 98g the value of warning and persuasion without the use of force particularly when directed at community leaders is important and the use of minimum necessary force must always be borne in mind 18stopping moving crowd it will be usual to deploy troops to halt the progress of crowd and such deployment focuses the attention of the crowd thus distracting attention from other moves by the security forces it establishes base line from which ops are established and ground reconnaissance carried out b every effort is made to identify individuals in the crowd especially ringleaders using photography if possible at night lights will be necessary 19communications whenever troops are called to aid the local authorities it is the responsibility of the military commander not the local forces to see that they can communicate with each other even though this may be achieved by the provision of radio set on the local net for use by the military or by attaching liaison officer it is still military responsibility to see that it is done 20use of aircraft and helicopters depending on the threat posed aircraft particu larly helicopters may be employed on the following tasks reconnaissance to give early warning of crowd assembly and movement aerial television can relay pictures direct to ground headquarters b dominating crowd by flying or hovering overhead and drowning any speakers who may be addressing the crowd c dropping riot control agent if necessary and reasonable to do so d acting as an airborne command post or radio relay station positioning ops on high buildings or lifting troops to the roofs of those occupied by crowds or snipers f public address by means of loudspeakers g night illumination h photography 21military records military action in support of the civil authorities may be the subject of subsequent enquiry it is therefore essential to be able to establish what happened and complete record must be kept of all events as they occur the use of pocket tape recorder can eliminate the need for laborious note taking and provides convincing record for subsequent use commanders at all levels must arrange for diary to be kept in which are noted such things asd 24 8 issue 10 dec 98a important events in chronological order b brief details of any orders received and issued either in writing or orally c the names of civil representatives or police officers with whom the commander has consulted d brief details of any requests proposals and advice given by the civil authorities reasons for decisions subsequent action taken and results 22photographs photographs form valuable record of events but hand held video recorder provides more effective and immediate record of events with dates and times superimposed prudent commander will ensure that both cameras and video recorders are available to cover any event where trouble is anticipated helicopters can easily be employed to record events by camera or video for the commander on the ground the use of the media to obtain suitable photographs video film shots and other associated evidence should also be considered it may be appropriate for the superior hq to monitor and record the international tv and media outlets if the incident has attracted such attention 23politicalreligious leaders the role and potential participation of political or religious leaders in large assemblies needs careful advance consideration and the options available to the military commander discussed and cleared at the appropriate level before action if any takes place 24crowd control equipment in some cases the use of crowd control equipment such as visors and body armour can be provocative and will need assessing by the commander before any situation gets so out of control that these items become essential the use of such equipment in tropical environments may also give troops an additional unnecessary burden in tense and difficult situationd 25 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d25 dispersing crowds and riots general 1 crowd nearly always includes innocent people caught up in it through circumstanc or idle curiosity it may also shelter agitators well aware of the capital to be made out of the spilling of innocent blood who will seek to provoke the security forces into ill considered hasty action it is therefore important that more than the minimum necessary force is used to disperse crowd and that the methods employed are appropriate to its mood and the local situation the commander must consider which method of crowd dispersal best fits the situation the measures which can be used short of opening fire are described in this serial persuasion 2 attempts by the civil authorities should always be made to persuade crowds to disperse peacefully if possible this would normally be the responsibility of the police military forces should normally only be called in when the situation has gone beyond this point nevertheless some of the methods available are avoluntarily as first step and one which may often be the most effective and the least provocative unobtrusive discussion with the leaders involved may lead to the orderly dispersal of crowd moreover this dispersal will appear to be voluntary rather than enforced by the security forces bverbal or visual persuasion the crowd may be addressed by loud hailer or by some other form of amplified system which may be hand held or mounted on vehicle or aircraft announcements should always be prepared by someone with knowledge of local affairs who can advise on the most persuasive approach an announcer with local accent may also be effective and an interpreter may be needed if expert is available then commander may have to extemporize it is always most profitable to address responsible members of the crowd and rely on them to influence the remainder when adopting any of these methods some pitfalls which should be avoided are 1pleas pleading from position of moral or physical strength may be logical and productive stage in the process of dispersal however it is more likely than not that pleas from position of weakness will produce an adverse effect 2promises while promises may produce an immediate and positive result the longer term results of rash promises made without due authority will inevitably be negative and damaging to the security forces 3threats any attempt to force crowd to disperse by threat of the use of force which cannot be justified legally in the circumstances may provoke the crowd and discredit the security forcesd 25 2 issue 10 dec 98cobservation and containment there are numerous occasions when to contain observe and threaten crowd should be enough the lack of suitable target in the shape of the security forces may cause the crowd to disperse from fear or boredom the ringleaders may have particular difficulty in inciting the crowd if there is suitable target for them to attack dshow of force this may be ostentatious which can be provocative or it may be conducted more circumspectly an ostentatious display of force may be very effective on those drawn into the crowd more by curiosity than conviction if however it inflames feelings the situation may get rapidly worse less provocation can be achieved by posting ops particularly on rooftops and high buildings where they can be seen so that the crowd becomes aware of military presence and individuals may begin to fear being surrounded and decide to leave their departure can be infectious and the crowd should be allowed to melt away while an open show of force may require that all troops available are seen more unobtrusive approach should always be backed up by reserve this may be needed should an isolated detachment be attacked or surrounded tactics when facing crowd 3 in some situations the police forces may well be organised and equipped to deal with crowd disorders and the military commander should note that police forces outside the uk would operate in very different ways and with differing types of equipment in addition new tactics and weapons possibly non lethal would indicate that all forms of dealing with disturbances should be rigorously examined and rehearsed before being taken into use as rule in any adopted formation the sections are deployed from front to rear instead of across the frontage of the area this arrangement enables unit to formally escalate the degree of force used by changing the front rank or to break box and adopt tactical fire positions under section control if confronted by small arms fire or worse the components of force 4general whether directly in support of the civil authorities or working independently the military force should generally be made up of the following four components the strength of each component in relation to each other will depend entirely on the situations and the role allocated to the military force baseline force b an arresting force snatch squad where appropriate c an antisniper screen d reserve 5the baseline force the baseline is barrier from which offensive action may be taken against crowds and behind which reorganisation can take place it will consistd 25 3 issue 10 dec 98usually of combination of vehicles and soldiers on foot carrying mix of baton guns and shields the line should be able to move forwards or backwards whilst retaining blocking capability there may be occasions however when the aim of the baseline is to remain static and in such instances there could be knife rests or some other form of barricade in place of vehicles the baseline will invariably be established as the first stage of controlling crowd and serves as the mainstay of dispersal or containment operations possible uses are as follows adispersal 1 holding ground while the arresting force in the form of snatch squads operate either through it or around its flanks 2 to move forward as an entity and in conjunction with baton guns and snatch squads disperse crowd by forcing it back bcontainment 1 holding ground on flanks and side roads while the main police force carry out blocking or dispersal operations in the area of maximum trouble 2 acting as back up to the police and moving forwards or backwards behind the police while they disperse crowd in front of the baseline in this instance the baseline will also act as line behind which the police can fall reorganise before recommencing offensive operations ccomposition suggested composition and layout of baseline force is shown at figure 1 it should be noted that the actual strengths and mix of weapons will depend on each situation and should be decided upon at the planning stage 6baseline composition suggested organisation for platoon sized baseline is two teams as shield men carrying 6 foot shields and batons they should wear helmets with visors down winged vehicles enable the number of baseline troops to be reduced b one team providing baton gun men for shield line c one team providing close antisniper protection and lookouts for acid petrol and blast bombs d one team as snatch squad or if provide from elsewhere the team can be used as extra batons or shield men one team commanders team including platoon commander and platoon sergeant with 2 soldiers to put out soldiers on fire splash down acid bomb victims with water and act as resupply runners for baton rounds they may also be used to escort anyone arrested celld 25 4 issue 10 dec 987the arrest force the military forces may be required to make arrests when acting in direct support of the police and will almost certainly find it essential to make arrests when working in isolation as arrests are the only really effective means of dispersal there are three aspects to making arrests aarrest snatch squads should be nominated to make arrests with the actual number of snatch squads and composition of each dependent on the situation and the number of troops available at the time the organisation below is the minimum recommended appointment weapon task 1 commander baton gun select target cover man 2 snatcher baton make arrest 3 snatcher baton make arrest bescort an escort with rifle may also be nominated as additional antisniper cover in exceptional circumstances such cover would normally be provided within the overall area plan for protection csnatch squads these should be carefully briefed on the following points 1 faultless arrest procedures to ensure conviction 2 the further forward they move from the baseline the more vulnerable they become limit of exploitation should be given 3 arrest only one individual at time the squad commander should make the selection 4 the dangers of splitting up 5 speed of action dprocessing arrested persons in addition to the snatch squads it may be necessary if this is not being handled by the police to have an arrest cell to process arrests whilst correct procedures and continuity of evidence are essential all involved must be aware of the necessity to move arrested persons to police custody as soon as possible eretrospective arrests finally and especially if the police are not present full use should be made of video and photography for retrospective arrests 8antisniper screen the military force will almost certainly be requested to provide antisniper cover for the whole operation time permitting the cover should be planned in advance and positions checked by reconnaissance it should be plannedd 25 5 issue 10 dec 98figure 1 suggested layout for baseline forcexxxx x tflank sniper coverflank sniper cover out of sight of crowd

98on an area basis and cover forward of the baseline and also the flanks and rear because such cover may have to be provided from high ground remote from the main position it is essential that sensible men are chosen and communications are good 9reserves as in any military operation reserve is essential to afford flexibility to the commander the reserve should be positioned centrally and must be prepared for any task from thickening up the baseline to providing extra antisniper cover or additional snatch squads it must be mobile and equipped to cover any eventuality dispersal measures 10 ringleaders in crowd or small parties of hooligans throwing stones or other missiles are usually bent on creating trouble without being caught if they think they are likely to be arrested they usually move to another area the incitement of the crowd or stone throwing may be an end in itself or it may be only the first phase of plan to cause major widespread trouble or to draw troops into an area where they can be ambushed with firearms surprise moves will catch them before they can move away or put the next stage of their plan into operation the aim of the military forces is to disperse the crowd it is important to select dispersal routes which will be attractive to the crowd namely those leading to their homes and to keep these exits clear as the crowd starts to disperse there are number of tactics which may prove successful assault from an unsuspected direction such as the flank or rear of the crowd as shown in figure 2 it may be possible to move over roofs or through top storeys through gardens or even by underground routes if these are well known to the security forces routes for such moves must be clear or the outflanking party may get involved in running fight with parts of the crowd and surprise will be lost flanking moves should usually be covered by standing patrols on high buildings or other suitable positions b when the crowd is in the open it may be possible to use speed to achieve surprise by moving vehicles rapidly into the area of the crowd from the flanks or rear c surprise frontal assault may be successful d withdrawal of the baseline will usually draw the crowd forward and expose its flanks to prepositioned arrest squads which can quickly move in on the ringleaders special weapons can be useful in dispersing crowd use of riot control weapons 11 weapons for use in riot control situations will rarely be decisive in themselves they may however give the security forces temporary advantage which must be quickly exploited perhaps by the use of arrest squads in the early stages of operations in any area it is preferable to precede their use by warning to the crowd the most usual weapons currently available ared 25 7 issue 10 dec 98aprodders and pushers these can be either hand held or mounted on vehicles when vehicle mounted they can be wired to give small electrical shock they may be difficult to manoeuvre where there are obstructions such as palings lamp posts telephone boxes etc hand held devices can be improvised to move crowd back slowly and steadily and for this purpose coils of dannert wire carried by line of soldiers or bounced in front of soldiers can be effective hand held devices can rarely be used against an aggressive crowd which is hurling missiles bwater under pressure water under pressure can be projected from water cannons or fire hoses water cannons should operate in pairs so that one can be away filling up they are large vehicles which may be difficult to manoeuvre in narrow streets and they must be escorted to and from the area and protected while in operation fire engines and fire hoses will become targets for violence once they have been used to quell disturbances and this and the possible urgent need for them in their conventional role should be taken into account before sanctioning their use the ways in which water can be used are 1as douse this may be the most humane way of dispersing crowd with high proportion of women and children epecially in cold weather 2as jet this can temporarily neutralize rioter and even knock him over at ranges of less than five metres the jet must be aimed at the feet not the body cs in solution in the jet will enhance the effect 3to spray dye this helps in the subsequent identification of rioters who fearing arrest may therefore disperse the presence of dye on person is not in itself sufficient evidence to obtain conviction on the charge of unlawful assembly cbaton rounds these are nonlethal large calibre rubber or plastic projectiles which are accurate at short ranges their use must be governed by rules of engagement driot control agents the standard riot control agent is cs which causes watering and irritation of the eyes choking and coughing the effects usually disperse in five to ten minutes but it takes determined person to remain in cs concentration cs can be delivered by riot gun pistol or by grenade mace is on issue to some police forces and this together with other varieties of non lethal agents may well be employed in the future british servicemen can only make use of equipment and agents that have been officially authorised in advance by the ministry of defence commander must take the following into account before using cs 1 the size temper and composition of the crowd cs may induce panic in tightly packed crowd 2 whether wind conditions will allow the speedy buildup of an effective concentrationd 25 8 issue 10 dec 98figure 2 example of crowd dispersal assault from an unexpected directionbuildings

contain riots 12countering hostile action determined and experienced insurgent organization will be able to anticipate the usual security force deployment drills and crowd may be assembled with the intention of drawing forces into selected area where they can be ambushed commander should be alert to this and some precautionary measures are the deployment of force of such size that any ambush party is likely to be surrounded or taken in the rear before it can act b the use of armoured vehicles to carry troops through dangerous areas c caution in following retreating crowd and the use of cover when doing so 13guarding against being outflanked subunit that is outflanked by crowd may either have to fight its way out or it may be necessary to divert troops from other tasks to rescue it in either case the credibility of the troops as an effective force will be reduced outflanking can be prevented by not allowing small subunits to become detached and unsupported b constant monitoring of crowds by rooftop ops patrols and helicopters c the sealing of flank approaches this could well be suitable task for the civil police particularly if they have been withdrawn into reserve 14the use of armoured personnel carriers apcs apcs provide protection from small arms fire give extra mobility to force and firm communications base they do however need to be protected from antiarmour weapons they may be useful to mount surprise attack b surmount or break barricades or force an entry into buildingd 25 10 issue 10 dec 98c provide illumination with spotlights these can also be used to dazzle rioters at night d act as crowd barrier for which purpose they can be electrified they can also be used as screen between opposing factions clear large crowd if several apcs are used in line abreast f evacuate casualties and detainees under fire 15dealing with women and children women and children are often involved in disturbances for publicity purposes as well as being used as cover for hostile groups the aim being to provoke the security forces into taking harsh action which can subsequently be used as hostile propaganda because women and children are exploited for their propaganda value the less made of any incident the better if possible the incident should be handled by police making full use of women police if arrest becomes necessary b it is often possible to play on the emotional factors physical lack of endurance and dislike of discomfort of women and children marches and sitdowns can some times be permitted to continue under control until boredom has brought the demonstration to an end c if force becomes necessary the less the degree of such force used the less will be the adverse propaganda value the following factors apply 1 the level of force which may be the minimum necessary against man or youth could be excessive or unreasonable in the case of woman or child 2 not all special weapons are appropriate for use against women and children baton rounds are an example the water cannon in the dousing role is most suitable causing discomfort and loss of dignity but injury 3 close physical contact with women and children to force them away may be justified but it must be remembered that they too are quite capable of using knives and other weapons troops bouncing rolls of dannert wire before them or the use of vehicle mounted barriers may achieve the aim with less risk provided always that their use is the minimum necessary force reasonable in the circumstances 4 the sooner arrested women and children are handed over to women police military or civil the less scope there is for smear campaign against security forces d despite the involvement of women and children in incidents for publicity and diversionary reasons it should be noted that all modern insurrections have included women who are just as committed to insurgency as their maled 25 11 issue 10 dec 98counterparts and who have carried out assassinations bombings and other insurgent activity it follows that soldier is just as much entiled to use force even lethal force to prevent woman or child causing death or serious injury when they are illegally involved in an attack it is always question of what in the circumstances is necessary and reasonable every case must be dealt with on its own merits using combination of firmness and common sense 16crowd dispersal in open spaces dispersing crowd in large open space may be more difficult because larger crowds can assemble b their direction of movement is less easy to anticipate and subsequently to canalize the security forces can therefore be more easily enveloped or outflanked c it may be difficult to establish baseline d some special weapons are less effective because their results can more easily be avoided evariations some adjustments have to be made to the techniques already described and in general terms these are 1 decide where the crowd can be allowed to go and deploy accordingly 2 employ an adequate number of troops in large area this should seldom be less than battalion 3 consider the use of armoured vehicles and special weapons 4 maintain an adequate mobile reserve 5 maintain continual observation on the crowd to detect any change in its mood or objective 17handling of dispersing crowd once crowd has started to disperse it may occasionally be necessary for troops to advance to keep it on the move in the right direction troops advancing and driving crowd before them should remember that the pace will be that of those furthest away crowd on the move in the right direction should not be hurried those able to see the troops will doubt be going as fast as they can and not nearly so fast as they would wish on account should the crowd be hemmed in so that it is unable to disperse 18subsequent domination of the area an operation does not end with the dispersal of crowd which must not be given the opportunity to reassemble joint plan must be made by military and police for patrolling the area after the dispersal of crowd and for removing any barricades erected by it if possible local residents should bed 25 12 issue 10 dec 98persuaded to remove the barricades themselves or at least assist in doing so only when the military and police commanders are both satisfied that the crowd is not reassembling or that the police alone can handle the situation should the troops be

grenades are to be fired in the case of cs order respirators to be put on this should be done by groups to avoid gap in fire cover or observation it is sometimes possible to achieve surprise by firing cs before donning respirators which can then be put on whilst the cs is affecting the crowd f if the crowd do not disperse order cs to be fired or thrown or baton rounds to be fired 23 if the crowd still does not disperse give further orders to fire more cs or baton rounds to greater effect the number and type of baton rounds and cs grenades or cartirdges fired should be carefully recorded firing riot control weapons from baseline 24 when firing riot control weapons from baselines the shield line should part this can be done by either parting the shields as at figure 3a or fanning shields as at figure 3b it is evident that this provides more cover during engagement the method shown at figure 3c should not be used as the riot gun cannot be aimed properly figure 3a figure 3b figure 3cd 26 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d26 opening fire during crowd dispersal general 1 it will be rare for fire to be opened except in situation of very serious rioting roe usually cover the opening of fire only in circumstances where there is real threat to lives this would apply equally to commander as well as the individual soldier although all have the right to open fire in self defence if lives are at risk responibility for opening fire 2 although there may be exceptional occasions when an individual is forced to open fire on his own initiative the responsibility normally rests with the commander on the spot who will not order fire to be opened unless he is satisfied that the situation is so dangerous that other means at his disposal are ineffective and that it is necessary and reasonable to do so orders covering occasions when fire may be used in crowd dispersal operations must be issued to all troops in accordance with the instructions of the senior military commander in the theatre all commanders must ensure that their soldiers fully understand these orders and are continually reminded of them the military commander on the spot should if possible consult with police or civil representatives present before ordering fire to be opened but he cannot ask them to take or even share the responsibility for his actions every effort must be made to prevent troops being overrun by crowd if there appears to be serious and immediate danger of this happening to such an extent that soldier considers his own life or others are at risk then it may be necessary to open fire number of police forces are armed with small arms or shot guns and may resort to their use for crowd control the engagement of crowd with weapons of this type does not set precedent for military commander operating in support of the police for opening fire with weapons under his command sequence for opening fire 3 when the military commander decides that fire has to be opened he will as far as possible take the following action attempt to warn the crowd by all suitable means that effective fire will be opened unless it disperses at once this can be done by the display of banners showing the necessary warning in the vernacular or an announcement over loud hailer megaphone or public address equipment in some situations hand held or vehicle mounted loud hailer equipment may be the only really effective means of warning in rapidly deteriorating situation it may not be possible to warn the crowd adequately and these methods may have to be abandoned altogether b give the order personally to the unit commander concerned indicating the target and the number of rounds to be fired1 he will ensure that the number of rounds 1 the and possibly other international alliances may insist on the use of warning shots in these situations before aimed fire is adoptedd 26 2 issue 10 dec 98is the minimum necessary to achieve the immediate aim marksmen should be used and steps must be taken to conceal the identity of the firer so that reprisals cannot later be taken against him c if soldier is forced to fire on his own volition without the previous direct authority of his commander then steps should be taken to bring that situation under the immediate control of superior nco or officer so that subsequent action can be properly directed and controlled within the overall context of the operation other factors 4 certain additional factors should be noted and implemented where appropriate these are 5 where the local police are armed only with shotguns for crowd control the rioters should if possible be engaged with these weapons before military firepower is used this will indicate to the crowd that the security forces are prepared to use fire whilst restricting its initial use to the less lethal low velocity weapons 6 fire should only be deliberately directed at persons who are visibly presenting the serious danger against which fire has been ordered the point of aim must be the centre of the body of the target 7 the rifle is the best weapon to use in the face of crowd because its fire is easily controlled and can be directed accurately against individuals rapid fire from rifles or bursts from automatic weapons should be authorised only in the gravest emergency 8 in really serious riot the threat of automatic fire from the machine gun of an armoured vehicle is powerful deterrent to hostile crowd and will also be ideal for dealing with any hostile group supplementing the threat by sniping from buildings since automatic fire scatters it should not be used if innocent people would be put at risk an armoured vehicle used in this role must be provided with close infantry protection but must not open fire unless that degree of force would be reasonable in the circumstances 9 ammunition must be strictly controlled and accounted for this ensures that troops do not possess unofficial ammunition and prevents ammunition falling into the hands of adversaries the control of ammunition is particularly important because it provides check on the number of rounds expended and acts as deterrent to careless handling or unauthorized firing by troops action after firing 10 the effect of fire must be judged by the reaction of the crowd and not by the number of casualties as soon as it is considered that the necessary effect has been achieved the following action should be taken firing must be stopped at once empty cartridge cases must be collected and countedd 26 3 issue 10 dec 98b immediate help must be given to any wounded any dead bodies must be collected and held until they can be handed over to the police they should not be removed by relatives friends or supporters c any necessary steps must be taken to help to clear the area but in so doing it is important that the exits are not blocked and that action involving the use of force is taken against people who are trying to disperse d efforts must still be made to arrest the ringleaders where possible this should be done by the police 11 any person arrested by military forces should be handed over to the police as soon as possible care being taken to maintain the chain of evidence troops together with representatives of the civil authorities and police should remain at the scene of the disturbance until it is clear that the situation has been restored 12 after an officer has ordered fire to be used he will as soon as possible render written report to his superior officerd 27 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d27 employment of heavy weapons and supporting arms 1 other serials in this handbook have covered the main components of military activity in pso operations indeed in most instances these activities may well be enough to disrupt and disorganise hostile groups however it should be noted that where operations have degenerated to such stage that heavy weapons mortars field artillery and other more sophisticated military equipment is being utilised then the military forces would have to make use of similar weapons and equipment to neutralise groups of hostile forces 2 in this context commander should not rule out the use of infantry support weapons artillery air power and possibly naval or marine capabilities to achieve result in any campaign there are recent examples of this in the balkans and ethiopia the roe for the use of these weapons in pso situation would be provided by the force commander but the tactical deployment and use of the troops concerned would be on the lines of those utilised in general war artillery for instance could be deployed to support patrolling activity ops and in larger scale operations 3 in some instances commander may include the deployment of armoured units or artillery in very public display of strength and capability in order to pass message to opposing belligerent forces should this occur it would be prudent to have contingencies in hand in case bluff is drawn and these units have to be deployed and operate their weaponsd 28 1 issue 10 dec 98serial d28 securing an operational base background 1 experience in past campaigns has indicated that there may be need for military forces to deploy for operations in an area which is deemed to be hostile and where form of law and order exists at all the area may even be classed as go area to the legitimate authorities in particular country general requirements 2 an operational base may be defined as an area providing firm base from which military action against any hostile forces can be developed its establishment would generally be undertaken as joint or multinational operation 3 the normal requirements and characteristics of an operational base are that it should be base sufficient in size for formation or joint headquarters estab lished at seat of local government if this is not possible easy access to the centre of local administration is essential b it should be located in an area from which operations can be successfully veloped throughout the allocated boundaries projected operations and opera tions in depth have to be within convenient helicopter range c it should contain suitable airfield site in some circumstances helicopter landing strip may have to suffice initially but it should be capable of rapid devel opment for use by tactical air transport aircraft for air dropping large quantities of engineer plant or stores d the immediate vicinity of the base should be at least temporarily free from inter ference it should be easily defensible if it is surrounded by natural obstacles so much the better if not the ground of tactical significance that lies outside the immedi ate perimeter should be controlled f the area of the base should be large enough to accommodate the logistic units and dumps necessary to support the military force being deployed but as small as possible to facilitate its defence g the base should be accessible by road or track so that tracked vehicles and heavy plan can be brought in probably by road convoy this requirement is not always possible to achieve and more extensive use of air transport may have to be made for bringing in vehicles and plant secure land line of communica tion may well be impossible to maintaind 28 2 issue 10 dec 98occupation 4 the occupation of an operational base may be entirely peaceful but if it has to be achieved in the face of some opposition careful consideration has to be given to the method of approach if combined air and land approach is employed it is important to plan the correct balance and to coordinate the timing of the arrival of both groups of forces as an example it may be necessary for the airfield site to be secured initially by troops inserted by aircraft or helicopter followed by rapid build up with some forces air landed and some moving by road whatever the precise circum stances the following factors should be considered there can be question of seizing an operational base in the face of strong military opposition this would be an operation of different nature the close defence of any airfield should be established as soon as possible b it is likely that there will be hostile activity against the base within short space of time c in planning the build up careful consideration has to be given to possible threats infantry supported by armour andor artillery are likely to be the first require ment but if there is an air threat some priority may have to be given to air fence engineer plant and stores may also be needed early to develop the airstrip rapidly d both the air and land approach operations will need to be carefully planned and executed it is possible that some form of demonstrations against the arrival of military forces may take place during the occupation of the base and there should be contingency plan to cater for this possibility defence and sequence of build up 5general the measures outlined below envisage defence against hostile activity such as sabotage raids or military attacks possibly supported by heavy weapons and indirect fire the defence commitment for the base could be reduced as the surrounding countryside is cleared and as the controlled area is enlarged by subse quent operations when planning defence arrangements every man capable of bear ing arms should be included and has to be fit and trained for such duties within the base this could apply to those in nongovernment agencies 6all round defence every unit or staff of an administrative installation should be given sector to defend with arcs of fire weapon pits obstacles and patrol areas installations should be protected from sabotage and attacks special attention being given to items particularly attractive to an adversary eg weapons ammunition ex plosives and parked aircraft maximum use has to be made of wire mines booby traps alarm systems illumination surveillance devices and guard dogs together with any locally improvised devices all main and isolated positions should be ord 28 3 issue 10 dec 98ganized for all round defence guard posts and detachments in isolated positions covering approaches to the base should be dug in with overhead cover be pro tected by wire mines and improvised obstacles and have reserves of ammunition supplies and water duplicated system of communication between all posts in the base should be established the use of booby traps if authorised can be two edged weapon in hot humid climate it is essential that early warning devices are checked regularly to ensure they are in working order and the danger of friendly troops initiating booby traps during these checks needs to be appreciated 7command if force commander assumes command of the operational base he and his staff could become immersed in defence details and less able to pay as much attention as they should to other operations someone else is needed to com mand the base area as every component of the force or its echelons could be present and the coordination of the defence and detailed command is large and compli cated task in ideal circumstances deputy force commander should be nominated this officer together with suitable headquarters for the control of the operational base would provide the most practical solution 8sequence of build up the build up of the operational base may take some time depending on the distances involved and the resources available the sequence for land forces might be an air landing by an infantry battalion group or parachute forces b the assumption of overall control of the defence by the battalion group c plan which directs the deployment of units and installations to selected areas d reception arrangements by the battalion group for the follow up troops and echelons patrolling by the battalion in areas close to the base f the hand over of sectors of the perimeter to followup battalion groups g frequent clearance searches of the base area and adjacent country h the reception of any road convoys i followup battalions patrol within the base area and its surrounds j the opening up of an airstrip k the battalion group may still be primarily concerned with the defence of the base and the provision of any reserve force l the establishment of limited controlled aread 28 4 issue 10 dec 98m the expansion of the controlled area n the introduction of local military and paramilitary forces to assist in the defence of the base in the patrolling of the controlled area and the establishment of defended villages etc operations in depth start concurrently with the establishment of the controlled area p the progressive reduction of the number of infantry units required to ensure the security of the base initially this will be high but as soon as the domination of the immediate surrounding area is successful the numbers can be reduced 9defence the ideal defensive plan should ensure that hostile small arms rockets or mortar fire can damage anything in the base this will seldom if every be practica ble because of the size of the problem every effort has to be made to prevent hostile small arms from being able to engage aircraft approaching and leaving any airfield if larger defence areas are needed to cover longer airstrips then further patrols are needed to protect against those with shoulder fired missiles 10patrolling while the area of the base itself should be patrolled by any units located in the base the infantry battalions should be used for patrolling in the operational area in the following ways in general patrolling should extend from the perimeter of the base out to the limit of the range of hostile mortars and rockets this patrolling must of course be tied in with or be part of the controlled area patrol programme compre hensive and detailed random patrol plan will be needed and maximum use must be made of listening devices detectors and surveillance equipment b patrols should operate within the range of artillery support 11security measures in addition to normal security precautions the following require special consideration in connection with the defence of the base the declaring of prohibited and restricted areas for civilian movement b under some circumstances it may be necessary to stop all movement except patrolling within the base after dark c local labour which always constitutes major security risk needs to either be carefully screened and supervised or escorted d the timings and methods of patrolling changing guards and detachments and other routine matters has to be varied guards and patrols might be supported by tracker and guard dogsd 28 5 issue 10 dec 98f depending upon the nature of the threat full use should be made of all forms of illumination including floodlights searchlights if available and illumination pro vided by mortars artillery or aircraft g the provision of earthwork protection for vulnerable equipment and stores h under certain conditions harassing fire can be used to disrupt the activities of insurgents 12reserves in addition to the mobile reserve which is held ready for use within the controlled area as whole small central reserve for the defence of the operational base is essential tasks for this reserve has to be planned and rehearsed and should include well coordinated fire plan the infantry reserve might use helicopters or apcs helicopters are particularly vulnerable if there is requirement to get behind any hostile forces and cut off their withdrawal there is danger of helicopter landing sites being ambushed through this can be reduced by short period of prophylactic fire from artillery or armed helicopters immediately before site is used 13armour armoured vehicles provide valuable fire support whilst the base is being established their presence alone often acts as deterrent thereafter they are likely to be required for both defensive and offensive tasks these will need to be protected and incorporated into the overall plan for defence of the base 14artillery and mortars the defence of an operational base may require coordinated massed fire support to counter determined attack all available weapon systems have to be coordinated usually by the senior artillery officer into one plan which will include the tasking of offensive air support attack or armed helicopters and all indi rect fire weapons deployed within range fortifications should be constructed so as to reduce the risk to own troops when fire is brought in close to the base the follow ing points should be considered acalibre 155mm artillery provides great range and coverage however it im poses significant logistic burden this may be difficult to sustain and 105mm guns and mortars may have to suffice particularly during the early stages of campaign bstap coordinated stap should be implemented this could include artillery ops with their specialist equipment and mortarartillery locating equipment to support patrolling and uavs for incorporation into the stap clogistics the logistic effort to support artillery within base will be large com pared with that for most other elements in addition to the obvious logistic impli cations of artillery ammunition large quantities of defence stores may be needed to protect it and provide for gun pits ddeployment the artillery and mortars deployed within base may be the only guaranteed fire support available to it however terrain limitations the physical dimensions of individual forward bases and the minimum range deployabilityd 28 6 issue 10 dec 98and sustainability of guns may indicate that fire support can be better and more flexibly provided from other mutually supporting and similarly established bases due weight has to be given to the early deployment of fire support assets 15air defence the possibility of air attacks from within the or from neighbouring country which is supporting these hostile forces has to be considered in the threat assessment before operations to secure the base are mounted suitable air defence capabilities to counter the air threat will be part of the overall contingency planning these capabilities will need regular review in the light of subsequent events 16engineers engineer considerations are likely to be critical both for the selection of the site for the operational base and for the timing of the operation particularly the opening of tactical airfield engineer tasks in the base may include the construction and maintenance of an airhead together with the necessary bulk fuel installations maintenance facilities and protective defences b the forward tactical air strip c vstol sites if necessary d the improvement of port or beach exit facilities combat engineer support f the establishment of water point 17control of air space in the initial stages apart from hostile air and ground action hazards to low flying aircraft in the area of the operational base arise from collision and from friendly artillery and mortar fire because of the nature of the threat and the fact that at least initially the base has to expect attack from any direction the close co ordination and control of weapons and aircraft is most important this is done by fire support coordination centre fscc and an air support operations centre asoc summary 18 operations of this type to obtain secure base in potentially hostile environment can be time consuming and expensive in manpower and material it could also be come focus for future aggressive action by hostile forces the significance of mount ing such operations probably goes well above the tactical level and commanders will need to gauge carefully the risks and rewards for such activity nevertheless it is quite feasible to pick out and use some of the tactical guidance provided in establish ing such base when conducting similar operations at lower scale and level and in more permissive environment
