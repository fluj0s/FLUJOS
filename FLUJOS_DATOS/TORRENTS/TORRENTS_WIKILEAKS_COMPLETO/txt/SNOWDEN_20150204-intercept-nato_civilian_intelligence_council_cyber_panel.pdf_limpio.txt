secretrel to usa nato nimcyber talking points14 september 2011 subjectsrel nato nato civilian intelligence councilcyber panel national input threat overview u ufouo thank you for the opportunity to discuss our assessment on the cyber threat to nato i would like to start by making clear distinction between the terms cyber espionage and cyber attack cyber espionage is the theft of information that is being stored or transmitted as digital data cyber attack refers to malicious activity intended to disrupt data networks or deny access to them to manipulate or corrupt the data on them or to cause physical damage to infrastructure and equipment connected to them srel nato we believe it is important to maintain clear distinction between cyber espionage and cyber attacks because the probability of consequences from and response to the two types of cyber incidents are distinctly different the vast majority of cyber incidents against nato networks are cyber espionage not cyber attacks srel nato we assess that cyber espionage isand will remainthe principle threat to nato systems over the next three years we judge that cyber attacks against nato networks by most nation states including russia and china are unlikely outside of the context of diplomatic or military conflict however we are concerned that the access that adversaries gain from cyber espionage activities could accelerate the deployment of cyber attacks in the event of such conflict b specifics u b1 threat actors u srel nato russia poses the greatest cyber threat to nato computer networks due to its strategic interests its record of effective cyber collection and its capability to target and disrupt nato and member state computer infrastructures secretrel to usa nato1 secretrel to usa nato srel nato russia is robust multidisciplinary cyber actor with proven access and tradecraft which can conduct the full scope of operations including computer network exploitation insiderenabled operations supplychain operations and computer network attack srel nato in addition russian nationalist hackerswho previously conducted cyber attacks against estonian and georgian networkscould target nato systems in the event of military or diplomatic conflict that pitted nato against russian interests srel nato china lags behind russia in terms of sophistication but the scale and scope of their overall cyber activities and their increasing interest in information associated with nato and its member states makes them the second most strategic threat to nato networks srel nato beijing has dramatically expanded its cyber espionage operations in the last five years and has conducted network intrusionsprobably sponsored by the peoples liberation armyagainst us military and diplomatic organizations srel nato we judge that chinas concerns over nato activities on its periphery including isaf operations in afghanistan almost certainly would make nato information and networks target for chinese cyber espionage srel nato although hacktivist groups such as anonymous have made headlines recently with their theft of nato information the threat posed by such activity is minimal relative to that of nationstates srel nato one area of concern however is the possibility of nationstates using hackers as proxies for their own operations difficulties with realtime attribution make it difficult to quickly identify threats meaning that cyber espionage or cyber attacks can be disguised as cybercrime or patriotic hacking activity the example of russian nationalist hackers targeting estonia and georgia serves to underscore this concern b2 methods u srel nato srel nato we assess that any unclassified nato network that is directly connected to the internet should be considered potentially compromised creating uncertainty regarding the confidentiality integrity and continued availability of all data on that network spear phishing although relatively unsophisticated at technical level has proved to be an effective intrusion method for many malicious actors full implementation of security best practices would help to significantly reduce the threat of cyber espionage against unclassified networks secretrel to usa nato 2 secretrel to usa nato srel nato as former deputy secretary of defense william lynn pointed out in media article in 2008 classified us military systems were infected with cyber exploitation tool deployed by foreign nation state exemplifying the potential threat to protected military networks we assess that the most immediate threat to classified nato networks are insiders working on behalf of thirdparty nation states and unwitting nato officers who create vulnerabilities by mishandling classified information systems and data such as emailing classified nato information through internetconnected systems or using an infected thumb drive with classified computers in addition the presence of russian intelligence officers operating in nato spaces raises the risk of close access penetrations without the implementation of more robust security policies monitoring tools and training to counter these factors we assess that any data on classified nato networks is at potential risk b3 other factors u srel nato the discussion so far today on the threat actors and the methods they could employ represents the standard methodology for discussing and evaluating potential solutions to cyber security threatbased analytical model is useful for understanding the problem but it only captures part of the picture srel nato an alternative way to think about the defense of natos networks is to start by identifying which nato data or networks would have the most consequences if they were stolen or disrupted and work from there prioritizing the data and networks we need to protect the most would make it easier to map nato gaps and vulnerabilities to actionable solutions develop mitigation and response plans and enable us to better allocate scarce resources srel nato separately natos efforts to work with nonalliance members on cyber security issues are commendable the alliances ongoing work with the european union and recent discussions on partnering with india only underscore the point that this is global issue that affects everyone we appreciate the alliances efforts to improve its own cyber defenses and look forward to continued work
