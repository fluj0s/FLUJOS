january 29 2008 thomas gabe specialist in social policy domestic social policy division trends in welfare work and the economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children 19872006 summary more than decade has passed since repeal of the nations major cash welfare program assisting lowincome families with children and its replacement with program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf tanf ended the 61 yearold federal entitlement program to poor families with children aid to families with dependent children afdc major purpose of tanf is to end dependence of needy families on government assistance by limiting the time they may receive federal assistance fiveyear maximum or fewer years under state option and by promoting job preparation work and marriage tanf gives states increased flexibility to design programs to assist needy families with children over what existed under afdc the majority of families assisted by tanf and its predecessor afdc program are poor and lowincome singleparent families headed mostly by women this report examines trends in welfare work and the economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children the principal group affected by the replacement of afdc with tanf the report presents analysis of 20 years of us census bureau current population survey cps data the principal source of information for us family income and poverty statistics the analysis spans the runup in welfare caseloads that began in 1989 to reach an alltime high in 1994 and the historic caseload declines that have since followed over the period studied variety of economic demographic and public policy and program changes besides tanf are likely to have affected welfare work and the economic wellbeing of single mother families this report does not attempt to untangle these possible effects the analysis shows that there has been dramatic transformation with regard to welfare work and poverty status of single mothers over the past 20 years many of these changes began before the passage and implementation of tanf but have continued perhaps to an even greater extent since the analysis shows that single mothers are more likely to be working in recent than in past years and that they are less likely to receive cash welfare or to be poor however reductions in poverty have not been as large as the large declines in welfare and the increased rates of work that have occurred the analysis indicates that welfare receipt rates among poor families headed by single mothers have dropped considerably among single mothers whose incomes place them in the bottom fifth of all such mothers income from earnings supplemented by the earned income tax credit eitc has grown markedly since 1993 but has been insufficient to offset concurrent losses in cash welfare and food stamp benefits while single mothers are less dependent on welfare in most recent than in past years increased work has not resulted in marked gains in net income for these lowestincome families the report suggests that fulltime fullyear work may be necessary but not sufficient to raise single mothers family incomes above poverty us income support policy will continue to be challenged to promote economic selfsupport through work and to reduce poverty and welfare dependency among families headed by single mothers this report will be updated annually when new census

economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children 19872006 introduction more than decade has passed since repeal of the nations major cash welfare program assisting lowincome families with children and its replacement with program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf tanf signed into law as part of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act prwora pl 104193 replaced the 61yearold aid to families with dependent children afdc program federal entitlement program to lowincome families with children tanf eliminated the federal entitlement to assistance that existed under afdc replacing an openended matching grant program with fixed dollar block grant program and imposing maximum fiveyear lifetime limit receipt of federallyfunded assistance states may impose shorter limits than the maximum tanf gives states increased flexibility to design programs to assist needy families with children over what existed under its predecessor program major purpose of tanf is to end dependence of needy families on government assistance by limiting the time they may receive assistance and by promoting job preparation work and marriage the majority of families assisted by tanf and its predecessor afdc program are poor and lowincome singleparent families headed mostly by women this report examines trends in welfare work and economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children the principal group affected by the replacement of afdc with tanf the report presents data from congressional research service crs analysis of us bureau of the census march current population survey cps the principal source of information for us family income and poverty statistics the analysis is based on cps data collected from march 1988 to march 2007 the earliest years data precedes the passage of the family support act of 1988 pl 100485 the last major nationwide reform to the afdc program prior to its repeal under tanf the data series begins before the most recent runup in cash welfare caseloads that occurred under afdc in the late1980s and early 1990s it captures the caseload increase to its peak in 1994 and the historic caseload decline that followed over the period examined in this report variety of economic and demographic factors and policy interventions are generally thought to have affected cash welfare caseloads increased numbers of singlemother families especially nevermarried mothers who are prone to poverty and receipt of welfare as well as the ill effects of an economic recession july 1990 to march 1991 are generally thought to have crs2 contributed to the increase in the afdc caseload from mid1989 to march 19941 the 10year long economic expansion from march 1991 to march 2001 the longest in us history presented most favorable economic climate to provide jobs to mothers who otherwise might rely on welfare and is considered to have contributed to declines in welfare caseloads the economic recession that followed march to november 2001 is likely to have contributed to the subsequent leveling off of tanf caseloads2 and increases in food stamp program caseloads variety of welfare policy interventions are likely to have affected welfare caseloads by conditioning benefits on new behavioral requirements for example the 1988 family support act extended work requirements which could include work preparation activities such as education and training from mothers with child as young as 6 to mothers with child as young as 3 under the law states had the option of extending work requirements to mothers with child as young as 1 in the years immediately preceding passage of the 1996 welfare law states experimented with changes to welfare policy under waiver authority granted to the secretary of the department of health and human services dhhs3 among the features of state programs tested under waiver authority granted by the secretary were efforts to strengthen work requirements experiments requiring work first approach rather than training first followed by work time limits strengthened sanctions for noncompliance with welfare rules and capping of welfare benefits for new baby conceived or born while mother was receiving welfare after the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law many states adopted these and many other approaches first tried under welfare waivers in addition number of other policy interventions are generally thought to have promoted work compared to welfare over the period examined in this report expanded eligibility and funding for child care has helped make work possible for mothers who otherwise might have difficulty finding child care for example the 1988 family support act expanded eligibility for child care assistance in the form of transitional child care assistance for families working their way off afdc in 1990 federally funded child care assistance was extended to lowincome families deemed to be at risk of receiving welfare under the child care and development block grant ccdbg4 expansions to the earned income tax credit eitc in 1990 phasedin 1991 and 1992 and in 1993 phasedin 1994 through 1996 expanded the credits work bonus to families

development block grant background and funding by melinda gish crs3 as 40 cents on each dollar earned for lowincome family with two children5 over the period examined in this report the minimum wage was increased four times6 additionally most states allowed inflation to substantially erode the real value of welfare benefits over this period diminishing the value of welfare relative to work7 furthermore since the passage of tanf most states have increased financial work incentives for families receiving cash assistance by allowing families to keep more of their cash welfare benefit as their earnings increase8 untangling the effects of demographic factors the economy welfare policy and other policy interventions on singlemothers work behavior welfare receipt income and poverty status is beyond the scope of this report others have attempted to parcel out these effects with mixed success and differing conclusions as to the relative impacts of each9 in contrast to these efforts this report is intended to simply describe changes in single mothers welfare work income and poverty status that have occurred over the past 20 years the analysis which follows relies on data

retrospective accounting of income and labor force participation during the prior year the data presented in this report capture family composition from march 1988 to march 2007 and family income and poverty status from 1987 to 2006 providing representative crosssection of families headed by single mothers in each year11 overview cps data show an increase in cash welfare receipt afdc tanf or other assistance among single mothers during the late 1980s and early 1990s and decrease in the midtolate 1990s the cps data generally correspond to the caseload rise and fall documented by administrative program data but underestimate the caseload statistics to some extent12 figure 1 shows that the total number of single mothers increased from 84 million in 1989 to about 99 million in 1993 an increase of 15 million or 17 from 1993 through 2000 the number of single mothers remained fairly stable ranging between 97 and 101 million since 2000 the number of single mothers has increased by over one million from 10 million in 2000 to 109 million in 2006 the number of single mothers in families reporting receipt of cash welfare on the cps increased from 25 million in 1989 to 34 million in 1993 an increase of 900000 or 36 over the fouryear period compared to 1993 the peak year of welfare receipt the number of single mothers reporting cash welfare was down to just under one million 991000 in 2006 71 decline from 1993 the bottom shaded portion in figure 113 over the same period the number of poor single mothers who reported receiving cash welfare increased from 1722 million in 1993 to 3120 million in 2006 an 81 increase over the period the middleshaded area in figure 1 10 the cpsasec was formerly known as the march supplement to the current population survey as data for the social and economic supplement were collected in march of each year beginning in 2001 the census bureau expanded the cps sample for collecting social and economic supplementary data to include some households interviewed in february and april most of the households in the asec are still interviewed in march and estimates for the full asec continue to be controlled to independent population estimates for march 11 unlike longitudinal surveys the cps does not follow the same families from year to year longitudinal surveys allow for the study of how individual families circumstances change over time 12 see appendix which compares cps estimates to afdctanf caseload counts 13 administrative caseload statistics show the caseload as peaking in march 1994 with nearly 51 million cases by march 2006 the caseload had dropped to 18 million cases 65 decline from its march 1994 peak crs5 figure 2 provides an overview of single mothers welfare work and poverty status from 1987 to 2006 the figure shows that since 1993 the share of single mothers who worked at some time during the year has increased markedly and that the share who received cash welfare afdc or post1996 tanf has declined significantly as has the share who are poor under the official poverty definition14 the figure illustrates that while both cash welfare recipiency rates and poverty rates for single mothers have generally fallen since 1993 single mothers welfare recipiency rate has fallen faster than their poverty rate more recently since 2000 the poverty rate of single mothers has increased but cash welfare receipt has not

the share working increased each year until reaching 83 in 2000 the share of single mothers working dropped to just over 77 in 2006 during the 1987 to 1993 period roughly one out of three single mothers received cash welfare in 1993 the most recent peak year of welfare receipt on the cps about 35 of single mothers received cash welfare since then the cash welfare receipt rate has declined substantially in 2006 only about 9 of single mothers received cash welfare just about onequarter of the1993 rate the figure shows that the poverty rate among single mothers fell from about 45 in 1993

employment rate increased from recent low of 351 in march 1993 to high of 591 in march 2000 24 percentage point increase over the period their employment rate fell to 537 in march 2005 but rebounded to 570 in march 2006 and fell slightly in march 2007 to 565 single mothers with youngest child aged 35 also experienced marked employment gains over the midtolate 1990s their employment rate grew from recent low of 541 in march 1992 to 727 by crs8 march 2000 an 186 percentage point increase over the period by march 2007 the employment rate of single mothers with youngest child aged 35 was 686 still about 4 percentage points less than its march 2000 peak but 56 percentage points above that of their married counterparts 630 single mothers whose youngest child was of school age age 617 had employment rates about equal to those of their married counterparts over the 19882006 period healthy economy during much of the 1990s combined with transformed welfare system improvements to the eitc and increases in the minimum wage are among factors thought to have encouraged work among single mothers tanf and the afdc waivers that preceded it transformed cash assistance from needsbased entitlement to program of temporary assistance encouraging work and personal responsibility imposition of work requirements time limits and sanctions and in most states more generous earnings disregards all serve to encourage work either in lieu of welfare or for temporary period in conjunction with welfare the eitc which is conditioned on earnings is thought to encourage work among most groups especially single parents who were not working or who were marginally attached to the labor market increases in the eitc passed by congress in 1993 and phased in between 1994 and 1996 have increased the financial incentive for single mothers to work15 other factors such as increased funding for child care subsidies may also have contributed to making work possible for more single mothers given their greater attachment to the work force in recent years one might expect single mothers to be more severely impacted by downturns in the economy than in years past evidence from the most recent recession march to november 2001 shows declining employment rate and increased incidence in poverty among single mothers since 2000 the employment rate among single mothers has yet to rebound seven years after having reached historic high and their poverty rate has yet to show significant movement back toward it historic low reached seven years ago in contrast in the previous recession july 1990 to march 1991 single mothers also experienced declining employment and an increased incidence in poverty although their employment rate was lower and their poverty rate higher than today however in the previous recession employment rebounded sooner after three years and the poverty rate increase abated within two years and began to fall once again after three welfare receipt among single mothers figure 4 shows that cash welfare recipiency rates among single mothers overall and among poor single mothers based on their pretransfer income ie cash income excluding cash welfare remained fairly steady during the 19871993 period but have fallen considerably since among single mothers overall about onethird received cash welfare during the late1980s and early 1990s with low of about 30 in 1989 and peak of about 35 in 1993 cash welfare recipiency rates among 15 meyer and rosenbaum in welfare the earned income tax credit op cit attribute 60 of the increase in single mothers weekly and annual employment between 1984 and 1996 to the eitc crs9 single mothers began to fall after 1993 falling to 10 in 2002 drop in the rate from nine years earlier of more than twothirds with the exception of 2003 cash welfare recipiency rates have remained around 10 since 2002 the apparent rise in the 2003 recipiency rate may be an aberration in cps measurement as administrative caseload data showed such increase see appendix for further discussion of cps and administrative data caseload trends in 2006 only about 9 of single mothers were receiving cash welfare recent declines in cash welfare recipiency rates have not simply been due to diminished need for assistance as recipiency rates have fallen even among mothers who would appear to be in economic need based on their pretransfer income relative to poverty for example figure 4 shows that among single mothers who were poor based on their pretransfer cash income ie income before counting cash welfare the share who received cash welfare generally held relatively steady around 63 in most years over the 198793 period since 1993 the cash welfare recipiency rate among single mothers with pretransfer income below poverty has fallen dramatically in 2006 only about one in five 202 single mothers with pre transfer income below poverty received cash assistance figure 4 single mothers cash welfare

rates in greater detail by families level of financial need as measured by families levels of pretransfer income relative to poverty the figure shows that cash welfare recipiency rates have fallen considerably in recent years even among single mothers who might be considered especially needy by having very low levels of pretransfer income relative to poverty for example the top line of figure 5 shows that nearly 90 of single mothers with pretransfer income reported receiving cash assistance from 1987 to 1990 however after 1990 the reported rate of cash welfare recipiency among this group began drifting downwards falling to 77 by 1996 and afterwards falling abruptly to just 35 by 2001 in 2002 and 2003 there was marked increase in cash welfare receipt for this group up to 442 in 2003 but by 2006 cash welfare receipt for this group dropped to 31 similarly for single mothers with very low pretransfer income relative to poverty below 25 of poverty and for families with pretransfer

to november 2001 on food stamp caseloads food stamp program statistics indicate that in fy2006 food stamp caseloads were up 55 from fy200016 to at least some extent the declining cash welfare and food stamp recipiency rates shown in figures 4 through 6 are likely due to increased underreporting of welfare receipt on the cps worsened reporting of cash welfare on the cps makes it difficult to gauge how much of the drop in welfare receipt among femaleheaded families with children represents eligible families who do not receive assistance rather than families who do not report actual welfare aid on the cps see appendix for brief analysis of the possible extent of underreporting of cash welfare on the cps poor single mothers work and welfare status although poverty rates among single mothers have declined in recent years there is greater likelihood today than in years past that poor single mother will be working rather than receiving welfare as shown above poor single mothers are less likely to be receiving cash welfare in recent than in earlier years figures 4 and 5 similarly like all single mothers poor single mothers are also now more likely to be working than not changes in poor mothers participation in work and welfare status first became evident in the earlytomid 1990s with rates of employment increasing after 1992 and rates of welfare receipt declining after 1993 see figure 7 2 darkest lines crossover point was reached by 1996 when the chances that poor single mother would be working exceeded the chances that she would be receiving welfare figure 7 shows that the share of poor single mothers who received cash welfare at any time during the year fell from just over 60 in the 198793 period to about 19 in 2006 the rate of decline in welfare receipt among poor single mothers has been greatest since 1996 period coinciding with the passage and implementation of national welfare reform legislation similarly the share of poor single mothers who were working at any time during the year increased from around 44 in 1992 to peak of 64 in 1999 but dropped since to about 54 in 2006 the share of poor single mothers who relied on cash welfare without working dropped from peak of 43 in 1991 to about 11 in 2006 75 drop from the 1991 rate the share of poor single mothers who worked without relying on cash welfare has increased from recent low of nearly 25 in 1993 to about 47 in 2006 the share of poor single mothers who combined work and welfare over the year which had remained relatively constant over most of the period at around 20 fell to about 8 in 2006 16 in fy2000 17194 million people were receiving food stamps based on monthly average participation rates in fy2006 monthly average food stamp participation had reached 26672 million participants these statistics reflect all households who received food stamps not just femaleheaded families see httpwwwfnsusdagovpdfssummarhtm crs13 the share of poor single mothers who reported that they neither worked nor received cash welfare during the year the dotted line in figure 7 has increased from low of about 12 in 1991 to about 35 in 2006 this surprising combination may reflect mix of circumstances including income or support from other sources such as family members support from unrelated household members which is not included in the official poverty measure and other means of support from outside the household not captured on the cps it may also reflect income reporting problems on the cps especially with regard to welfare income17 finally welfare diversion and sanction policies may have contributed to the increased number of poor mothers neither working nor receiving welfare figure 7 poor single mothers work and welfare status during the year 1987 to 2006 percent 100 90 80 70 60

earlier in figure 2 single mothers poverty status has improved since 1993 changes in the economy and changes in welfare policy and other programs such as the eitc have both direct and indirect effects on income and poverty however the official us poverty measure counts only family cash income excluding capital gains and lump sum or onetime payments against familys poverty threshold which varies by family size and composition to determine whether family is counted as poor the definition does not include the value of in kind benefits such as food stamps school lunches or public housing subsidies nor does it include the effects of taxes or tax credits such as the eitc inclusion of in kind benefits and the eitc provides more comprehensive income definition than the official definition additionally other unrelated household members may contribute to the familys economic wellbeing but determining the extent to which resources are shared among unrelated household members is often difficult figure 8 shows the effects of income from these other sources on poverty among all single mothers components of family income are sequentially added and measured against families poverty thresholds as one moves from the top line of the chart to subsequent lines below line 1 the top line shows the percent of single mothers who would be counted as poor if only family earnings were counted against the poverty line line 2 the second line down includes other sources of cash income in addition to earnings that were already counted above eg social security payments unemployment compensation workers compensation interest and dividends interfamily transfers however this line does not include cash welfare line 3 the third line down adds cash welfare to the other sources already mentioned and with those sources represents the income definition used in the official poverty measure lines 4 through 6 include food stamps taxes including the effects of the eitc and the partially refundable child tax credit and income of other unrelated household members that are not included under the official us bureau of the census poverty definition line 4 the fourth line down shows the market value of food stamps when added to cash income and compared to the family poverty threshold line 5 the fifth line down shows the effect of adding the value of the eitc plus the partially refundable child tax credit and state refundable credits less federal and state income taxes and payroll taxes to line 4 line 6 the bottom dashed line shows the effects of counting all income in the household in which the single mother lives not just that of her related family members and comparing it to an unofficial crs15 household lowincome threshold the household lowincome threshold used here applies family poverty income thresholds which are based on family size and composition to households based on household size and composition it must be noted that official poverty measurement is based on family concept which assumes that family members share income and economies of scale that result from shared living arrangements it is generally agreed among researchers that assumptions regarding income sharing and shared economies of scale among related family members who have ties based on blood marriage and adoption do not apply to the same extent among unrelated household members consequently these estimates of household lowincome status likely overstate the effect of household income on reducing poverty among families headed by single mothers figure 8 effects of earnings

cps sample and 2000 decennial censusderived weights crs16 in viewing figure 8 note that the trend in earnings is the principal factor affecting the declining trend in poverty whereas the other income sources with the exception of the eitc affect the level of poverty more than its trend over time evidence of this effect is that most lines in the chart with the exception of the eitc roughly run parallel to the ones above effect of earnings and other nonwelfare cash income on poverty figure 8 shows that between 1993 and 2000 single mothers poverty based on family earnings alone fell from 562 to 408 line 1 as result of the economic recession their earnedincome poverty rate rose from 2001 through 2004 and in 2006 at 445 was still above its historic low in 2000 adding other cash income except cash welfare to family earnings line 2 reduces poverty in 1993 from 562 line 1 to 474 line 2 and in 2006 from 445 to 357 effect of cash welfare on poverty cash welfare benefits have only small impact on the poverty rate as these benefits generally are not sufficient even when combined with other cash income to lift families above the federal poverty threshold in the vast majority of states the level of earnings or other cash income at which states cash welfare benefits under tanf become unavailable for family are well below the poverty line for example in january 2003 in only seven states could single mother with two children have earnings above the poverty line and still continue to receive tanf cash assistance18 consequently cash welfare benefits have little impact on the poverty rate the addition of cash welfare line 3 representing the official income definition for measuring poverty reduces poverty only slightly from 474 line 2 to 452 line 3 in 1993 and from 357 to 351 in 2006 nonetheless cash welfare benefits can have significant impact on the level of poor families incomes affecting the degree to which their incomes fall below the poverty income standard this impact is not captured by changes in the poverty rate as shown above in figure 8 effect on poverty of counting selected income sources not included in the official poverty measure the following three measures include income from sources not included under the official us bureau of the census poverty definition food stamps taxes including the effects of the eitc and the partially refundable child tax credit and income of other unrelated household members effect of food stamps on poverty the fourth line from the top in figure 8 shows the effect on the poverty rate of single mothers by counting the value of food stamps the line shows that food stamps reduce the poverty rate of single mothers 18 see us congress house committee on ways and means 2004 green book table 716 tanf phaseout points pp 751 to 753 washington dc march 2004 crs17 from about 2 to 3 percentage points over the period compare the reduction in poverty from line 3 to line 4 effect of taxes and tax credits on poverty as noted above the net effect of the eitc19 and the child tax credit20 after counting the effect of reductions in income from federal and state income taxes and fica taxes line 5 when added to total family cash income and food stamps line 4 causes divergence in trend from the lines above this is especially notable after 1993 major expansion of the eitc passed by congress in 1993 and phased in between 1994 and 1996 increased the amount of the eitc work bonus families might receive the anti poverty effectiveness of the eitc was approximately three times greater in 2006 than in 1993 in 1993 the aftertax poverty rate counting food stamps among single mothers dropped from 427 line 4 to 407 line 5 20 percentage point 47 reduction in 2006 the eitc in combination with the child tax credit after counting estimated tax payments reduced poverty from 329 to 279 50 percentage point 152 reduction the bulk of this reduction is the result of the eitc as the child tax credit is comparatively small for most families headed by single mothers with adjusted gross incomes near the poverty line as receipt of the eitc is conditioned on earnings the growing impact of the eitc in part reflects the rise in work rates among single mothers among those who are working and poor before counting the eitc the eitc helps lift the income of some above the poverty line although the eitc expansion provided additional income to lowincome families who were already working it may also have helped induce increased employment among family heads with low to moderate earnings potential and thus contributed to the decline in poverty based on earned income only that has occurred since 1993 shown as the top line in the chart note too that to the extent that changes in cash welfare programs in recent years have encouraged work such as work requirements and increased earnings disregards these changes may have had an indirect effect on poverty by increasing earnings and through earnings making the eitc available to greater number of families effect of unrelated household members income on poverty the household lowincome line bottom line shows that if all household members income is counted as though shared equally among household members the poverty rate among single mothers would drop by at most 3 to 4 percentage points over the 1987 to 2006 period using the household as opposed to the family as the economic unit for determining poverty reduces the post inkind transfer posttax poverty rate in 1993 from 407 line 5 to 368 line 6 and in 2006 from 279 to 237 again this is most likely an overstatement of the possible effect that shared 19 note that the value of the eitc on the cps is based on census bureau imputations rather than actual reported tax credits also the eitc is different from most sources of income as most families receive the eitc as lump sum refund 20 for discussion of the child tax credit see crs report rs21860 the child tax credit by gregg esenwein crs18 household living arrangements might have on single mothers poverty status because of uncertainty about the extent to which such income is actually shared degree of poverty among poor single mothers as noted above the poverty rate measures only the percent of families whose incomes fall below their respective poverty thresholds based on family size and composition although the poverty rate provides an overall indication of the level of need in the population it does not measure the extent of need among poor families figures 9 and 10 show two different measures of the poverty gap among poor families headed by single mothers that is the degree to which poor families incomes fall below the poverty income level in these figures the poverty gap is depicted as family income as percent of poverty among poor families figure 9 is based on the cash income poverty measure whereas figure 10 is based on cash income plus the value of food assistance and taxes including the eitc and the child tax credit note that the families depicted in figure 10 are subset of those included in figure 9 as they are families who remain poor after considering food stamps and taxes including the eitc and the child tax credit the effects of which are not counted in figure 9 in each figure the extent of poverty among poor families is depicted at various percentiles based on families ranked by family income as percent of poverty figures 9 and 10 show that the median family income as percent of need ie poverty among poor families has remained relatively steady over the past 18 years based on official cash income for purposes of measuring poverty the median family income as percent of need among poor families headed by single mothers has ranged from low of 48 to high of 53 over the period figure 9 looking at just the subset of singlemother families who were poor based on more comprehensive income definition that includes food stamps and taxes including the eitc and child tax credit the median family income as percent of need was somewhat higher over the period ranging from high of 66 of poverty in 1991 to low of 56 of poverty in 2004 figure 10 both figures 9 and 10 show recent declines in income relative to poverty for the poorest families headed by single mothers for example figure 9 shows that for the bottom fifth of poor single mothers family income relative to poverty fell from recent high of 28 of poverty in 1996 to low of 15 of poverty in 2005 looking at the subset of singlemother families that were poor based on the more comprehensive income definition cash food stamps and taxes including the eitc and child tax credit the bottom fifth have seen decline in relative economic wellbeing from high of 43 of poverty in 1994 to low of 22 of poverty in 2006 figure 10 crs19 figure 9 poverty gap

supplemented by increased eitc and reductions in cash welfare and food stamps single mothers with the lowest incomes depicted as the bottom fifth bottom quintile of single mothers ranked by their families incomes by 1999 had more than doubled their earnings since 1994 however these earnings gains even when supplemented by the eitc have not been sufficient to offset losses in cash welfare and food stamps that have occurred since 1994 the year in which their income was highest earnings of single mothers in the bottom income quintile peaked in 2000 but fell each year through 2005 in 2006 average earnings of single crs21 mothers in the bottom income quintile increased somewhat over 2005 in spite of their greater earnings average total income of single mothers in the bottom income quintile in 2006 was still well below their 1994 income level which marked peak over the 20 years depicted single mothers ranked in the bottom 20 to 40 by income second quintile also experienced significant earnings gains since 1994 for these families earnings gains supplemented by the eitc have more than offset reductions in cash welfare and food stamps over the period resulting in higher overall income in most recent years than in 1994 after reaching peak in 2000 average total income among mothers in the second quintile has fallen somewhat due to reduced earnings and eitc presumably as result of 2001 economic recession figures 11 and 12 examine sources of income among the bottom quintile bottom 20 and the second lowest quintile bottom 20 to 40 of singlemother families

that these estimates are based on yeartoyear income comparisons of crosssectional survey data rather than comparison of incomes for the same families over time figure 11 shows declining reliance on cash welfare and food stamps since 1994 and increased reliance on earnings supplemented by the eitc among families headed by single mothers in the bottom income quintile however earnings gains even when supplemented by the eitc have not been sufficient to offset the losses in income from cash welfare and food stamps since 1994 average earnings for these families peaked in 2000 but total family income 8405 still fell short of that attained in 1994 8654 since 2000 average earnings fell each year through 2005 increased food stamp benefits since 2000 have helped to bolster families income somewhat but cash welfare benefits have continued to erode in 2006 average total income 7587 of single mother families in the bottom income quintile was only slightly above the 20year low 7322 observed in 2004 and well below the 20year peak 8654 observed in 1994 average cash welfare and food stamp benefits reported by single mothers in the bottom quintile have fallen since 1994 in 1994 combined average afdc and general assistance benefits were 3075 for this population by 2006 combined tanf and general assistance had fallen to 854 25 of their 1994 value similarly in 1994 average food stamp benefits amounted to 2996 by 2006 they amounted to 2113 71 of their 1994 value in spite of earnings and supplemented eitc benefits being higher in 2006 than two decades earlier reductions in cash welfare and food stamp benefits have resulted in lower average crs22 total income for single mothers at the bottom of the income distribution ie bottom income quintile the growing importance of the eitc as an earnings supplement can be illustrated by comparing the average eitc as share of average earnings shown in figure 11 legislative expansions to the eitc in 1990 phased in between 1991 and 1992 and in 1993 phased in from 1994 through 1996 expanded the credits work bonus to families with children amounting to supplement of as much as 40 cents on each dollar earned in 1990 the average eitc depicted in figure 11 amounted to about 13 of average earnings of mothers in the bottom income quintile by 1993 the eitc work bonus increased to 18 of earnings and then doubled to 37 of earnings by 1996 once legislative expansions had completely phased in in addition to providing needed income to lowincome working families the eitc has also likely encouraged work and increased earnings figure 12 is similar to figure 11 but shows average income by source for the second quintile of singlemother families ranked by their income relative to poverty the chart shows comparatively large gains in average total income from 1993 to 1995 due largely to increased earnings and eitc during this short period average total net income increased from 14095 to 17851 gain of nearly 27 earnings of singlemother families in the second income quintile peaked in 2000 at 12095 in 2006 dollars more than three times what they earned in 1993 however from 2000 to 2005 average earnings and consequently average eitc declined among these families food stamps have helped to offset recent earnings losses somewhat growing by 66 from 2000 to 2005 whereas cash welfare support continued to diminish over the same period in 2006 earnings and the eitc increased somewhat compared to 2005 but income from all other sources fell and taxes increased resulting in lower net average income in 2005 than in 2006 average total income among single mother families in the second quintile reached its highest level over the 20year period examined in 2000 in 2000 the peakincome year earnings in combination with the

decennial census derived weights crs25 conclusions and policy implications crs analysis of 20 years of us census bureau cps data shows dramatic transformation in single mothers welfare work and poverty status over the period cps data generally follow the upsurge in the afdc caseload evidenced by administrativeprogram statistics that occurred in the late1980s and early 1990s and the historic declines that followed increases in the number of families headed by single mothers during the late1980s and early 1990s are likely to have contributed to the rapid growth in cash welfare caseloads under the afdc program that occurred over the period the number of single mothers increased from about 82 million in 1987 to 99 million in 1993 cash welfare caseloads peaked in march 1994 and have dropped dramatically since whereas the number of single mothers stayed close to 10 million in most years since 1994 in 2006 the number of single mothers reached 109 million but the number reporting receipt of cash welfare has continued to fall economic conditions certainly contributed to the welfare caseload increase that began in the late 1980s and the historic declines since 1994 number of policy interventions have helped to increase the economic returns to work and to encourage work over welfare increases to the eitc and the minimum wage and erosion of most states welfare benefit levels due to inflation have helped to increase the economic returns to work compared to welfare in recent years states extension of work requirements to mothers with younger children increased welfare sanction authority and adoption of timelimits on welfare receipt first experimented with under afdc waiver authority and now widely adopted by states under tanf have helped to transform the welfare system from an entitlement program to program that emphasizes selfsupport primarily through work and personal responsibility the cps data show that single mothers are considerably more likely to be working and less likely to be poor or receiving welfare in most recent than in earlier years figure 2 although many of these changes precede passage of the 1996 welfare law reductions in welfare receipt have since been especially large since 1996 poor single mothers are more likely to work during the year than to receive welfare figure 7 however reductions in poverty among single mothers have not been as large as the concurrent declines in cash welfare receipt and increased work among single mothers in recent years moreover cps data indicate that welfare receipt rates among very poor families based on their pretransfer income ie income other than welfare have dropped considerably in recent years figure 5 among singlemother families whose incomes are lowest the bottom 20 of singlemothers based on family income relative to poverty income from earnings has grown markedly since 1993 but has failed to offset losses in cash welfare and food stamp benefits which have occurred since figure 10 while single mothers are less dependent on welfare in most recent than in past years increased work has not resulted in marked gains in net income for the bottom fifth of single mothers ranked by family income relative to poverty in 2006 average income of these families was well below its 2000 level its most recent highwater mark and only slightly above its 2004 level which marked the lowest level observed in the 20 years examined the cps data show that although welfare receipt and poverty among single mothers has declined in recent years mothers receiving welfare are now more likely crs26 to be working and poor mothers are now less likely to be receiving welfare and more likely to be working than in past years prospects of single mothers working their way off welfare and out of poverty hinge in large part on their finding fulltime stable employment at sufficient wage cps data show that most single mothers work fulltime schedules 35 or more hours per week when they work see figure 13 in 2006 among single mothers who combined welfare and work during the year 59 worked fulltime schedules not that much different from working poor single mothers who did not receive welfare of whom 61 worked fulltime schedules however mothers who worked and received cash welfare were considerably less likely to have worked fullyear 50 to 52 weeks 30 than their working

rounding one policy challenge to reduce poverty and welfare dependency among single mothers may be to assist mothers in moving to fulltime fullyear work however fulltime fullyear work is likely necessary but not sufficient for some single mothers to have incomes above poverty and not rely on cash welfare about one in five 213 single mothers who combined work and welfare worked fulltime full year and one in three 328 poor single mothers who did not receive welfare crs27 worked fulltime fullyear see figure 13 for these mothers fulltime attachment to job was insufficient to move them off of welfare or out of poverty single mothers with incomes somewhat above poverty 100 to 150 of poverty were much more likely to have worked fulltime fullyear 591 than working poor mothers not receiving welfare 328 and nearly 3 times as likely as mothers who combined work and welfare during the year 213 in march 2007 most working single mothers who were poor or received cash welfare earned more than the federal statutory minimum wage of 515 per hour applied at that time21 figure 14 shows that in march 2007 the median hourly wage of single mothers who were either poor or received welfare during the prior year was estimated at 850 per hour22 half of such mothers earned more and half earned less the middle 50 of such mothers earned between 700 and 1100 per hour denoted by the interquartile range working mothers who were near poverty between 100 and 149 of poverty and did not receive cash welfare in the prior year earned 95 cents per hour more than their poor or welfarereliant counterparts at the median hourly wage 945 per hour 50 percent of these near poor working mothers earned between 800 and 1171 per hour combined with their somewhat higher wages nearpoor single mothers are more likely to work fulltime fullyear than their counterparts who receive cash welfare or are poor clearly fulltime fullyear work lessens the chances that single mother and her children will be poor or receive cash welfare but does not completely eliminate those chances among single mothers who did not work fulltime full year 61 were poor or received cash welfare in 2006 compared to only 13 who worked fulltime fullyear not shown in figures single mothers have lost economic ground since the 2001 recession their situation is likely to worsen if the economy falters the bottom fifth of single mothers ranked by income relative to poverty appear economically worse off than before passage of the 1996 welfare reform law on the basis of their measured income in 2004 their total income was at the lowest level measured over the 20 years examined single mothers ranked in the bottom 20 to 40 based on income relative to poverty have also failed to recoup income losses since the 2001 recession but their measured incomes are still well above pre welfare reform levels among 21 pl 11028 enacted on may 25 2007 raised the federal minimum wage to 585 effective july 2007 and in

the survey group technically referred to as the outgoing rotation group the cps interviews households for eight months after four months of interviews household leaves the survey for four months and afterwards is interviewed for an additional four months after which the household leaves the survey permanently in march selected questions such as hourly wage rates are asked only of households who have been in the survey for four or eight months and will be leaving the survey in the following month either temporarily or permanently the estimates of hourly earnings shown in figure 14 are based on hourly wages of hourly workers and for other workers estimated hourly earnings based on reported gross weekly earnings divided by usual hours worked crs28 families headed by single mothers their incidence of poverty has increased from historic low of 318 in 2000 to 351 in 2006 strong economy may be necessary but not sufficient to markedly reducing poverty among families headed by single mothers absent significant increases in single mothers job attachment or hourly earnings income supports in the form of child support earnings supplements such as the eitc food housing and medical assistance as well as cash welfare are likely to continue to play important roles in addressing the needs of singlemother families challenge for these and other approaches will be to reduce basic unmet needs and at the same time promote economic selfsufficiency current signs of faltering economy spotlights this challenge figure 14 hourly wage rates of working single mothers in march 2007 by

definition for measuring poverty under the official us bureau of the census poverty definition as percent of poverty which defines the bottom fifth and bottom twofifths of singlemother families ranked by family relative to poverty the lightershaded lines show other income percentiles relative to poverty the figure shows for example that the bottom fifth of singlemother families ranked by official cash income relative to poverty had family income below 42 of poverty in 1992 by 2002 the relative income of the bottom fifth 20th percentile of singlemother families increased to 66 of the poverty line but by 2006 stood at 59 of poverty similarly the second fifth between the 20th and 40th percentiles of singlemother families had family income above 42 of poverty but below 85 of poverty in 1992 by 2002 the secondfifth of single mother families had family incomes above 66 of poverty but below 123 of poverty in 2006 the secondfifth of single mother families declined and ranged between 59 and 113 of poverty the figure shows that the bottom 10 of singlemother families has shown essentially improvement over the 20 year period figures b2 and b3 are similar to figure b1 but depict singlemother families income rankings based on alternative definitions of income relative to poverty figure b2 for example ranks families based on family aftertax income including the eitc plus food stamps whereas figure b3 ranks families based on household aftertax income plus food stamps relative to household poverty income threshold based on household size and composition in both cases figures b2 and b3 show comparatively better income position relative to poverty than does figure b1 which uses the official poverty income definition for example in 2006 the bottom fifth of singlemother families had incomes below 59 of poverty under the official poverty income definition shown in figure b1 when taxes including the eitc and food stamps are considered the bottom fifth of singlemother families had incomes below 78 of poverty shown in figure b2 and if household aftertax income and food stamps are counted against revised household poverty threshold the bottom 20 of singlemother families have incomes below 89 of poverty shown in figure b3 although the alternate income definitions also result in improved income standing relative to the official poverty income definition for the bottom 10 of singlemother families the trend over the 20year period shows little improvement crs32 figure b1 income to poverty percentiles of motheronly families based on ranking of families by family cash income
