ashgabat 00000250 0012 of 002 1 sbu summary turkmenabat turkmenistans second largest city continues its role as transport hub and industrial center despite diminished regional commerce in the postsoviet era large complex that processes locallyharvested licorice root continues to prosper due to the availability of inputs and healthy export market machine parts factory has faced greater challenges having been forced to find new product line and relying solely on the domestic market unlike the licorice complex which predates the russian revolution the machine parts factory was soviet creation that lacks an obvious market in turkmenistans current economy thanks to government subsidies however it does not appear that even struggling soviet era enterprise is threatened with closure given its success at maintaining its production equipment the factory could see better days if it found the right foreign partner interested in lowcost metal parts end summary local licorice root supports an industry 2 sbu poloff recently visited the buyan turkmenabat agroindustrial complex which specializes in the production of licorice extract in dry and paste forms the licorice processing plant dates back to the czarist era when it was started by the us firm macandrews and forbes in 1906 meeting with the director of the complex took place in the administrative building adjacent to the processing plant the plant was reportedly modernized in 2008 by chinese company although the original 1906 press is still in use the director of the complex declined poloffs request to tour the plant saying that the equipment was currently undergoing maintenance prior to the startup of the harvesting season in march instead he offered to describe the process used to produce licorice extract which is essentially combination of steam and pressure applied to the harvested roots 3 sbu licorice root grows wild along the banks of the amu darya attempts to cultivate it have not been successful the licorice root is harvested by the buyan complexs own brigades the harvest takes place between march and october terminating after the first frost during the soviet period the buyan plant processed licorice root from uzbekistan tajikistan kazakhstan and azerbaijan since the end of the soviet union the plant only processes licorice root harvested in turkmenistan buyan has 600 employees the bulk of whom work in its harvesting brigades the company does not obtain licorice root from individual harvesters 4 sbu the buyan complex processes and sells unprocessed licorice root as well as paste and powder extract the powder extract is new higher valueadded product following modernization of the plant by the chinese and installation of new equipment the equipment in the plant is chinese russian and american the still operational usbuilt press dating back to the plants founding more than 100 years ago although the plant falls under the control of the ministry of healthcare and medical industry it does not produce higher valueadded consumer products such as medicine or candy which are the primarily end uses for licorice extract buyan ships licorice extract to the us japan former ussr countries china and western europe the us company mafco worldwide corp purchases about 2000 tons of extract per annum all of which is produced on the vintae us press according to the director thirty percent of the exports are licorice extract with the remainder sent as dried root machine parts well make whatever you need 5 sbu poloff also visited an industrial machinery factory in turkmenabat named agromash which was established in 1973 the plant is part of the stateowned ashgabat 00000250 0022 of 002 turkmenmashyngurlushyk turkmen machine building enterprise which falls under the ministry of energy and industry it is one of eleven such factories operated by the machine building enterprise at different locations throughout the country the factory has mechanical and welding sections as well as section for the reconstruction and testing of russianbuilt yamz diesel engines greeted by the companys director muratjan jumakulyiev poloff was immediately led to the sovietera plants massive shop floor in soaring hangarlike structure the better part of the shop floor was devoid of activity although handful of workers were operating some of the equipment the plant remains fully equipped with sovietera machine tools such as metal lathes and drills an adjacent building houses foundry with two rows of furnaces for melting metal although the factory has capacity to produce 1800 tons of iron and steel castings per annum and 250 tons of nonferrous metal castings during the visit none of the furnaces were operating 6 sbu while the factory plant had once specialized in the repair of road grading equipment it longer performs that work and is now clearly scrambling for business for its line of products the factory can also fabricate customordered machine parts based on clients specifications agromashs product line includes clay mixing machinery for use on drilling units trailers that provide temporary housing and offices on construction sites circulation systems for the preparation and storage of drilling solutions for oil and gas wells rototillers and ironwork such as ornamental fences and manhole covers there was one massive circulation system on site ready for shipment and at least dozen trailers featuring various interior configurations the factory currently does not export its production although it does sell to foreign companies doing business in turkmenistan the factorys director proposed that us firms could order custom machine parts and agromash could produce them at fraction of the us cost he also thought the companys housingoffice trailers could find useful applications in afghanistan 7 sbu comment the buyan licorice complex clearly has longstanding market niche dating back to the early 20th century even though the complex lost its regional role following the breakup of the soviet union its continued exclusive access to its basic input licorice root and welldeveloped export demand have provided it with continuity and favorable prospects agromash on the other hand had to find new lines of business in the postsoviet turkmen economy and lacks the wherewithal to develop export markets while the factory did not look busy it has managed to maintain its equipment intact thanks to state support and could present an opportunity for foreign partner looking for lowcost supplier for machine parts end comment curran
