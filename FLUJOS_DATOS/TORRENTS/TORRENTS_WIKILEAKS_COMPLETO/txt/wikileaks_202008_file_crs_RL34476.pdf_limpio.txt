addressed in this report is whether the current amphibious lift goal is appropriate congre sss decisions on these issues will affect among other things navy and marine corps funding require ments and capabilities and the shipbuilding industrial base background amphibious ships in general functions and uses of amphibious ships amphibious ships are one of four principal categories of combat ship s that traditionally have helped define the size and structure of the us navy the other three are submarines aircraft carriers and surface combatants eg cruisers stroyers frigates and littoral combat ships6 the navys amphibious ships are crewed by sailors the primary function of navy amphibious ships is to lift ie tran sport us marines and their equipment and supplies to distant operating areas nd enable marines to conduct expeditionary operations ashore in those areas amphibious ships have berthing spaces for marines flight decks and hangar decks fo r their helicopters and vertical takeoff and landing vtol fixedwing aircraft we ll decks for storing and launching their landing craft7 and storage space for their wheeled vehicles their other combat equipment and their supplies although

forces can be used for launching and conducting largerscale ground combat operations smallerscale strike and c ounterterrorism operations noncombatant evacuation operations neos peaceenforcement operations operations to train advise and assist foreign military forces other nationbuilding operations ch as reconstruction operations peacetime engagement activities such as exercises and disasterresponse and humanita rianassistance operations amphibious ships and their embarked ma rine forces can also be used for maintaining forwarddeployed naval presence for purposes of deterrence reassurance and maintaining regional stability although the marines have not conducted largescale amphibious assault against opposing military forces since the kor ean war marine corps officials state that there have been about 85 us am phibious operations of other kinds between 1990 and april 20088 in addition possibility of an amphibious landing can generate tactical benefits even if the landing is not carried out during the 1991 persian gulf war for example the possibility of an amphibious landing by force of about 17000 marines embarked on amphibi ous ships in the persian gulf tied down several iraqi divisions in coastal defense positions those iraqi divisions positions were not available for use ag ainst uscoalition ground forces moving north from saudi arabia9 types of amphibious ships us navy amphibious ships have designations starting with the letter l as in amphibious landing navy amphibious ships can be divided into two main gr oups the socalled bigdeck amphibious assault ships designated lha and lhd which look like mediumsized aircraft carriers and the smaller but still siz eable amphibious ships designated lsd or lpd10 which are sometimes called smalldeck amphibious ships the lhas andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs4 10 continued in the designation or not all these ships have well decks 11 us department of the navy naval operations concept 2006 washington 2006 pp 30 the navy states further on pages 3031 that like all sea bases the composition of gfs depends on combatant commander requirements the operating environment and the mission from its sea base continuedlhds have large flight decks and ngar decks for embarking and operating numerous helicopters and vtol fixedwing aircraft while the lsds and lpds have much smaller flight decks and hangar decks for embarking and operating smaller numbers of helicopters the lhas and lhds as bigger ships in general can individually embark more marines and equipment than the lsds and lpds forward deployments on any given day some of the navys amphibious ships like some of the navys other ship s are forwarddeployed to various overseas operating areas forwarddeployed us na vy amphibious ships are often organized into formations called expeditionary st rike groups esgs an esg notionally includes three amphibious ships one lha or lhd one lsd and one lpd these three amphibious ships which are referred to as an amphibious ready group arg together can embark marine expeditionary unit meu consisting of about 2200 marines their aircraft their landing craft their combat equipment and about 15 days worth of supplies in addition to the arg and its embarked meu each esg also notionally includes three surface combatants some or all armed with tomahawk cruise missiles one attack submarine nd perhaps one or more p3 longrange land based maritime patrol aircraft esgs are designed to be independently deployable strikecapable naval formations but they can also operate in conjunction with carrier strike groups csgs to form larger naval task forces on average two or perhaps three esgs might be forwarddeployed at any given time amphibious ships are also sometimes forwarddeployed on an individual basis to certain lowerthreat operating areas particularly for conducting peacetime engagement activities with foreign countri or for responding to smallerscale contingencies in such deployments an amphibious ship might serve as the core of new kind of navy formation called global fleet station gfs the navy announced the gfs concept in 2006 and is now implementing it in certain areas around the world including the caribbean nd the gulf of guinea off the western coast of africa core of gfs consists of an amphibious ship or highspeed sealift ship that is forwarddeployed to region of interest smaller navy ships such as littoral combat ships lcss might then operate in conjunction with this core ship the navy states that the gfs is persistent sea base of operations from which to coordinate and employ adaptive force packages within regional area of interest focusing primarily on phase 0 shaping operations theater security cooperation global maritime awareness and tasks associated specifi cally with the war on terror gfs offers means to increase regional maritime secu rity through the cooperative efforts of joint interagency and multinational partners as well as nongovernmental organizations11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs5 11 continued each gfs would serve as selfcontained headquarters for regional operations with the capacity to repair and service all ships small craft and aircraft assigned additionally the gfs might provide classroom space limited medical facilities an information fusion center and some combat service support capability the gfs concept provides leveraged highyield sea based option that achieves persistent presence in support of national objectives additionally it complements more traditional csgesg training and deployment

goal the ae part is often dropped for convenience even thoug h the current require ment still relates to meb aes rather than complete mebs marine corps officials state that th 2006 reduction in the amphibious lift goal to 20 meb aes is acceptable because the navy and marine corps also plan to field new squadron of 14 nextgeneration maritime prepositioning force ships called the maritime prepositioning force of the fu ture or mpff the planned 14ship mpff squadron which is to include th ree modified lhalhdtype ships and 11 sealift ie cargotransport ships is to have capability for putting an additional meb ashore unlike the amphibious ship force the mpff squadron is not intended as assault shipping the sealif t ships in the mpff squadron have less survivability and selfdefense

11 lpd17s in explaining how the requirement for 20 meb aes translates into this 33ship requirement the marine co rps states the following given the lift capabilities of the navys current amphibious ships each meb ae would require 19 operational amphibious ships to lift 6 lhaslhds 7 lsd4149s and 6 lpd17s to arrive at more fiscally c onstrained goal the marine corps reduced the above 19ship tota l to 17 operational ships 5 lhaslhds 7 lsd4149s and 5 lpd17s this 17ship force requires about 11 of the meb aes vehicles to be shifted to the afoe which creates degree of operational risk this 17ship force was presented to navy officials in mid2007 to arrive at stillmore fiscally constrained goal navy and marine corps officials in mid2007 agreed to reduce the 17ship total to 15 operational ships 5 of each kind this 15ship force requires about 20 of the meb aes vehicl and about 12 of its cargo to be shifted to the afoe which creates an additional degree of operational risk the marine corps testif ied in april 2008 that each meb ae requires seventeen amphibi ous warfare ships however given current fiscal constraints the navy and marine corps have agreed to assume degree of operational risk by limiting the assault echelon of each meb by using only fifteen ships per meb16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs8 17 as shown in appendix the marine corps alternatively s stated that in light

whether to procure lpd17s that are in addition to those in the navys shipbuilding plan congress may consider several factors including those discussed below potential operational implicati ons of not meeting lift goal falling short of the 20 meb amphibious lift goal could preclude or increase the operational risk associated with attempting larg erscale amphibious landing which could in turn affect us military options in major regional conflict where the us objective is to evict significant opposing conven tional military forces from land area that borders onto the sea potential example of such situation would be conflict on the korean peninsula scenario that has low likelihood of occurring on any given day but which could ve significant implications for us security if it were to occur falling short of the 20 meb ae goal could also reduce the navys ability to use amphibious ships for conducting other kinds of operations that are more likely to occur on daytoday basis such as those listed earlier in the section on functions and uses of amphibious ships potential impact on other programs reducing funding for one or more other navy or dod programs so as to make funding available for lpd17 procurement could have its own resulting operational implications which might then be weighed against the ope rational benefits of additional lpd17 procurement service life extensions for amphibious ships as mentioned earlier the navys projected 32 or 33ship amphi bious force assumes service life extensions for certain existing amphibious ships if the navy is not able to achieve all of these service life extensions because of limits on ship maintenance funding or future discoveries of significant problems in the ships material condition then the total number of amphibious ships in service in certain future years will be lower than the navy projects and the amount of amphibious lift capability in certain future years will be less than that shown in table 4 conversely if the navy is able and chooses to extend the lives of these ships even fu rther than currently planned then the amount of amphibious lift capability in certain future years will be less than that shown in table 4 planned mpf f squadron as discussed earlier the 2006 reduction in the amphibious lift goal to 20 meb aes is ac ceptable to the marine corps in part because the planned mpff squadron is to provide capability for putting an additional meb ashore if because of budget constraints or other factors some or all of the mpff ships are not procur ed shortfalls in combined amphibious shipmpff lift could be greater than what would be suggested by looking solely at the amphibious ship figures in table 4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs14 25 the navy in 1996 awarded the contract to desi gn and build

ronald orourkethe cost of 10th lpd17 could be affected by when the ship is procured if the interval between the 9th ship which was procured in fy2008 and the 10th ship grows beyond certain point the procurement cost of the 10th ship could increase because of break in the lpd17 production learni ng curve and the incurring of lpd17 production line restart costs the navy testified in april 2008 that if you look at the industrial base and where we are in the lpd production i would say that you could wait until fy2010 to buy that 10th ship with little bit more risk than if you were to procure it in fy2009 but beyond that you would definitely end up with cold production line27 some observers have proposed using the basic lpd17 hull design as the basis for building other kinds of ships for the navy such as the navys planned jccx joint command ship which the navy wants to procure in fy2012 the lsdx the navys projected replacement for the lsd4149 class ships or naval gunfire support version of the basic lpd17 hull wh ich is an option that has been suggested by both cbo and robert work of the cent er for strategic and budgetary analyses csba28 advocates of building such ships might argue that their procurement costs could be minimized by keeping the lp d17 production line open and avoiding break in the learning curve for producing the basic lpd17 hull amphibious lift goal factors to consider in assessing the issue of whether the marine corps amphibious lift goal is appropriate congre ss may consider severa l factors including those discussed below future security environment changes in the international security environment could affect future dema nds for amphibious ships for performing various missions changes in the political or military situation on the korean peninsula for example c ould affect demands for amphi bious ships for potential use in korean peninsula conflict scenarios while changes in population patterns weather patterns commodity prices or the policies of foreign governments could affect future demands for amphibious ships for perfor ming disasterresponse or humanitarian assistance operations potential to meet demands with other forces it is possible that certain demands for us navy amphibious ships mig ht be met in other ways for example by other us forces or by allied or co alition military forces the us army has forcibleentry forces

lief operations the capab ilities nd limitations of amphibious ships however differ from those of other us forces consequently depending on the military or geographic circumstances using amphibious ships might be the preferred option or the onl option for conductin g certain operations in addition other us forces have their own mission responsibilities and consequently might not always be available to act as substitutes for amphibious ships some allied or coalition navies include amphibious ships that are potentially suitable for meeting demands that might ot herwise be met by us navy amphibious ships the number of amphibious ships in these navies however is relatively small and the capabilities of these ships are not always equal to that of us navy amphibious ships in addition foreign amphibious ships might not always be available to perform operations of interest to the united states either because they are in maintenance or already committed to performing other missions or because the allied or co alition governments fo r their own reasons do not want their amphibious ships to be used for the ssions in question even when foreign amphibious ships are available for conductin g an operation us officials might still prefer to conduct it with u s navy amphibious ships so that the united states can receive the political credit for conducting it reduction in

experienced cost growth of about 70 and is on perton basis the most expensive amphibious ship ever built for the navy33 when lpd17 procurement began followon ships in the class were estimated to cost roughly 750 million each estimated procurement costs for the followon ships subsequently grew to figures between about 1200 million and about 1500 million the navy estimates the procurement cost of the ninth ship at 1782 million relatively small portion of the cost growth in the program since its inception is attributable to the decision to reduce the programs sustaining procurement rate from two ships per year to one ship per year most of the programs cost growth is attributable to other causes34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs24 35 associated press shipbuilder navy will accept new

needed to build the ship the navy stated that it accepted lpd 17 in incomplete condition for four reasons it permitted the fleet to begin s ooner the process of evaluating lpd 17 through operational use so as to identify problems with the lpd 17 class design that need to be fixed in followon lpd17s it avoided further delays in givi ng the lpd17s crew an opportunity to conduct postdelivery tests and trial events that are intended to identify construction as opposed to class design problems with lpd17 itself it permitted lpd17 to leave the shipyard sooner and thereby mitigated schedule and cost impacts on other ships being built at the shipyard other lpd17s lhd8 and ddg51s that would have resulted from having lpd17 rema in in the shipyard longer it reduced the cost of the remain ing

disrupting the optimal construction sequence and application of lessons learned for followon vessels in these programs in the lpd 17 program the navys reliance on an immature design tool led to problems that affected all aspects of the lead ships design without stable design work was often delayed from early in the building cycle to later during integration of the hull shipbuilders stated

others although not necessa rily in the order shown below i am deeply concerned about northrop grumman ship systems ngss ability to recover in the aftermath of hurricane katrina particularly in regard to cons truction of lpd 17 class vessels i am equally concerned about ngss ability to construct and deliver ships that conform to the quality standards maintained by the navy and that adhere to the cost and schedule commitments agreed upon at the outset by both ngss and the navy even prior to katrina ngsss performance was marginal resulting in significant cost overruns that forces the navy to take delivery of the lpd17 with numer ous outstanding deficiencies ngss inefficiency and mismana gement of lpd 17 put the navy in an untenable position by taking delivery of ships with serious quality problems the fleet has suffered unacceptable delays in obtaining deployable assets twentythree months after commissioning of lpd 17 the navy still does not have missioncapable ship these delays create further problem s as work must be completed or redone by other shipyards that ar not as familiar with the ships design the navy also took delivery of lpd18 uss new orleans in an incomplete fashion albeit mo re complete than lpd17 persistent shortcomings at the ngss yards are troubling and causing not only grave concern about the lpd program but also the lha and ddg1000 programs the navy does not wish to find itself in the same situation with other ships that it faces with lpd 17 18 it is imperative that ngss deliver future ships devoid of significant quality problems and that it meet its

cautiously optimistic the oncebeleaguered program is on track on dec 15 the navy commissioned the third ship the mesa verde in panama city fla it was the first ship in the class to be delivered without significant problems the san antonio class faced difficulties beginning in late 1998 when the initial construction contract was awarded to avondale industries in new orleans avondale beat out litton ingalls shipbuild ing primarily because it planned to use new computer program to design the ships the first time navy ship was designed entirety using computer tools but the computer systems didnt work the navy kept making design changes costs escalated and major delays ensued litton ingalls bought avondale in 1999 its owners mistakenly thinking they could fix the program and in late 2000 the shipyards were acquired by northrop grumman meanwhile succession of service program managers and acquisition executives struggled to hold down the design changes and manage costs which have more than doubled from the 750 milli on per ship the navy forecast in the late 1990s all those problems and more affected th first two ships of the class the san antonio was delivered incomplete in mid2005 the navy accepted the ship knowing it had numerous constructi on defects many of which would need to be fixed at extra costs after the shipyards obligation period ended the next ship the new orleans

former vice admiral said after viewing the photos it looks like more of systemic problem from when it was built the ones who suffer are the bluejackets said sestak member of the house armed services committee and former top warfare requirements and programs officer for the navy naval analyst and author norman polmar put it more bluntlyits criminal its criminal that the navy accepted this ship he said and this is two and half years after the navy accepted the ship its bad enough that it was delivered this way polmar said he thinks the san antonio should be towed back to the shipyard as taxpayer and as naval analyst he said im fuming whos to blame those familiar with the situation do not blame the crew or navy engineers for the problem comparing it with the discovery of flaw in your cars chassis during road trip you may have topped off the oil and filled the gas tank before you left they say but you cant be expected to examine work completed long ago when the car was built at the auto plant even those responsible for ensuring the material condition of the fleet the ultracritical board of inspecti on and survey do so under certain assumptions one navy source said even insurv

expeditionary strike groups so theyre ready for integrated operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs35 thats different type of readiness than material condition she added pat dolan spokeswoman for naval sea systems command said naval engineers declined request to explain the damage because they refused to comment on photos that had not been officially released the photos were posted on blog and later authenticated by dolanshe did say that when the ship pulled into bahrain it was greeted by crew of more than 30 engineers pipefitters and welders flown to bahrain from the us as of nov 13 there were initial cost estimates and available progress reports were still looking at mid to late november for the repairs to be completed dolan said she added that engineers are conducting rootcause analysis and the repair and ship crews are fixing the fl aws noting some that require replacing whole sections of pipe earlier dolan said the oil leaks had not posed danger to sailors working near them other problems lurking naval experts and engineers familiar with the san antonios history are concerned that if these welding problems went undiscovered until now what other problems are waiting to pop up jan van tol retired captain who commanded the amphibious assault ship essex said he had deployments during his career commanding three ships that were interrupted by major breakdowns nd that its not unusual to have technical experts come aboard but the size of the repair team and the nature of this casualty is notable he said it surprises to see oil leaking fro m such major points i associate leaks with moving parts he said whats unusual is the sheer number of people who are going out to address what appe ars to be widerranging problem van tol said he thinks any such flaw if detected would have prevented the ships deployment so how did the ship get as far as it did are these systemic problems in one or more of the ships systems and physical plant if they are that goes to the question of craftsmanship and why did the navy accept the ship are there shipwide problems of similar nature of poor craftsmanship and quality assurance who made the decisions to allow it to reach this point he said it raises the question of supervision and oversight both at the shipyard and on the navys side he wont go as far as other critics but he did say the situation certainly doesnt look goodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs36 its imperative to take harsh harsh look at how they got to this place the navy really needs to learn some harsh lessons he said those lessons may soon be in the syllabussestak the former threestar has called for hard look at the defense acquisition process since his arrival in congress in 2007 he believes the problems aboard the san antonio are symptom of larger institutional breakdown among the defense industry the pentagon and congress as former commander in the fleet he said he finds it hard to believe that the san antonio could have been allowe d to deploy if anyone knew these breakdowns were imminent i expected to be handed machines of war that had certain level of readiness i then had to maintain at times there were unexpected problems something could break but i never expected to deploy with machine of war particularly relatively new one that had systemic problems that would take weeks at time to fix said sest ak who commanded the george washington carrier strike group when its something that appears sy stemic to the construction of the machine of war were giving short shrift to our warriors out there he said operators preparing for deploy ment care about how the ship and the crew perform its not their job to inspect welds quality construction is supposed to be given something certified long before the ship is ever put into action in predeployment certifications the yre not looking inside the welds theyre looking at how its operating at that moment he said sestak said the lpd 17 class is just one weapon system among many with major problems id like to go back to what are th institutional processes that permitted this to happen that is where id like to go back to the sources and find out how this can be done better he said i ve proposed that we should have hearings on acquisition reform in the new ssion with lpd 17 part of that for polmar the naval analyst the navys experience with the san antonio is scandal worthy of investigation he compares it to the infamous air force tanker deal that sent an air force civilian and an industry executive to jail besides the money and shoddy product polmar said putting such problematic ship to sea put sailors lives at risk its as big in some respects as the ta nker deal because its difficult to get to the truth of this he said its difficult to find out who accepted the ship people went to jail and were fined in th tanker deal and thats the minimum of what should happen herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs37 48 andrew scutro gator oil leaks what went

manager lpd17 told defense daily in recent interview galinis said initial inspections found couple of issuesone problem was improperly installed or missing pipe hangers second issue were welds that galinis noted were on the lower side of the acceptable criteria in some cases those welds didnt pass visual inspection he addedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs38 those items combined resulted in some cracked welds that we found we believe it was fatigue failure he added lot of that analysis is still ongoing as of earlier this week repairs to the san antonio were 50 percent complete and the work was expected to be wrapped up by mid to late november the main propulsion lube oil system problem on lpd17 has led to classwide review navy source told defense daily that review includes inspection of the weld quality and an examination of whether the number of pipe supports on lpd18 19 and 20 are sufficient we are doing engineering analysis nd shipboard inspections the source said that includes visual radiological and dye penetration the lube oil leaks occurred in the forward and aft machinery space the source said the inspections take place in two groups one focusing on the welds and the other on the pipe hangers galinis said weld inspections in one of two machinery rooms have been completed on lpd18 galinis added the results of that inspection show the welds are good he notedthe ship is underway right now when she pulls back in herewell do the second machinery room galinis said we also just completed the pipe hanger inspection so we have list of pipe hangers we need to add the pipe hanger work likely will get done before lpd18s deployment next year he added the inspections are not limited to the ships however galinis added the navy is also looking at the weld insp ection techniques used in the shipyards we are doing that from training aspect looking at the weld criteria that is applied when you do visual inspectionhow thats applied to ensure there is uniformity we are also taking an opportunity to go back and look at the processes that are in place in the shipyard all th way from how the pipe is fabricated in the pipe shop and weld joints that are installed and how the welding is done to installation on the ship and the way the pi pe gets hangered on the ship galinis said if you follow that trend all the way from material receipt through the fabrication of pipe details to the installa tion of the pipe on the ship to the testing of the pipe and inspection of the welds nd the installation of the system if you follow that process all the way through th ere are things along the way here that we certainly can improve on he added and we are taking that opportunity to do this northrop grumman noc ship systems said the quality of its work is something the company takes very seriouslyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs39 we have rigorous program in place that includes inspecting and evaluating our work to ensure it adheres to the navys requirements when issues arise we aggressively address them in an immediate and methodical way margaret mitchelljones northrop grumman shipbuilding spokeswoman told defense daily upon hearing there may be problem with lube oil leaks on lpd17 we immediately res ponded with technical staff to assist in the navys efforts and began our own inhouse criti we have put our best people in place to assist our customer and we ar proactively conducting comprehensive review of our procedures processes and policies surrounding the lpdclass ships currently under construction at our gulf coast shipyards those efforts include the implementa tion of shortterm corrective actions until aligned with the navy northrop grumman determines the cause and need for any longterm corrective actions to ensure conformance and reinforce the commitment to quality the company has in its work mitchelljones added we have invited and welcomed navy participation throughout our own internal review process northrop grumman builds the san ant onioclass amphibious ships at both its pascagoula miss and new orleans shipyards the fourth ship of the class lpd 20 was just delivered galinis said lpd21 through 25 are under construction with lpd22 and 24 being built at pascagoula and lpd21 23 and 25 being built in new orleans the navy just received funding for lpd26 in the fy 09 defense bill we are in the process of putting together the rfp documents galinis said lessons learned from the lube oil leak on lpd17 have been rolled into ldp21 he added currently lpd21 is about to begin the process where its lube oil system is flushed galinis said obviously lessons learned from l pd17 were immediately applied to lpd21 because that piping system although it is installed and fully built hasnt been completed with all theins ulation so it was very easy to take what we were seeing on lpd17 and go ba ck and look at lpd21look at the welds look at where the pipe hangers areand in some cases quite frankly even now not all the pipe hangers are installed so we are kind of still in that process for the ships that have already been delivered galinis said there is big focus on lpd18 which is out on the west coast and w ill deploy next year lpd19 is currently going through her post shakedown availability psa in norfolk va at bae systems we will do weld and hanger inspection on her during the current psa period she is in galinis said the navy is doing an inspection righ t now on lpd20 earlier this month she was going through an engineering certification with her crew galinis said we didnt want to get into the machiner spaces while she was going through that inspectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs40 50 geoff fein navy making sure lpd17 lube oil leak problem doesnt spread to rest of class defense daily november 20 2008 13 ellipses and material in brackets as in the originalthat certification wrapped up last week so the navy is now going through the inspection on her he added so far the results look pretty good but we are still in that process50 it was subsequently repor ted in november that while it might appear that the navys san antonioclass program is fraught with problems the navy and industry team have been able to drastically reduce the number of inspection trial cards and put in place construction practices to cut down on installation work and on cost according to navy official when the uss san antonio lpd17 wrapped up her trials the navys board of inspection and survey insur v wrote up just over 16000 trial cards capt bill galinis lpd17 program manager told defense daily in recent interview in april 2007 lpd17 went into bae systems repair facility in norfolk va to fix the problems found by the inspection the cost of post shakedown authority psa for the uss san antonio was 36 million when the uss new orleans lpd18 fini shed her trials earlier this year the insurv board wrote up just under 14000 trial cards galinis noted when we delivered the ships they were not quite finished he said of both the san antoni and new orleans when we got to lpd19 thats wh ere we saw the big down shift we had little bit more than 50 percent reduction from hull 2 to hull 3 and that was step increase for us galinis said same thing on part 1 cards where you went from 740 cards to 257better than 50 percent decrease from the second to third ship part 1 cards note deficiencies that w ould affect mission area of the ship such as defensive systems the ability to get underway and embark marines galinis said part 2 cards are material deficiencies that would not necessarily degrade mission area he added by the time the uss mesa verd lpd20 underwent her insurv inspection the amount of part 1 cards decr eased almost 90 percent galinis said thats real credit to the builder and the navy team thats down there on site where literally we go through and prepare ship to go through the trial process galinis saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs41 the first trial is conducted by the na vys supervisor of ships supship galinis said they take the insurv reports from the previous inspections and start from there as we go through the test sequence we are looking at these deficiencies and making sure we are rolling those lessons in he said the shipyard has process where they do that and the supship does that as well but its difficult to roll in those lessons learned thats because two different yards are building the lpd 17 class northrop grumman noc ship systems pascagoula miss facility and the companys shipyard in new orleans across the class you dont get true l earning because we are building ships in alternate facilities galinis said although there is some part of the workforce that moves back and forth across the two shipyards another issue has been that the ssons learned from lpd17 and 18 have been rolled into the followon ships out of sequence galinis said on lpd19 and 20 lot of these lessons learned were cut inout of sequence in other words if you had to plan how you do the work some of the changes as result of some of these ear lier insurv trials were rolled into these follow ships probably not at the optimum time if you had an opportunity to really plan it out he said thats beca use if you take look at how the ships stack up on top of one another they were just that close in the construction sequence not being able to cut that work in in sequence affects not only the number of changes that can be cut in but also wh at it cost to do that work galinis added that also affects the end cost of this ship in some cases because it takes more man hours to do that galinis said it is the three two one rule what would take you an hour to do in unit would take you two hours to do when you stack that on and when the ship goes into the water that task would take you three hours to do he said so you can see as ship gets closer to delivery it gets more expensive to do the same amount of work because you close the ship down and are working in much more confined spaceand its more difficult to do the work thats why when i say we are cutting corrections in out of sequence here you dont generally get as much learning and the same leverage galinis added what people will start to see on the uss new york lpd21 and the follow ships however is that lot of this work is being done in sequence galinis said so we are able to sort of pan that in and certainly with lpd 22 and followon you will see even more of that the other thing the navy and northrop grumman have been able to do on these ships is to increase the amount of preoutfit on the units galinis said there are 210 units on lpd17class ship those units are built in modules what the navy would like to try to do is get as much preoutfitting done as they possibly canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34476crs42 51 geoff fein lessons learne d from insurv inspections lead to improvements on san antonioclass defense daily november 21 2008 35 ellipses and bracketed material as in the originalby installing piping systems equipment some machinery units ventilation electrical components things of that natureon the earlier ships preoutfitting has probably been in the 70 percent range we are moving up into the 90 percent or even better on these ter ships galinis said going back to that threetwoone rule we are doing t more of that work on the front end of the construction process at lower cost as we start to stack those units there is less installation work to do on the back end the lessons learned in the items that were identified on the previous ships that work is being done more efficiently in sequence on lpd 21 and follow and we are also able on lpd 22 and follow to pull that back further and include that as part of the preoutfittin g work that we do we are increasing that amount of work as well51
