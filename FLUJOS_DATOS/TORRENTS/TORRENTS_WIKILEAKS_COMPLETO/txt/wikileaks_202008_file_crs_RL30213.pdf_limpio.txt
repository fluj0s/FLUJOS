district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance act of 1995 pl 1048 created the authority and the office of chief financial officer cfo the authority and cfo are charged with improving the delivery of city services and returning the district of columbia to position of financial solvency as evidenced by four consecutive years of balanced municipal budgets working in concert with the districts elected political leadership the authority and the cfo have implemented series of financial and management reforms these reforms the shifting of some statelike functions to the federal government improved tax collections and an improved economy have resulted in two consecutive years of budget surpluses with the possibility of yet third the district ended fy1997 with surplus of 185900000 for fy1998 the citys budget surplus was 112492000 the fy1998 surplus was in part the result of the national capital revitalization act of 1997 pl 10533 the act allocated to the city more than 5 billion in federal funds transferred government financial responsibility for prisons and court operations and the accumulated pension liability for police firefighters teachers and judges to the federal government the act also increased the federal share for medicaid from 50 to 70 at the end of fy1998 the districts accumulated general fund balance was 112 million the citys accumulated general fund surplus at the end of fy1999 is projected to be 282 million according to the districts proposed fy2000 budget the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 division sec 101c requires the inclusion of 150 million operating reserve in any budget submitted for congressional approval beginning with the budget for fy2000 based on this provision the districts proposed fy2000 budget would produce projected fy2000 yearend surplus of 313 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30213crs3 changes in district leadership during 1998 the districts elected political leadership changed on november 5 1998 voters elected the districts former cfo anthony williams to be mayor of the district of columbia mr williams who had served three years as the districts cfo before resigning on june 8 1998 ran on his record as cfo mr williams defeated four veteran members of the council of the district of columbia the council during the primary and general elections changes in the citys mayoral leadership were also accompanied by changes in the citys elected legislative body the council of the district of columbia in the general election in november 1998 district voters elected three new city council membersvincent orange jim graham and phil mendelson and reelected david catania who had been elected in december 1997 in special election catania and the three new council members who unseated established incumbents ran on reform minded good government platforms the district voters also elected five members to the citys elected school board they include gail dixon atlarge westy byrd ward 2 tom kelly ward 7 william lockridge ward 8 and dwight singleton ward 4 none had served previously on the elected school board in addition the school board successfully challenged the authori tys power to appoint an education oversight committee arguing that the oversight committee lacked the authority to usurp the boards powers this led to the signing of an agreement between the authority and the school board that would allow the school board to regain control of the public schools by june 30 2000 in addition to changes in elected leadership there were changes in the composition of the authority during the threemonth period from june through august the president appointed four new members to the fivemember authority including new chair in midjune 1998 the president appointed robert p watkins former federal prosecutor and dr alice rivlin vice chair of the federal reserve board to the authority for threeyear terms the president also reappointed constance newman to oneyear term on july 29 1998 on august 4 1998 the president appointed eugene kinlow board member of washington metropolitan transit authority and darius mans world bank economist to twoyear terms on the authority september 1 1998 marked the start of the terms of the newly appointed members of the authority the president designated dr rivlin as the authoritys new chair replacing dr andrew brimmer also stepping down from the authority were joyce ladner edward singletary and stephen harlan management reform on march 5 1999 the president signed the district of columbia management restoration act of 1999 pl 1061 the act repeals the district of columbia management reform act of 1997 subtitle b of title xi of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 thus restoring to the mayor management authority for the daily operation of the citys nine largest departmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30213crs4 the act allows the mayor to appoint and dismiss department heads it also restores the councils authority to confirm mayoral appointments without the concurrence of the authority this transfer in management authority represents progress by the citys elected government working with the authority in its effort to restore selfgovernment largely lost since april 1995 in restoring the mayor s management authority congress seeks greater accountability and less diffusion of responsibility by clarifying the lines of responsibility and authority between the mayor and the authority the change in the authoritys leadership and the election of anthony williams as mayor has coincided with statutory changes in the relationship between elected city officials and the authority in the past the authority took much more direct role in daily operations of the district government mayor williams the former cfo successfully lobbied the authority to transfer control of the nine major agencies from the chief management officer cmo to the mayor restoring some measure of home rule the transfer of power to hire and dismiss the department heads in charge of the citys nine largest agencies changes the role of the authority from direct management to oversight management reforms have proceeded unevenly according to variety of observers despite progress made in some agencies others have recently faltered the police department is reported to have been slow to decrease the number of officers doing administrative work response time problems persist in the districts 911 emergency and 1010 nonemergency telephone system in addition the district is losing 18 million annually because it maintains 9000 unused telephone lines moreover the citys property management department acknowledged that the district has been leasing at least eight blighted vacant or abandoned buildings for period of years an additional 162 blighted and abandoned buildings including schools tax delinquent housing and commercial real estate controlled by the city have been identified by city agencies district of columbia city council reform in early 1999 two studies critical of the councils operations were released in january 1999 the national conference of state legislatures released report to the council of the district of columbia building stronger more effective institution the study which was conducted at the request of the council detailed problems in the operation and organization of the districts legislative body created under the home rule act of 1974 in february the dc appleseed center released its study of the operation and organization of the council entitled operational reform of the district of columbia council fixityourself manual both reports criticized the operations of the council and recommended reforms the studies found the council too reliant on the use of the emergency legislation process noting that it used the emergency process to pass nearly half of its legislation the studies also found that the council is hampered by operational and structural problems such as the fragmented and parochial nature of its committee structure the prevalence of patronage in its committee staffing and the lack of centralized professional staff capable of providing indepth analysis of proposed legislation the studies also noted the councils inconsistent execution of its oversight responsibilitie s and the unfocused and undisciplined nature of public hearingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30213crs5 included among the various recommendations of the studies are the following abolish the current committee structure and the practice of allowing the chair of each council committee to select committee staff create centralized permanent resource of professionally trained public policy staffers capable of performing legislative and public policy research bill drafting fiscal analysis and related legislative services improve dissemination of information to the public provide timely distribution of proposed bills and amendments to council members to allow each member sufficient time to formulate an informed opinion concerning proposals meaning and impact and improve the councils standard legislative process by providing better and more timely information to council members and the public public education for the first time in four years the district of columbia public schools opened on time in september 1998 however despite this minor accomplishment the school system faced challenges in meeting the needs of its students like so many district government institutions the citys public education system has experienced changes during the past year and will face challenges in the coming months in april 1998 general julius becton resigned as chief executive of the district of columbia public schools and was replaced by arlene ackerman on november 3 1998 voters elected five new members to the school board in late october 1998 the authoritys chair alice rivlin signed memorandum on returning authority to the board of education offering the elected school board the promise of complete return of responsibility and authority for operations of the districts public schools by june 30 2000 in 1996 the authority had declared the school system to be in state of crisis stripped the elected school board of its powers and appointed an emergency board of trustees in january 1998 the elected school board successfully challenged the authoritys power to transfer its oversight and management powers to the appointed emergency board of trustees the rivlin memorandum of october 1998 gives the elected school board some input on school discipline and facilities and promises to increase the elected boards decisionmaking powers the elected board continues to retain the power to grant charters to groups seeking to start public charter schools in 1998 the district experienced an expansion in the number of public charter schools these schools are financially supported by public education funds but operate independently of the school system bureaucracy in 1998 22 institutions received charter school designation by september 1999 the number of charter schools is expected to reach 29 during the 19971998 school year three charter schools operated in the city currently approximately 3600 5 of the total student population in the district of columbia attends public charter schools in august 26 1998 during testimony before the house oversight subcommittee on the district of columbia constance newman member of the authority identified problems in the school systems special education program the district public school system provides special education services to nearly 7700 studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30213crs6 approximately 10t of the districts public school population the number of students seeking special education assistance is expected to grow to 11000 this growth in special education needs has implications for the future cost of education and the pace of educational reform the school system has budgeted 167 million for special education services for fy1999 which is 30 of the school systems total budget funding is not the only issue delays in the period between the time student is referred and assessed increase the number of students placed in private educational institutions which adds to cost of special education concern about the cost of these delays prompted congress to include provision in the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 that extends the time period between referral and assessment of students with special education needs from 50 days to 120 days in addition in september 1998 the superior court appointed two receivers to improve educational instruction at the oak hill prison school which houses district youth offenders in response the council passed pr 13113 on april 13 1999 the resolution establishes special committee council special education program investigation special committee to investigate the delivery of special education services and includes all members of the city council of district of columbia the resolution gives the special committee one year to investigate and recommend improvements in the delivery of services in april 1999 the superintendent of public schools placed three of the agencys top special education administrators on administrative leave the superintendent also announced administrative and programmatic changes as part of 90day action plan intended to address some of the agencys longstanding problems including transferring the responsibility for special education assessments to school principals receiverships the courts continue to play significant role in the daily operations of the district government according to the districts proposed budget for fy2000 7 of proposed total general fund expenditures 4637 billion will be controlled by court appointed receivers three agencies the child and family services mental health services and district columbia jail medical services account for at least 352 million in proposed spending controlled by court order the budget does not include cost estimates for two other agencies controlled by court appointed receivers the district of columbia public housing authority and the oak hill prison school in september 1998 the district of columbia superior court appointed two receivers to manage the daily operations of the oak hill prison school the new receivers appointed by the court are peter leone and sheri mitchell of the university of maryland the judge stated that he was not satisfied with educational services provided to the youth offenders housed at the oak hill prison located in laurel maryland after appointing the receivers the judge stated that the operations of the school could be returned to the district school system before the next school year the city could also see the return of the housing authority from receivership by the year 2000 according to press reports the agency has been in receivership sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30213crs7 1995 legislation has been introduced by council chair linda cropp that would allow the agency to retain its independent status despite progress made by the districts public housing agency there are indications that three of the four other agencies under court ordered receivership are prepared to be returned to district government control any time soon

surrounding jurisdictions in the states of maryland and virginia the tax parity act passed by the council is projected to reduce commercial property taxes and personal and business income taxes by 300 million over fiveyear period the measure has been the source of debate among city leaders and during congressional hearings democrats on the house and senate on the district of columbia appropriations

strategy to encourage business development and reverse the exodus of middle class families congressional action on the budget congress not only appropriates federal payments to the district to fund certain activities but also reviews the districts entire budget including the expenditure of local funds the district subcommittees of both the house and senate appropriations committees must approve

during house consideration of the districts appropriations bills for fy2000 the controversy surrounding creation of needle exchange program touched on issues of home rule public health policy and government sanctioning and facilitating the use of illegal drugs proponents of needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hiv among illegal drug users by reducing the incidents of shared needles opponents of such efforts contend that such programs amount to government sanctioning of illegal drugs by supplying drug addicted persons with the tools to use them they content that public health concerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through shared contaminated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and the citys ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressional actions the conference committee versions of hr 2587 and hr 3064 which was vetoed by the president on november 3 1999 would have prohibited the use of federal and district funds to finance needle exchange program the senate during consideration of its version

not include funding for such program in the bill forwarded to the full appropriations committee for its part the house appropriations committee reported bill hr 2587 that included provision

congress agreed on compromise that would have allowed the private funding of needle exchange program but would continue to prohibit the use of federal and district funds for such program presently only one entity prevention works private nonprofit aids awareness and education program operates privately funded needle exchang program the house version of hr 3194 included provision that would prohibit any organization that receives federal or district funds from funding needle exchange program with private funds this was reversal of language contained in hr 3064 which prohibited organizations from using public funds for needle exchange activities but did not prevent or prohibit an organizat ion that receives public funds from operating privately funded needle exchange program pl 106113 and the senate version of hr 3194 included the language of hr 3064 allowing organizations to continue to receive public funds for other activities while using private funds to finance needle exchange programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30213crs24 medical marijuana the medical marijuana initiative provision in the district of columbia appropriations bills is yet another issue that engende rs controversy last year congres s included provision that prohibited the city from counting ballots of an initiative that would allow the medical use of marijuana to assist persons suffering debilitating health conditions and diseases including cancer and hiv infection the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 and hr 3064 as vetoed by the president prohibit the implementation of the medical marijuana initiative known as initiative 59 house appropriations committee version of hr 2587 the first version of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 included provision that would have prohibited the use of federal funds to tally the results of the ballot initiative but would have allowed the city to use local funds to determine the outcome of the initiative the district of columbia board of elections estimated the cost of tallying the results as approximately 136 the house provision of hr 2587 was later changed to include prohibition on the use federal and district funds to implement any law legalizing the use of marijuana even for medical purposes the conference committee version of hr 2587 which was vetoed by the president would have allowed the tallying of the votes cast for and against the medical use of marijuana but would have kept in place all penalties for the use distribution or possession of schedule 1 control substances which would include marijuana opponents of the conference committee provision content that such actions undercuts the concept of home rule the provisions proponents argue that the provision allows the peoples voice to be heard but keeps in place federal sanctions last year the congress power prohibiting the counting of medical marijuana ballot initiative was challenged in suit filed by the dc chapter of the american civil liberties union aclu on september 17 1999 district court judge richard roberts ruled that congress despite its unique legislative responsibility for the district under
