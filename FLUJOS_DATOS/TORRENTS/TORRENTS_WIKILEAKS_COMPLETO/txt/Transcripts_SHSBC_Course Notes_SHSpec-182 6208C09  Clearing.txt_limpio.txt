6208c09 shspec182 clearing what are you as an auditor trying to do you are trying to clear people you should recognize that all processes are subordinate to this end to be clearable person has to be auditable if someone cant talk listen or respond he is unauditable you arent concerned with states of insanity as defined by kraepelin this is subject that is subordinate to scientology we have used the words sanity and insanity for pr purposes but actually we have nothing to do with either there is not person on earth who is sane they are all batty or they wouldnt be here someone who is sane is someone who resolves problems for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics that is sane action and definition of sanity very few people apply that rule people fall into gradient scale of auditability that is what you should study if you are concerned with states of man person who isnt clear wont resolve things for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics even first goal clear wont ordinarily there is processing short of clearing that is worth long arduous hours now that we have 3ga so we become interested in auditability the trick at the moment is to clear someone while he is clearing someone else the struggle for lrh is not to clear people it is to get people to clear people people in the ruds and havingness group are there not because they are unauditable but because they are not able to audit well enough to receive auditing person to be unauditable has to be pretty bad off his auditability is determined by how many overts he is secretly committing while being audited the lowest level of auditability is the person who can be cleaned up who will keep his snoot clean long enough for you to clean up his needle below that level is the pc who will never tell you who wont cooperate or be frank with you at this point auditing ceases to the degree that the auditor cant get the pc to communicate it isnt that the meter wont read though that would also debar auditing almost anybody if not auditable is preparable he is still auditable on cchs and thus he can be prepared for auditing this would also apply to someone who is bleeding to death or in coma the unauditable case will get new body sooner or later so you can get him later if the technology is still there the only case that cant be reached is the one that isnt there and will never hear of scientology dont spend more time than necessary to get the goals any case that can be forced into groove can be audited the case that breaks your heart though is the one that appears auditable but is not really preparable we dont have the tools to handle such case at present the auditability of people depends in large measure on the sphere of influence of the scientologist the sphere of action that will do the world the most good is that of auditable cases they may be nutty amnesic spinbin cases but if they are auditable they can be straightened out some people have nutty idea and know it is nutty others dont know the one who has some hope who knows he can get better can be audited the one who knows one can be helped and that it is all someone elses fault etc may be lot harder to audit the bugginess of their ideas makes difference persons goal could make him sound batty but they could still be audited there is nothing wrong with somebody except that he has upped and got himself basic purpose for reasons that are unknown to him then when his basic purpose is disobeyed or blocked off you get bank developed at this point lot of other purposes he doesnt want get hooked on to the first and he follows those and he doesnt know who he is and he gets body etc etc it is incredible that clearing process to unsnarl all this was developed previous efforts at clearing peeled the guy away from the gpm but it was still there so matter how good the pc felt the chance was there that it could key in again the pcs goal is random chance factor for instance in running repetitive processes eg help processes communication processes etc the goal could be never to communicate to anyone or never to help anyone the index of how much good it will do to find and clear the pcs goal is the amount of case gain you can get on person who has had wrong goal found if you sit down with him on meter and handle that goal with the to be tiger drill reference hcob 29nov62 routines 2i2 321 and 3gaxx tiger drill for nulling by midruds see fig 10 clean it until all sensation and pain have gone gone off it you will see more case gain than you have seen for some time what is happening is that finding the wrong goal did keyin of what was there anyway it could have keyed in at any time now you clean it up and it has further effect on him this could lead to wild problems intensive 1 have the pc write list of all the problems that he has had this lifetime 2 ask him what decision would have solved the first second third problem etc etc dont date them they are really goals 3 dust them off lightly with the tiger drill it is little chunk of doing goals list and the pc will get phenomenal relief not that you would necessarily do this on someone it is workable because of the value of decision the bank is basic decision or purpose which has on top of it concatenation of purposes so every time he makes decision he adds look it is simpler though to just do 3ga in the first place and this is also faster and more to the point if you can clear somebody there is reason to do anything else what this means for this planet is quite amazing threequarters of asia became civilized just because of hope that this could be done 295a figure 10 the tiger drill small tiger uses suppress big tiger uses small tiger buttons invalidated plus nearly found out suggested protest fail to reveal anxious about mistake careful procedure if the goal reads check inval etc until null then check suppress repetitively to null recheck goal b if the goal doesnt read check suppress patter to be tiger c null on this goal has anything been suppressed c read that reads what was it thank you on this goal has anything been suppressed c null to be tiger c read on this goal has anything been invalidated c null on this goal has anything been suggested c read that reads what was it thank you on this goal has anything been suggested c null to be tiger c null on this goal has anything been suppressed c
