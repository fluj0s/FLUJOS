massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary executive summary introduction and methodology during the 2007 fall semester the massachusetts institute of technology established blue ribbon committee as an advisory group to evaluate the existing campusdining program and provide recommendations as to how the program might change for the future the specific charge to the committee was to gain an understanding of the dining program and its purpose beyond just serving food some features that might relate to the campusdin ing programs purpose include but are not limited to nutritional aspect which addresses the relationship be tween sound nutrition and learning ability social engagement over meals allowing students faculty and staff to interact outside the classroom and an opportunity for creating community building that brings members of the larger institute family together and contributes to the overall learning experience as part of the evaluation the committees charge was to review and assess current program offerings current pricing and perceived value where and when they eat spending patterns delivery models the process used to evaluate the campusdining program included focus group sessions webbased market research survey benchmarking with peer schools discussions to develop vision analysis key research findings 3921 members of the mit campus community participated in webbased survey during the 2008 spring semester of which 462 were undergraduates 453 were graduate students and 85 were faculty members survey results indicated that th dining opportunities available on campus significantly influence where students choose to live and that th ere is need for several options for the diverse population these options include providing dining rooms for those who do not want to cook kitchens for those who prefer to cook their own meals and both for those who like to participate in both options on average most students indicated that eat approxi mately 14 meals every five days students living in residences with dining facilities tend to purchase slightly more meals on campus than preparing them in their room or kitchen while students living in resi dences without dining facilities tend to prepare twice as many of their own meals as purchasing them on camp us despite eating approximately fourteen meals ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 1 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary every five days less than 20 of the undergraduate st udents and less than 30 of graduates indicated that eat balanced diet 125 of the respondents percei ve they eat one healthy meal day while less than 10 do not think about health and nutrition and only eat what is convenient to them survey results suggest that the amount of money students spend on food each year varies from approximately 1750 east campus and senior house to 2250 average for students living in residence halls with dining facilities this is consid erably lower than the financial aid offices allocation of 4460 which includes 28 days for iap approximately 50 of undergraduates living in ho uses with dining halls as well as those living in burton conner and senior house thought mit should offer an all you care to eat ayce dining option interestingly 65 to 69 of the undergraduates living in macgregor new house and bexley and 44 to 47 of graduate students thought mit should offer an ayce dining option around 10 of all undergraduates living on campus indicated that they prefer all their meals to be available on an ayce basis while 27 of the undergraduates living on campus wanted combination of some ayce and some carte meals when the acye interest percentages are extrapolated to mits official bed occupancy by residence 278 undergraduate resident s prefer all their meals to be ayce while 793 undergrads prefer combination of ayce meals nd carte meals when fsilg students are included these numbers increase to 460 and 1134 respectively in general students do not perceive that the curre nt dining program provides good value and students living in residences with dining facilities expressed desire to have breakfast as part of their dining program other thoughts that survey respondents tend to agree upon included mit should offer global meal plan to build community meals are an important part of the residential life experience broader commitments are justified if it results in lower costs and better service when compared to its peer schools all the other schools offered at least one ayce dining facility with the exception of virginia tech all the peer schools had some kind of meal plan requirement nine schools require all residents three schools require all first year students and stanford requires residents that have dining hall affiliated with it to purchase meal plan the number of ayce facilities available at peer schools varied from several smaller residen tial dining venues residen tial college models to providing only few larger ones where seven schools offer an ayce dining venues that may serve from 1575 to 5500 residents among its peer schools mit has the fourth lowest dollar allocation for the equivalent of 14 meals per week meal plan proposed vision for the campus dining program after considerable discussion and analysis of the market research data the blue ribbon committee developed list of desired outcomes for the campus dining program this vision includes the following 1 students should have money set aside for food nd food only regardless of where they choose to obtain meals campus dining venues fsilgs gro cery stores offcampus venues 2 dining plans should insure that economic considerations do not compromise student nutrition everyone should be able to eat well regard less of his or her economic situation 3 opportunities need to exist to allow students to participate in the system and be part of the system this might include employment opportunities and must include programs that welcome and encourage continual feedback and input ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 2 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary 4 choice must be part of whatever system is chosen the program must also be dynamic and able to be changed 5 the institute has vested interest in building community around meals 6 good nutrition aids in better academic performance 7 mit is diverse community the system should recognize that diversity exists and plan for it 8 food should be available on schedule that matc hes customer schedules service availability should not be barrier to using the system 9 the program should be able to exist on its own merits regardless of the syst em chosen to support it shortterm recommendations taking into consideration the market research resu lts and the desired outcomes for the campusdining program shortterm recommendations were developed to address the nutritional aspects social engagement and community building features desired for the mit campusdining program nutritional aspect it is significant concern that less than 20 of th undergraduates and 30 of the graduate students are consuming balanced diet especially when other st udies have indicated that poor nutrition adversely affects cognitive performance see references at end one of mits educational missions is to combine rigorous academic study and the excitement of research with the support and intellectual simulation of diverse campus community so that students are prepared to contribute to or prosper in an environment of science and technology in society through excellence in education research and public service since the academic and learning experience at mit is rigorous it is of utmost importance that students receive nutritious and balanced diet on daily basis it is also interesting to note that when pilo t study was conducted at simmons dining hall for few weeks during the 2008 spring semester where an ayce dining program was offered for dinner rather than an carte service the bon appetit management team informed mit administrators that the types of menu items consumed changed considerably students were consuming significantly more fruits vegetables and milk when they paid fixed fee price for their meal when stud ents paid for their meal on an carte basis they would not tend to pu rchase these foods and consequently did not have the variety required to obtain all the essential nutrients and minerals needed for healthy diet to ensure that students will be more likely to c onsume nutritious well balanced meals to fuel their brains mit should provide ayce dining options the survey results suggest that the interest in ayce meals is significant and that more than one ayce di ning venue will need to be available to accommodate the demand for dinner in addition these venues need to be strategically located so that they are convenient for most of the residents such as baker an d next house at minimum and perhaps simmons since studies have indicated that the first meal of day results in better perform ance it will be important that convenient healthy breakfast options are available including hot ayce breakfast mit should also consider offering continuous service rather than set times at one of the ayce dining venues this ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 3 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary will accommodate those students that have different schedules and do not tend to eat their meals during traditional meal times given that most of the academic classes are east of massachusetts avenue baker house appears to be the logical choice for this service since it is anticipated that baker will likely be already offering an ayce breakfast and dinner at minimum later service hours will also help address the nutritiona l aspect athletes in particular find it difficult to obtain dinner meal in residential dining unit by extending the service hours to 900pm or 930pm this should accommodate the athletes and other students who have activities occurring during the dinner hour to address the late night needs of students who are still studying past midnight mit can offer carte service at next house another option is to convert the macgregor convenience store into an emporium an emporium features food platform that can provide menu items fo r all day parts breakfast lunch dinner and late night such as grill in addition to convenience and reta il items the dining environments are designed to be inviting featuring mixture of café tables and soft seating and in some cases may include small performance area similar to what one might see in co ffeehouse environment this type of environment coupled with more nutritious menu options will be more attractive and ultimately the emporium can become destination for students the other benef it is that macgregor provides an outside entrance which is easily accessible for all residents in this zone of the campus and as result provides opportunities for social engagement among all the houses there will be cost to convert macgregor to an em porium which is beyond the scope of this study however once it is implemented the institute should evaluate if the demand for late night service will merit keeping both macgregor and next house open social engagement campusdining program provides more than ref ueling persons brain however it presents opportunities for students to interact with faculty nd staff outside of the classroom setting while still contributing to their overall learning experience unfo rtunately since many of the faculty and staff leave campus by 500pm the opportunities for students to so cially interact with them over meal needs to occur primarily over lunch unfortunately the number of dining venues that encourage people to dine in and have pleasant environment that is conducive to conversation is rather limited during lunch the options might include the forbes family café and the lobdell food court mit should consider offering convenient sitdown dining venue that features more intimate setting such as residential dining venue which may be more conducive for social engagement if this venue happens to offer ayce service mit could configure its meal plan program so that students could invite faculty or staff member to lunch using one of their meal swipes or by using bonus swipe if using bonus swipe then the institute may need to step up fund to budget the faculty and staff meals if it ends up being popular program an ayce dining venue will also encourage members of the campus community to dine in rather than take their food to go when person dines in the chances of seeing someone you know increases which provides an opportunity to engage in conversation that might not have occurred otherwise even if they do not see familiar person the first time on subsequent visits seeing the same individuals in the dining room may encourage civil pleasantries that ma evolve into longterm friendships another opportunity for social engagement and prepar ing students for society in the future is creating program that features mock interview over meal faculty and staff members could act as potential employers while students are the prospective empl oyees not only will this create comfortable ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 4 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary readiness for students for when the r eal interview occurs but it also provides an opportunity to learn the proper dining etiquette that many students may not have received previously this type of program could occur over lunch or dinner besides mock interviews conducting discussion or presentation over meal that perhaps bestows additional information on particular topic or addr esses current events will provide an opportunity for faculty staff and students to interact and engage with each other outside of the traditional classroom experience community building for several years now mit has desired to increase the community aspect of campus life but has not always been successful in fostering it as noted in previous studies including the september 1998 task force on student life and learning report many think that the campus dining program can be key contributor in fostering institutew ide community but this has been ch allenging in recent years for several reasons many members of the campus community th ink that the dining halls in the residences are restricted primarily to the students living there and as result do not patronize them unfortunately the house dining venues are only open for dinner approxim ately three hours and this is fewer operating hours than in previous years the student center would be the next logical location to build community however it is very commercialized with fast food eater ies and the building itself does not have very many convenient and inviting hang out spaces where student s and members of the community can gather to see and be seen despite these challenges mit is known for its dive rse population and wants its diversity to be contributing factor to the overall campus life experi ence and the educational process as noted earlier the diverse population and their subsequent dining need s were reinforced by the survey results several survey respondents indicated that they prefer to c ook all of their own meals however the survey results suggest that students that prefer to cook tend to purc hase at least couple of their meals in the existing campus dining facilities in any given week in additi on some students want the option of consuming an ayce meal on any given day while around 10 of all residents regardless of where they live want all their meals to be on an ayce basis by offering an ayce dining venue different campus constituencies including faculty staff and offcampus students will likely dine in this facility on any given day which will bring residents from different houses into one dining venue when residents from multiple houses dine in one f acility the dining venue can provide unique opportunity for students to mingle and socialize with other members of the campus ultimately fostering sense of community campusdining venue can also provide an opportunity to educate the campus community on different ethnic cuisines exposing students to foods that they may not otherwise try which contributes to their educational process this oppor tunity can be expanded to where dining services can market and promote themed lunch or dinner that ma support or be in conjunction with campus event or activity these events can be marketed to th whole campus community where everyone including faculty and staff are invited to partake and learn about different ethnic cuisine meal plans to accommodate the changes that will foster better nut rition social engagement and community building mit will need to reconfigure its meal plan offerings factors that were considered when developing the proposed meal plans included the following 1 per the market research students are consuming approximately fourteen meals every five days ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 5 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary 2 meal plans need to accommodate the different dini ng patterns and lifestyles of all the residents consequently the meal plans will need to ffer different combinations of ayce meals and dining dollars the dining dollars can be used to purchase food items in the oncampus dining venues and convenience stores as well as pay for debit cards that can be used for food in the local grocery stores 3 meal plans need to provide flexibility and be perceived as good value 4 meal plan rates need to be appropriate w ith mits financial aid offices allocation 5 meal plan options need to

purchase th equivalent of fourteen meals per week while juniors and seniors will purchase the equivalent of ten meals per week this proposed requirement is less than what survey respondents indicated they ar currently consuming however it should provide approximately two meals day it is also recommended that students be allowed to change their meal plan once each semester and ideally this will

strategies page 8 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary the meal plans were designed to accommodate the di fferent dining patterns of students including all ayce meals some ayce meals and some carte meals few ayce meals few cart meals and cook few meals all carte meals some carte meals and cook some meals cook all the meals the declining balance plans are designed to accommodate the last three dining patterns were mostly carte meals and cooking for themselves are desired the unlimited plan and the 285 meals per semester plan can only be offered if convenient dining location such as baker is available and it offers continuous service from breakfast through dinner it should be noted that continuous service does not imply that every station needs to be open rather the appropriate stations are open during the breakfast lunch and dinner meals but between lunch and dinner perhaps only the deli bar soup and salad bar are available the key is that the menu offerings are fresh and the customer does not perceive that they ar being served leftovers or that the food has been sitting for several hours one might ask why the dining hall does not close between meals which might allow the dining program to save money the consulting teams experience is that it will not cost the institute that much more money to offer continuous service versus three meals da it is estimated that the labor cost differential between continuous service and three meals day will be approximately 25000 annually the proposed price difference between the 285 meals per semester which is approximately 19 meals per week and the unlimited plan is 300 this implies that if 42 st udents each semester elected to purchase the unlimited plan over the 285 meals per semester it would pay fo r this service more importantly the customer satisfaction level will be significantl higher if students are allowed to graze all day and do not need to worry about making it back to the dining hall before specific time to obtain the value of their meal if the institute decides to offer only two to three meals day then they n eed to be prepared to listen to students complain about missing meals failure to ad dress their missed meal issue will result in customer dissatisfaction which is not perception that is desired for the mit campus dining program it should also be noted that the unlimited plan has been successfully implemented on other campuses at princeton university students have the option of sel ecting an unlimited plan that comes with 10 guest meals for an annual cost of 5200 or they may select fro m four to six other plans that cost less 50 of the meal plan participants opt to purchase the unli mited plan which have declining balance dollars associated with the plan unlike other campuses princeton does not offer continuous service at each of the residential college dining halls because it is not cost effective for them rather students on the unlimited plan may use meal equivalency of 595 for late lunch on weekdays and 695 for late dinner monday through thursday at the frist campus center campuses that implemented unlimited plans have found them to be cost effective in that the cost per meal served can be less because students tend to eat the same amount of food if they use three swipes versus multiple swipes day customer satisfaction is also higher because students on the unlimited plan are longer restricted and it is almost like be ing at home where they access to kitchen and refrigerator most hours of the day since mit has not offered an unlimited plan or an ayce dining program in the house dining venues in recent years the acceptance factor is obviously an unknown although residents that live in close proximity to dining facilities that offer ayce service ar anticipated to participate in the plan for the ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 9 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary financial analysis the consulting team conservatively estimated that more than 25 of the 10 that desired ayce meals for all their meals would choose this option the main reason for doing this is that the unlimited plan is most successful when it is c onvenient for the students thus it was assumed that for students living in macgregor new house next house and simmons the unlimited plan would not necessarily be convenient for them and as result ma elect not to purchase the unlimited plan but may select different ayce meal plan analysis to determine the participation for each of the prop osed meal plans listed above the market research results for the ideal dining pattern was extrapolated to each residence hall by potential class as indicated in the fall 2008 housing occupancy data although the actual occupancy was higher than the official bed count the consulting team used the offi cial bed count to be conservative in the revenue projection and the ayce seating requirement three analyses were conducted one was to understand the potential demand for ayce seats for any given meal to determine how many dining venues ght need to offer this service the second was to conduct swot strength weakness opportunity thr eat analysis for the proposed changes while the third one was to understand the potential financial implications of implementing some of the proposed changes the analyses were conducted on four fiveyear scenarios as follows scenario in year 1 all currently enrolled upperclass students that are living on campus are grandfathered from purchasing meal plan and participate in the dining program on voluntary basis while all freshmen living on campus are required to purchase minimum plan that is the equivalent of fourteen meals per week in year 2 all freshmen and sophomores liv ing on campus will be required to purchase minimum plan that is the equivalent of fourteen meals per week in year 3 all juniors are required to participate and in year 4 all seniors are required where both classes must purchase the equivalent of ten meals per week scenario b is similar to scenario except that all upperclass students living in houses with dining facilities are longer eligible to be grandfathered and must purchase meal plan that is the equivalent of 10 meals per week upperclass students already living in houses without dining venues are grandfathered and may participate in the program on voluntary basis until they graduate in year 1 freshmen are required to purchase minimum plan that is the equivalent of fourteen meals per week while in year 2 both freshmen and sophomores have this requirement in year 3 and 4 ll juniors and seniors living on campus are required to purchase the equivalent of ten meals per week respectively scenario c is similar to scenario except that the dining venues available for ayce service change for example in scenar io c pritchett is not available as an ayce venue and to accommodate the demand for ayce dinners mccormick is converted to an ayce dinner service in years 2 and 3 when w1 is not available when w1 becomes available it is anticipated that baker may still be needed for ayce dinner service since the residents living in east campus and senior house that prefer ayce meals will need to walk to w1 or baker for their ayce meals scenario d is similar to scenario except contin uous ayce service is not available in years 1 2 and 3 when w1 is not availabl instead meal plan participants are

dining program which is approximately 195 per meal plan participant by ear 4 each of the scenarios are estimating subsidy of 422000 to 454000 which takes into consideration an annual inflation rate of 3 for four years this equates to 66 to 70 subsidy per meal plan participant extrapolation of the current subsidy at 3 for four years suggests that the subsidy will increase to 578338 if changes are made to the existing dining program it should also be noted that in all of the scenario s the subsidy could be considerably less since the financial assumptions appendix that were incorporat ed were very conservative factors that could reduce the subsidy include 1 the marketing and selling of lunch only meal plans to fsilg and offcampus students this is feasible option since 196 of fsilg survey respondents and 68 of offcampus students indicated their ideal dining pattern would cons ist of all ayce meals mit could offer 75 lunch only plan at 580 per semester if 20 of the fsilg students purchased this plan each semester the incremental revenue would be 21 5760 with an estimated net contribution of 129456 2 marketing and selling of meal plans to faculty sta ff and graduate students for example if 5 of the graduate students purchased 50 lunch only plan each semester the incremental revenue would be 238382 while the estimated net contribution would be 142429 3 the purchase of ayce meals with the dining dollars associated with the meal plans for example if 10 of the dining dollars associated with plans that averaged less than ten meals per week were used in the ayce facilities then the projected subsidy could be reduced by 100000 to 200000 in any given year this is reasonable expectation since 10 of the potential dining dollars averages to about five meals per semester given the popularity of an ayce brunch meal on many campuses the amount of dining dollars spent in the ayce venues could be higher than 10 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 13 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary 4 lower participation rate on each meal plan where fewer ayce meals are consumed this would reduce the overall food cost although this would not be the goa l the reality is that some students may have lower participation rates than that estimated in the financial analysis 5 students paying the door price for an ayce meal for example if 80 of the 930 fsilg students purchased one ayce lunch per week at approximately 8 the incremental gross revenues would be approximately 178560 with an estimated net contribution of 107136 6 bon appetit could hire student employees for some of the parttime positions where appropriate in some instances offering free meal for working full shift or set number of hours each day may be an incentive for some students to work in the dining halls another option that has been successful on other campuses is to pay dining services student employees higher wage perhaps 10 higher than those students that may opt to work in library 7 in the 2008 fall semester the mit housing partment was accommodating approximately 72 additional students over the official bed count considering that the average per person meal plan revenue for years 1 and 4 is 2163 this will generate incremental gross revenues of 155736 if this pattern continues in the future summary of how couple of the options above migh t influence the subsidy requirement for year 1 and

lose more money than the other scenarios since pritchett is open as an ayce dining venue this loss could be reduced if pritchett is not open an d mccormick is converted to an ayce dining venue instead the potential negatives to this change is that students living in east campus or senior house will need to walk to west campus to obtain an ayce meal while residents on west campus would need to go to the student center for any carte dinners that they would want to purchase the number of participants on each meal plan per th survey results which ultimately generates the annual board plan revenue

massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary longterm recommendations knowing that mit wants to maintain and foster residential college model yet wants to create and promote community and socialization on an institutew ide basis the institute should consider offering one centrally located ayce dining facility that is not pa rt of residence hall there are several benefits to offering centrally located dining facility including the facility can be designed to accommodate resi dents from several houses to dine and socialize together for example centrally located fac ility on west campus could accommodate residents living in burtonconner macgregor new house next house and simmons b it can feature multipurpose space where reside nts from whole house could dine together all at once if so desired or the space could be divi sible so that more than one group can reserve it c it is more efficient to operate and it provides an opportunity to offer more choices to students than what is available in the smaller house dining venues d it will encourage diverse populations to dine together one of the stations in the serving area could be designed to accommodate cooking meal with campus chef certain nights of the week or month this event would allow students faculty and staff from campus to sign up and participate in the experience which may focus on how to incorporate particular cooking technique and or prepare unusual foods f it can incorporate more sustainable dining practices in an effort to reduce the use of natural resources and the carbon footprint g the facility could become community commons building that may also include centralized mail area which tends to be destination for most students in this case the institute may want to offer an carte dining option in addition to an ayce venue since all residents in this zone of the campus would likely be visiting the commons building to eat meal or check their mail on regular basis those lingering may want to purch ase meal or snack on an carte basis or at the ayce venue if an carte venue is offered in this commons building it will be important to evaluate the need for any carte operations in the residence halls such as next house or simmons the service hours for all of the venues should be adjusted according to the demand h last but not least central location will be mo re inviting for faculty and staff member to patronize which will foster the out of classroom social interaction that is so importance to mits mission and campus life experience other considerations 1 develop meals plans for fsilg offcampus and graduate students faculty and staff as noted earlier the survey results indicated that 196 of fsilg students prefer that all their meals be ayce while 367 expressed desire for some of their meals be ayce this suggests that developing lunch only meal pl an may help complement the dining program in their house or living group when developing these plans it is recommended that the average cost per meal charged to the student for lunc h only plan be less than the cash door price to provide an incentive for them to purchase the plan if the fsilg or offcampus student is being charged tax then purchasing meal plan may re duce or eliminate the tax creating another cost savings to the student faculty staff and graduate students may find similar plan to be attractive as well and this would provide an opportun ity for the diverse members of the campus to dine together it should be noted that if the lunch only program becomes popular in the first couple of years then baker dining may not able to accommodate the demand for seats and another dining venue may need to become available 2 declining balance plans in year 1 one of the proposed declining balance plans cost 800 per semester which when extrapolated to an annual basis is less than what survey respondents indicated they are currently ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ envision strategies page 15 massachusetts institute of technology meal plan study executive summary spending on food the intent of this plan is to accommodate those students who prefer to prepare their own meals or tend to purchase them on carte basis and may not be enamored with purchasing meal plan the institute should mon itor this plan to determine if more dollars should be added to the plan and understand what percentage of the dining dollars are being used for grocery debit cards 3 grocery debit cards the grocery debit cards will allow students th flexibility to purchase food to cook their own meals to ensure that the students are receivi ng the maximum nutritional benefit the institute may want to consider differentiating the grocery debit cards that are purchased with dining dollars by differentiating the card from the gro cery stores generic debit card the cashier will be alerted so that students will not be allowed to purchase beer cigarettes soap health and aids and any other nonfood products that are typically available in grocery store 4 attractive carte dinner options as the number of ayce dining venues increase on campus the number of carte dinner options decrease it is recommended that the ins titute monitor this closely to determine if the operating hours as well as menu offerings may need to be modified for those students who prefer to purchase their meals on an carte basis 5 evaluate the changes every year since the proposed recommendations will involve significant transformation for the mit campus community it is strongly recommended that the changes be evaluated every year if not every semester in the first year it will be im portant to evaluate the changes during the fall semester to determine if the assumptions incorpor ated into the planning process were correct and what modifications if any should be implem ented to enhance the program and achieve the desired outcomes expressed by the blue ribbon committee year 1 summary in summary the proposed changes for the housing dining program in year 1 include 1 offering ayce continuous service at baker seven days week 700am 900pm or 930pm monday friday and brunch through dinner on the weekends 2 offering acye breakfast and dinner at next house 3 offering carte service at next house for late night 4 offering carte breakfast at simmons pacific java 5 offering ayce dinner at simmons 6 continuing to offer carte dinner at mccormic k and carte late night service at simmons pacific java 7 and perhaps offering ayce dinner service at pritchett if scenario b is followed by implementing the proposed changes into the house dining venues the mit campus community will be able to realize the following benefits in year 1 addresses and accommodates the ayce interest that was expressed in the survey provides healthier and additional choices for breakfast encourages students to dine in relax and socialize provides students more variety and the opportu nity to consume more nutritious meals at reasonable price athletes will appreciate the later dinner hours
