dianetics dear name we often receive questions about relationships and if they can be improved by using dianetics based on testimonies alone the answer is irrevocably yes here are few recent examples for you my relationship just blossomed and weve become closer than weve ever come before i had this really wonderful relationship with this girl she was beautiful she was everything that i wanted to have but i was for whatever reason constantly depressed i would get into these emotional situations where nothing would really occur but i would just feel like she was going to leave and i felt very insecure with her being around other guys if she was talking to some guy it would completely ruin i would sit in my bedroom crying and thinking theres just something going to go wrong shes leaving oh my goodness this relationship is not happening this was how i was feeling in life i felt like there was way i could actually go on with this relationship i couldnt do this and as guy i was trying to push it away i thought i had to be all macho about it it was really affecting and then dianetics came along i thought this has to work in my first dianetics session we addressed those issues and that loss just completely disappeared and later during the moments that i would think that i was going to react that way it didnt occur it was just gone it was absolutely beautiful my relationship just blossomed and weve become closer than weve ever come before it was just amazing kg i could see this happening in my life but just knowing it did not change anything for years i had problems with relationships i really wanted to have good marriage again but i always dated men who did not want longterm commitment it wasnt as if i was coming on too strong and they were nice enough but none of them wanted permanent relationship i could see this happening in my life but just knowing it did not change anything i was also single mother and i wanted family life where my two sons had both mother and father as it was my youngest sonwho was normally nice kidexpressed his dislike with the idea of having another man around he either bit them kicked them or found anything that he could to annoy them i tried various things to solve this problem but nothing worked finally i read dianetics and i decided to try it much to my amazement i addressed the cause of this situation in my second session afterwards i felt like new person i felt bright and full of life again and i longer had that problem in fact within year i got married to wonderful man whom both of my sons liked too were doing great mt we broke up and i was trying to get her out of my heart i had problem with an exgirlfriend i had been going out with we broke up and i was trying to get her out of my heart and with dianetics it helped relieve all that tension all that pain and all that hurt it helped get it off my chest and release all that anger i had in right now im lot clearer and lot calmer im doing better than ever in life i wake up every day and thank the lord right now its great start its totally great start what im doing right now i just know theres lot more to go so if this is happiness now i know there must be some more happiness around the corner ww i used to think that maybe i should leave my marriage i was in marriage and it was going nowhere i felt i couldnt trust my husband and matter what i was always assuming he was being dishonest with i used to think that maybe i should leave my marriage after reading dianetics i was able to see that this was irrational thought and that this was really coming from things in my past and that he was not the problem i am glad i found dianetics as today we are happily married and building strong relationship without any of these problems i am thankful that
