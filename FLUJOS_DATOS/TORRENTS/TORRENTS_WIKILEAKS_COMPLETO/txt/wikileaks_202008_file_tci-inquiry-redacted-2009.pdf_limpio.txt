then governor of the islands the t erms of reference of the commission taking into account subsequent amendment were as follows to inquire into whether there is information t hat corruption or other serious dishonesty in relation to past and present elected members of the house of assembly previously known as the legislative counci l may have taken place in recent years and to submit its preliminary findings and recommendations concerning instigating criminal investigations by the polic or otherwise and to refer such information it may obtain to the tci pros ecuting authorities b any indications of systemic weaknesses in legisl ation regulation and administration and c any other matters relating thereto 12 as i observed in my interim report submitted t the governor on 28th february 2009 the tasks set for by the terms of reference could not sensibly have been expressed wi th lower thresholds 13 under the first term of reference i am to consi der whether there is information in whatever form and giving it the weight i consider it deserves ʹ of possible corruption in relation to that is involving elected members past and present of the legislature if so i am to

commission before it began oral proceedings in providenciales in january 2009 i received much information pointing to possible systemic corruption andor of other serious dishonesty involving past and present elected members of the legislature in recent years i also found indications of systemic weaknesses in legislation regulation and administratio n and related matters calling in my view for attention as will appear in the ensuing c hapters of this report the oral proceedings were necessitated in the main to secure full disclosure of interests from ministers and other member of the house of assembly those proceedings produced an abundance of further information ʹ information that pointed not just to possibility but to high probability of such systemic venality coupl ed also with clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of general administrative in competence they demonstrated an urgent need for suspension in whole or in part f the constitution and for other legislative and administrative reforms there were so strong indications from the information before of the need for changes in oth er related matters 17 i accordingly determined by the close of the oral proceedings on 11th february 2009 that i should submit an interim report to the new go vernor his excellency gordon wetherell who had succeeded governor tauwhare as go vernor on 5th august 2008 that

for moment from the constitutio nal status of the islands achieved by 1976 it may be helpful to look back briefly at their physical cultural social and economic development since the beginning of the 20th century for this purpose i cannot do better by way of scenesetting for today than draw on the followi ng passages from the 1986 blom cooper report 29 at the beginning of this century grand turk sa lt cay south caicos east caicos middle caicos north caicos and west caicos were all populated today east and west caicos are uninhabited this small gr oup of islands sparsely populated have limited natural resources there are vast diseconomies of scales both in public and private sectors resulting in th high cost of goods and services which must be duplicated on each island this is exa cerbated by the geographical spread of the islands ranging over 166 square miles and surrounded by reef and shallow waters communication between the islands h as been perennial problem on the caicos islands there were prope r roads and the journey between the noncoastal settlements was often made on foot or by donkey grand turk was cable station and had contact with the outside world but the caicos islands were not so fortunate there has been historically marked divide between people from the salt islands grand turk salt cay and south caicos and those f rom middle caicos north caicos and providenciales in the salt islands salt was cash crop and created wage economy whereas in the other islands subsist ence farming and fishing provided the sole means of livelihood during the s econd world war an airstrip was built by the us forces on south caicos and anoth er was established on grand turk the us established coast guard base at the northern end of south caicos on grand turk at the

19761156 29 report pp 5 6 30it is true that since the late 1970s the territory h as also sought to establish itself as offshore financi centre but with only moderate success 22 providenciales the next 30 years saw gathering momen tum indeed an explosion on that island of largescale tourist developments radiating ou t to some of the other caicos islands and associated cays but not to any great extent in gran d turk or the other former salt islands despite or because of this dramatic economi c turnabout the cultural social and economic divide between the two sets of islands has p ersisted in large part to this day sir louis blomcooper commenting in 1987 again aptly set the scene31 between the population of grand turk and that of the caicos islands there was an initial difference the former consisted of bermudans and their slaves in search of salt the latter were loyalists from the u s who emigrated after the war of independence while the salt industry brough t measure of prosperity to grand turk agriculture was always struggle gra nd turk the seat of government has been concentrated in single town an d has been politically more advanced in the larger caicos islands settlement h as been more scattered and less cohesive but with sturdy parochialism encourag ed by sectarian variety in religious matters for these and other reasons the re has been division of long standing between the two groups divided by 22 mil deepwater channel an d difficult communications but new dimension to the traditional rivalry and p arochialism was already developing by the early 1970s tourism was mushroomin g on the most attractive of the caicos islands providenciales today there is reversal of the unequal fortunes of the two groups with those anxious for d evelopment on providenciales believing it to be thwarted by the political dominan ce of grand turk it is new ingredient in the rivalry 32 125 all of this as i have indicated formed the bac kdrop to the 1976

leading members of the pdm opp osition in the legislative council and public works department employee expressing the vi ew that they were unfit to hold public office however he recommended that they

chief min ister and four other ministers and legislative council consisting of 12 elected member s and three appointed members the 1988 constitution lasted for 18 years until its replac ement by an order in council in 2006 131 that period in political terms continued to be dominated by rivalry between the pnp and pdm and particularly since the turn of the cent ury accelerating economic development and growth in public wealth and private pro sperity engendered in large part by tourism and overseas developers catering for it in the years from 2000 up to the recent worldwide economic crisis the territory had accor ding to the uk national audit office experienced economic growth among the highest in the world42 this influx of overseas investment much of it hungry for crown land at the d isposal of the governor in cabinet also brought with it continued governmental maladminis tration and mix of incompetence and perceived corruption in public affairs whichev er of the two parties

foreign affairs committee in 2007 200843 and to this inquiry have stigmatised the conduct of both political parties and t heir members when in government accusing them of abuse of office or political power fo r personal or political advantage however of the two the pnp have in recent years attracted the main and most vocifer ous criticism 40 tci constitutional commission 1986 report of the

the increase in their prevalence and seriousness that is particularly so in respect of those voiced against the hon michael misick his political co lleagues and supporters and families since the pnp gained control and he became chief minister in the 200 3 elections the dramatic surge in power and wealth that he and they enjo yed over the succeeding years which they openly displayed appeared to many to be gregious and telltale signs of at best abuse of power and favouritism at worst corru ption or other serious dishonesty 134 it was in such political and economic climate that at the suit of now highly confident pnp administration seeking more devolution of powers fr om westminster and further move towards total independence that the 2006 constitution came into being44 the principal changes wrought by it were the introductio n of modernised chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual and th replacement of the legislative council with house of assembly composed of speak er 15 elected members one for each of 15 electoral districts four appointed memb ers and the attorney general the former executive council was replaced with cabinet co nsisting of the governor premier45 and six other ministers appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier from the elected or appointed members of the house and the attorney general 135 the constitution requires the governor to co nsult the cabinet on matters of policy and in the exercise of all functions conferred on him s ave when otherwise instructed by the secretary of state or in functions expressly exercisab by him in his discretion it also reserves to the governor certain special responsibili ties namely defence external affairs internal security including the police force and appo intment to any public office and it provides for the judiciary and the public service 136 the cabinet and its members individually were granted or were enabled to exercise significantly more discretionary power than they or th eir predecessors had enjoyed as members of the executive council under the previous constitution 137 when the 2006 constitution came into force n 9th august 2006 the governor in post

election campaign later in this report for the moment it is enough to record that this time they secured resounding majori ty in the new house of assembly composed in addition to the appointed members and th attorney general of 15 elected members with 12 seats to the two of the pdm this result doubt coupled with the continuing rising wave of tourism and associated prospe rity to the islands gave to

serious deficiencies in their financial management and control mostly routinely ignored by those in government responsible for them until about 2007 income from stamp duty on land sales and import

done many times since that th is inquiry is into possible corruption or other serious dishonesty meriting cr iminal investigation and into indications of need for systemic governmental and administrative reform it is not 64 including the establishment of an integrity commissio n human rights commission ministerial code pub lic service code of ethics and integrity appointment of chief auditor the post then being vacant adoption of proceeds of crime or dinance advanced work on crown land bill and revised immigration bill 65 see the commission website for the press statement containing this opening statement in providenciales f 15th july 2008 33 for to make findings of corruption or other crimi nality simply to recommend areas and people or bodies for further investigation while at the same time indicating areas of systemic weakness suggesting need for consideratio n by others of reform i also said that with liberal use of commission website and press s tatements i would make start by seeking information in writing under terms of fidentiality if requested and when ready would follow it with oral hearings in the tci towar ds the end of my statement i made the following appeal for cooperation from ministers and other members of the house of assembly in all of this i hope to have the full cooperation of those asked to assist the inquiry those ministers and members of the house f assembly or members of the former legislative council who have nothing to fear from the truth should have need to withhold the true source of their ca pital and income on any issue relevant to the inquiry as i am concerned w ith ministers and elected members of the legislature whose remit is the honest stewardship of their public responsibilities to the people of these isla nds there should be need for to have recourse to the wide powers given to by the commissions of inquiry ordinance to compel disclosure 153 how wrong the hope proved to be on the pre vious day 14th july two backbench pnp members of the house of assembly the hon royal ro binson and the hon samuel been had already taken steps to apply to the supreme court of the tci seeking among other things declaration to restrain from proceeding w ith the inquiry they claimed that my terms of reference were invalid and my appointment th erefore was of effect this application which in due course was rejected by the c hief justice the hon gordon ward and the court of appeal of the tci66 was accompanied in the early days of the inquiry by regularly repeated television broadcasts of the premie r urging opposition to it he stigmatised it as nothing more than fishing expedition to disguise th true plot to make criminals out of our politicians on both sides of t he political divide and destabilise our country and suggested an early move by way of elections or referendum towards independence 154 notwithstanding that inauspicious start i ret urned immediately to the uk and established secretariat in london and began to conside r the information already available my starting point was preliminary discussion i had had with and briefing note from the 66 on 1st october 2008 the two applicants withdrew proposed application to the court of appeal for leave to appeal to the privy council 34 outgoing governor tauwhare on my short visit to the tci supplemented by further information provided shortly afterwards by his success or as governor his excellency gordon wetherell following his appointment on 5th august 2008 155 shortly afterwards the uk foreign affairs committee ʹ for whose ready and helpful assistance throughout i am grateful made available to t he commission the recently published two volumes of its report the first containing the report itself and the second record of the oral and written evidence given to it by those who had not requested confidentiality as i have indicated many of those f rom the tci who gave evidence to the committee did so only on the basis that it would be t reated as confidential the committee had sought and obtained their consent and that of all ther persons who had given evidence to it for its provision to the commission on the s ame terms i have treated that body of material as information and evidence in the inquiry verall it is consistent with the vast body of written and oral information since provided to the commission other than that of the hon michael misick and his ministerial colleagues and other political supporters 156 the time allowed to the commission was short and its terms of reference were wide broadly based but also selective inquiry was clearl necessary the aim was to discover whether there were certain major categories andor seri ous instances of possible corruption involving elected members of the tci legislature and or others that might merit criminal investigation andor as leads for such investigation i could not hope to investigate every allegedly corrupt or dishonest relationship or trans action however big or small it does not follow that because i have not mentioned as possibly corrupt particular relationship or transaction it should be excluded from any ensuing c riminal investigations 157 i also decided that i should have to concentrat on relatively recent matters since the priority is to identify the present malaise said to be one of endemic corruption in public life in the territory there was also the important practic consideration that the older the alleged crime the colder the trail for the purpose f investigation and prosecution ađđžƌěŝŷőůǉ i ƚžžŭ

reforming bribery78 took as its starting point for bribery at common law the following venera ble proposition from the 12th edition of russell on crime 79 bribery is the receiving or offering of any undue reward by or to any person whatsoever in public office in order to influen ce his behaviour in office and incline him to act contrary to the known rules of ho nesty and integrity 77 per gordon

public are interested to receive bri be either to act contrary to his duty or to show favour in the discharge of his functions 24 the criminal law of bribery in the tci is much the same as in england wales its relative simplicity in each case masked by an unsatisfact ory mix of common and statutory law mr misick and other counsel helpfully directed to section 18 of the legislative council powers and privileges ordinance 1998 which makes it an offence to bribe members of the house of assembly in relation to pro ceedings before the house and to sections 68 and 69 of the elections ordinance 199881 which make it an offence to bribe voters both sets of provisions overlapping with or replacing the general common law offence of bribery in their respective contexts 25 however while corruption in particular of th ose in public office may be simple enough notion it is by its very nature often hard to prove there are two reasons for this first as chief justice ward observed in the passage from his judgment set out at the head of this chapter its invisibility or secrecy usually b etween two consenting persons readily defies discovery or proof secondly even when the material relationships and facts are established it can still be difficult value judgment whether in the circumstances of any particular case transaction is corrupt or accords with widely accepted social and business norms of its context it is an internationally acknowl edged phenomenon that the difficulty 80 1914 3 kb 1283 at 1296 see also 10 cr app r 245 cca 81 cap 5 revised 15th may 1998 50 of proving

the best known an d welltried provision of this sort is section 10 of the hong kong prevention of bribery or dinance cap 201 which enables court to convict an official where there is evidence that he

international covenant on civil and political rights 84 it is for defendant to establish on balance of probabilities satisfactory explanation for disproportionate wealth the smaller the disproportion

introduced an almost identical document to the cabinet as long ago as 7th march 2007 with view to such adaptation for use in the tci as might be necessary88 it took nearly further year before the cabinet on 6th february 2008 accepted it in principle subject onl to few small amendments substituting references to the tci for references t the uk89 29 the code90 including th nolan principles makes detailed provision for avoidance of conflicts of interest and for declaration of potenti ally conflicting private interests acceptance of gifts and hospitality and in connection wi th overseas travel

having introduced and passed such code 211 as counsel to the commission observed in his closing submission despite those two public references to the code and its acceptance in p rinciple by the cabinet in early 2007 it does not appear to have been formally adopted publi shed or promoted when the commission finally obtained copy it was in the form of reproduction of the british code save for the title and crest of the tci and with small but incomplete adaptations for use in the territory 212 the attitude of the hon michael misick and som other ministers to the principles set out in that

and presented i t to him for signature and distribution the minister for natural resources the hon mcalliste r hanchell like the hon michael misick repeatedly stressed that the code had not b een introduced 213 the hon floyd hall had different approach w hen questioned he said that he had known that the cabinet had approved the code and that although it had not come into force he had regarded it as guide to proper behaviour and its principles as binding on him93 however he does not appear to have applied those prin ciples to his own conduct so as to avoid conflicting interests 214 the lethargy and lack of interest with which th cabinet as whole approached the simple but important task of incorporating the esse ntials of the uk code into its law and practice are unfortunate their disregard of it in pr omoting their private interests and those of their intimates deserves more serious censure as does the hypocrisy of the hon michael misick on 14th july 2008 in his public reliance on his claimed introduction of it to the tci as an argument against the need for the commission 215 the attitude of the hon michael misick and hi s fellow ministers in this respect has not as

sweeping ele ctoral majority of the pnp in february 2007 giving it seemingly impregnable control of th country the need for clear recognition and observance of such code became even more necessar 216

also number of examples of cabinet ministers purportedly exercising their own discret ionary powers in favour of themselves members of their families close friends the pnp p olitical supporters or

that they had been donating large sums to one party or to individual members of that party while in power lest it damage their access to and possibility of influencing their political opponents if and when they came to office107 donors to party are highly sensitive abo ut the disclosure of information the fact that the details of donations are going to be made public to this inquiry is going to send shivering effect down the spines of the donors there is an environment that ʹ there is feeling that if you donate and you are strong supporter of particular party whether or not that i s actually real or imaginary if you are strong supporter of particular party an d you are engaged in business that with the flows and ebbs of political fortune when the party you strongly support is in opposition that very few of your calls will be answered very few of your applications will be considered there is that perception and donors do not like their information to be made publ ic and108 the problem and concern is that public discussi on about the identity of the donors or even one or two donors and even if those donors are somehow involved with criminality or conduct that is inappropriate t hat even in those instances public discussion about those donors will irreparab ly damage the ability of the party in the future ʹ the ability for party in the future to raise money to collect money which is absolutely essential for its functio n that is the major concern that the party has that future donors to be petrifi ed about donating to the party q why should they be petrified if their intentions are good and in the public interest what have they got to be frightened of they are afraid of their details being made publi c when there is change in political parties they fear that their applications their telephone calls their proposals may go unheard 107 transcript day 5 pp 116 117 108 transcript day 7 pp 3 4 64 236 as to my second question why strings at tached

very large payments direct or indirect to in particular the hon michael misick the hon floyd hall the hon mcallister hanchell and the hon jeffrey hall whose m inisterial portfolio included

money as long as they stayed in power or had the prospect of it and remained amenable to their commercial proposals the party had system ʹ the hon floyd hall its treasurer and certified public accountant seemed oblivious to the need for requiring individual recipients whether of ms direct from donors or from the party to account for their use of such monies most of the d onations or payments appear to have been at the disposal of individual ministers to spend on what they liked free from any requirement to account for their expenditure the f ollowing extracts from oral evidence of the hon michael misick the hon floyd hall and the ho n mcallister hanchell in examination by senior counsel to the commission give flavour f what was going on first the hon michael misick 109 q on 3rd november 2006 you got donation so you tell us of 100000 from caicos construction management and development li mited what was that for it was political donation for q what is the purpose of political donation the purpose of political donation in the turks caicos might be different from the purpose of political donation in the uk so you have to put in those two different perspectives the purpose of polit ical donation in the turks caicos is to assist the person receiving it with hi s or her political ambitions but 109 transcript day 1 pp 158 161 65 also in most cases when donations are given to indi viduals it is to use your discretion because you use your personal money to dvance your political ambition and so donations is sort of help to supple ment that q what is political

reference t his credit card expenditure whether he could account for his use of political payments made to him personally said110 to some degree but not any degree of specificity this is the area where it could get bit muddy in the sense that in my cas i have been using personal funds for political endeavours as well including l oan proceeds to enforce my political endeavours throughout the turks caicos islands so it is quite conceivable that some of those political sic woul d end up being conmingled at the end of the day when it reached my bank account r my credit card q did you not

election 240 there was also movement of political donations the other way from pnp politicians at or about election time to their voters in some cases given the small constituencies and the limitation of the franchise to belongers to relative ly few of them as counsel to the commission observed in his closing submission111 the remarkable aspect of such funding was the sheer volume of money washing

right to vote and they are only ones to whom as matter of policy crown land may be disposed either in their ow n right or as the majority shareholder in corporate purchaser and at substantial discount they also benefit from policy of empowerment espoused by both main political parties one of its avowed aims is to enable every tci belonger to buy small plot of land for himse lf and his family 245 there is legal restriction however on th number of plots each belonger may acquire and the same privileges are accorded to promine nt and wealthy persons including developers and others who have been accorded belongers hip on exceptional grounds nor is there any restriction in practice on belonger im mediately flipping that is quickly selling on to developer parcel of crown land granted to him or

belongers to 114 immigration ordinance s 3 68 the same developer thereby enabling him to acquire l arge acreage of land on advantageous terms sometimes it appears the flipping belongers are only informed by government authorities shortly before or afterwards in that event they are to be or have been used as intermediaries in this way possibly or possibly not with small profit for themselves 246 such transactions can be initiated at ministeri level and their product approved in cabinet in the form of grants of large areas of land to developers coupled with conditional development ăɖɖƌžǀăů

tourists and touri st development to secure the investment in the interest of the people of the isl ands that was certainly how such proposals were often put to the governor in cabinet ʹ speed was of the essence or the developer would go elsewhere that was also the just ification given to the commission by number of pnp ministers and others for such high lev proposals and the developments to which

there has been parliamentary oversight of any significance and the power of the pnp has been largely unchecked given its overwhelming and until recently loyal parliamentary m ajority 253 such machinery as the 2006 constitution123 requires is the establishment by the legislature of at least two standing committees of th house each with responsibility for monitoring the conduct of the business or minister ial department or departments in addition it empowers the house with the approval of the governor to make standing orders which may provide for the establishment of add itional standing committees of the house124 each standing committee is to consist of members who are not ministers and to correspond proportionately so far as possible to num erical strengths of political representation in the house at least one of the c ommittees must be presided over by an opposition member under the constitution the comm ittees may but are not required to summon ministers or any public officer for examinatio n and provide information about their departmental responsibilities they may but again are not required to report on their work to the house of assembly if committee does repor t the house is required to publish their reports but not within any specified timescale 254 as in the case of other institutions of publi c governance and administration in the tci the commission has had great difficulty in extracting from those who should be most familiar with the system what if any effective machi nery these constitutional provisions have provided for public oversight of government duct standing orders of the house125 which have been amended from time to time provide fo r standing committees to be re appointed at the commencement of each parliamentary s

standing committees met infrequ ently sometimes they could not meet because they were inquorate due to nonattendance of p np members for example four ʹ possibly five meetings of the public accounts com mittee scheduled in the first quarter of 2008 were cancelled for want of quorum i believe that it only met twice in the whole of 2008 although all three committees are required by standing orders to report upon their activities to the house of assembly and the house was required to publish their reports127 compliance with both requirements has been distinctly patchy unless reports are presented to the legislature and tabled the exercis is pointless even when committee reports were tabled before the house ministers often did not make themselves available to answer questions arising from them and on occasion have refused to answer questions128 256 even in less troubled times for the governanc of the tci these committees do not appear to have met regularly or reported to the house promptly or at all since the early nineties and throughout there has been concern abo ut their ineffectiveness in 1993 consultant engaged by the foreign commonwealth off ice identified number of areas of concern such as widespread laxity in adopting financial procedures and failure to administer government finances with due respect for the law and legislature129 thereafter eight technical officers

there was little change for the better t he uk national audit office expressed concern in 2005130 these concerns include committee hearings being hel d in private failure to achieve quora especially

concern of eris was lack of legislative p rovision for campaign financing and the potential for bribery and other electoral malpracti ces in the present system the biggest concern during the process of campaignin g was the insufficient legislation dealing with campaign financing curren tly there is requirement to publish campaign accounts nor is there any limit on spending imposed this can be considered serious breach of good practice and is not in line with uk or international standards which impose strict rul ings on campaign finance to guard against bribery and corruption furthermore n safeguards exist to prevent use of government resources as part of an ele ction campaign which gives the incumbent party an unfair advantage over op position parties whilst it is accepted that political parties and can didates cannot conduct campaigns without funds and it is internationally ccepted that donations are legitimate source of campaign funding there is ri sk that such finance may come with strings attached to the candidate or the d onor in order to prevent legitimate campaign funding transgressing the line an d becoming non legitimate method of influence legal safeguards must xist although the tci elections ordinance has specific rulings and defini tions on what constitutes corruption and bribery there seems to be way to enforce or audit campaign expenditure specifically to protect against briber or treating the high levels of campaign spending and the advantage that more weal thy party has over their opposition are apparent and of concern it is questionable whether

level of transparency of action and accountability to the pu blic 310 such provision as there is for disposal of cro wn land is to be found in the crown land policy this policy was originally devised in the 19 80s with the aim of empowering belongers to play an active role in the economic and social develo pment of the islands more particularly its aim was to ensure that all belongers w ould have affordable access to crown land for their needs by permitting them to purchase it at substantial discount from its market valuation there appear to have been number of changes in the policy over the years some written some not some published some n ot159 it has never had any statutory basis and its legal status is not clear 311 disposals of crown land for residential use were initially in the grant only of the executive council by means of conditional purchase l ease for three years the condition required completion of the proposed home within that period or if extended by the council further two years when the lease could be converte d into freehold the initial rent was to be 10 of the discounted freehold purchase price and the freehold purchase price was set at only 25 of the market valuation at the time of s igning of the lease ʹ thus an overall discount of potentially well over 75 however fu rther condition of the lease was that the belonger could not dispose of the land to nonbelon ger within 10 years without repayment to the government of the discounted sum ϯϭϯ fžůůžǁŝŷő ƚśğ pnpɛ ğůğđƚŝžŷ ǀŝđƚžƌǉ ŝŷ ϯϭϭϯ ƚśğ ŷğǁ aěŵŝŷŝɛƚƌăƚŝžŷ ǁŝƚś ƚśğ hžŷ michael misick as chief

11 ʹ 16 83 enormous scope for corruption entailed in the assumpt ion by ministers of such power was immediately recognised and robustly addressed in the fuller report160 313 as to disposal of crown land for commercial use the policy had been less consistent save that it too had been intended to empower belongers who might otherwise be deterred or disabled by the costs of development the policy took different and sometimes overlapping forms according to whether the land for di sposal was small or largescale commercial development the new pnp administration i ntroduced changes to the policy in march 2004 shortly after assuming power in future 1 grants were to be subject to the approval of the executive council 2 grant could b made unless belonger had minimum of 51 in the grantee entity and 3 belong er was to pay more than 50 of the open market value of the land in providenciales and more than 25 of the value in the other islands conditions 2 and 3 were to give rise to new speci of empowerment of or of the possibility of abuse by belongers in the form of substantial unearned rewards from flipping andor fronting and otherwise by virtue only of their status 314 the policy did not limit the number of leaseh old grants of crown land per individual belonger whether for residential or commercial use nor did it identify any social or economic criteria for the grant for example equality of opportunity or any overall objectives as to what proportion of the population s hould be afforded such opportunities whatever the original wellintended purposes of the p olicy it had not by 2004 and may not yet have ʹ as generality resulted in grants of land to tci b elonger families to meet their own needs on the contrary as fuller noted161 the policy made specific provision for equitable distribution of crown land many belongers acquired several plots some of which they quickly disposed of for profit to others incl uding foreign developers and as he added162 whatever the wording of and intentions for the polic it was in any event overreached by leaving to single minister the allocat ion of residential plots for the grant of conditional purchase leases and to the executive counc il the allocation of commercial leases 315 the evidence before the commission indicates that such overreaching of the policy has continued up to and since its appointment there is much anecdotal information about it in 160 ibid pp 17 20 161 ibid p 4 162 ibid 84 the written submissions i have received of personal i nterference by the hon mcallister hanchell the minister of natural

according to him was operated by his department for allocation he said that there was review process operated by group of staff workers who considered on daily basis representations of applicants for the grant of crown land he said that that the grou p consisted of the permanent secretary the commissione r of lands the deputy commissioner of lands the assistant commissioner of lands and sometimes also himself he emphasised that normally he only came into the proc ess very late in the day when decisions as to allocation had been made and letters to successful applicants had been prepared for

responsibility because he was the mini ster of land much of the movement in crown land took place under his watch i think he does accept that the whole system for crown land allocation and disposition is in need of reform he has also conceded that himself and other ministers have played direct role in the process of distribution it is c learly not appropriate for ministers to be involved at that level and they really ought to confine themselves to making policy the last words are my submission but ce rtainly his stance is that he accepts that the system is in need of reform and he accepts that in an ideal world ministers ought not to be involved in the all ocation and distribution he seeks to explain it by the fact that there is tr emendous demand on himself his cabinet colleagues and other elected members to g et involved in the process in that members are effectively used as messengers be tween applicants and the 164 transcript day 21 pp 179 181 87 permanent secretary and others who are involved in the administration of crown land he says that he has never received r asked for any kind of financial reward for his involvement in this process and his involvement has not been out of any desire to be corrupt or dishonest he said that the system as it operates leads or may lead to favouritism in the llocation 323 thus there were and are still number of wel levidenced and acknowledged flaws in this illdefined policy and its application also for consideration are the complexity given to the process by the involvement of multiplicity of government departments and the scope for abuse and profiteering at the expense of the publi c in dissipation of its most priceless asset for inadequate return there was and still is li ttle effective coordination between the

criteria with conditions of devel opment and of repayment to government of undeserved discounts where land was not retained ando r not developed by the belonger 324 it was plain by the time of the fuller report in 2004 if not well before that the administration and allocation of crown land should be go verned by statute not policy and that it should be administered by an independent crow n land commission not ministers inside or outside of cabinet165 mr fuller in his report made many and detailed recommendations to that end including the removal of ministers from the process of granting of land for residential use and marginalising t heir role in the case of grants for commercial purposes his concern about possible mini sterial corruption both in relation to past possible abuses by ministers in the taylor admini stration166 and the future potential for it was explicit among his many recommendations were the following167 32 crown land is an immensely valuable public asse t its strategic importance to the economy and stability of the country and the opportunities for improper advancement that poor or corrupt management offer mean that its management should be governed by specific legislation and not often informal policy and regulatory statements 312 specific legislation as opposed to various statemen ts of uncertain legal standing is needed concerning land allocatio n and usage specific regulations should be in place to prevent those with d ecisionmaking authority 165 for powerful critique of the system see op cit 158 executive summary pp 1 10 166 ibid see pp 9 17 and 18 167 ibid pp 17 19 88 being able to benefit directly from their decisions clear accountability is needed through the publication of details of all b eneficiaries and more importantly of all discounts given to those allocat ed such land details must be made available of all transactions involving mini sters or companies with which ministers have an involvement in publicly vailable document and review of such transactions should be undertaken by an independent body such as subcommittee of the legislative council 325 unfortunately the fuller report gave rise to little of practical benefit to the people of the tci over the next four years i say that in the main because of the continuing vulnerability of the system to ministerial corrupti on and other abuses his recommendation for formal inquiry into transactions of crown land in volving ministers andor their close family members was ignored by the hon michael misick then chief minister and his ministerial

decisionmaki ng should remain with the elected government rather than be devolved to independent bodi 326 there were also broad concerns expressed in th fuller report about the failure of the crown land policy to enable as originally intended all belongers to advance themselves and of the government to introduce properly conceiv ed land use and planning policy many of which gave rise to similar governmental respon 327 however the fuller report was followed by number of other authoritative studies and reports all in much the same concerned and critical vein and all meeting with similar lack of response or disregard from the misick adminis tration the first was an interim comprehensive study on crown land management by kevin barthel in association with terra institute ltd study sponsored

process ca n only be prevented with specific legislation enforcement of the legislation and establishment of system to monitor the compliance with the legislation 112 crown land policy should be

do so if deemed necessary the proceeds of such sales will be paid into the government reserves fund or used directly for ma jor specific development project in fact as has been well documented and publicly acknow ledged the tci government has since become increasingly dependent on the proceeds of large disposals of crown land to fund recurrent expenditure including most recentl to meet its monthly payroll bill when short of funds 330 in the briefest and somewhat selective outli ne the new policy statement provided for transfer of crown land to belongers for residential r commercial purposes at market price subject to nontransferable discounts this was to ap ply initially to conditional purchase leases for specified periods appropriate to the size and nature of each proposed development the maximum discount for purchase of res idential land was to be 50 of the full open market price and available only in respect f one property per island and not in respect of any other property on another island at the same time the maximum discount n crown land required for commercial use which was to b limited to first purchase only of up to 10 acres was again 50 except on providenciales where it was limited to 25 and for large developments for example major tourism pr oject two or more belongers were to be permitted to combine their 10 acre entitlement s to enable belonger participation in the project in the event of the land being sold w ithin five years the discount would be repayable in full sale more than five years after acqu isition but before ten would require repayment of half the discount information on crown land allocation was to be published in the gazette crown land legislation and regulations w ere to be introduced crown land department was to be established within the minist ry of natural resources and the system of application for and approval of grants of crow n land was to be rationalised and based on uniform rational and objective

cap 5 pp 94 and 206 92 key is fine as far as it goes namely that the crown land department would be responsible for the administration and management of crown land in particular its allocation for lease or sale with the governor retaining responsibility f or legal grant at the request of the government as will appear later in this discussion it is important that the bill in the drafting excludes any ministerial interference in th work of the crown land department in allocating land to persons for lease or sale the bill as presently drawn does not in my view do that184 further and entirely proper assumption was that dev elopment of crown land like that of any other land requires developmen t permission from the physical planning board pursuant to the physical planning ordinance185 requirement that ministers sometimes simply ignore or on occasion exert pressu re to influence under the present statutory regime186 335 the meat of the proposed manual concerning pre vention of corruption and other abuse in the allocation of crown land is in sections 3 an d 4187 as to disposition and eligibility for disposition section 33 preserves b roadly the existing scheme restricting grants of crown land whether for residential or commercial p urposes to belongers usually by leases for three years the lease conditions relate mainly to completion of approved development within that period which would qualify t he lessee to apply for freehold title priority would be given on any one island to belonger s who own land on that island and have not previously benefited from any crown land disp osition there 336 as to allocation section 4 of the manual introd uces an entirely new and closely controlled scheme to be operated by the crown lands department and in which ministers would have involvement it provides in order of preference for four methods of allocation in the main to belongers only namely 1 p ublic invitation for applications for developed land with selection to be made where ther are more applicants than available parcels of land by ballot weighted in favour of those who have never before received crown land 2 public offer for sale by tender available for both residential and commercial use principally applicable to large residential or commercial developments 3 public auction though not expected to be much used and 4 private t reaty following public notification 184 see paras 351 ʹ 352 below 185 see paras 4183 ʹ 45189 below 186 see submissions of mr ariel misick qc on behalf of the hon mcallister hanchell transcript day 22 187 pp 46 77 93 where crown land has not been sold by use of any of th other three methods or in other exceptional cases 337 section 5 of the proposed manual deals with d iscounts as set out in the november 2005 policy it begins by identifying their purpos e188 to assist belongers to purchase freehold land recognising that the law of tci does not prevent foreign ownership of land and that many nonbelongers may have an advantage over belongers with respect to ac cess to capital for land purchases in the absence of statute the policy vels the playing field and makes access to land more realistically achievable f or belongers moreover the policy seeks to empower belongers through their owne rship of land and the capital that is inherent in the ownership of tang ible asset section 5 also clarifies how the discount is to be cal culated where the grantee is belonger owned tci company namely it must be 100 owned by be longers or belongerowned companies or organisations and at least 51 of its inco must be earned from activities undertaken in the tci the section also provides that where company or organisation is less than 100 belonger owned the discount shall app ly to the portion that is belonger owned and if company is less than 51 belonger ow ned discount will be given 338 importantly the proposed manual also provides in section 7 for monitoring and enforcement of crown land leases and grants189 and in section 9 for appeals to the commissioner of crown lands and thence to an appeals tribunal to be constituted by the proposed crown lands ordinance190 339 in march 2008 shortly after presentation of t he 2008 terra institute report mr martin robinson who had as the acting chief auditor tempor arily succeeded cynthia travis presented special report to the

expressed as those of his predecessor over three years before h set them out under ten headings192 making as an early point the failure of the tci governm ent to keep to its first stated aim of the policy namely to confine the proceeds of crown lands sales to bolstering the government reserves fund or for major specific devel opment projects instead as mr robinson recorded government finances are now heavily dependent on in come from crown land sales which amounted to over 55 million in 200607 and 200708 there is danger that this will become the key determinant of fu ture policy on land disposal193 340 i summarise his ten headings of concern 1 w eak to nonexistent compliance with the policy 2 blatant speculation in crown land particul arly on salt cay warranting independent review194

being to companies in which present or past members of the house of assembly andor their immediate families had direct interest 4 failure of compliance in the system of allocation which was deter mined in large part by personal contacts pressure and influence 5 inadequate and teriorating systems of crown land data and data management 6 general lack of openness and accountability in allocations of crown land 7 reliance by decisionmakers on out ofdate valuations and the potential for improper pressures on the tci valuation office 8 l ack of an up todate development plan for the islands and of any adequate inventory of crown land 9 insufficient provision of affordable housing on crown land and 10 mounting arre ars of rentals because of inadequate collection arrangements 341 the robinson 2008 special report which governor tauwhare saw in draft caused h im great concern particularly as to recent disposals of l and in salt cay he expressed those and wider concerns in the following passage in letter to the foreign commonwealth office of 22nd february 2008 192 ibid executive summary pp 3 6 193 ibid executive summary p 3 194 see in particular as to the salt cay transactions pp 3 ʹ 4 and 19 ʹ 20 section b2 and b expressing particular concern about number of recent transactions 95 there appear to have been up to 12 grants in shor t space of time shortly before significant hotel development there was announced most of those rec eiving land are related to one another one is former ps natural resources another is the director of medical services and brother in law of hon galmo williams most subsequently sold the land to the developer at an verage profit of 750 with individuals making between 300 ʹ950k profit each the total profit to them and therefore loss to tcig was over 4m the valuation used when the land was sold to them dated from 2001 and had not been subsequently updated few if any of them appear to have fulfilled the normal terms for be ing granted freehold the land sold to the developer himself was also valued n the basis of 2001 valuation the draft report strongly recommends that there should be thorough and independent review of the background and history of these grants for the first time i have been here we at last have properlyre searched account of exactly the sort of abuse which is traditionally complained of in what appears to be particularly blatant example whether anyone has act ually broken the law is unclear but questions should certainly be ask ed of why the minister for natural resources proposed these land grants to these people at this time and if so why questions should also be asked about how t hese decisions got through cabinet with an old valuation it must be highly likely that any serious review will confirm what the acting chief auditor has found recommend rapid reforms to the procedures albeit these are mostly inhand in the crown land bill but to the extent that they are not they should be added and recommend that wider review is required to check whether the problems found in salt cay are replicated elsewhere as they almost certainly are this coul d provide the basis for wide ranging commission of enquiry into crown land deals 342 it is clear from those remarks that at governo r level at least there had been mounting concern for some time about abuses in relati on to crown land management and disposals and that the uk foreign affairs committee which had yet to publish its report in june 2008 was not the first in the field to conside r the need for commission of inquiry 343 the 2008 robinson special report which had also been submitted as matter of routine in draft to the hon mcallister hanchell did not seemingly cause him the same concern following discussion of the draft with mr robinson he commented on it by letter to him 9th march195 in the letter the minister accepted that certain part s of the november 2005 crown land policy had not been implemented and th at certain parts of it

the governor it expressly disclaimed that it bore the status of either an audit or review in accordanc with internationally recognised standards or any assurance on the tci crown land polic or the

consisting mainly of few brief statements of fact combined with several lengthy schedules of transactions respectively described as background and analysis 346 analysis is certainly what was ʹ and still is required though not provided in any meaningful or readily understood form from deloitte but on their understanding what they had provided was to form the basis for an evaluation by the governor with presumably the assistance of the tci government as far as i have been able to discover such evaluation has been undertaken much less completed and the commission has had neither the time nor the resources of forensic accountant r auditor to attempt it in submitting its report to the governor deloitte tantalisingly obse rved that had it performed additional procedures or had it performed an audit or review of t he crown land policy or the transactions in question in accordance with recognised in ternational standards matters might have come to their attention that would have be reported to the governor 347 i was and remain puzzled why deloitte was instru cted to report on mr robi ŷɛžŷɛ concerns in so restricted way i have asked governor tauwhare and have corresponded with and spoken to those responsible at the foreign an d commonwealth office about it the former governor told that he had compiled the terms of reference in joint exercise with the hon michael misick having taken advice from the foreign and commonwealth office in london and notwithstanding his unease ferred to their judgment i can only say that i share the unease of mr robinson and governor t auwhare about these transactions an unease accentuated by an absence of information befor as to any or any expert evaluation of the factual information gathered and tabul ated by deloitte in its report save that the current chief auditor has considered it such an evaluation coupled with the results of other investigations in relation to the s alt cay project is clearly matter that special

and other major commercial projects still in many cases at short notice and with or tabled supporting cabinet papers what is more many recent transactions have involved the disposal of crown land not

greater wher an urgent and obvious need for infrastructure is coupled with contractual access to bstantial public finances that are and are known to be largely uncontrolled 354 in the tci over recent

ministry of finance197 and to generally accepted tendering procedures those instructions since 2006 have required all contracts for work valued at between 15000 and 75000 to be the subject of public tendering less the permanent secretary the attorney general the financial secretary or the commi ssioner of police approved limited tendering that is from an official list of previous ly approved contractors198 all contracts for work worth more than 75000 should be the subject f public tender unless the cabinet approved limited tendering199 responsibility for issuing invitations to tender lay

which only limited number of sources of supply could reasonably be identified capital projects were normally governed by the government development budget but the cabinet could additionally approve expenditure on new projects not contained in the budget for emergencies or to meet emerging and unforeseen developments during the year 356 the two main purposes of public tendering requ irements for major capital projects were and are 1 to promote open and competitive tende rs to enable those considering them on behalf of the tci government to determine i n the public interest in terms of quality of work and value for money the bidder to who m the contract should be awarded and 2 to ensure honest dealings between those respo nsible for the award of public contracts and those bidding for them ʹ in short to minimise the scope for corruption ando r unnecessary cost to the public however the increas ing pattern in the tci over the last few years has been to disregard these requirements in numb er of large and small scale public works and other contracts ʹ many potentially questionable as to value for money and or because of possible corruption of ministers and publi c officers involved in their award 357 the commission has not seen the audit report n contract tendering systems in the tci of november 2004 but it raised issues that were still present in 2006 as shown in like audit report for that year200 they included number of recommendations designed to improve the accountability openness and independence of tender procedures and drew attention to specific contracts some involving signi ficant sums where such procedures had not been followed or at least were not evidenced 358 in late 2004 the tci government had engaged consulting engineer simon bradfield201 to undertake department for international development dfid funded project to create an inventory and condition survey f all public infrastructure on the islands and to reorganise the public works department he had made detailed and urgent proposals for reorganisation new methods of working and greater accountability he had presented these proposals to the executive council nd to various government 200 2006 contract tendering and expenditure systems engineering and maintenance services department ap pendix d 201 of wsp international management consultants 102 departments but to avail in 2008 in submission to the uk foreign affairs committee he described the lack of response to his work throughout my work i received minimal cooperation from the various department heads and pwd public works department staff were largely unwilling to divulge or discuss detailed informatio n on their current practices of implementing public works projects project informat ion and records were haphazard incomplete andor lacking and i found it impossible to conduct any adequate audit of project histories or expenditure my overall impression during my time there was that the reorganisation project had been imposed on the department and that they had interest in our objec tives ʹ considering us to be merely an interference with their existing methods of working he added that on subsequent visit at the beginning of 2006 to check on progress of implementation of his proposals he found that nothing whatsoever had been achieved 359 the uk 2007 national audit report202 indicated widespread departures from competitive tendering in the tci report echoed in many allegations to the uk foreign affairs committee and to the commission these allegat ions included the award of major contracts at an overprice andor without tender andor or as result of failure properly to observe the tender process common features of such allegations have been disregard of ůžǁğɛƚ žƌ ůžǁğƌ ďŝěěğƌɛ mŝŷŝɛƚğƌɛ

he contacted the uk foreign affairs committee in relat ion to the project to reorganise the public works department203 it seems great pity that the large expenditure made by dfid on the project has produced practically results or improvements 202 see 139 above 203 op cit 103 361 the material before the uk foreign affairs co mmittee supplemented by similar information in evidence to the commission has sugge sted number of areas of business and transactions for concern for want of time and reso urces i have not been able to investigate all or even most of them so as to equip myself to form view of possible criminality and need for further investigation wher i have been able to examine specific allegations and to form views as to potential criminali ty i have done so in chapter 4 of this report in relation to individual ministers and others 362 my main area of concern in this context is the grant of untendered andor possibly overpriced contracts to persons or corporate entitie s with connections with pnp ministers andor financial supporters of the pnp i set out in the next paragraph some examples of types of transaction that give rise to that concern however i should emphasise that the commission has not had the time or the resources to investigate individual instances in any depth or other similar contracts or matters for examp by questioning public officials andor representatives of persons or corporate entiti concerned it may well be that further investigations would yield information that w ould point to the possibility of corruption andor other serious dishonesty or would allay widespread concerns that have been expressed in the tci about such matters over th last year or more my lack of specific mention of them among the following examples should n ot be taken as an indication or recommendation not to investigate them it is of cou rse open to any investigators instructed by the tci government following my submis sion of this report to examine such transactions and relationships as they see fit 363 the examples are 1 major contracts for services such as that made in vember 2006 with southern healthcare network shn for referral of tci islanders for overseas medical treatment and air evacuations at discounted rate s which quickly proved to be financial disaster in its cost service finan cial management and control204 2 major

of full citizenship called belongership acquired by descent from belonger or spouse of be longer of five years standing or exceptionally where the governor in cabi net considers that 205 revised ed 1998 cap 51 as amended 206 ss 3 and 4 105 person has made an outstanding contribution to the economic nd social development of the islands as i have already indicated only this status carries with it the right to vote 2 the legislation provides for the grant by the gover nor in cabinet of permanent residence certificates207 which as the name indicates are valid for life and grantable to persons of good character and health who have established long term living and working connection in the territory and with demonstrated ability to support themselves and their dependents th ere such longterm connection may take any one of several prescribed for ms including having home or principal home in the islands coupled with w ork permit as self employed or employed person or investment in and act ive running of business there or investment of substantial sum in busines s or home there208 the status is also revocable by the governor but only fo r specified reprehensible conduct andor failure to comply with the statutory re quirements of grant any decision of his to revoke it is appealable to the preme court209 3 the legislation provides for less secure form of permission to remain in the

scheme it is clear that ministers wield very considerable discretionary power over nonbelon gers including those not entitled to permanent residence but who have established home and place of work in the islands there are two aspects to their vulnerability one at the stage when grant of higher immigration status is sought and the other where if granted revocation is threatened 367 the application for grant stage was canvassed in ev idence put before the uk foreign affairs committee213 and has been frequent subject of information given ʹ almost always in confidence ʹ to the commission the complaints are of grant of be longership or permanent resident certificates in breach of the legal requirements in return for bribes to ministers or officials and also of belongerships to q uestionable individuals with financial clout or ministerial connections via the exceptional grounds route the commission also received many complaints including accounts of long d elays in the regularisation of their immigration status and of seemingly arbitrary and une xplained decisions on applications for grant or in revocation of existing status 368 many residents who have not attained belongersh ip or permanent residence or who do not qualify for it live in state of constant ins ecurity lest they are compelled at short notice and at the whim of minister or one of his p ublic officials to leave their home andor employment the commission has received submissions from numerous persons in the tci given in confidence for fear of losing their homes and livelihoods as result of

residence and wor k permits it also considered possible mechanisms for greater efficiency in the handling of applications for each of those statuses and for comput erization of immigration records 371 the commission consulted widely throughout t he tci and beyond and reported within five months in february 2004215 in doing so it identified abuses of the statutory system of the sort to which i have referred includi ng instances of belonger status given blatantly in return for political favours216 and of applications for permanent residence certificates ignored or delayed for months and even years217 372 in an early section of the report in which th commission set out its approach it spoke of the need to attract and retain people with sp ecialised skills and expertise to secure the success of the islands as tourist destination and financial centre in the following passage it diagnosed in terms that are as apt today as the n what was required 218 over time the people who have

for example as the uk national audit office reported i n its 2007 report in 20062007 the foreign commonwealth office consented to 10 mill ion of further borrowing by the tci on the basis that its liquid reserves amounted to 14 6 million however when the 2004 05 accounts were audited in july 2006 it was revealed that cash reserves had been overstated by 66 million233 383 given the dire state of the economy it is l the more important that all revenues are collected but if some or all of these revenues are subject to concessions made by ministers for example when grants of crown land at less than ma rket value are made or when development agreements are being negotiated the impact on tci revenues may be considerable cynthia travis the chief auditor from 2005 to 2007 reported similar concerns about the lost opportunity for the tci government re sulting from significant and potentially unwarranted concessions234 according to her report some us 32 million was giv away by the customs department in the year 20052006 throu gh concessions made to developers 384 the information from many sources before the c ommission suggests that such forgone revenue has in large part been the product of over investorfriendly development policies often presented by ministers to the gover nor in cabinet to be absolutely and imminently necessary to secure the particular inward investment under discussion the real possibility is that individual ministers have often s old the pass in precabinet negotiations with developers by undertaking to secure for them f avourable prices exemptions discounts and concessions of one sort or another such negot iations often conducted privately in haste and without recourse to advice from tcinvest or other professionals are ready source of fixing on financial advantages between develo per and minister not presented to the governor in cabinet or intended ever to become p ublic however signs of it may later surface when developer recipients of such ministeria l largesse are discovered to have made large and usually secret donations to or for the ben efit of particular minister or to the pnp there is clear need for timely publication f full

issues which have arisen in r elation to individual elected members in the course of evidence presented to the commission the commission has not and does not make definitive findings of fact it is vital to b ear in mind that the terms of reference of the commission were only ever to establish whether there was information that corruption or other serious dishonesty may have taken place the more exacting tests of proof as might be applied in trial could not be employed by the c ommission nor were they required to be 42 this chapter necessarily considers other perso ns beyond simply the elected officials involved it would be wholly artificial to produce report that did otherwise in so far as there is information indicating corruption that cor ruption does not exist in vacuum eg if an official receives possibly corrupt payment it mus t have come from someone else and they must be identified in order to show why and ho w it may be is corrupt 43 several parties have sought to argue before the c ommission that to consider or even to name parties apart from elected officials takes the com mission outside its terms of reference related arguments were also raised that com ment should be made upon those who provided evidence or who only gave writ ten evidence before the commission i do not accept those arguments i have endeavoured to ensure that in every case where i was minded to make an adverse finding leading to recom mendation of criminal investigation in respect of any person whose conduct is the subject of or who is implicated or concerned in the subject matter of the inquiry t hat person should have an opportunity to comment ahead of the report by means of responses to salmon letters238 all have responded 238 see 186 above 114 44 in reporting upon what i have found i have sim ply related what emerged from the evidence and identified areas of conflict contradict ion and information pointing to possible corruption further investigation will be required in every case but to do less than this at this stage would have been dereliction of my duty u nder the terms of reference and would have risked presenting less than full picture 45 any final assessment made may or may not bear ou t my initial assessment on the material available that assessment will be task for th ose who come after and may or may not involve criminal proceedings what should also be clear is that the process of inquiry which this commission has begun is far from complete the fact that an individual is not named or criticised should not be taken as any f orm of

estate sales through his family company prestigious properties ltd he also owned so properties in his own right several sources have quoted him as having said that he w as worth only 50000 prior to his election to the legislative council in 2003 he nies having said that and there is firm information before to support the assertion it may have been comment taken out of context 49 he was at all relevant times after august 2003 first chief minister and then premier he has also held the portfolios for tourism trade i nvestment and district administration and was the leader of his party the pnp during the latter part of his period of office he married the american actress lisaraye mccoy in high p rofile wedding in april 2006 the couple subsequently separated and during the inquir were engaged in divorce proceedings 410 i should state straightaway that the inquiry has p roduced much information of possible corruption andor other serious dishonesty in relation to ʹ that is involving

the oral proceedings in providenciales all the various written and oral submissions made on behalf of witnesses including responses and 116 other correspondence in the salmon exercise as i have indicated there may be other matters worthy of such investigation which for want of time and resources i have not been able to undertake in sufficient detail 411 there is much information to show that he ado pted lifestyle and spending habits once in office that far exceeded his salary and allowances as minister and politician and that which he had previously enjoyed he spent lavis hly and extravagantly indulging in international travel by privately leased jet and adopt ing what was referred to in the islands as hollywood lifestyle it was this as much as anything that attracted publi c comment opprobrium and eventually investigation 412 during period when his duties and responsibilities as minister and politician should have engaged most if not all of his time and ef forts his business interests appeared to prosper and expand exponentially those interests were intimately connected to his role as chief minister and later as premier the principle that politician should scrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or perceived conflict of in terest between their ministerial position and their private financial interests was t one that he observed or encouraged his cabinet to observe240 413 he appears to have benefited on several fronts apart from his salary and allowances 1 the pnp continued to fund him with căŷěŝěăƚğɛ ƚŝɖğŷěɛ amounting to about us900000 following his election in 2003 his asse rtion that these represented salary is largely matter of semantics none of the payments bo re the hallmarks of salary i have been shown documentation to support

them on his behalf these were for large amounts of money and in one instance included 500000 from businessman involved in major development project who was in th process of negotiating further large development project with the government and w ho received belonger status the same year 4 his spending of government funds was extensive as chief minister and minister for tourism he funded worldwide travel on the governmen t budget this extended in due course to the provision of gulfstream iii jet whic h he treated as his own he also ensured that his wife received contracts for promotion of th tci which resulted in payments to her of hundreds of thousands of dollars 5 the cabinet voted to provide him with not just one but two official residences and covered much of the household running expenditure n his main providenciales property from public funds 6 he was the beneficiary of number of land grants i ncluding one of 18 acres in the north west point area in april 2007 for which he did not p ay his partners overseas developers paid the entire purchase price of over 19 million but he received 50 ownership in the project 7 he received number of payments whilst in offic representing ĩŝŷěğƌɛ ĩğğɛ or commissions from developers seeking land including half of fee charged by the hon floyd hall to the developer richard padgett he does not ppear to have regarded such actual or perceived conflicts of interest as an obstacle to acce ptance of such financial benefits similarly he received sum of 325000 for having i ntroduced mr alden smith of ashley properties ltd to developer named mr peter wehrli leading to sale of land241 the hon floyd hall also benefited from this transaction 8 whilst promoting development in the islands he held financial interest in projects considered by the cabinet that benefited from governm ent grants of permission without 241 see paras 433 439 below 118 disclosing that interest an example was the casablanca casino where he held share in the company that owned and rented its building the ca sino paid for the renovation of the building thus indirectly enriching him and two cabin et colleagues he did not declare those interests when they were discussed in cabinet 9 he received large sums of money which he and his brother chal misick were to characterise as loans many of those receipts were undocumented and not th subject of any agreed terms for interest or repayment in severa l instances they have still not been repaid despite the passage of years or his apparent abili ty to repay them he received one of such loans matter of days before the lenders the same overseas developers who later paid for the north west point land received favourabl decision from the cabinet approving conversion of land from residential to comm

relatives of those two ministers used their belonger status to purchase free hold crown land for immediate onward sale to an overseas developer each of the par ties received 1 million each was then pressed to and did make substantial loan to him none of which he has yet repaid further loan was also taken from his colleague hon j effrey hall who also profited from the deal 11 he received millions of dollars in transactions f ormally documented as loans one of which was of sum of 6 million on advantageous terms from the overseas backers of development project on salt cay the collateral on th

f the oral proceedings that donors on 122 occasion might wish to advance the political career of n individual but without any publicity in his evidence he said245 this is primarily because

hon floyd hall247 that party politicians must dispense money to constituents as w ell as pay for the usual political expenses 422 what constituted individual political contribu tions proved to be somewhat elusive the hon michael misick had made mention of political contributions in his declarations of interests under the registration of interests ordinance over the years or in his submissions to the commission prior to the start of the oral proc eedings he mentioned them for the first time in the following passage from written stat ement presented to the commission at the start of those proceedings some donations were paid directly to whilst on at least one occasion the pnp passed on to donations of political nature don ations sometimes took the form of personal contributions to to use as i see fit rather than political contributions in the normal sense understood by uk observer the money given to in this way could be used to help out the peop in the islands or to reimburse for money that i spent to help islanders and there is another aspect to this i often spent my own money on pnp act ivities and i often did not claim the sums back he provided details of monies spent on helping is landers any more than he did of personal monies that he had spent on pnp activities or of any correlation of sums received by him with such expenditure on his own belated acc ount set out in schedule to the statement and the light of pnp accounts also produced at the last moment by the hon floyd hall he had much political largesse to explain he di sclosed two payments into his accounts 245 transcript day 1 p 49 246 ibid p 56 247 transcript day 5 pp 5 26 123 described as funds from pnp one of 18000 in may 2004 and another of 100000 i n february 2005 the pnp accounts showed payments to t he hon michael misick from 2004 to 2008 totalling about 900000 423 even when he left the witness box there was evidence before the commission f undisclosed political donations received on his behalf by his brother chal misick when the latter gave evidence the following week he disclosed after having been ordered to do so the identities of five contributors who had chosen to make donations to the premier via his office these totalled further 1030000 the lar gest was for half million dollars in january 2007 purportedly for election campaigning expe nses from turks ltd the company of dr cem kinay the developer of dellis cay and the p roposed developer of joe grant cay in further written statement to the commission he stated that he had omitted to mention those sums because he had been concentrating on his wn accounts248 424 other previously undisclosed donations to the hon michael misick continued to emerge chal misick in his oral evidence to the co mmission spoke of 50000 from sarawak ltd paola sepe 30000 from windsor enterpri ses ltd russell garland 300000 from valentine grimes and 150000 in two payments f rom cherokee ltd249 chal misick also spoke of number of loans from other sources some from large financial institu tions and documented others small and undocumented from ind ividuals and some from himself his method of lending on at least two occasions was to place funds into his client account on behalf of his brother who would then draw upon th account in july 2006 he credited 325000 to his client account and made equivalent paym ents out to two accounts operated by or on behalf of his brother in november 2006 he placed further 130000 into the client account and dealt with it in the same way withi n few days in all he loaned his brother some 455000 in that way none of which had b een repaid when he gave evidence to the commission in january this year the commissi on had time to investigate the legitimacy or otherwise of the payments from this com pany or individuals 425 there is obvious reason why personal loans t the hon michael misick would need to be put through chal misick ɛ đůŝğŷƚ ăđđžƶŷƚ ƚśğ ůăƚƚğƌɛ ůğěőğƌ ƌğđžƌě žĩ ǁśŝđ ś ŝɛ seemingly

question whether the reason was to obscure the conne ction between the source of the funds and the hon michael misick especially when he h as never repaid them even when apparently in funds to do so and he has seemingly not been pressed by his brother to do so without examining the full banking records of chal m isick the commission could not identify the source or establish any audit trail for these funds 426 further source of large scale funds to the h on michael misick wholly undisclosed by him in the course of correspondence with the commis sion or in his oral evidence was 500000 allegedly borrowed from his brother philip these sums only came to light in the ledger of chal misick and were said to be loans made in november 2005 and february 2006 as with the chal misick loans they were devoid of supporting documentation and on the face of the client account have not been repaid at t he very least these raise questions as to their purpose 3 i find from the above and other material before the commission that there is information that the hon michael misick may have abused his position as premier and as leader of the pnp party by using pnp funds for his own purposes in that 1 if and insofar as he may have been entitled to reimbursement from the party for monies expended on its behalf he failed to account for such expenditure and 2 that the level of his personal expenditure was disproportionate to any expenditure on the part he may have incurred i therefore recommend criminal investigation by p olice or others in relation to him into possible corruption andor other serious d ishonesty in relation to such and other similar matters in recent years 4 ʹ i find that the hon michael misick accepted and fai led to declare to the registrar of interests many gifts of money via the client account of his brother and attorney chal misick which were not and could not reasonably be interpreted as being political in nature and whic h he appears to have applied to his personal expenditure without disclosure to t he registrar of interests or to the commission 125 i therefore recommend criminal investigation by p olice or others in relation to him of possible corruption andor other serious dis honesty in relation to such and other similar matters in recent years 5 i find that the payment of 500000 by dr cem kinay through his company turks ltd to the hon

misick then chief minister placed paper before the executive council proposing rezoning of certain parcels of land254 from low density residential development to tourism related development and asked

firm of saunders co of which he had been an associate he had declared earnings from the firm in his returns to the registrar he initially stated to the c ommission through his attorneys that he had been paid for work done in 2003 but not since he then produced list showing commission payment in 2002 salary payments in 2004 2005 and 2006 and loans in 2004 and 2008 the latter being the 275000 loan in oral evidence to the commission he said that he had been paid as consultant by the firm throu ghout his period as premier his attorneys clearly on instructions had informed the commission on 18th november 2008 that he had not been employed by saunders co since 2003 the precise nature of his consultancy work for saunders co was however obsc ure as he could not name any of their clients in

supported i n the hon michael mŝɛŝđŭɛ submissions to the commission with any documents d uring the course of the oral proceedings the commission was informed that the fun ds had been used to make

michael misick must have prev iously produced them to the commission according to this further documentati on saunders co did not make the loan but arranged it the source of the funds remain s unclear the oral evidence of the hon michael misick was that he had still not repaid it in c ommon with almost all his other loans saunders co had not taken security themselves but ap parently caution had been placed on property owned by the hon michael misick on behalf of nominee company run by the firm in the result this loan like the others raises serious questions that remain unanswered and merit further investigation 433 the north west point loans of 450000 ʹ the hon michael misick said that in june and july 2006 he had received total of 350000 in t hree loans 150000 from the hon floyd hall and 100000 each from the hon jeffrey hal l and the hon lillian boyce the money for these loans was generated by the sale of lan d at north west point by company called urban development ltd to company controlled by an overseas developer called david wex and the loans were made to the hon michael misick following the transaction i examine this matter in more detail later in this chapt er in relation to the hon jeffrey hall258 the beneficiaries of the transaction which involved flipping259 of crown land were the hon jeffrey hall and three other belongers the three ot hers were respectively the brothers of the hon floyd hall and the hon lillian boyce and the former husband of hon lillian boyce the hon floyd hall and the hon lillian boyce each ins isted in evidence that their siblings not they had loaned the monies but the hon michael ick disagreed saying the ministers had been the lenders 434 the transaction as whole bears the hallmarks of flagrant exploitation of the crown land policy in which three cabinet ministers may have been complicit both the hon floyd 258 see paras 4196 ʹ 4209 below 259 see paras 3 9 ʹ 315 above purchase by belongers of land at discou nt and immediate onward sale to overseas developers at l arge profits 129 hall260 and the hon lillian boyce261 admitted that they had benefited personally from the profits made by their brothers the hon michael ick seems to have known enough of the transaction and the profits made to regard it as an oppor tune time to approach them for money there is sign of any attempt to repay or ev pretence at attempts to repay the funds despite his later acquisition of much greater funds from slovakian bank jt banka262 the fact that the money was being taken from those who had made windfall profits without the need for investment or risk on t heir parts suggests that the hon michael misick took cut from the profits from each if that proves to be th case it would be shameless exploitation of the crown land policy and represent his personal enrichment at the expense of the tci islanders 435 as with all or most of the other loans that i have mentioned the receipt of multiple sums never repaid suggests that ʹ like the loans to constituents ʹ the idea of eventual repayment is convenient fiction this is at its most obvious when it is remembered that they were made to an ostentatiously wealthy premier b colleagues in the cabinet or the relatives of the two of them none of whom enjoyed at the time his trappings of wealth or influence and whom he has made attempt to repay 7 i find that the

criminal investigation by p olice or others in relation to the hon michael misick of possible corruption andor other serious dishonesty including misfeasance in public office in relation to these

wife gave evidence to the commiss ion about their use of private aircraft after they met in mid2005 they conducted courtsh ip from afar flying between angeles and the tci initially on scheduled aircraft they quickly decided that privately leased aircraft would give them more time together he provided the funds she said that she did not at first know the cost but later learn ed that each oneway trip cost about 50000 they adopted this mode of travel from about july or august 2005 and continued with two or three round trips per month up to and b eyond their marriage in april 2006 assuming private leases were always at the level and rat mentioned by ms mccoymisick the premier would have spent between 200000 and 30 0000 per month between august 2005 and march 2007 when they began to consider differ ent arrangement this represents expenditure of between 4 million and 6 million conspicuous and lavish expenditure of this nature is precisely the reason wh there was such widespread public concern at the behaviour of the premier and legiti mate concern as to how he could possibly afford it 455 in 2007 the government acquired 1976 king air 200 aircraft271 for local and regional transport it bought the plane for just over 1 milli on from company called tci export llc based in boise idaho with mailing address in chicag o272 the only named manager on the corporate documents is man named paul brassington wh ose likely relative michael brassington became its regular pilot once the govern ment had purchased it the hon michael misick proposed the purchase at cabinet meeti ng on 30th may 2007273 cabinet approved the purchase and the following week 6th june they approved payment for the employment of two pilots 456 the aircraft of greater interest however

transportation partners company based in miami that company then offered to lease it to the tci government for 165000 per month based on total of 400 hours flying time in july 2007 the cabinet before

but had not spoken out agai nst it he told the commission that the deal had been done by the hon michael misick with out reference to him as minister for finance the hon michael misick was unable to explain to the commission how it was that mr watson had bought the aircraft he had been looking at in angeles soon after in october 2007 mr watson was given belonger status 457 ms mccoymisick remembered the details of th acquisition somewhat differently she had been shown the offer to purchase document whilst on board the aircraft from miami to providenciales they had she said bought the plane she knew that because her husband had told her so she and he had made arrangeme nts to personalise or customise the inside of the aircraft to the extent of her desi gning personal crest to be woven into the carpet they had also chosen colours and fabrics for t he interior design she provided the commission with documentation from designer quoti ng for work on the aircraft which had been faxed to captain mike she knew jeffrey watson as friend of her husband who would stay at the house with them in tci but was unawar of his connection with the aircraft at stage during her marriage did she suspe ct that they did not own the aircraft 274 registration number n165g 140 she had accompanied her husband in it on working tri p to dubai for tourist conference but most of her use of it was

had leased it to the gove rnment and others for government use for set periods of time and to himself for pers onal use however there is doubt that the hon michael misick had almost exclusive use of

borrow 13 million from m s trust company ltd 466 when asked about the possible involvement of mario hoffmann in the casino operation chal misick said he did not know he main tained that he had idea if mr hoffmann was behind the other 50 share in hydronox ltd or whether he had been behind the loan of money for the redevelopment of the casino in fact as mr hoffmann was later to make clear in written submissions to the commissi on on 20th february 2009281 he was behind both included in those submissions mr hof fmann stated that on visit by the hon michael misick to bratislava in october 2005 he mr

mr hoffmann also confirmed in written submis sions to the commission in february 2009 that he had loaned the money to casablanca casinos ltd and to bk partners ltd the latter apparently partner in managing the casino init ially owned by washington misick and later jointly by him and mr stephens accordingl it appears that whilst chal misick manages hydronox ltd 50 owned by himself on trust f or others he claims not to know the identity of the person behind the other 50 share ven though this was mario hoffmann man with whom he has been involved later in number of transactions he also does not know that the money loaned to the company formed by h im for renovation of the casino encouraged by his brother the hon michael misick an d 50 owned by his brother washington was also from mr hoffmann 469 whether there is any wrongdoing in the estab lishment of the casino does not emerge from the material we have seen mr hoffmann in his written evidence to the commission insisted that it was standard business deal but even he expressed surprise that chal misick claimed not to recall the details of it completed as it was only few months earlier in my view chal misick is almost certainly lying about his recollection it defies belief that he would not know with whom he was dealing 470 the two cabinet ministers in addition to the hon michael misick who had been investors in windsor investment group ltd the hon f loyd hall282 and the hon mcallister hanchell283 both returned to give further evidence in the oral proceedings both then remembered their investment 40000 each in the c asino project in about 2004 471 the hon floyd hall said that he had not known th at the windsor investment group ltd had been the company involved or that his shareholding had amounted to 10 he said he had paid 40000 from his own account but had received paperwork evidencing his investment he said that he had not thought it neces sary to declare his interest in this investment to the registrar of interests or to disclos it to the commission he also said that whilst he believed ministerial colleagues had also invested he had not known who or in what sums he added that the hon michael misick the hon mcallister hanchell and he had never discussed their joint investment despite all being in similar position and he had 282 transcript day 15 p 4 283 transcript day 19 p 94 145 never asked chal misick how the investment was doing despite the high profile and apparent success of the casino 472 the hon mcallister hanchell unlike the hon floyd hall knew the company name and its borrowings that the hon michael misick and the hon floyd hall were his coinvestors and that chal misick had coordinated their respecti ve investments indeed he recalled when the four men had met together to discuss the p roject and had agreed that it would be good investment 473 all this information and evidence about the casablanca casino suggests joint venture by the four men through windsor investment group ltd to develop the casablanca building that in itself is unremarkable however formal shares were ever issued in windsor investment group ltd and the commission has not been able to establish what if any investment they respectively made or when or w here the money from the investment came from the company said to own the land hydronox ltd although it existed before casablanca casinos ltd was not acquired by windsor invest ment group ltd until late 2007 which is over 18 months after casablanca casinos ltd d been established and after the casino with the financial involvement and support of mario hoffmann had begun to operate it is hard to see how the claimed investmen t in 2004 could have been used to redevelop the building 474 i cannot say that the circumstances giving rise to this establishment and investment in the casino by three former government ministers and mar io hoffmann were on their face possibly corrupt or otherwise seriously dishonest however the contradictions and evasiveness exhibited by the three ministers suggest possibility of some venality that calls for further investigation i have in mind in partic ular the following circumstances 1 the nondeclaration by the ministers of their respective interests in the casino to the registrar of interests and their tardy and patchy disclosure of th em to the commission 2 contradictory accounts of the hon floyd hall and the hon mcallister hanchell and 3 their common accounts of investing without any form of documentatio n and apparent lack of curiosity about the value of and returns from their investment despite its apparent obvious success i am strengthened in the suspicion of such possibility of venality by the contradictions inherent in the evidence of chal misick 146 475 an interesting side issue and footnote arises from the involvement of chal misick in the windsor investment group ltd it concerns payme nt into one of the companies that chal misick had established for ms mccoymisick my way productions 2 ltd one of the items listed by the hon michael misick on the schedu schedule 5 that he provided to the commission at the start of the oral proceedings in ja nuary 2009 purporting to show the sources of various funds284 was the receipt of payment from windsor investment g roup ltd by my way productions 2 ltd of sum of 300000 made in march 2007 when asked about it the hon michael misick referred to his inte rest as shareholder in windsor investment group ltd285 and initially suggested that it was dividend payment t him however he was unable to explain why or how he could have acquired 300000 as dividend from company that had earned nothing 476 chal misick was to suggest in later statement that he thought his brother was mistaken and that the 300000 came from share sale option on north caicos property286 in fact the client account ledger provided by chal ick did not support either explanation the client account had received almost ex actly the same sum about six weeks before the transfer to my way productions 2 ltd by way of political contribution from valentine grimes believed to be bahamasbased lawyer and politician joe grant cay 477 the issue of the

fraudu lent activity there may be nothing in these allegations the commission has not received any information to suggest that his involvement in joe grant cay was not above board it i s clear however that he was attracting criticism in his own name over some period of time and his continuing association with the project might have been embarrassing for the tci government 480 chal misick also knew

misick may not have had full access to that information at the time w hat is clear is that in the following year 2007 the cabinet set deadline of 30th november 2007 for action deadline that the then proposed developers did not meet this failure may have been confused with the events of late 2006 by then according to chal misi ck mr malave had dropped out of the picture and he chal misick had

the commission it is clearly an area of great concern to the inhabitants of the tci in particular those of salt cay its renowned natural beauty the frag ility of its environment and the historical significance of the island make any attempt to develop the island topic of serious debate i do not seek to intrude on that debate but i must consider the handling of the proposed development in so far as it may cast light u pon the issues at the heart of the inquiry 491 the development of salt cay has been contemplat ed for long time but only became real possibility in recent years with the proposals ad vanced by salt cay development company ltd devco which is ultimately owned and controlled by the s lovakian businessman mr mario hoffmann mr hoffmann in exten sive written submissions to the commission described his involvement with the proj ect beginning with his purchase of land on the island held by the caribbean islands investment company ltd in 2001 in total about 11 acres of mixed freehold and leasehold property ver the following years he bought further land adding about six acres more to his holdi ng 492 from 2005 onwards proposals for the development gathered pace and grew in land take mr hoffmann reached an agreement in principle wi th the government to obtain 41 further acres of land to build hotel and residences at around this time the hon michael misick and the hon galmo williams made trip to bratislav at the invitation of mr hoffmann 152 493 in early 2006 feasibility study was prepared b kpmg on behalf of devco envisaging far wider reaching development of the island this do cument floated for the first time the idea of golf course in mayjune 2006 mr hoffmann so reached agreement with his then belonger partners to buy out their shares in the busi ness 494 one particular aspect of the development that has caused concern to the commission was the handling of the proposal for the salt cay golf club following informal consideration and discussions about the possibility of golf course mario hoffmann wrote formally on behalf of devco on 1st august 2006 to the hon michael misick seeking parce l of land for golf course he sought in formal terms long ter m lease of 222 acres for 99 years the letter of 1st august stated that salt cay golf club ltd would be stablished to run the course301 it made mention of who would be involved beyond that 495 the hon michael misick showed the letter to the cabinet meeting scheduled for the following day 2nd august there had clearly been possible chance fo r any formal governmental assessment of it in the intervening 24 h ours and there is indication that there had been beforehand nonetheless cabinet imme diately approved it in principle302 and the hon michael misick wrote to mr hoffmann telli ng him the good news on 8th august303 tcinvest instructed the chief valuation officer mr shaaban hoza to undertake valuation of the site he placed freehold value on it of 776 million304 by 29th november 2006 the cabinet had decided ʹ following request for relatively small increase in acreage ʹ that they would grant 23872 acres for the proposed golf course at peppercorn rent of 1 per acre per year at the same time they approved t he grant of belonger status for mr hoffmann the effect of this grant was to avoid the ne ed for mr hoffmann to engage any other belonger partner in the project since he was now himself the belonger 496 from the viewpoint of mr hoffmann this was ve ry good deal he had his full golf course for tiny initial outlay and his resort develo pment would be valuable extra resource that would make the marketing of the developm ent far more attractive even so the commission has received several representations that the deal was vulnerable to failure 301 core volume 7 tab 3 p 1 302 ibid pp 2 3 303 ibid p 4 304 ibid p 5 153 without adequate and timely ancillary facilities such as those proposed and it has been pointed out given the vast development costs land f or golf courses is frequently provided by way of long term lease and at low or nominal rates 497 if longterm leasing at nominal sum had been anticipated by the government when first considering the proposal in august 2006 it is surprising that tc invest in november 2006 sought market valuation of the land from the chi ef valuation officer having received the freehold valuation of 7760000 tc inv est had on 14th november 2006 prepared memorandum for the lease suggesting com mercial rent of 194000 per annum calculated at 25 of the freehold value305 however the cabinet did not even seek to negotiate on the strength of that valuation they chose to forego the 194000 rental worth over 19 million over the term of the lease and let the lease go for peppercorn rent 498 salt cay golf club ltd had been incorporated by chal misick on 4th august 2006 two days after the august 2006 cabinet approving the initial proposal in principle and before the receipt of the letter from the hon michael misick in

the hon floyd hall was at all relevant times eith er deputy chief minister or later deputy premier of the tci he was also the minister f finance having also responsibility for national insurance and economic planning and was the tr easurer of his political party the pnp he is certified public accountant before becoming government minister he had worked in barclays bank and then in charter trust as chie f accountant 4111 owing to his central role in government for many years i have had to examine his conduct in some detail having regard to number of all egations made against him within my terms of reference he made written submissions p rior to the cžŵŵŝɛɛŝžŷɛ žƌăů proceedings in january and february of this year and gav evidence over two days in those proceedings when he was represented by mr oliver sm ith he has provided series of written documents and submissions subsequent to the hearing s declarations of interests 4112 the hon floyd hall in common with his cabin et colleagues failed to comply with the statutory requirements requiring declarations to the registrar of interests316 the most striking and consistent omission in this respect was of his receipt of gifts or contributions including socalled political contributions in parti cular he did not mention party contributions to him in any of his returns to the reg istrar of interests in oral evidence to the commission he produced ledger showing payments in his favour from an account of the party held with the first caribbean bank totalling 355500 over three years he also admitted receipts largely undocumented of further p arty funds from second account held with the belize bank 4113 he also failed to declare to the registrar any of his overseas visits during the period covered by the inquiry of which there were several he has admitted in evidence to the commission that he was flown from london to slovakia i n the private jet of mario 316 see 229 above 159 hoffmann317 and from slovakia on to dubai to see motorracing he sought to draw distinction between the requirement under the registration of interests ordinance to declare every visit relating to your membership of the legisl ative council undertakenthe cost of which has not been wholly borne by yourself or by public funds and his role as member of the executive branch of government by virt ue of being minister of finance i do not regard this as meaningful distinction so as to co nstitute an exemption from the ordinance the office of minister of finance derives from h is elected membership of the legislature of which he remains member when acting as minister at the very least the trip should have been declared so that the registrar could termine its relevance it was said ďǉ măƌŝž hžĩĩŵăŷŷ ƚśăƚ ŝƚɛ ɖƶƌɖžɛğ ǁăɛ ƚž

ful l and accurate declarations of his interests to the registrar of interests as r equired by the registrations of interests ordinance 15 ʹ i find as an important example of his failure to make full and accurate declaration of interests to the registrar as requir ed by the registration of interests ordinance his failure to declare his interest in the casabla nca casino in providenciales through his investment in windso r investment ltd318 as in the case of the hon michael misick the breaches of the registration of interests ordinance are punishable only by the legislature and not by the courts save possibly by recourse some more general provision of the criminal law such as the common law offence of misfeasance in public office in his case too there is much else of substance worthy of criminal investigation i therefore make recomm endation arising out of either of those findings 317 transcript day 6 pp 161 163 318 see paras 461 ʹ 474above 160 4114 further matters that the hon

claimed ignorance of the perce ntage of his share in the project in addition to his nondeclaration to the registrar and ndisclosure to the commission of this interest he never disclosed it at cabinet meetings when the casino project was the subject of applications for various approvals as i have mention ed320 his evidence was that he only had vague idea that some of his ministerial colleague s

mcallister hanchell in respect of this matter loans 4159 in written and oral evidence to the commission the hon mcallister hanchell disclosed that he had borrowed extensively by way of p rivate loans and on credit cards these were all loans or receipts of money that he had not declared to the registrar of interests and only at the last moment to the commissi on despite being requested in advance of the proceedings to provide details of any cr edit cards used he failed to mention until the day before giving oral evidence that he had btained an american express centurion card following an introduction in 2007 to jt banka in prague by mr mario hoffmann the principal developer of salt cay he has since used the card extensively however he did not always clear the debit on monthl basis allowing monthly outstanding balances to accumulate this from time t time engendered chasing letters from the bank seeking payment of outstanding sums on occasion in excess of 300000 4160 the minister made late disclosure in the cour of his oral evidence to the commission of other loans that he had never declared to the registrar of interests one was loan totalling 1168 million which he said that he had obtained with the agreement of norman saunders jnr from his firm of attorneys saunders co he agreed that the only documentation of the loan was charge in favour of sau nders co imposed on parcel of land in fact the loan was from an unnamed principal f the firm 4161 another loan which the hon mcallister hanc hell disclosed just before he began to give oral evidence was of 1 million from the hon chael misick who had not at that stage disclosed it in his written or oral evidence353 the minister explained that he had asked the hon michael misick for the loan to help pay outstandin g sums on his american express card 353 which the hon michael misick then promptly disclo sed by an emailed message to the commission 183 bills the hon michael misick made series of payments to help out in at least one case from line of credit he had from lichtensteinbased arling anstalt institution according to the minister this borrowing was informal interest free and undocumented on the understanding that he would repay it as soon as possibl the commission is unaware of any repayment by him of the loan or when or how he ant icipates doing so his limited accounts disclosing an excess of spending over his d isclosed ad hoc income streams in services ltd and caicos oil ltd do not indicate early repayment 4162 whilst the minister broke law in borrowing massively beyond his means to repay his behaviour raises some worrying questions his cabi net salary of 203000 per annum could not provide him with funds that would go very far towards repayment of capital never mind servicing interest obligations when charged an d he seems not to have felt able to make drawing from his company interests to put him in credit yet he embarked on and persisted in lavish spending spree as the debits in curred on his american express card show and which he could only meet in the first inst ance by further borrowing it may be that he had expectations of other and substantial sou rces of revenue caicos oil ltd 4163 one possible source revenue may have been wi llingness to use his ministerial position to further his own financial interests for example in relation to his company caico s oil ltd on 8th october 2008 the hon michael misick put proposal t the cabinet in support of his interest in obtaining cabinet approval for the company to build number of storage facilities around the islands the proposal visaged the grant of outright freehold ownership of land for service stations long leases for establishment of storage facilities on an uninhabited island tax exemption for 15 years and 5 customs duty on materials needed for establishment of the facilities 4164 when questioned in the oral proceedings about the need for such provision he told the commission that there had been long standing pro blem on the islands of shortages of fuel he was unable to point to any supporting docume ntation for this contention say in th form of government fuel strategy papers and there ap pears to have been reference to 184 such problem at the 8th october 2008 cabinet meeting his proposal if appr oved by the cabinet would however create valuable commercial opp ortunity for caicos oil 4165 the fact that hon mcallister hanchell was known to be the owner of caicos oil ltd and that he withdrew from cabinet discussion on the prop osal does not exclude the problem of potential conflict of interests on his part it was h ighly likel ǉ őŝǀğŷ ƚśğ hžŷ mŝđśăğů mŝɛŝđŭɛ espousal of the proposal that his other close cabine t colleagues and friends would follow suit while he waited outside the door of the cabinet room ministerial allocation of crown land 4166 there was considerable potential for more dire ct abuse by the hon mcallister hanchell of his cabinet position in his role as minist er for natural resources it has been common theme of official and other concerns put befor the commission that the system for allocation of crown land has been routinely abused i n number of complementary ways including critically ministerial misuse of po wer i have detailed these concerns in chapter 3 of this report354 broadly they fall under two main headings the first is that allocation is not fair or equitable in that not all belo ngers can obtain crown land whilst some are able to profiteer by obtaining it at the disco unted rate and immediately selling it to overseas developers the second is the recent gover nmental approach of covering recurrent public expenditure from the disposal of valuable capital assets in the form of crown land 4167 in response to questions posed by his couns mr ariel misick qc the minister gave an account of the administration of allocation of crown land that i have already set out in chapter 3355 part of which for convenience i repeat here the officers try to do their very best to service n first come first served basis after that process is over then there is review process with number of applications where recommendations are made by staff members in the industry based on the representations received to get crown landthe review process involves the permanent secretary the commissioner of lands the assistant commissioner of lands the deputy commissioner of lands and it also involved i come in sometimes during the overall discussion of the allocations or i may 354 paras 310 ʹ 350 above 355 transcript day 9 p 29 185 come

the nistry for natural resources mrs garlandcampbell in response to written enquiry from the commission about this account wrote on 29th january 2009 contradicting it356 she stated that there were formal procedures for allocating land and that such arrangement as review group existed she stated that applications were handled in ne of three possible ways 1 the minister gave instructions orally or in writing as t whom the land was to be allocated 2 another minister intervened to do the same or 3 she or the land commissioners provided the minister with lists of longstanding unsuccessfu l applicants for his approval the only review that took place was after allocation had been mad simply to ensure that each successful applicant qualified for it as belonger and had not exceeded the maximum number of parcels of land allowable 4168 the permanent secretary provided the commiss ion with number of letters and ğŵăŝůɛ ďǉ ǁăǉ žĩ ğǆăŵɖůğɛ žĩ ƚśğ hžŷ mđaůůŝɛƚğƌ hăŷđśğů ůɛ ɖƌăđƚŝđğ žĩ

the allocation of number of conditional purchase lea ses to company akita holdings ltd of which he owned 60 of the equity which he commu nicated by letters bearing his signature ʹ effectively writing to himself as he acknowledged i n evidence he also acknowledged that it did not look good but defended the use of the discretion granted to him by the cabinet to make allocations to himself ev more striking was letter he wrote on behalf of the ministry to palm breeze ltd compan wholly owned and operated by him granting it freehold title to parcel of land at 75 of open market value said to be in

commission has not been able to identify the claimed cabinet decision and he did not declare his interest in pal m breeze ltd to the registrar of interests in short the minister did not appear to regard the use of his ministerial power to grant land 356 see 318 above 186 to himself as presenting him with conflict of inter ests since as he emphasised he too was belonger 29 i find that the hon mcallister hanchell in his ffice of minister for natural resources entered into possibly corrupt andor oth erwise seriously dishonest transactions andor in misfeasance of public office by offering on behalf of the government grants of crown land to himself andor t companies that he substantially owned or controlled thereby creating and ignoring the obvious conflicts of interest to which his offers gave rise i recommend criminal investigation by the police or others in relation to him of possible corruption andor serious dishonesty an dor misfeasance in public office in respect of these matters 30 ʹ i find that the hon mcallister hanchell possibly bused his ministerial position by instructing the permanent secretary in the ministry for natural resources to allocate crown land to individuals of his choice or to allocate or instruct the permanent secretary or other of his departmental officers to allocate crown land to individuals identified and notified to him by fellow ministers in all or most cases without proper rega rd to the crown land policy i recommend criminal investigation by the police or others in relation to him of possible corruption andor other serious dishone sty andor misfeasance in public office in respect of such actions 4169 one associated aspect of the allocation of crown land arose from the evidence of mr gary lightbourne who had been former bodyguard of th premier he said that had been offered parcel of crown land personally by the hon mc allister hanchell for which he had not even applied following series of unsuccessful applications over the years for

of his application for commercial lease of parcel in west c aicos mr 187 lightbourne said that he had never made any such applicati on and had never had any interest in starting business on west caicos he ri ghtly or wrongly interpreted the letter as an attempt to placate him ahead of the february 2007 election as he had left the service of the hon michael misick for whom he had been dri ver and bodyguard 4170 on the following day it happened again this t ime the hon michael misick personally handed him letter again at the airport and again signed b him now for conditional purchase lease of residential property at proggins bay but again for which he had not applied he regarded it as further attempt at an elect oral bribe 4171 when these matters were put to the hon mcallis ter hanchell he said that mr lightbourne had made many applications for leases over the years and did not accept that offers had been made to mr lightbourne that did not reflect his applications he suggested that

500000000 there is evidence to suggest that the government ac ted upon or communicated the valuation to the proposed developers the valuation as with all such documents bore the cautionary rider that it was valid for more than six months from the date of production 4173 some 18 months later in june 2008 mr hoza was again asked to value joe grant cay but only as to 300 acres for hotel villas and co ndominiums as described in letter from chal misick on behalf of new developer dr cem kinay mr hoza in report of 10th june 3008359 valued the 300 acres at 75 million the hon mcalli ster hanchell on being notified of that valuation communicated at least twice b email with mr hoza requiring him to produce further valuation the commission has been shown some of the email correspondence between the two men the first was r equest by the minister made at 518pm on thursday 12th june for sight of the 10th june valuation report mr hoza sent it back by email at 835am the next mornin g360 the minister

to stress the nonpublication clause is unclear mr hoza had inserted and always inserted that phrase in valu ation reports and would be aware of the need for confidentiality in his work 4174 mr hoza replied at 913 am indicating his fusion at the request and stating the value for land is determined by forces of demand nd supply for goods and services in trying to satisfy this demand suit able land for development is sought after this means that the demand for suit able land is derived demand he indicated that he awaited further instructions the commission has not been shown any correspondence to suggest he received any the reque st made by the minister was tall order as it sought fresh valuation the same day mr hoza apparently complied producing two reports on the 13th june one set out to value the land as if for agricult ural use361 and the second on the basis of commercial use362 in each case at the specific request of the minister he addressed four specific parcels of land for agricultural use he valued them collectively at 2676 million for commercial use h valued them collectively just over 89 million 4175 the remarkable difference in the two valuation s clearly demonstrates the professional truism of valuation officer that the per ceived use to which land may be put is critical to its value 4176 the hon mcallister hanchell was later to say th at he had not seen the report referring to agricultural use although mr hoza had clea rly prepared it at the same time as the other report of the same day and one would have ex pected them to be sent together tśğ

coincidence that the four belongers involved in this transaction were all intimately connected to the cabinet one of them mber of it two the brothers of serving ministers one the exhusband of minister it may be coincidence that the premier seemed to know great deal about exactly who p rofited and when to the extent that he felt able to ask for loan from the three cabinet colleagues ʹ loan apparently unreturned in each case the hon floyd hall and the ho n lillian boyce maintained that had part or interest in the transactions however the hon floyd hall acknowledged that he might have had

agreed to give mr wilson half of that sum but mr wilson has denied that saying that mr harvey had merely asked him to hold the money on hi s behalf which he did by lodging it in the bank account of his company alliance realty lt d it was transaction in which mr wilson had apparently again acted for both the sellers an d the purchaser with the result that alliance realty ltd received handsome commissi on of 320000 4211 the conflict between the hon jeffrey hall and mr wilson as to whether the former had given 100000 to the latter or had merely asked t hold it for him is not resolved by examination of their respective bank accounts and that f alliance realty ltd the movements of monies in those accounts are bit convo luted like the transaction giving rise to them undoubtedly both merit further investigati on for what it is worth it looks as if the hon jeffrey hall had the benefit of the whole 200000 commission paid by mr harvey but whether it was 200000 or 100000 he did not

large number of scholarships were awarded outs ide of the scrutiny of the committee several problems arose out of this th majority of such recipients did not apply through the prescribed app lication process not all awards met the predetermined criteria set by the poli cy in most cases the awards did not focus on priority areas and were t based on merit with regard to the administration of the schola rships unless there are clear breaches of government policy ministerial involvement in individual cases can only hinder the efficient operation of ministry and the committee in implementing policy in cost effective transparent and equitable manner 4219 the hon lillian boyce as minister of educatio n clearly set the tone for disregard at the highest level of the scholarships policy for

consider in the light of all the information before whether to make findings as to any systemic weaknesses in legislation regulation or administration andor on any r elated matter as i indicated in the interim report i have interpreted any related matter as one that bears in fundamental way on any statutory regulatory andor administrative re form or changes that i recommend that includes the franchise the constit ution the criminal and civil justice systems and other areas of law and procedures the over all system of governance and financial control any relevant codes of professional c onduct and electoral and party political finances 52 as shown in earlier chapters of this report t he information i have gathered in the ten months of this inquiry points at least to possibil ity ʹ but more realistically high probability of systemic corruption andor other rious dishonesty involving past and present elected members of the legislature in recent years the information leading to those conclusions and where i have expressed them preliminary findings in relation to individuals has highlighted many weaknesses in the law and its administration all or most of which i have touched on in different contexts in the report in this chapter i shall refer to but not rehearse in detail systemic weaknesses or f ailures that i have already identified and where i think it may be helpful venture recomme ndations for remedying them 53 before doing so i should like to mention so general faultlines as i now see them in the governance and different cultural attitudes givin g rise to the troubles that brought to these beautiful hurricane prone friendly and potent ially prosperous islands in the sun i do not claim any originality in this exercise because afte r ten months of this

democratic traditions and structures have been tested almost to be yond breaking point 55 such problems are bad enough for any small state with strong economic potential but they are compounded by the tripartite system of gove rnance that is feature of many british overseas territories first there is the f oreign commonwealth office with general oversight and responsibility for the people of the islands and ultimate control over the governor of the day yet it has only partial fin ancial input to the governance of the country secondly there is the governor usually of broad and deep experience of many overseas jurisdictions but stranger for while to the islands and here only for few years he has general oversight over an executive of which he is part and in accordance with whose advice he is bound to act save in certain reserved matte rs or when instructed from london for him there are political and financial pressures in cabinet from the front distant albeit experienced guidance or instruction from london fro m behind and all around expectations from many of those who live here that he will stand u p for them and thirdly there is an executive in the form of the cabinet consisting of third or more of the members of politically polarised legislature of locals closely inv olved with the commercial and social sinews of their society and their constituents repr esentative at best of less than half of the longterm residents of the islands 56 the pressures good or bad upwards on minister s and onward to the governor and the limited financial clout and immediate authority he can br ing to bear on matters possibly or 216 possibly not calling for reference to his superiors on the other side of the atlantic are the stuff of the weekly cabinet meetings over which he p resides it is at those meetings ʹ calling i should think for the skills of seasoned poker pl ayer that he is often pressed by cabinet ministers to approve matters of great public and pri vate consequence proposed by them they are inevitably matters in respect of which they know more than he does ʹ the approaches have been made to them most of the talking an d the dealmaking have been done before they put it to him in the cabinet room as cabinet agendas and minutes show ʹ his approval for proposals is frequently sought as mat ter of urgency and on inadequate information with the clear implication that if he do not approve the fleeting opportunity of securing valuable investment for the territory w ill be lost 57 the constitution does not it seems to ass ist as well as it might in balancing the countervailing interests and inputs in this tripartit system decisionmaking perhaps such tensions are unavoidable the 2006 constitution to far greater extent that its 1988 predecessor leaves individual cabinet ministers with wealth of discretions by way of grants exemptions concessions discounts etc to override or sidestep matters of principle or orderly and fair administration nor has there been for some time culture of probity in governance at the highest level or openness in the management and control of public finances to engender what democracy should be there to deliver an efficient system of governance and financial order that is honest and fair to all put at its narrowest there is dearth of effective checks and balances to prevent min isterial and other official abuse of the system of governance and its financial management 58 behind all of these problems lies the power and poison of politics since it is through the largely secret and publicly unaccountable donations to politicians direct or through the medium of their political parties ʹ notably in recent years the pnp that corruption of individual ministers by developers and other investor s may have been enabled to flourish unseen this possible corruption may prove to be n ot only feature of personal enrichment of ministers and in some instances their officials or families or associates but also of corresponding losses to the people of the islands in the bad governance to which it reduces the country and the diminution of its natural assets and revenue returns 217 59 in

on the information before of high probability of systemic corruption andor other serious dishonesty involving past and present elected members of the house of assembly and others i n recent years however i am not ready to formulate provisional findings for institution of criminal investigation in relation to any individual or any such interests he or she may have when i am ready to do so i shall give each individual concerned an opportunity to make representations 512 nothing that has happened since then has prompte d to take different view certainly not the new administration established under the leadership of the hon galmo williams after much delay and bumpy internal pnp politi cal manoeuvring and now functioning somewhat fitfully under the watchful eye s of the hon michael misick and other former cabinet colleagues there has been little appar ent legislative activity on the several broad fronts urgently needed for some time though t hat is doubt in part owing to the unsettled conditions to which the inquiry has contri buted coupled with the wait for this report but perhaps most important of all my close xamination of the information and evidence before the inquiry driving to the preli minary findings and recommendations in chapter 4 in relation to individual ministers in the misick administration has reinforced not weakened my conviction of the need of need for urg ent and wideranging systemic change 513 accordingly i confirm my interim recommendatio n 5 for suspension of the 2006 constitution but varied so as to take account of the alternative of p

this report 519 in addition both in the short and the medium tolong term i believe that there should be consideration of appointment of director of pu blic prosecutions to have responsibility under the general oversight of the attorney general for the initiation and conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions in the island s such an appointment would relieve the holder of the office of attorney general from t he often invidious combination of roles of member of the executive andor legislature and governm ental adviser with that of prosecutor that is so notwithstanding the provisi on in section 395 of the constitution that in the exercise of his powers in criminal proc eedings he shall not be subject to the direction or control of any other person or authori ty any holder of the office given his membership of the executive and the legislature as w ell as his main job advising the government on the law and applying and enforcing it in the public interest is inevitably 222 vulnerable in closely knit and highly politicised c ommunity such as that in these islands to speculative and unfounded perceptions and criticisms whatever he does or does not do in the exercise of his legal responsibilities in maki ng the following two recommendations my intention therefore is to enhance the authority and reach of whoever holds the office of attorney general by distancing him

the attorney general for initiation and conduct of criminal inv estigations and prosecutions 520 while on the subject of the attorney general and looking ahead to the eventual return of the islands to ministerial government i bel ieve for similar reasons that whatever the traditional role of the attorney general in most british overseas territories consideration should be given to him longer bein g ex offico member of the executive or legislative arms of government his membership of both bodies is in practice somewhat restricted in function his presence at the deliberations of both bodies when necessary as independent legal adviser is however vital to their proper functioning it is for him to advise the governor in cabinet on matters of law and practice w hen necessary rather than participate in cabinet discussions and decisions on the extralegal merits or demerits of many matters of cabinet business under discussion si milarly and fortiori i believe that the attorney general should longer be member of the house of assembly on its resumption both positions are in my view inimical to the quality in addition to legal expertise and judgment that in the public eye brin gs stature to the office ʹ independence of the government of the day and associated political p ressures if the governor in cabinet and the house of assembly need his legal advice he can be present at their respective deliberations in his legal capacity but not as member privy to but conventionally silent on their deliberations as to policy 47 recommendation in the interests of preserving an d enhancing the independence and stature of the office of attorney general consideration 398 see s 39 of the 2006 constitution which details his powers all in the context of crimi nal proceedings 223 should be given before return to ministerial govern ment to amending the constitution to provide that 1 the attorney gener should be available and entitled to advise the cabinet and the house of ass embly on the law and practicalities of its form and administration as it affects their deliberations and 2 for those purposes he or she should be entitled to attend their respective meetings but to do so in the capacity of independe nt legal adviser not as member of either 521 the final matter highly relevant to the proposed period of interim direct rule through the governor has been well canvassed in many audit and ot her reports over the last few years discussed in various parts of this report it is the urgent need for thorough examination ʹ stocktaking žĩ ƚśğ tğƌƌŝƚžƌǉɛ ĩŝŷăŷđŝăů ɛƚăƚğ ăŷě

my interim recommendation 8 governance and fiscal review and 19 more effective auditing were both blinding glimpses of the obvious the g overnor with i believe the assistance of the department for international devel opment has already begun to work with experts seconded to the territory to assist in certain aspects of the immediate task including recovery from hurricane damage and there are various initiatives under way within the public service which he with the assistan ce of the proposed advisory council should be well equipped to lead but if and to the extent that they are not

of crown land and of revenue in respect of waivers andor concessio ns in respect of stamp 224 import and other duties fees and taxes to which i h ave referred in various passages in this report most

of the administration of justice this would cover but not necessarily be c onfined to cases of possible corruption andor other serious dishonesty giving rise to this inquiry see for example the provisions in england wales under sections 43 and 44 of criminal justice act 2003 for trial by judge alone in cases respectively of serious and complex fr aud and where there is danger of jury tampering also in northern ireland under the justice and security northern ireland act 2007 sections 1 ʹ 9 see also the widespread use of bench trials ie trial without jury at the option of the defendant in common law jurisdicti ons for example in many of the states of the united states the commonwealth including canad australia and new zealand the falkland islands and st helena 527 such course would involve the removal of th present right to trial by jury contained in section 6g of the present tci constitution for suspension of which the 2009 constitution order provides409 but ideally leaving it for decision by the trial judg on case by case basis but trial by jury is not precondition of the fair trial requirement of article 6 of the echr which section 6g reproduces in substance trial wi thout jury is also feature of number of jurisdictions throughout the world including in dia and holland if as is clearly the case it is article 6 compliant in the many jurisdictions that permit trial of even the most serious 408 s 7 and schedule 1 1 409 ibid 227 offence without jury it is not such big step to t ake where national and cultural conditions are such as here that fair or effective trial coul d take place with jury there are in my view at least seven reasons why such step should b taken 1 the stance taken by all attorneys acting for minister s andor other members of the house of assembly and others in the inquiry w as that their respectiv clients could not possibly be given fair hearing by jury given the wide adverse publicity to allegations against them before during and as result of the work of the commission all or most of the attorneys express ed with some cogency in my view the high likelihood that any trial judge face d with an application for stay of the prosecution on account of such prejudice would stay it410 2 the contrary consideration if any prosecution were to survive such stay application is that in this small community of close family political and commercial affiliations it would in the event be wel l nigh impossible to secure convictions of politicians by jury trial where the p anel is of only seven jurors entitled to bring in majority verdicts by as few as fi ve411 and where for so many potential jurors in this jurisdiction much turns on commitment to party politics and local and family allegiances412 3 the clear risk in such circumstances of jury ʹtampering 4 the potential complexity of allegations of corrupti on or other serious dishonesty of the sort canvassed in the inquiry ʹ taxing for any jury panel whether in the tci or any jurisdiction strong co ntributor to the reasoning of lžƌě žɛŭŝůůɛ cžŵŵŝƚƚğğ žŷ fƌăƶě tƌŝăůɛ ƌğđžŵŵğŷěŝŷő ƚƌŝăů žĩ serious and complex fraud without juries413 5 the length and public and

criminal court after many months at reported cost to the public purse of some 60 million414 and 7 the strong public interest in what has become s tate of national emergency for those responsible to be brought swiftly to just ice and if found guilty made to expiate their crimes ʹ an outcome which in my view will be impossible if it is attempted in the territory by way of trial by jury 528 the same considerations should in my view app ly to civil issues which are presently also triable in the tci with jury 529 in both criminal and civil cases where the iss ue of jury trial is raised it should in my view be matter for determination by the judge assig ned to hear the matter whether in his judgment there could be fair and effective tri with jury or some such test and his decision on the issue

amendment an dor if necessary by way of amendment of schedule 1 to the 2009 constitution order partial reversal of the burden of proof or so called evidential burden in cases of corruption and other appropriate cases so as to enable court to convict public offi cial where there is evidence that he has been living above his present or past official mean s for which he has not given satisfactory explanation such provision is to be fo und in various forms in number of jurisdictions where national and social conditions h ave been such that it has been necessary to introduce such provision to provide p roper balance of the public interest against the individual rights of defendants in cases of alleged corruption i emphasise 414 r v rayment ors 2005 ʹ there are many other similar examples in england wales of lengthy trials aborted for reasons arising from the vulnerability juries to prejudice or other facto rs requiring their discharge before verdict 415 paras 218 et seq above 229 that i have in mind procedural and evidential change fo r the existing criminal offences not the creation of new substantive criminal offence in the form say as in hong kong 416 52 recommendation consideration of introduction of statutory provision partially to reverse the burden of proof or evident ial burden in cases of charges of corruption against public official so as enab conviction where there is evidence that he has been living above his or prese nt or past official means and for which he has not given satisfactory explanati on 531 disqualification from public office there is statutory provision in section 47 of the 2006 constitution for disqualifying persons from standing for election as members of the house of assembly if within the preceding five year s they have served part or all of sentence of imprisonment of at least 12 months cri minal conviction following election does not appear to result in automatic disqualification of an elected member or require his or her resignation in my view consideration should be given to disqual ification from membership of the house for longer periods of up to life where court considers it necessary andor for an enforceable declaration to be made that such person whether member or not is unfit to hold any public office or specified public offices 532 in an inquiry such as this even where prosecu tion for criminal offence is not recommended or contemplated as in the first blomcoo per inquiry417 it is not unknown for the report to include finding that the conduct of public office holder subject of the inquiry is so seriously reprehensible that he shoul d be declared to be unfit to hold public office it is not clear to what if any legal force such r ecommendation or action taken in consequence of it in the context of commission of inquiry the tci commissions of inquiry ordinance makes provision for it such declaration where app ropriate clearly based and sufficiently precise as to time and extent could be an important protection and reassurance to the public in my view consideration should be given to the introduction of statutory basis say by amendment of the ordinance for such declaration and for giving effect to it 416 see for example section 10 of the hong kong prevention of bribery ordinance cap 201 and other examples referred to in 26 above 417 see 128 above 230 53 recommendation consideration should be given to providing for 1 disqualification from membership of the legislat ure of those who have been convicted of serious criminal offences for longer periods than presently prescribed 2 for an enforceable declaration that such member is unfit to hold to hold any public office or specified public offices and 3 for the provision to commission of inquiry appointed unde r the commissions of inquiry ordinance of power to make such declaration enforceable if necessary by the court integrity in public life 533 codes of conduct the 2009 constitution order so long as it lasts will remove or neutralise many of the institutional contexts conduciv to corruption that i have mentioned in this report in particular those going to ministeri discretion however steps should be taken in the meantime by legislation and otherwise in cluding eventually constitutional change to minimise the opportunities for recurrence the first requirement is the establishment of system of governance that removes r minimises the scope for conflict of interests for those holding public office and whe re such scope remains ensures full and public disclosure of it as indicated in chapter 2 some of the safeguards are already there but they need considerable strengthening if integri ty in public life is to develop and endure 534 the starting point should be clear and widely publicised statement from the top emphasising the need for probity in public life not just for its own sake but for the general wellbeing and economic health of the islands the k eystone of that stance should be formal and public adoption of the code of conduct for ministers of the turks and caic islands which has been held as if in escrow by the pnp administration for some two years and its existence even as an instrument for the guidan ce of ministers denied by some of them418 there is another document which appears to have been g iven equally little priority by the pnp administration the precise sta of which is seemingly unknown by those in the public service who might be expected t know the tci public service code of 418 see paras 27 ʹ 214 and 227 ʹ 228 above 231 ethics419 whilst there are professions by the present pnp adm inistration under the leadership of the hon galmo williams shortly before s ubmission of this report of doing something about it nothing has yet been done to vey to the tci islanders change from the culture to the contrary about which the hon michael misick spo ke so confidently in evidence to the commission i therefore recommend as matter of urgency formal and wide promulgation of both codes and any necessary asso ciated revision of general orders as clarion call to all in public service of what is ex pected of them promulgation should include an expanded government website 54 recommendation the code of conduct for ministers of the turks caicos islands and any other similar code or provision governing t hose in public office should be formally and widely promulgated and used as permanent reminder by provision to all public officers on app ointment and published as ɖğƌŵăŷğŷƚ ĩğăƚƶƌğ žŷ ƚśğ gžǀğƌŷŵğŷƚɛ ǁ ebsite it should also be strengthened by regular reinforcement and reminder by training and in public educational media programmes 535 secondly consideration should be given to the introduction of freedom of information act 536 thirdly there should be early implementatio n of the integrity commission ordinance enacted on 15th may 2008 presumably intended in part as replacement of the registration of interests ordinance 1993 the latter though relatively basic as to its requi rements for disclosure could possibly have continued to serve i f it had been taken seriously by ministers and other elected representatives of the territories full and accurate public disclosure under its provisions would have gone long way to det erring or bringing to light much earlier the rampant conflicts of interest to which m inister appear to have exposed themselves and of which they possibly took advantage 537 the new ordinance is more demanding and provides investigative powers and sanctions outside the parliamentary context that should encourage more rigorous and cooperative approach by persons in public life to the need to avoid conflicts of interest and 419 i understand that the tci office of public service man agement and the change manager rather than the misick dministration were responsible for the introduction of this document and have now circulated it to civil servants in advance of its formal launch 232 to be open about and minimise them if they are unavoid able however the ordinance could do with some tightening up by way of the following steps but not so as to delay bringing it into force 1 conducting an early and widelyspread examination und er section 131f of the ordinance of the practices and procedures of those in public l ife and public bodies in order to facilitate the discovery of corrup t practices if and to the extent that other person or body has statutory du ty to perform that function 2 instructing advising and assisting the management f public bodies pursuant to section 131g of the ordinance as to changes in practices or procedures that may be necessary to reduce the occurrence of co rrupt acts if and to the extent that other person or body has statutory du ty to perform that function 3 the commission itself andor any other appropriate public body providing early publicity to and education in respect of the oƌěŝŷăŷđğɛ definition and manifold categories of corruption set out in section 44 4 reviewing the sufficiency of particularity require d from persons in public life in annual declarations of their financial affairs required of them by section 25 of and schedule 2 to the ordinance and reviewing the procedures for enforcement by the att orney general or other appropriate public bodies pursuant to section 35 of t he ordinance of the section 25 duty to declare their financial affairs so as to ensure speedy and otherwise effective proceedings and timely impositi on of significant penalties for noncompliance where required 55 recommendation early implementation and amendme nt along the lines indicated above of the integrity commission ordinance enacted in may 2008 in replacement of the registration of interests ord inance 233 538 in the light of the declared ignorance of some ministers and other members of the house of assembly of what was required of them as publ ic servants and possibly others in public office and with view to greater openness abo ut the way in which the government conducts its business its website should be expand ed and kept up to date with among other information 1 the code of conduct for ministers of the turks caicos islands and any other similar codes promulgated for those in public office 2 the integrity commission ordinance 3 annual declarations of financial affairs made by members of the legislature pursuant to that ordinance within short period ʹ to be prescribed ʹ of their final dates for submission or notation that declarat ion has been submitted 4 details of any sanction imposed for

posting as they occur all entries in the gazette including allocation of crown land grants of belonger status permanent reside nce etc 56 recommendation the government should expand its website with vi ew to informing and reminding all in public life of wh at is required of them in the matter of conflicts of interest and declarations of interests and with view to greater openness about the way in which the governm ent conducts its business so as to provide the above among other i nformation 539 as discussed in chapter 3 and as eris detailed in its excellent report on the february 2007 election420 there has long been much potential for abuse by pol iticians and their associates of purported campaign funding first there is specific legislative control of election campaign funding secondly such legislativ control as there is in the elections ordinance namely prohibitions on bribing and treating voters at or around election time has long been widely disregarded the eris report deserve s attention in their expression of general concern about lack of legislative provision f or campaign financing and electoral malpractices which it has detailed in the present syst em i strongly endorse their recommendation for legislation to regulate party campaig n finance and to require political parties to publish their income and expenditure on ection campaigns i would go further in the light of the information rehearsed in chapter 4 as to the use of pnp accounts as medium for channelling possibly corrupt payments to the premier and number of his cabinet colleagues i would recommend legislation r equiring publication of the amounts of all purported political donations the identities of t he true donors and donees and the medium of payment there can be honest reason or legal basis for secrecy about political donations and their sources if the motive for giving and receiving them is in the public interest as it should be 57 recommendation legislation to 1 regulate party campaign finance 2 require public disclosure by contributors to and recipients of election campaign expenses 420 paras 31 ʹ 38 235 3 of details of the true source recipient amount of

remedy the many other electoral buses identified by eris in their report421 540 abuse of office checks and balances as i have mentioned in number of contexts in this report there have been serious shortcomings in governmental financial management and accounting systems over the years including serio us inadequacies in internal auditing systems these have been routinely drawn attention t and criticised in successive audi t reports by tci chief auditors and others and mostl ignored by those ministers in cabinet responsible for doing something about it there is little point in my detailing here even the more important deficiencies and the many overlapping cr iticisms of them many of which i have summarised in chapters 1 and 2422 58 recommendation introduction or facilitation of rigorous internal and external audit systems for all governmental departm ents and public and statutory bodies where audit reports are promptly published and treated with respect by ministers and used by them board chairm and directors and other senior public officials to inform budgetary d ecisions and give effect to necessary financial control 541 as is also apparent from chapter 2 of the report there is endemic lack of effective checks and balances in the system of governance of the tci either because of insufficient constitutional or other legislative underpinning and or because of systematic disregard or neglect of what legislative or other imperatives ther are this is most evident in the total breakdown of the system of parliamentary standing commi ttees ʹ oversight committees or constitutional watch dogs as they are variously cal led ʹ for which the 2006 constitution 421 see paras 35 ʹ 38 above 422 see paras 138 and 250 251 above 236 provides as d id the 1998 constitution423 they have been so inactive over the years that neither the public officers responsible for servicin g them nor the members of the house of assembly to which they should report or others in the public service let alone the public are barely aware of what if anything they do the comm ission has had extraordinary difficulties in trying to extract basic information i n the form of records or otherwise

rigorous oversight and insistence by the house on compliance with its standing orders and for provision to the committees of the necessary support facilities to enable them to do their jobs in addition to such par liamentary scrutiny provision should be made for other public scrutiny as to the action or inaction of their watchdogs by broadcasting and reporting on the government website and otherwise their proceedings including examination of witnesses and their reports to the house as the chief auditor cynthia travis commented in her 2005 and 2006 audit re ports with regard to the public accounts committee424 maintenance of an accountability process can only be achi eved if it regularly submits report of its recommendations to t he legislature followed by governmental reply in the legislature and unless re ports are tabled the exercise is an entirely empty one consideration should be given t holding pac sessions in public broadcasts on television or on the radio as in other co untries such as in the uk 59 recommendations 1 on return to ministerial government constitutio nal and other legislative or parliamentary instruments should provide for rigoro us scrutiny of the financial and other governance of the territory through parli amentary oversight committees and for regime of strict and well publ icised adherence to their 423 see paras 252 ʹ 253 424 see paras 338

given to amending t he 2006 constitution to enable on return to ministerial government appoin tment to the public accounts committee if not all three committees of one or more ex officio members qualified and experienced to introduce fin ancial management experience into the process 543 abuse of office ʹ wide and unfettered ministerial discretion the absence of checks and balances are complemented and aggravated by the many m atters engaging public and private interests that are susceptible to discretionary determination by ministers rather than regulated by legal and clearly specified criteria 60 recommendation there is an urgent need for remo val or reduction by reference to clearly expressed criteria of ministe rial lawful or unlawful exercise of discretionary powers in many and variou s aspects of government these include inappropriate interference in and by passing of statutory administrative or policy procedures in number of areas for example 1 administration management and disposal of crown land 2 award of public works contracts and other public contracts and their fragmentation to evade open tendering requirements 3 development approval planning permission and co ntrol the grant or revocation of licences or franchises or effective g overnmentprotected monopolies the grant of exemptions waivers and di scounts of any type in particular as to stamp duty on the transfer of land and as to import duties and 4 in immigration matters including the grant of b elongerships and the grant and terms of permanent residence certificates res idence certificates and work permits 238 crown land allocation sale and management 544 i have set out at length in chapter 3425 by reference to number of objective and highly experienced experts the ills injustices and possibility for corruption of ministers their families and associates and public officials in the syst em in the tci for administration and disposal of crown land i have also set out the many ften overlapping recommendations for reform made in the fuller426 barthelterra institute427 and robinson428 reports which it would be otiose to repeat by way of summary here all of which should be given careful consideration for inclusion in the crown land bill now in preliminary draft or other new legislation regulatory or administrative forms as appro priate the crown land bill when enacted should go long way to removing many of the defects in the present system of crown land administration management and disposal both as to principle and practicality importantly it should also remove or severely reduc the possible scope for corruption and diminution at great loss to the public of its most v aluable asset but more thought needs to be given to the matters that i have listed in the foll owing recommendation 61 recommendation 1 devise as part of the proposed crown land ordina nce the essential statutory criteria for the administration management and dis posal of crown land

as recognised by the 2004 immigration review commission and by eris in 2007 the scope for abuse through intimidation of the major ity of the territ žƌǉɛ effective permanent residents by those voted

for the same reason t have it passed to any prosecutor who might follow the commission it was t he acceptance of such vulnerability and insecurity that led the 2004 immigration review commission to
