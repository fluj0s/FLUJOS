presidential succession overview and current legislation constitutional provisions and the succession act of 1792 article ii of the constitution as origin ally adopted provided the most basic building block of succession procedures stating that in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the powers and du ties of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and vice president declaring what officer shall th act as president and such officer shall act accordingly til the disab ility be removed or president shall be elected1 this language evolved during the c onstitutional convention of 1787 the two most important early drafts of the constitution neither provided for vice president nor considered succession to the presidency and it was only late in the convention proceedings that the office of vice president emerged and the language quoted above was adopted2 while the need for vice president was debated during the ratification process the stion of succession received little attention meriting only one reference in the supporting federa list papers the vicepresident may occasionally become substitute for th president in the supreme executive magistracy3 the second congress 17911793 exerci sed its constitutional authority to provide for presidential vacancy or inab ility in the succession act of 1792 1 stat 240 after examining severa l options including designa ting the secretary of

president pro tempore and the speaker could be considered officers in the sense intended by the constitution if so they were eligible to succeed if not they could not be included in the line of succession the house expressed its institutional doubts when it voted to strike this provision but the senate insisted on it and it became part of the bill enacted and signed by the president4 although the speaker and president pro tempore were thus incorporated in the line of succession they would serve only temporarily however since the act also provided for special election to fill the vacancy unless it occurre d late in the last full year of the incumbents term of office5 finally this and both ter succession acts required that designees meet the constitutional requirements of age residence and natural born citizenship presidential succession in 1841 setting precedent the first succession of vice president occurred when president william henry harrison died in 1841 vice president john tylers succession set an important precedent and settled cons titutional question debate at the constitutional convention and subsequent writing on succession indicated that the founders intended the vice president to serve as acting president in the event of presidential vacancy or disability assuming the powers and duties of the office but not actually becoming president6 tylers status was widely debated at the time but the vice president decided to take the presidential oath and considered himself to have succeeded to harrisons office as well as to his powers and duties after some discussion of the question congress implicitly ratified tylers decision by referring to him as the president of the united states7 this action set precedent for succession that subsequently prevailed and was later formally incorporated into the constitution by section 1 the 25th amendment the succession act of 1886 and the 20th amendment 1933 president james garfields death

pp 207208tempore because of partisan strife8 congress subsequen tly passed the succession act of 1886 24 stat 1 in order to insu re the line of succession and guarantee that potential successors would be of the same party as the deceased incumbent this legislation transferred succession after th vice president from the president pro tempore and the speaker to cabinet officers in the chronological order in which their departments were created pr ovided they had been duly c onfirmed by the senate and were not under impeachment by the house fu rther it eliminated the requirement for special election thus ensu ring that any future successor would serve the full balance of the presidential term this act governed succession until 1947 section 3 of the 20th amendment ratified in 1933 clarified one detail of presidential succession procedure by declarin g that if presidentelect dies before being inaugurated the vice presidentelect becomes presidentelect and is subsequently inaugurated the presidential succession act of 1947 in 1945 vice president harry s truman succeeded as president on the death of franklin d roosevelt later that year he proposed that congress revise the order of succession placing the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate in line behind the vice president and ahead of the cabinet the incumbent would serve until special ection scheduled for the next intervening congressional election filled the presidency and vice presidency for the balance of the term truman argued that it was mo re appropriate to have popular ly elected officials first in line to succeed rather than appointed cab inet officers bill incorporating the presidents proposal minus the special election provision passed the house in 1945 but action was taken in the sena during the balance of the 79th congress the president renewed his call for legislation when the 80th congress convened in 1947 and legislation was introduced in th senate the same ear debate on the senate bill centered on familiar questions whether the speaker and president pro tempore were officers in the sense intended by the constitution whether legislators were wellqualified for the chief executives position whether requiring these two to resign their congressional membership and offices before assuming the acting presidency was fair9 in the event the senate

1947 has been regularly am ended to incorporate new cabinetlevel departments into the line of successi on and remains currently in force the 25th amendment and current procedures the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedy helped set events in motion that culminated in the 25th amendment to the constitution key element in current succession procedures although vice president lyndon b johnson succeeded without incident after kennedy s death it was noted at the time that johnsons potential immediate successor h ouse speaker john w mccormack was 71 years old and senate pres ident pro tempore carl t hayden was 86 and visibly frail in addition many obs ervers believed that vice presidential vacancy for any length of time constituted dangerous gap in the nations leadership during the cold war an era of international tensi ons and the threat of nuclear war12 it was widely argued that there should be qualified vice president ready to succeed to the presidency at all times the 25th amendment providing for vice presidential vacancies and presidential disability was proposed by the 89th congress in 1965 and approved by the requisite number of states in 196713 the 25th amendment is the cornerstone of contemporary succession procedures section 1 of the amendment formalized traditional practice by declaring that the vice president shall become president if the president is removed from office dies or resigns section 2 empowered the president to nominate vice president whenever that office is vacant this nomination must be approved by simple majority of

to r eexamination of many previously longsettled elements of presidential succession and continuity of government on th federal level15 number of proposals to revise the succession act of 1947 were introduced in the 108th congress some were in the nature of housekeeping legislation that is they pr oposed to insert the office of secretary of the department of homeland security into the line of succession as has been done in the past when new cabinet departments are created by congress others proposed more complex changes in the legislati on the growth of concern over succession issues in the wake of 911 was further reflected in the fact that the senate committees on rules and administration and the judiciary held joint informational hearing on september 16 2003 and the h ouse judiciary committees subcommittee on the constitution held hearing on oct ober 6 2004 at both hearings wide range of points of view and gislative proposals was examined the question of continuity of

constitutional legitimacy there is question as to congresss constitutional ability to provide for presid ential succession this power is directly granted by article ii section 1 clause 6 as modified by the 25th amendment as noted earlier in this report what the constitution means by the word officer however has been perhaps the most durab element in the succession debate over time the succession acts of both 1792 nd 1947 assumed that the language was sufficiently broad as to include officers of congress the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives16 some observers assert that these two congressional officials are not officers in the sense intended by the constitution and that the 1792 act was and the 1947 act is constitutionally questionable attorney miller baker explained this hypothesis in his testimony before hearings held jointly by the senate committees on the judiciary committee and on rules and administration in 2003 the constitution is emphatic that members of congress are not officers of the united states the incompatibility clause of article i section 6 clause 2 provides that person holding any ffice under the united states shall be member of either house during his tinuance in office in other words members of congress by constitutional finition cannot be officers of the united states17 this point was raised in congressional debate over both the succession act of 1792 and that of 1947 in the former case opini on appears to have been divided james madison arguably the single most form ative influence on the constitution and serving representative when the 1792 act was debated held that officers of congress were not eligible to succeed other representatives who had also served as delegates to the constitutional convention we re convinced to the contrary18 i n addition political issues also contributed to the debate in 1792 fordham university law school dean john d feerick writing in from failing hands the story of presidential succession noted that the federalistdominated senate insisted on inclusion of the president pro tempore and the speaker and excluded the secretary of state largely because of its distrust of thomas jefferson who was secretary of state and leader of the antifederalists group that later emerged as the jeffersonian republican or democra tic republican party19 the constitutional legitimacy of the speaker and the president pro tempore as potential successors to the president and vice president recurred during debate on

acceptance of the 1792 act passed by the second congress which presumably had firsthand knowledge of original intent in this question was bu ttressed as an argument by the supreme courts decision in lamar v united states 20 professor howard wasserman of the fl orida international university school of law introduced another argument in support of the speakers and president pro tempores inclusion in the order of succe ssion in his testimony before the 2003 joint hearing held by the senate judiciary committee and the committee on rules and administration the succession clause of the constitution provides that congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and the vice president declaring what officer shall then act as president and such officer shall act accordingly this provision refers to officers unmodified by reference to any department or branch elsewhere the constitution refers to officers of the united states or officers under the united states or civil officers in contexts that limit the meaning of those terms only to executive branch officer s such as cabinet secretaries the issue is whether the unmodified officer of the succession clause has broader meaning on one hand it may be synonymous with the modified uses of the word elsewhere all referring solely to executive branch officials in which case the speaker and the president pro tem cannot constitutionally remain in the line of succession on the other nd the absence of modifier in the succession clause may not have been inadvertent the unmodified term may be broader and more comprehensive covering not only executivebranch officers but everyone holding position under the constitution who might be labeled an officer this includes the speaker and president pro tem which are identified in article i as officers of the house and senate respectively21 given the diversity of opinion on this stion and the continuing relevance of historical practice and debate the issue of constitutional legitimacy remains an important element of any congressional ffort to amend or supplant the succession act of 1947 democratic principle and party continuity these interrelated issues collectively comprise what might be termed the political aspect of presidential succession the first democratic prin ciple was perhaps the dominant factor contributing to the passage of the 1947 ccession act simply stated it is the assertion that presidential and vice pres idential succession should be settled first on popularly elected offici als rather than the appointed members of the cabinet as washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31761crs8 22 feerick from failing hands pp 204205 23 us president truman public papers of the presidents of the united states harry s truman 1945 washington gpo 1961 p 129 24 the president pro tempore is elected by th whole senate but this office is customarily filled only by the senator of the majority party who has served longest thus the act of election is arguably formalitythe case under the 1886 act according to feerick the 1886 acts provisions aroused criticism not long after vice president rry truman became president on the death of franklin d roosevelt22 president truman responded less than two months after succeeding to the presidency when he proposed to congress the revisions to succession procedures that when amended eventually were enacted as the succession act of 1947 the president explained his reasoning in his special message to congress on the subject of succession to the presidency by reason of the tragic death of the ter president it now lies within my power to nominate the person who would be my immediate successor in the event of my own death or inability to act i do not believe that in democracy this power should rest with the chief executive in so far as possible the office of the president should be filled by an elective officer there is officer in our system of government besides the president and vice president who has been elected by all the voters of the country the speaker of the house of representatives who is elected in his ow n district is also elected to be the presiding officer of the house by vote of all the representatives of all the people of the country as result i believe that the speaker is the official in the federal government whose selection next to that of the president and vice president can be most accurately said to stem from the people themselves23 conversely cr itics of this reasoning assert that the speaker while chosen by majority of his peers in the house has won approval by the voters only in his own congressional district further although ected by the voters in his home state the president pro tempore of the senate serves as such by virtue of being the senator of the majority party with the longest tenure24 against the case for democratic succession urged by president truman the value of party continuity is asserted by some observers the argument here is that person acting as president under these circumstances should be of the same political party as the previous incumbent in order to assure continuity of the political affiliation and presumably the policies of the candidate c hosen by the voters in the last election according to this reasoning succession by speaker or president pro tempore of different party would be re versal of the people s mandate that would be inherently undemocra tic moreover they note this possibility is not remote since passage of the succession act of 1947 the nation has experienced divided government that is control of the presid ency by one party and either or both houses of congress by another for 35 of the 57 intervening years as yale university professor akhil

assassination and sen hayden was 86 and visibly frail 28 miller baker testimony p 11 29 senior cabinet secretary or officer in this section refers to the secretary of the senior executive department

act as president the link between cabinet officers and the president preserves some measure of the last presidential elec tion the most recent popular democratic statement on the direction of the executive branch26 efficient conduct of the presidency some observers also question the potential effect on conduct of the presidency if the speaker or president pro tempore were to succeed would these persons whose duties and experience are essentially legislative have the skills necessary to serve as chief executive moreover it is noted that these offices have often been held by persons in late middle age or even old age whose health and energy levels might be limited27 as miller baker noted in his testimony before the 2003 joint committee hearings history shows that senior cabinet officers such as the secretary of state and the secretary of defense are generally more likely to be better suited to the exercise of presidential duties than legislative officers the president pro mpore traditionally the senior member of the party in control of the senate may be particularly illsuited to the exercise of presidential duties due to r easons of health and age28 conversely it can be noted that the speaker particularly has extensive executive duties both as presiding officer of the house and as facto head of the extensive structure of committees staff and physical installations that comprise the larger entity of the house of representatives moreover it can be argued that the speakership has often been held by men of great judgment and ability eg sam rayburn nicholas longworth joseph cannon and thomas reed bumping or supplantation this question centers on the 1947 succession act provision that officers actin g as president under the act do so only until the disability or failure to qualify of any officer higher in the order of succession is removed if the disability is removed the previously entitled officer can supplant bump the person then acting as president for instance assuming the death disability or failure to qualify of the pr esident vice president the speaker the president pro tempore or senior cabinet secretary29 is acting as president supplantion could take place under any one of several scenarioshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31761crs10 30 3 usc 19 b 31 3 usc 19 d3 32 howard m wasserman testimony p 8death of the president vice president speaker and president pro tempore the senior cabinet secretary is acting as president the house elects new speaker w ho upon meeting the requirements ie resigning as house member and as speaker then bumps the cabinet secretary and assumes the office of acting president the president pro tempore serving as acting president could be similarly bumped by newlyelected speaker both persons would be out of job under this scenario the president pro tempore by virtue of having resigned as member and officer of congress in order to become acting president30 and the senior cabinet secretary by virtue of the fact that under the act the taking the oath of office by cabinet secretary shall be held to constitute his resignation from the office by virtue of the hol ding of which he qualifies to act as president31 disability of the president and vice president the speaker is acting president either the president or vice president could supplant after recovering but the speaker or the president pro tempore should that officer be acting would be out of job due to the requirements noted above failure to qualify of the speaker or president pro tempore the president and vice president are di sabled or the offices are vacant the speaker and the president pro tempore decline to resign their congressional membership and ffices and the acting presidency passes to the senior cabinet officer at some point the speaker or the president pro tempore decides to claim the acting presidency resigns and bumps the serving cabinet secretary the same scenario could occur to president pro tem supplanted by the speaker critics assert that the suppl antation provisions could lead to dangerous instability in the presidency during time of national crisis imagine catastrophic attack kills the president vicepresident and congressional leadership the secretary of state assumes the duties of the presidency but whenever congress elects new speaker or president pro tem that new leader may bump the secretary of state th result would be three presidents within short span of time32 moreover as noted previously any person who becomes acting president must resign his previous position in the case of the sp eaker and president pro tempore or have his appointment vacated by the act of oath taking it is certainly foreseeable that public officials might hesitate to forfeit their offices and end their careers before taking on the acting presidency particularly if the prospect of supplantation loomedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31761crs11 33 see the republican national committee rules 2000 rule 9 the

argument for removing the sp eaker and president pro tempore from the line of succession another suggested reme dy would be to amend the succession act of 1947 to eliminate the right of prior entitled individuals to supplant an acting president who is acting due to vacancy in the office of president and vice president relatedly other proposals woul d amend the law to permit cabinet officials to take leave of absence from their departments while serving as acting president in cases of presidential and vice presidential disability they could thus return to their prior duties on recovery of either the president and vice president and their services would not be lost to the nation nor would there be the need to nominate and confirm replacement succession during presidential ca mpaigns and transitions the related issue of succession during presiden tial campaigns and during the transition period between elections and the inaugura tion has been the subject of renewed interest since the terrorist attacks of ptember 11 2001 the salient elements of this issue come into play only during elections when an incumbent president is retiring or has been defeated and the prospect of transition between administrations looms but uncertainties about succession arrangem ents during such period have been cause for concern among some observers procedures governing these eventualities depend on when vacancy would occur between nomination and election this first contingency would occur if there were vacancy in major party ticket before the presidential election this possibility has been traditionally covered by political party rules with both the democrats and republicans providing for replacement by their national committees33 for example in 1972 the democr atic party filled vacancy when vice presidential nominee senator thomas eagleton resigned at the end of july and the democratic national committee met on august 8 of that year to nominate r sargent shriver as the new vice presidential candidate between the election and the meeting of the electors the second would occur in the event of vacancy after the ection but before the electors meet to cast their votes in december this contingency has been the subject of speculation and debate some commentators suggest that the political parties employing their rules providing for the filling of presidentia l and vice

ticket then the recipients of these votes become th president and vice presidentelect notwithstanding the fact that the votes are not counted and certified until the following january 636 if so then the succession procedures of the 20th amendment noted earlier in this report would apply as soon as the elector votes were cast namely if the presidentelect dies th the vice presidentelect becomes the presidentelect this point of view receives strong suppor t from the language of the house committee report accompanying the 20th amendment addressing the question of when there is president elect the report states it will be noted that the committee uses th term president elect in its generally accepted sense as meaning the person who has received the majority of electoral votes or the person who has been chosen by the house of representatives in the event that the election is thrown into the house it is immaterial whether or not the votes have been counted for the person becomes the president elect as soon as the votes are cast37 between the electoral vote count and inauguration as noted previously the 20th amendment covers succession in the case of the presidentelect providing that in

what might happen in the ev ent of mass terrorist attack during or shortly after the presidential inaugural while there would be president vice president speaker and president pro mpore during this

not established until 1870administrations designees are usually in the midst of the confirmation process it is not impossible to envision situation in which not single cabinet officer will have been confirmed by the senate under these circumstances thus raising the prospect of facto decapitation of the executive branch this concern has led to several proposals in the 108th congress proposed legislat ion in the 108th congress successionrelated legislation introduced in the 108th congress fell into two basic categories first perfecting legislation sought to include the secretary of homeland security in the existing order of succession but did not otherwise provide major changes in the succession act of 1947 second were proposals that sought to make broader changes to the existing law revising the order of succession to include the secretary of homeland security perhaps of most immediate interest in the case of presidential succession was the establis hment in 2002 of the department of homeland security dhs the secret aries of newlycreated cabinetlevel departments are not automatically included in the order of succession this is normally accomplished by an appropriate provision in the legislation authorizing the new department39 in some instances however the secretarys inclusion has been omitted from the authorizing act but is accomplished later in perfecting legislation this omission occurred in the act establishing the dhs in the 107th congress pl 107296 which did not incorporate the secret ary of the new department in the line of presidential succession s 148 and hr 1354 these two 108th congress bills had direct purpose to include the secretary of dhs in the line of presidential succession s 148 was introduced on january 13 2003 by senator michael dewine40 and companion bill hr 1354 was introduced in the house on march 19 2003 by representative tom davis41 both bills departed from tradition however by proposing to place the secretary of homeland security in the line of succession directly following the attorney general in this position the s ecretary would have been eighth in line to succeed the president rather than 18th at the end of the order following the secretary of veterans affairs this realignment woul d have had historical significance as the four offices that would immediately pr ecede the secretary of homeland security constitute the original cabinet as tablished between 1789 and 1792 during the presidency of george washington some times referred to as the big four42httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31761crs14 43 for

include reps bair d camp chabot frost jacksonlee of texas shadegg and vitterthis departure from tradition derived fro m heightened concern over the question of continuity of government43 it was argued that the proposed placement of the dhs secretary will have at least two advantages first the department of homeland security was one of the largest and most important executive departments with many responsibilities directly affec ting the security and prepar edness of the nation both its size and crucial role are cited as arguments for placing the secretary of dhs high in the order of succession second the s ecretary of homeland security would have critically important responsib ilities in these areas and might be expected to possess the relevant knowledge and expertise that ar guably justify placing this official ahead of 10 secretaries of more senior departments par ticularly in the event an unprecedented disaster were to befall the leadership of the executive branch on the other hand the bill was open to criticism on the argument that was an exercise in undue alarmism and that pl acing the secretary of homeland security ahead of the secretaries of more seni or departments might set questionable precedent by seeming to elevate the offi ce to sort of super cabinet level that would arguably be inconsiste nt with its legal status s 148 was the apparent choice for bicam eral action for these companion bills introduced on january 13 2003 and passed the senate on june 27 2003 without amendment by unanimous consent it wa s later received in the house and referred to subcommittee on the constitution of th house judiciary committee hr 1354 was referred to the same house committee and subcommittee but subsequent action was taken on either bill during the 108th congress revisiting the succession act of 1947 several other bills introduced in the 108th congress called for substantive chan ges in the order of succession beyond the vice president some of the concer ns expressed by critic s of the 1947 act were reflected in these proposals which are liste d by chamber and in order of introduction and are examined below hr 2319 this bill introduced on june 4 2003 by re presentative christopher cox and others44 sought to place the secretary of dhs in the order of succession after the attorney general section 2 of hr 2319 went beyond s 148 and hr 1354 in several aspects first it clarified existing language in the 1947 act by changing the language concerning refe rring to succession from the speaker of the house of representatives and the preside nt pro tempore of the senate to the person holding the office of speaker of the house of representatives at the time such event inability or failure occurs and the person holding the office of president pro tempore at such time second it sought to amend 3 usc 19 d2 to remove the requirement that cabinet officer acting as president w ould be bumped or supplanted by ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31761crs15 45 see above at p 4 46 this assumption is grounded in the trad ition that presidents almost always c hoose members or supporters of their own political party for cabinet positions there have been exceptions to this practice fo r instance secretary of transportation norman mineta served as democratic representative in the 94th through 104th congresses 19751996 and as secretary of commerce in the clinton administration 20002001qualified and prior entitled official45 except in cases in which the person is acting as president due to the inability of the pres ident or vice president in other words cabinet officer acting as president would not be displaced by newly qualified speaker of the house or newly qualified president pro tempore if however the officers service is based on the inability of the president or vice president then the officer would be superseded by the removal of the disability of the president or vice president this provision addressed several of the issues cited earlier in this report that have been noted by critics of the successi on act of 1947 first by eliminating the displacement of cabinet officer acting as president except in cases of presidential or vice presidential inability it would remove potential source of instability once installed as acting president the cabinet officer would remain in this position for the balance of the presidential term unless as noted above the officer is acting due to the presumably temporary inability of the pr esident or vice president further under these circumstances it would almost certainly remove the possibility of president and vice president being succeeded by an actin g president of different party which has proved to be an issue of continuing concern since passage of the succession act of 194746 finally it would confer the actin g presidency on person whose most recent assignment has been executive and managerial rather than legislative this would some suggest provide presumably experienced executive who would act as president on the other hand some might argue that continuing cabinet officer as acting president after speaker or president pro tempore had qualified would violate the original intention of the succession act which was to ensure that elected rather than appointed officers would succeed to the presidency it can be further argued that experience as member of either house of congress and service as speaker or president pro tempore would not necessarily be inconsistent with executive experience and ability section 3 proposed to change the curre nt provisions of 3 usc 19d3 which specify that any cabinet officer who acts as president automatically resigns from the cabinet upon taking the presidential oath of office instead such officers would not automatically resign if they were acting due in whole or in part to the inability of the president or the vice pr esident this would obviate the automatic resignation of individuals serving during temporary incapacity of the president or vice president and permit cabinet offi cer serving under such circumstances to return to the cabinet section 4 was technical adjustment to 3 usc 19e which sought to clarify the succession act by requiring that cabinet officers in order to be eligible to succeed must have been confirmed in th eir position with the advice and consent of the senate thus

2003 by represen tative brad sherman and others47 would have constituted major change in provisi ons relating to presidential succession it sought to empower the president to choos an officer among sp ecified congressional leadership positions who would be designated to succeed in case of simultaneous vacancies disqualifications or inability in the offices of president and vice president this would have had the effect of eliminating the possibility that president and vice president would be succeeded by congressional leaders of different party than their own at the same time the bill would have continued the tradition established by the succession act of 1947 that elected rather than appointed officials ie the cabinet would continue to be first in line to succeed following the vice president under the bills provisions the presiden t was to submit to the clerk of the house of representatives his choice of either the office of the speaker or the office of the minority leader as designated pr imary office of succession similarly the president would submit to the secretary of the senate his designation of the office of majority or minority leader of the nate as the secondary successor under the act thus the president would have the option of choosing member of his own political party as his potential successo r under such circumstances this section of the bill dealing with the senate contained further significant change from existing procedures in that it sought to establish the person holding the office of majority or minority leader of the senate rather than the president pro tempore of the senate as secondary successo r the intention here was arguably that this change would place younger and perhaps more vigorous senator of the presidents party in line of succession rath er than the president pro tempore who is customarily the senior senator of the majority party in common with the bills houserelated provisions it w ould also have ensured that the president and vice president would be succeeded temporarily or permanently depending on conditions by member of the political party of thei r choosing this would safeguard party continuity in the presidency but would not assure it since president would be free to choose from among both parties it is arguable that president might choose house or senate officer from party ot her than his own as demonstration of bipartisanship question could be raised however as to the constitutional status of the house minority leader and the majority and minor ity leaders of the senate are these officials officers of

earlier in this report under constitutional legitimacy 49 the question of failure to qualify relates generally to the presidential election process in theory it could mean that neither of the pe rsons

residence in the united states but this contingency is extremely likely the more likely but still remote situation would be in the event neither candidate wins majority of electoral votes and that the house and senate are unable to assemble th majority of votes needed in the contingent election process to choose either president or vice president between the time they meet to count electoral votes

of the presidential term unle ss they were founded on the disability or failure to qualify of pr esident or vice president in case of the former then the acting president would serv only until the disability of the president or vice president was removed in case of the latter contingency he would serve until president or vice president qualifies49 hr 2479 was referred to the hous judiciary

respectively by representative brad sherman on ptember 14 2004 and senators john cornyn and trent lott on february 12 2004 addre ssed the desirability from the standpoint of continuity of government of having the officers comprising presidentelects line of succession confirmed and in place by the time of the inauguration they recommended that president whose term is coming to an end and who will not succeed himself should submit his successo rs nominations for offices that fall within the line of succession to the senate for its consideration before his term ends they further recommended that the confir mation process for such officers should be completed by the senate insofar as possi ble between january 3 the date on which the new congress assembles unless otherwise arranged and january 20 the date on which the incumbent presidents term ends finally they urged the incumbent president to sign and deliver commissions for those officers whose nominations have been approved on january 20

day and january 20 of the following year when the newlyelected president actually assumes office alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31761crs18 during this period incumbent presidents cabinet officers traditionally submit their resignations generally effective on inaugura tion day although investigations of and hearings on cabinet nominees for an in coming administration are often under way before the changeover official nominati ons by new president and subsequent advice and consent by the senate cannot occur until af ter the new president has assumed office frequently this process c ontinues for some weeks or longer in the case of controversial or contested nomina tions so that the full cabinet may not be sworn until well after the inauguration representative sherma n senators cornyn and lott and other observers viewed this gap particularly in the confirmation and swearingin of cabinet officers included in the line of succession as threat to continuity in both the presidency and in executive branch management one advantage conferred by this proposal was that cabinet secretaries unlike elected officials do not serve set terms of office which expire on date certain if the level of interpersonal and bipartisan cooperation envisaged in the resolution could be attained an incoming president might assume office on january 20 with full cabinet already sworn and in stalled thus reducing the pot ential for disruption of the executive branch by terrorist attack the process recommended by hres 775 and sconres 89 had the additional advantage of being able to be implemented without legislation or constitutional amendment had they been passed they would make it more likely that every incoming president would have cabinet nominated vetted and sworn on january 20 in addition to th national securityre lated advantage this would confer it would arguably provide an impetus to streamlining the sometimes lengthy and contentious transition and ppointments process faced by all incoming administrations it would also however face substantial obstacles it would require high levels of good will nd cooperation between incumbent presidents and their successors moreover it

not more specific in his testimony it could be argued that these officers might be inserted after the big four ie the secretaries of state the treasury and defense the attorney general and possibly the secretary of ho meland security should that officer be included at that place as proposed in pending legislation miller baker offered other proposals dur ing his testimony at the september 2003 hearings all of which would requi re amending the succession act of 1947 under one the president would be empower ed to name an unspecified number of state governors as potential successors the constitutional mechanism here would be the presidents ability to call state militias the national guard into federal service53 fortier argues that by virtue of their positions as commandersinchief of their state contingents of the nationa l guard governors could in effect be transformed into federal officers by the federalization of the guard54 second proposal by fortier would am end the succession act to establish series of assistant vice presidents nominated by the president and subject to approval by advice and consen t of the senate these fficers would be included in the order of succession at an appropriate place they would be classic standby equipment their primary func tion would be to be inform ed prepared and physically safe ready to serve as acting pr esident should that

his testimony be fore the september 2003 joint senate committee hearings he suggested that presidential candidates should announce their choices for this office durin g the presidential campaign this would presumably enhance the electoral legitimacy of the assistant vice president as voters would be fully aware of the candidates c hoices for this potentially important office and include this in their voting decisions56 further variant was offered by howa rd wasserman during his joint senate committee hearing testimony he suggested establishment of the cabinet office of first secretary

requirement that successors be officers of the united states empowering the president to nominate potential successors beyond the cabinet subject to advice and consent by the senate such an amendment he argues would eliminate any doubts about placing state governors in th line of succession and could provide for succession to the presidency itself s opposed to the acting presidency58 fortier envisions that these persons would be emin ently qualified to serve as examples he suggested that president george w bu sh might nominate former president george hw bush and former vice pres ident dan quayle both of whom longer live in washington to serve in the line of succession similarly future democratic president might nominate former vice pres idents gore and walter mondale to serve in the statutory line of succession59 concluding observations seemingly longsettled legislative nd constitutional question the issue of presidential and vice presidential succession in the united states has gained degree of urgency following the events of september 11 2001 old issues have been revisited and new questions have been asked in light of concerns over potentially disastrous decapitation of the us government as the result of terrorist attack possibly by use of weapons of mass destruction the 108th congress did not act to insert the office of secretary of homeland security into the current line of succession major revisions to current ccession legislation are less likely in the short run although the foundations for futu re consideration were laid by the 2003 senate and 2004 house
