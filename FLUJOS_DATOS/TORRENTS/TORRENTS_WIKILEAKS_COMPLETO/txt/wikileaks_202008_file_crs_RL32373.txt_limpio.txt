updated march 8 2005 robert l bamberger specialist in energy policy resources sciences and industry division congressional research service the library of congress abandoned mine land fund reauthorization selected issues summary the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra pl 9587 enacted in 1977 established reclamation standards for all coal surface mining operations and for the surface effects of underground mining it also established the abandoned mine land aml program to promote the reclamation of sites mined and abandoned prior to the enactment of smcra to finance reclamation of abandoned mine sites the legislation established fees on coal production these collections are divided into federal and state shares subject to annual appropriation aml funds are distributed annually to states with approved reclamation programs since the programs inception and through fy2004 collections have totaled 71 billion appropriations from the fund have totaled 55 billion the unappropriated balance in the fund approached 17 billion at the end of fy2004 as of the end of fy2004 roughly 11 billion of this sum is credited to the state share accounts of which nearly 430 million alone is in wyomings account because even though most of the sites awaiting cleanup are in the eastern part of the nation coal production has shifted westward consequently the western states have been making significantly larger contributions to the fund in recent years authorization for collection of aml fees was scheduled to expire at the end of fy2004 and was extended nine months to the end of june 2005 by the consolidated appropriations act for 2005 pl 108447 while congress continued to debate changes to the program number of bills were introduced during the 108th congress to reauthorize fee collections and make changes to the program that would address concerns about the mechanics of the program the fee structure and the unappropriated balances bush administration proposal s 2049hr 3778 proposed to refund through significant increase in appropriations unobligated state balances over 10year period these balances would be returned to states and indian tribes that had completed reclamation of their priority 1 sites these states would longer receive grants from the aml fund itself freeing up funds to be targeted to states with sites awaiting cleanup house and senate legislation hr 3796 and s 2086 differed greatly in some respects from the administration proposal these bills would have maintained the distinction between state and federal shares and would have required that 50 of annual contributions be returned to states even if cleanup of priority abandoned mine sites had been completed states and tribes would have been allowed to use the money for other purposes if cleanup of aml sites had been completed the house senate and administration proposals were in agreement to end an allocation of portion of aml collections to the rural abandoned mine land program program that has received appropriation since fy1995 the fy2006 budget submitted by the administration is essentially the same as the plan proposed for fy2005 with the exception that the fees based on coal production would not be lowered in the fy2006 request as of midmarch legislation had been introduced this report will be updated as developments warrant

mining operations and for the surface effects of underground mining it also established the abandoned mine land aml program to promote the reclamation of sites mined and abandoned prior to the enactment of smcra to finance reclamation of abandoned mine sites the legislation established fees on coal production which are deposited in an aml fund administered by the department of the interior doi office of surface mining osm authorization to collect these fees was scheduled to expire on september 30 2004 but the 108th congress was unable to reach any agreement among number of proposals to make some changes to the mechanics of the program the fee structure and distribution of the unappropriated balances authorization to collect aml fees was extended for brief time nine months to the end of june 2005 by the consolidated appropriations act for 2005 pl 108 447 debate over legislation to extend authorization further into the future and to make other adjustments to the program is almost certain to continue in the 109th congress to set the stage for that debate this report summarizes the current structure of the aml program and fund distribution and reviews some of the major proposals considered in the 108th congress as of midmarch legislation had been introduced in the 109th congress in its fy2006 budget submission for osm the bush administration once again proposed changes in the aml program that were proposed with the fy2005 budget the fy2006 proposal does not include lowering of the aml fees that was part of the plan introduced with the fy2005 budget on february 2 2004 in company with the administration budget request for the department of the interior doi the department released reauthorization proposal that would have made changes in the collection of fees for and disbursement of grant monies from the aml fund prominent among the provisions was phased reduction in the aml fees assessed on coal production under the administration plan unobligated balances that have accumulated in individual state share accounts would be returned over 10year period this proposal and other changes sought by the administration requiring congressional action to implement are intended to address number of longstanding complaints about the formulas that are applied to the fees and the calculation of grants disbursements full initial implementation of the administration proposal introduced in the 108th congress as hr 3778s 2049 would have required substantial increase in the fy2005 aml appropriation from 1906 million in fy2004 to 2439 million an increase of 533 million the fy2006 budget crs2 proposes comparable increase of 58 million over the final appropriation for fy2005 of 1882 million1 there are number of issues for congress in the disposition of the reauthorization prominent issue raised by the administration proposal was whether the changes proposed by the administration would leave the fund with adequate resources over time to meet all the funds obligations the united mine workers combined benefit fund cbf which provides health care benefits to retired miners is also dependent upon transfers from the aml fund meeting the expenses of the cbf has been one of the most important issues in the debate second issue concerns the geographic balance between collections and disbursements as coal production has moved westward western states have been paying larger sums into the aml fund while grants distribution has favored eastern states that have larger number of priority sites to be reclaimed at issue too will be how the return of unobligated state share balances should be funded the administration approach to program reform would finance the return through higher appropriation from the aml fund at time of growing concern over federal spending competing approach in the 108th congress hr 3796 would have partly financed the return of these balances with proceeds from federal coal leasing that bill and one in the senate s 2086 would have also among other provisions provided for the return to states of greater portion of current fee collections grants distribution the current structure collections for the aml fund are divided into federal and state shares subject to annual appropriation aml funds are distributed annually to states with approved reclamation programs2 since the programs inception and through fy2004 collec tions have totaled 71 billion appropriations from the fund have totaled 55 billion the unappropriated balance in the fund approached 17 billion at the end of fy2004 of this figure the federal share represents roughly 620 million and the unobligated balances in state share accounts approaches 11 billion3 osm which runs the program has estimated that it will require roughly 3 billion to address the remaining highpriority sites4 the design and purpose of the aml fund has raised some significant issues some of which are common to trust funds in general the aml program touches 1 consolidated appropriations act of 2005 pl 108480 summary of the fy2006 appropriation and aml distribution appears in tables 1 and 2 at the end of this report 2 twentythree states and three indian tribes received reclamation grants during fy2003 3 current figures are available from the osm website see httpwwwosmregov fundstathtm 4 see for example statement of jeffrey d jarrett director office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement us department of the interior before the house committee on resources subcommittee on energy and mineral resources us house of representatives on hr 3778 and hr 3796 march 30 2004 available at httpwwwosmregovreports033004statementtxt crs3 upon longheld state concerns about levying fees on residents or businesses operating in one state to remedy nationwide problems albeit for the common good but which dot the landscape disproportionately among the several states the allocation and distribution of aml collections are designed to preserve rough equity given the anomaly that the states with the greatest inventory of priority aml sites are longer among the largest coal producers but not all states have been comfortable with the distribution nor are they sanguine about the level of annual congressional appropriations from the fund from the inception of the program the fund has had unappropriated balances this places the aml fund in company with other trust funds held by the federal government such as the highway trust and land and water conservation funds in which some states eyeing the unappropriated balances believe their citizens and businesses operating within their borders pay more into the fund than the state receives in benefits to finance reclamation of abandoned mine sites smcra established fee on coal production that is paid by coal producers into an abandoned mine land recla mation trust fund5 smcra authorized collection of aml fees through the end of 1992 the energy policy act of 1992 epact pl 102486 extended the aml authorization through the end of fy2004 in between the passage of those two bills the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra pl 101508 had extended authority for aml collections through fy1995 additionally obra authorized the osm to invest the unappropriated balance of aml funds in us treasury securities the investment interest is deposited in the aml fund however epact authorized transfer of up to 70 million annually of this interest income beginning in fy1996 to the united mine workers of america umw to help pay the health benefits of retired miners in recent years low interest rates have generated less money to be transferred to the umwa combined benefits fund cbf6 smcra also provided that 50 of aml collections would be allocated to the states this is generally referred to as the state share of aml fees the balance of the collections is under the control of the secretary of the interior and is generally referred to as the federal share as amended by pl 101508 40 of this federal share or 20 of the whole of aml collections is designated for 1 emergency projects in states and on tribal lands 2 projects in states and on tribal lands without approved reclamation plans 3 the small operator assistance program soap and 4 federal administrative costs twenty percent or 10 percent of total aml collections is set aside to be transferred to the department of agriculture for its rural abandoned mine program ramp7 the ramp program has had 5 the current schedule is 35ton of coal produced by surface mining 15ton of coal produced by underground mining and 10ton of mined lignite 6 appropriation is required for this transfer 7 ramp was designed to restore agricultural land that had been disturbed by strip mining while entitled by smcra to onefifth of aml collection the program had been receiving significantly less 10 million in the years before appropriations to the program ceased after fy1995 there have been repeated attempts to abolish ramp critics claimed it was continued crs4 appropriation since fy2005 and has an unappropriated balance of slightly more than 300 million which under the current structure of the aml program is not available for grants distribution house senate and administration proposals in the 108th congress were in agreement that the allocation to ramp should end however there were differences among the proposals on disposition of the ramp balances an additional earmark is made for the appalachian clean streams initiative acsi the acsi program was initiated in fy1994 to clean up and restore streams damaged by acid mine drainage largely the result of past coal mining the remaining 40 of the federal half of total aml collections constitutes pool from which supplemental grants may be awarded to the states for remedy of priority 1 and 2 sites8 based upon historic coal production congress annually appropriates money from the aml fund osm then calcu lates the distribution to each eligible state and indian tribe from its shares of state and federal apportionments of aml collections annual distributions are paid from both shares the formula is complex and applies differently to the state and federal share of aml collections9 while the draw from the pool of aml revenues allocated to individual state shares is fairly straightforward and proportional more complex adjustments affect the proportionality of the final distribution paid from the federal share this makes it difficult to measure direct transfer of wealth among individual states calculation of the distribution of grants to state from its share of aml collections is based on the states share of previously collected but yet undistributed aml fees the distribution to state from the federal share is based on 1 states coal production prior to 1978 before enactment of smcra that established the aml fund and 2 adjustments to the distribution made on behalf of minimum program states to bring their grants up to designated minimum level of funding for reclamation minimum program states are states with relatively low annual coal production for these states smcra was amended in 1990 to authorize appropriations for the reclamation of the most dangerous sites socalled priority 1 and 2 sites listed in the aml inventory at the lesser of 1 the estimated cost to reclaim those sites or 2 7 continued duplicative and that sites subject to regular aml grants were higher priority more than 300 million of the total unappropriated balance has been allocated to ramp see archived crs report 95706 enr the rural abandoned mine program fact sheet by duane thompson june 12 1995 8 smcra defines priority 1 sites as those warranting the protection of public health safety general welfare and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices priority 2 sites are similarly defined with the exception that the adverse effects do not pose extreme danger as with priority 1 sites sec 403a of smcra 30 usc 1233 9 table 2 shows the breakdown in the distributions from the federal and state share accounts crs5 minimum program level of 20 million per state prior to that appropriations had provided 15 million annually to minimum program states these minimum program levels however remain subject to annual appropria tions by the congress congress may appropriate all or less than the 20 million currently authorized for fy1995 congress provided minimum program appropriation to 15 million and it has remained there into fy2004 as noted above the energy policy act of 1992 provided that payments of up to 70 million referred to as the cap from interest earned annually on aml funds would be transferred to the retired miners health benefits fund the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund cbf this fund pays the premiums of retirees who worked for companies that went bankrupt or which longer exist prior to 1992 expenses of the cbf were less than the annual interest generated by the aml fund leaving interest balances that have been transferred as needed in subsequent years when cbf expenses exceeded the annual interest generated transfers of roughly 680 million have been made to the cbf as of the end of march 200410 major features of the administration proposal and competing proposals 108th congress as of early march 2005 legislation reauthorizing aml collections had not been introduced in the 109th congress but the fy2006 budget request indicates that the administration will seek most of the changes proposed in the administration proposal introduced in the 108th congress s 2049hr 3778 it was intended to address the major concerns outlined above the administration plan would have extended the program through fy2018 reduced the aml fee assessed on each ton of coal produced by 15 during the period fy2005fy2009 and by 25 from fy2010 until the expiration of the reauthorization in fy2018 the fy2006 budget request does not include lowering of the fees from current levels returned unobligated state share balances over 10year period to states that have been certified to have completed reclamation of their priority 1 sites these states would longer receive aml grants from the remaining unappropriated balances in the fund or from new collections noncertified states would have their state share balances 10 office of surface mining the energy policy act of 1992 provided that the unobligated balances would begin to earn interest in fy1993 however transfers did not begin until fy1996 so as not to violate deficitcontrol

5054 crs6 returned to them as part of their annual grants for reclamation activities11 ended the division and assignment of fee collections into state and federal shares all future aml collections would be deposited in single account removed the 70 million cap on the amount of interest to be transferred annually to the united mine workers combined benefits fund and make other changes to provide the cbf with 310 million over the next few years provided minimum program states with 2 million each annually the fy2006 budget request seeks 15 million for minimum program states the level at which congress has set this appropriation since fy1995 and ended the reservation of aml funds for the rural abandoned mine land program which is under the jurisdiction of the department of agriculture and which has received appropriation since 1995 the cessation of assigning aml collections to state share is one of the most interesting features of the administration proposal this assignment has been responsible for one of the greatest pressures on osm the creation of the separate state and federal funds was more an accounting convenience than intended to be literal however states have been displeased with the accumulating unobligated balances in their state share accounts and regard these balances as state money to which they are entitled certain states have special interest in how this particular issue is resolved as shown in table 3 more than half of the nearly 1 billion in unobligated state share balances is held in the accounts of wyoming west virginia and kentucky12 the administration proposed to return the state share balances over 10year period and has requested in the fy2005 budget an additional 53 million to begin disbursement of the unobligated state share balances in fy2005 this figure is 58 million in the fy2006 request under the administration plan states that have been certified would receive only the disbursement from their unobligated state share balances they would 11 section 1240a provides for states to apply for certification that they have completed reclamation of high priority sites however under the administration proposal certified states would only receive return of unobligated balances in the state share account non certified states would receive both return of state share balances and reclamation grants from the federal portion of the aml fund creating disincentive to apply for certification the administration proposal would allow the department of the interior to initiate certification without waiting for states to make application at present louisiana wyoming montana texas and the hopi and navajo tribes are certified 12 montana has completed reclamation of all 18 of its priority 1 and 2 sites in contrast kentucky has reclaimed 253 of 640 priority 1 and 2 sites and west virginia has reclaimed 323 of 1069 such sites source office of surface mining abandoned mine land inventory system amlis httpwwwosmregovamlinvenzintroinhtm crs7 receive further grants from the aml fund by seeking an additional appropriation for returning state share balances and assuming that the appropriation for grants from the aml fund remains around current levels the administration has argued that it will free up more grant resources to be awarded to those states with the most sites awaiting reclamation further benefit the administration argues is that cleanup of these sites will be completed decades sooner13 grants to states and tribes still with highpriority sites would be drawn first on the state share account until the state share accounts for these states were also exhausted under the administration proposal unobligated state balances would be largely divorced from osm and current aml mechanics all future collections would go into single account eliminating the state share designation altogether and ending any further accumulation of unobligated balances in the state share by predicating return of these balances to straightforward appropriation determined by congress it would also eliminate the argument that osm and the current formula for grant distribution drawn on both federal and state share balances are the bottleneck for return of these funds the unobligated balances in the state aml fund account have especially nettled some states as coal production has shifted west of the mississippi contributions to the aml fund have been increasingly borne by western states in 1950 nearly 525 million tons of coal were mined in the eastern portion of the country while western production was roughly 36 million tons by 2003 western coal production was roughly 550 million tons while production in the east had declined moderately to 376 million tons14 however the prospects for approval of the sort of significant increase in appropriated funds for this purpose sought in the fy2005 request and again in the fy2006 request are unclear in climate of renewed concern over federal spending and borrowing it is possible that if the essential features of the reauthorization plan proposed by the administration were enacted the calendar for return of state share monies could be lengthened or even deferred while disbursement of aml grants has always been dependent upon congressional appropriation the congressional role in the aml program could have even more visibility if reimbursement of unobligated state balances is tied to congressional appropriation as well competing proposal s 2086 introduced by senator thomas in the 108th congress differed from the administration proposal in some important respects that bill would have extended the program through fy2014 reduced reclamation fees in single stage to 25ton of surface mined coal 12ton for underground mined coal and 08ton for lignite 13 summary sheet from doi abandoned mine land aml reclamation program extension and reform act of 2004 feb 2 2004 14 energy information administration annual coal report 2003 crs8 preserved the distinction between state and federal shares requiring that 50 of state contributions be returned to states even if cleanup of abandoned mine sites had been completed based grants on current rather than historic coal production reflecting the shift of production westward allowed transfer to the cbf of all interest generated by the aml fund prior to fy2005 if needed to cover health care costs of unassigned beneficiaries funded the difference from land lease revenues paid to the treasury under the mineral leasing act to the extent that grants to certified states and tribes from the aml appropriation fall short of the state share allocation of collections the transfer would not have been subject to appropriations and states and tribes could have used the money for other purposes if cleanup of aml sites had been completed and ended the reservation of aml funds for the rural abandoned mine land program ramp and released 65 million of the current ramp balance to pay for the return of unobligated state share balances to certified states and tribes that have lands available for leasing grants would have been proportional to states or tribes unappropriated state share balance the thomas proposal would have reduced the fee assessed on surfacemined coal by nearly 30 significantly larger reduction than in the other proposals thus changing the historic relationship between the fees assessed on the different categories of coal production to more or less equalize collections from the eastern and western coalproducing states the original fee structure may have been structured to reflect that western coal was generally surfacemined while eastern coal was largely produced from underground mines now that production has shifted westward proponents of s 2086 argued that the fee relationship between the various types of coalmining should be adjusted whatever fee structure is settled upon will doubt be reflection of regional considerations as well as the size of the fee collections that majority of policymakers favor whether for the purpose of making reclamation grants or meeting the needs of the cbf in the house hr 3796 introduced by representatives cubin and rahall was very similar to s 2086 with some differences among these hr 3796 would have extended the program through fy2019 reduced reclamation fees in single stage to 28ton of surface mined coal 12ton for underground mined coal and 08ton for lignite and crs9 ended the allocation of any aml collections to ramp and made the money available for transfer to the cbf15 the combined benefit fund the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 the coal act enacted as part of the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 epact established the united mine

comprise category of unassigned beneficiaries premiums for assigned retirees are paid by former employers or entities to which these individuals have been assigned epact provided that the expenses of the unassigned beneficiaries would be supported by interest generated by the unobligated balances in the aml fund capping annual transfers at 70 million while the fund began to earn interest in fy1993 transfers to the cbf did not begin until fy1996 so as not to violate deficitcontrol measures included in the budget enforcement act of 1990 provisions of pl 10150816 there are roughly 17000 unassigned beneficiaries assuring that there are sufficient funds to meet the expenses of the cbf is major consideration in the aml reauthorization debate while the cbf ran surpluses in its early years it began to run deficits in fy1997 interest generated prior to 1996 was transferred to the cbf by the interior appropriations acts for fy2000 and fy2001 low interest rates in recent years have reduced transfers to the cbf the clinton administration established trial medicare drug prescription program to provide reimbursement to the cbf for drug expenses in january 2004 the bush administration announced that the program set to expire in june 2004 would be extended through the end of fy2005 the united mine workers of america estimated that the extension would increase the cbfs medicare reimbursement by 190 million17 as noted earlier the administration also proposed to remove the 70 million cap on the amount of aml interest that can be transferred annually and estimated that between the removal of this cap and extension of the medicare drug program the cbf could be provided with 310 million over the 15 in this respect hr 3796 incorporated the language of hr 313 the coal accountability and retired employee act for the 21st century generally referred to as care21 introduced by representative rahall on january 8 2003 it was reported from the house committee on resources

projected that the drug program and other provisions of its aml reauthorization would provide 310 million to the cbf during the next two years crs10 next few years s 2086 would have provided for the transfer of any interest earned prior to fy2005 if needed to cover the costs of benefits for unassigned beneficiaries while the umwa has been favorably disposed toward some features of the aml reauthorization advanced by the administration the union supported provisions in hr 3796 that would have in addition to the transfer of interest earned by the aml fund allowed transfers to be used to cover any deficit in the expenses of the cbf for coverage of assigned beneficiaries as well18 epact also provides that in the event that authorization for collection of aml fees expires the fee shall be established at rate to continue to provide for the deposit of funds to the cbf it is not apparent by what mechanism that fee would be determined or how it is to be designed to meet the needs of the cbf19 whatever resolution is reached on aml reauthorization treatment of the cbf is likely to be major piece in the negotiations and debate conclusion dissatisfaction with the aml program has coalesced around perceptions that the current structure has not been evenhanded in the distribution of aml collections as noted earlier the distribution formulas make it difficult to measure direct transfer of wealth among individual states while it is impossible to predict the outcome of this debate opponents of the proposal advanced by the administration seem intent on making annual distributions more predictable particularly with respect to treatment of the balances in the state share accounts some of the competing proposals by establishing component of distribution outside of regular appropriations would isolate some grant elements from what states consider to be the vagaries of the current aml structure in part this may be due to continuing skepticism about the likelihood that congress will raise aml appropriations sufficiently to institute the administrations proposed 10year return of the unobligated state balances however it may be equally possible that congress will not be inclined to free up the ramp balance to the aml program or the mineral leasing revenues resolution of number of issues affecting provisions for the cbf could prove to have major influence on any final resolution of the broader aml reauthorization as noted earlier if congress and the administration do not reach some compromise before the authority for aml collections expire once again at the end of june 2005 statute provides for the establishment of fee expressly to provide for maintaining 18 see news from the united mine workers of america united mine workers of america international

this and other dimensions and complexities of the issues concerning the combined benefits fund are beyond the scope of this report crs11 transfer of funds to the cbf in the event of this scenario congress could continue or suspend disbursements from the aml fund through the appropriation process depending upon how statute is interpreted or upon the duration of the time collections are
