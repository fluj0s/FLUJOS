department of transportation and related agencies act 2000 pl 10669 the act provided 502 billion for the department of transportation dot dot had requested funding similar to the level enacted in pl 10669 however the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act pl 106113 calls for an acrosstheboard rescission of 038 from each agencys discretionary budget authority and obligation limits this will result in reduction of approximately 179 million from the level enacted in pl 10669 the federal highway administration 1053 million the airport improvement program 544 million the federal transit administration 176 million and the coast guard 16 million together absorb all but about 05 million of the dot reductions even with the rescission the amount provided represents nearly 6 increase over the fy1999 enacted level reflecting the continuing impact of the transporta tion equity act for the 21st century tea21 both the federal highway administration fhwa and the federal transit administration fta received increases of 7 above fy1999 enacted levels the federal aviation administration faa received more modest increase of just under 3 the fy2000 act funds the entire faa budget out of the airport and airway trust fund historically significant portion of the faa operations budget has been provided from general fund revenues much of the debate over the departments budget focused on allocating resources raised by user fees and deposited in specific transportation trust funds debate arose between those in favor of unified budget vs those seeking to protect individual programs either by taking them off budget or using fiscal boundaries or firewalls to ensure minimum level of financing this policy of creating discretionary spending guarantees originated with the provisions of the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 legislation that placed firewalls around certain categories of the federal highway administrations programs the house version of the federal aviation administration faa reauthorization bill hr 1000 proposes also changing the budgetary treatment of the airport and airway trust fund by taking the fund off budget for the highway trust fund tea21 provided for the disposition of actual receipts above those forecast and authorized the revenue aligned budget authority raba provisions require additional trust fund receipts to be redistributed to individual states based on the formula used to apportion highway dollars the enacted version of hr 2084 narrows the scope of raba distribution to certain core highway programs thereby

of transportation and related agencies most recent developments the president signed the department of transportation and related agencies act 2000 pl 10669 hereafter referred to as the fy2000 act on october 9 1999 the act provided 502 billion for the department of transportation dot however the fy2000 consolidated appropriations act pl 106113 mandates government wide resci ssion equal to 038 of discretionary budget authority provided or obligation limits imposed for all government departments approximately 179 million will be cut from the dot funding levels provided for in pl 10669 the largest reductions are faced by the federal highway administration 1053 million the airpor t improvement program 544 million the federal transit administration 176 million and the coast guard 16 million even accounting for the rescission the final funding level represents nearly 6 increase over the appropriations level of the fy1999 act the transportation appropriations framework transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget it is also considered part of the discretionary budget funding for the dot budget is derived from number of sources the majority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds the remainder of dot funding is from federal treasury general funds the transportation trust funds include the highway trust fund the transit account of the highway trust fund the airport and airway trust fund and the inland waterways trust fund all of these accounts derive their respective funding from specific excise and other taxes together highway and transit funding constitutes the largest component of dot appropriati ons and can account for 60 to 70 of total federal transportation spending in any given year most highway and the majority of transit programs are funded with contract authority derived by the link to the highway trust fund this is very significant from budgeting standpoint contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc authorized funds are automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legislation appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30208crs2 where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation that is the authority to spend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to obligate funds for these programs is also in place prior to the fy1999 appropria tions act changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcon tract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control outlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements the authority to set limitation on obligations for contract authority programs gave appropriators considerable leeway in allocating funds between the various federal transportation activities in function 400 which includes agencies such as the coast guard and the federal aviation administration in addition the inclusion of the highway and transit programs and their trust fund generated revenue streams in the discretionary budget provided appropriators with additional flexibility as part of the annual process by which available funds were allocated amongst the 13 standing appropriations subcommittees in the house and the senate changes in transportation appropriations as result of tea21 tea21 changed this budgetary procedure in two ways first it created new budget categories and second it set statutory limitations on obligations the act amends the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highway and mass transit the act further amends the budget process by creating statutory level for the limitation on obligations in each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy2003 in addition tea21 provides mechanism to adjust these amounts in the highway account but not the transit account to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in the highway generated revenues see revenue aligned budget authority raba under key policy issues the net effect of the creation of these budget categories is predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee these categories are separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the use of funds assigned to these categories for any other purpose these so called firewalls are viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor minimum levels of funding for highway and transit programs additional funds above the firewall level can be made available for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process tea21 changes the role of the house and senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs the appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obligations in addition it appears that the house appropriations committee is precluded at least in part from exercising what some members view as their traditional option of changing spending levels for any program or project the tea21 firewalls appear to diminish the flexibility of the committees on appropriations to meet the goals of the annual budget process because they can onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30208crs3 adjust the dot agencyprogram budgets outside the firewalls hence any reduction in spending for function 400 must be allocated to these agenciesprograms this has raised special concern for supporters of the faa the coast guard and amtrak which are the largest dot functions without firewall protection see the key policy issues section for further amplification on june 15 1999 the house completed action on hr 1000 the aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century air21 hr 1000 contains provisions that take the aviation trust fund off budget off budget differs from firewalls and would give the trust fund status similar to the social security trust fund as far as the annual budget debate is concerned the senatepassed version of hr 1000 contains changes in the budgetary treatment of the aviation trust fund conference version of the bill failed to emerge from conference before the end of the first session of the 106th congress however the conference remains open and action could occur in the second session the budget treatment of the aviation trust fund has become particular issue in the 106th congress the aviation trust fund is expected to have large unobligated balances in the years ahead unless spending from the fund is increased or the funds tax revenues are decreased this situation combined with the belief in some quarters that protected spending within the tea21 firewalls constrains faa spending in the annual appropriat ions process has heightened interest in providing some sort of budgetary protection for aviation supporters of the coast guard are also concerned about the new transportation appropriations environment the coast guard is not funded by trust fund and hence cannot claim userfee base to support an argument for its own budget firewalls the coast guard has unique status within the transportation budget category because of its wartime role in national defense it is not unusual for the coast guard to receive some funds from military appropriations during the annual appropriation s process it is possible that the coast guard will seek additional funding from the military side of the budget in the years ahead if additional funds from transportation appropriations do not become available amtrak does not have similar option

further information see crs report 9667 the surface transportation board stb an overview and selected public policy issues by stephen thompsonkey policy issues the debate over fy2000 dot appropriations included the major issues of 1 allocating funds among competing dot programs and 2 seeking compromise between the concept of unified budget versus specifically earmarked off budget activities competition for funds stems from various transportation interests and from the modal administrations themselves monies have been allocated for diverse array of purposes for example to pay for the expenses of the us coast guard to improve safety throughout the various modes of transportation and to help finance various infrastructure needs in the dot and related agencies appropriations act monies are also provided to support the national transportation safety board ntsb the surface transport ation board stb and several other transportationrelated independent agencies1 the perennial question of priorities surrounds the appropriations process throughout its budget request the dot continues to emphasize several priorities including safety infrastructure innovative financing environmental enhancement technology and national security much of the appropriations process must take place within the framewo rk created by the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 signed into law on june 9 1998 pl 105178 hr 2400 the act authorized appropriations for key surface transportation programs through fiscal year 2003 the general sense of congress appears to be that although transportation trust funds are not sacrosanct proceeds from the federal fuels taxes must be targeted toward the capital and recurring needs of the vast us highway and transit network and not viewed as source of general revenue although attempts to move highway and transit programs off budget prior to the 106th congress were unsuccessful congress did insert language within tea21 to protect specific funding by creating firewalls around selected programs the firewalls effectively created minimum funding levels for the selected programs however their creation has caused congressional debate between the authorizers and appropriators over who should exercise ultimate authority for spending levels firewalls established by authorizing committees guarantee minimum funding for selected programs but in the process are seen by some as reducing the funding that might have been allocated to other unprotected programs thus unprotected programs must compete for finite amounts generally capped by the budget resolution similar initiative is underway for air transportation through hr 1000 although it drops the firewall provision while retaining offbudget provisions tea21 also contained provision section 1105 revenue aligned budget authority raba that authorizes dot to redistribute trust funds in excess of projected receipts to the various states for title 23 highway programs accordinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30208crs5 2 starting in the early 1990s about 300 million of the funds shown in table 2 were transferred from the dod appropriations budget to dot these monies are used to support coast guard activities the amounts requested for fy2000 are provided in table 5 at the end of this reportto raba the additional revenues are to be allocated to the states using the formulas spelled out in the law however the fy2000 dot request proposed redirection of these funds from highway programs to other dot initiatives predominantly environmental activities associated with the congestion mitigation and air quality cmaq program and transit in the end the fy2000 dot appropriations act pl 10669 disallowed the administrations proposed redirection of raba funds major funding

fees for commercial cargo vessels and cruise ships it anticipated collecting 41 million in fy2000 and 165 million annually when fully operational proposals for user fees for traditional coast guard services such as buoy placement and vessel traffic regulation have been controversial some argued that these services should be funded from general funds because of their widespread benefits others argue that user fees should be assigned in instances where the beneficiaries can be clearly identified in passing hr 2084 the senate included bill language prohibiting the coast guard from using any

administration fhwa httpwwwfhwadotgov the fy2000 act provides the fhwa with 289 billion in total budgetary resources this is 21 billion increase over the fy1999 level the fy2000 act continues the dramatic growth in fhwa funding that has resulted from passage of the transportation equity act for the 21st century pl 105178 tea21 in 1998 by way of further comparison funding for fy2000 will be over 10 billion more than was available in fy1995 the fy2000 act funding was reduced by just over 105 million pursuant to the government wide rescission pl 106113 the fy2000 act largely follows the provisions of tea21 in terms of overall funding distribution discussion of the tea21 program structure follows this section there are number of provisions in the act however that waiver from the formula guidance found in tea21 the principal change is in the distribution of revenue enhanced budget authority raba funds for programs under the direct control of the fhwa these are the so called allocated funds and include programs such as the federal lands highway program and the highway beautification program the effect of the acts provisions is to transfer significant portion of the raba funds designated for the allocated funds to core highway programs surface transportation program national highway system program etc for distribution to the states on formula basis the other major change in the act is significant increase in the number of specific projects and funding levels detailed in the legislation this earmarking is common feature in other parts of the transportation appropriations act but has been absent from the highway section of the act for several yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30208crs15 the earmarking and the raba reallocation are the most contentious features of the fy2000 act and were opposed by the leadership of the house transportation and infrastructure committee which viewed these changes as constituting legislating ie authorizing in an appropriations act opposition in the house however was insufficient to defeat the conference report on final passage the senatepassed version of hr 2084 formerly s 1143 honored the tea21created program structure and spending guarantee provisions and provided small additional increase in spending over the clinton administration proposal the legislation as reported included total budgetary resources for fhwa of just under 29 billion almost all of the programmatic changes proposed in the bill affected research programs and intelligent transportation systems its programs that will be discussed later in this section the major difference between the senate act and the clinton proposal was in the treatment of raba funding the senate act distributes raba funds of 146 billion on the basis of tea21 formulas thereby rejecting the administrations attempt to use these funds for nonhighway activities the senate passed version of hr 2084 differs from the house version in that it narrows the scope of raba distribution to certain of the core highway programs instead of allocated programs thereby excluding number of smaller previously mentioned programs during floor debate this provision was challenged on point of order as violating the senate rule against legislating in an appropriations bill the point of order failed hr 2084 as passed by the house also honored the tea21 guarantee levels federal aid highway funds and raba funds are identical to the senate levels total budgetary resources available to fhwa were slightly lower in the housepassed version the house bill also rejected the clinton administration raba redistribution proposal the fy2000 budget proposal submitted by the clinton administration requested fhwa funding at the tea21 firewall level 273 billion in addition raba distribution of 146 billion in additional highway funding was forecast the administration chose to make the very controvers ial suggestion that the raba distribution be reprogrammed to number of transportation programs outside the highway program firewall these changes were designed to complement vice president gores proposals concerning the administrations livability agenda for example the administration proposed 250 million in additional funding for highway research activities which are outside the highway firewall raba funding would also have been used for highway safety transit and rail related activities the administration proposal failed to gain congressional support and as detailed above was not seriously considered as part of the fy2000 appropriations process the tea21 funding framework tea21 created the largest surface transportation program in us history for the most part however it did not create new programs rather it continued most of the highway and transit programs that originated in its immediate predecessor legislation the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea pl 102240 programmatically tea21 can be viewed as refinement and update of the istea process there are few new funding initiatives in the act such as border infrastructure program but the vast majority of funding is reserved for continuing programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30208crs16 9 us house of representative s department of transportation and related agencies continuedthere are several groupings of highway programs within the highway firewall most of the funding is reserved for the major federal aid highway programs which can be thought of as the core programs these programs are national highway system nhs interstate maintenance im surface transportation program stp bridge replacement and rehabilitation and congestion mitigation and air quality improvement cmaq all of these programs are subject to apportionment on an annual basis by formula and are not subject to programbyprogram appropriation there is second category of highway funding within the firewalls this so called exempt category consists of two elements an additional annual authorization of minimum guarantee funding 639 million per fiscal year and emergency relief 100 million per fiscal year these funds are not subject to the annual limitation on obligations further set of programs which are also within the firewall are known as the allocated programs these programs are under the direct control of fhwa or other governmental entities these programs include the federal lands highway program high priority projects former demonstration project category appalachian roads formerly ineligible for trust fund contract authority most minimum guarantee funds the national corridor planning and border infrastructure program and several other small programs tea21 provides link between the highway generated revenues that flow into the highway account and highway spending the act requires that the secretary of transportation make an annual evaluation of revenues into the highway account during the previous fiscal year visavis spending authorized within the highway firewall for the new fiscal year if revenues go up program spending is increased conversely spending can go down if revenues go down the act specifies formula to determine the direction and amount of highway funding adjustment this mechanism known as the revenue aligned budget authority raba is employed beginning in fy2000 fhwa research development and technology programs for fy2000 the fhwa requested 641 million to support its research development and technologyrelated rdt activities this is an increase of 268 million over the fy1999 estimate of 373 million the request consisted of 370 million to conduct rdt related to fhwas traditional highway programs and 271 million to support the national intelligent transportation systems its program an important issue associated both with the traditional highway component and particularly with the its deployment program component of the rdt program is the earmarking of funds the appropriators historically have designated substantial portion of the incentive funds used to accelerate its deployment for example in fy1999 the appropriators earmarked the entire deployment account by specifying which cities or states would receive those funds and the amounts to be obligated9 both the house appropriations committee and the senate committee onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30208crs17 9 continued appropriations act for fy1999 105th congress 2nd session hrept 105825 pp 7677 10 the administration proposed using raba monies to fund 250 million of the requested increase of 268 million for rdtappropriations again earmarked the entire its deployment program in their fy2000 recommendations the conference agreement accompanying pl 10669 earmarked almost all of the deployment account many members and proponents of its would prefer to have the deployment funds competitively awarded the fy2000 budget request poses other issues regarding highway rdt programs but one is of particular note this issue pertains to the use of raba funds as previously stated the administration has been seeking the flexibility to allocate those monies according to its priorities instead of the distribution specified in tea21 the administration proposed allocating 250 million of the raba funds to supplement both components of the rdt program if highway rdt programs had received only their proportional share of the raba funds now allowed under tea21 the funding for those activities could have been increased up to about 5 plus any increase now specified in tea21 for fy2000 instead of the 72 increase proposed by dot10 this would have upset the agreements forged in tea21 regarding how the raba funds would be distributed the senate and the house did not accept the administrations proposal to use raba funds to increase rdt activities by 72 motor carrier safety operat ions in fy2000 fhwa requested approximat ely 554 million for the motor carrier safety mcs program that is managed by the newly established office of motor carrier and highway safety in an amended request fhwa asked for an additional 58 million for that program the requested funds are used primarily to pay for the salaries and expenses of some 630 staff who conduct audits or reviews of motor carriers write and revise the federal motor carrier safety regulations and conduct many other activities intended to improve commercial motor vehicle safety in fy1999 534 million was appropriated for those functions for fy2000 the senate specified about 574 million for motor carrier safety operations and the house appropriated about 705 million for that function the conference agreement specified the amount recommended by the house various congressional committees have recently conducted hearings on the truck and bus safety program administered by the us department of transportation dot two of the key issues that were discussed include how effectively is the current program being conducte d is new administrative structure needed to improve its implementation the debate on the future administrative structure of the federal truck and bus safety program appears to have affected the fy2000 dot appropriations act pl 10669 prohibits the use of any funds to carry out certain motor carrier safety functions and operations by the fhwa and would transfer those funds to any dot entity other than

fund additional mcsap activities and other safety initiatives mcsap provides grants to the states to implement inspection and review programs affecting both interstate and intrastate commercial vehicle operations in fy1999 100 million was made available for mcsap and related information systems the housepassed hr 2084 appropriates 105 million for those activities the senatepassed version

been an increase of almost 700 million or 14 over the fy1999 level of 54 billion however tea21 authorized 68 billion for fy2000 of which 58 billion was guaranteed under the socalled firewall provisions the additional amount of 291 million over the guaranteed level of 58 billion under the administrations proposal for transit would have come from highway gasoline tax revenues derived from the revenue aligned budget authority act raba funds designated by tea21 for highway programs the reallocation of raba funds to transit was opposed by highway proponents the american public transit association apta also opposed the administrations use of raba funds for transit purposes apta believed that the additional funds proposed by the administration over the guaranteed funding level could be found within the discretionary budget category however apta wanted transit to be funded at the full tea21 authorization level of 68 billion for fy2000 the senatepassed version of hr 2084 originally introduced in the senate as s 1143 provided fta with total budgetary resources of 58 billion in doing so the senate complied with the tea21 budgetary firewalls the senate bill provided additional transit funding over this amount and rejected the clinton administration proposals for the redistribution of raba funds during consideration in the senate deadlock occurred over provision that the would have limited states total transit funding to 125 of total formula grant transit funding the provision was controversial not only because it entailed changing the grant distribution formula enacted in tea21 but also because all of the reductions would have come out of the projected distribution of transit funds to the two states new york and california after vote to invoke cloture failed the provision was withdrawn in the face of the certainty of filibuster by the delegations from new york and california and opposition from those who were against changing any of tea21s provisions in general the fy2000 act provides total of 58 billion for fta this exceeded fy1999 funding by 407 million an increase of more than 76 almost all fta programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30208crs19 figure 4
