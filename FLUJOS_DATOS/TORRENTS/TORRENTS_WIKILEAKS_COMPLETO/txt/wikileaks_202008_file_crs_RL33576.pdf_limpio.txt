budget initiatives for glossary of budget terms and relevant websites see appendix terminology and web resources for funding sources for l hhsed agencies see appendix b context of lhhsed appropriations the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues such as restrictions on the use of federa l funds for abortion stem cell research and human cloning this bill provides discreti onary funds for three federal departments and 14 related agencies including the social security administration ssa among the various appropriations bills lhhsed is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federa l programs the depa rtment of defense dod bill is the largest source of discre tionary funds among ll federal programs according to the budget of the united states government

tables of this report are postreduction amounts as determined by omb 302a and 302b allocation ceilings the maximum budget authority for annual lhhsed ppropriations is determined through twostage congressiona l budget process in the first stage congress establishes the 302a allocations the maximum spending totals for congress for given fiscal year this task is sometimes accomplished through the concurrent resolution on the budget where sp ending totals are specified through the statement of managers in the conference report in years when the house and senate do not reach budget agreement these totals may be set through leadership arrangements in each chamber the 302a allocations determine spending totals for each of the various committees as well as the total discretionary budget authority available for enactment in annual appropriations thr ough the house and senate committees on appropriations congress has not yet reached agreement on the fy2007 budget resolution the house passed hconres 378 on may 18 2006 and the senate passed sconres 83 on march 16 2006 the house resoluti on established 302a discretionary budget allocation of 8728 billion the sena allocation was

budget author ity available to each subcommittee for each annual appropriations b ill the total of these allocations must not exceed the 302a discretionary total this process creates the basis for enforcing discretionary budget discipline since any appropriations bill reported with tota l above the ceiling is subject to point of order the 302b allocations can and often do get adjusted during

the corporation for public broadcastin g cpb for use in fy2008 advance appropriations may be used to meet several objectives these might include the provision of longterm budget information to recipients such as state and local educational systems to enable better planning of future program activities and personnel levels the more contentious as pect of advance appropriations however involves how they are counted in budget ceilings advance appropriations avoi d the 302a and 302b llocation ceilings for the current year but must be counted in the year in which they first become available for obligation this procedure uses up ahead of time part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in future years in fy2002 the presidents budget proposed the elimination of

become topic of contention for congress and the administration and the issue extends to lhhsed projects in the case of lhhsed appropriations earmarks may be defined as funds set aside within an acc ount for specific organization or location either in the appropriation act or its conf erence report typically the authorizing statute gives the general purpose for use of appropriations such as projects for the improvement of postsecondary education but an earma rk designates specific amount for specific recipient such designations bypass the usual competitive distribution of awards by federal agency but otherwise require recipients to follow standard federal financial and other administrative pro cedures the president has urged the elimination of c ongressional earmarks in appr opriations in recent years but with the possible exception of fy2006 lhhsed appropriations congress generally has continued the practice earmarks in lhhsed appropriations ge nerally have increased during the past decade along with the total appropriation for lhhsed programs however major change in direction occurred in fy2006 virtually all earmarks were eliminated from the fy2006 lhhsed bill in

embryonic stem cell resear ch funding restrictions on august 9 2001 president bush announced decision to use federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cells for the first time but limited the

parkinsons disease in response to the presidents announcement the nih developed registry of 78 embryonic stem cell lines eligible for use in federally funded research however many of th lines were found to be unavailable or unsuitable for research only 22 of the 78 eligible stem cell lines are currentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33576crs24 available for general research purposes some scientists are concerned about the quality longevity and availability of eligible stem cell lines many believe that the advancement of research requires new stem cell lines possibly including stem cells derived from cloned embryos the use of stem cells however raises ethical issues regarding embryo and fetal tissue research because the embryos are destroyed in order to obtain the cells given its potential

funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year for example many of the elementary and seconda ry education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33576crs32 states on july 1 of the same year as th appropriations and re main available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2007 appropriations for some programs will become available for obligation to the states on july 1 2007 and will remain available until septem ber 30 2008 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forward or multiy ear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time fo r school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants for undergraduates however aggregate program costs for indi vidual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time ppropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2007 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants for the 20072008 academic year unlike fundi ng for elementary and secondary education programs however the funds for pell grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for wh ich the appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2007 appropriations funds norma lly would have become available october 1 2006 under regular funding provi sions but will not become available until july 1 2007 under the forward funding provisions discusse d above however if the july 1 2007 forward funding date for obligation were to be postponed by three months until october 1 2007 the appropr iation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in subsequent fiscal year fy2008 for example the fy2007 budget request for title i part grants to leas for the education for the disadvantaged was 127 billion this amount includes not only forward funding of 53 billion to become available july 1 2007 but also an advance appropriati on of 74 billion to become available october 1 2007 like forward funding pr ovisions these advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appr opriations bill what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the appropriations level ther is difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period availa ble for obligation at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the threemonth delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for st andard school year occur after october 1 at the scorekeeping level however sign ificant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary ppropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an adva nce appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence threemonth change from forward funding to an advance appropria tion for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations for additional info rmation please see crs report
