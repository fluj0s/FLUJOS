accountability by being disincentive to agencies to resolve matters promptly in the administrative processes by not pursuing resolution an agency could shift the cost of resolution from its budget to the judgment fund and escape scrutiny that would accompany request for supplemental appropriation 3 in addition the legislation requires each agen cy to file with congress an annual report detailing the number of discrimination or whis tleblower cases filed with it how the cases were resolved the amount of any settleme nts and the number of agency employee disciplines for discrimination or
