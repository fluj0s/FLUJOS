specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32712agriculturebased renewable energy production summary since the late 1970s us policy makers at both the federal nd state levels have enacted variety of incentives regula tions and programs to encourage the production and use of agriculturebased re newable energy motivations cited for these legislative initiatives include energy security concerns reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and raising domestic mand for usproduced farm products agricultural households and rural co mmunities have responded to these government incentives and have expande d their production of renewable energy primarily in the form of biofuels nd wind power every year since 1996 the production of ethanol the pr imary biofuel produced by the agricultural sector has risen from about 175 million gallons in 1980 to nearly 49 billion gallons per year in 2006 the us ethanol production capacity has also been expanding rapidly particularly since mid2006 with important implications for the food and fuel sectors current ethanol production cap acity is 56 billion gallons per year february 28 2007 with another 62 billion gallons of capacity under construction and potentially online by late 2008 biodiesel production is at much smaller level but has also shown growth rising from 05 million gallons in 1999 to an estimated 386 million gallons in 2006 wind energy systems production capacity has also grown rapidly rising from 1706 gawatts in 1997 to an estimated 12633 megawatts by july 1 2007 despite this ra pid growth agriculture and ruralbased energy production accounted for only about 07 of total us energy consumption in 2006 key points that emerge from this report are substantial federal and state programs and incentives have facilitated development of agricultures re newable energy production capacity rising fossil fuel prices impr ove renewable energys market competitiveness whereas higher costs for feedstock and plant operating fuel eg natural gas dampen profitability technological improvements for bi ofuel production eg cellulosic conversion enhance its economic competitiveness with fossil fuels farmbased energy production is likely to substantially reduce the nations dependence on petroleu m imports unless there is significant decline in energy consumption and ethanoldriven higher corn prices have raised concerns from corn users over rising food and feed co sts as well as the potential for increased soil erosion and chemical usage from substantially expanded corn production this report provides background informa tion on farmbased energy production and how this fits into the national energyuse picture it briefly reviews the primary agriculturebased renewable energy types and issues of concern associated with their production particularly their economic and energy effici encies and longrun supply finally this report examines the major legislation related

use than energy from renewable sources2 however since the late 1970s us policy makers at both the federal and state leve ls have enacted variety of incentives regulations and programs to encourage th production and use of cleaner renewable agriculturebased energy3 these programs have proven critical to the economic success of rural renewable ergy production the benefits to rural economies and to the environment contrast with the generally higher costs and have led to numerous proponents as well as critics of the government subsidies that underwrite agriculture based renewable energy production proponents of government support for agri culturebased renewable energy have cited national energy secur ity reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and raising domestic demand for usproduced farm products as viable justification4 i n addition proponents argue that rural agricu lturebased energy production can enhance rural incomes and employment opportunities while encour aging greater

background and public policy issues by brent yacobucciin contrast petroleum industry critic s of biofuel subsidies argue that technological advances such as seismography dr illing and extraction continue to expand the fossilfuel resource base whic h has traditionally been cheaper and more accessible than biofuel supplies6 other critics argue that current biofuel production strategies can only be economically competitive with existing fossil fuels in the absence of subsidies if significant improve ments in existing technologies are made or new technologies are developed7 until such technological breakthroughs are achieved critics contend that the subsidies distort energy market incentives and divert research funds from the development of other potential renewable energy sources such as solar or geothermal that offer pot entially cleaner more bountiful alternatives still others question the rationale behind po licies that promote biofuels for energy security these critics question whethe r the united states could ever produce sufficient feedstock of either starches sugars or vegetable oils to permit biofuel production to meaningfully offset petroleum imports8 finally there are those who argue that the focus on development of alte rnative energy sources undermines efforts to conserve and reduce the nations energy dependence the economics underlying agricultureb ased renewable energy production include decisions concerning capital investment plant or turbine location relative to feedstock supplies and byp roduct markets or power gr ids production technology and product marketing and distribution as well as federal and state production incentives and usage mandates9 several additional cr iteria may be used for comparing different fuels including

biodiesel still account for very small shares of us motorvehicle fuel consumption figure 1 under most circumstances bi ofuels are more environm entally friendly in terms of emissions of toxins volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases than petroleum pr oducts s upporters of biofuels emphasize that biofuel plants generate valueadded economic activity that increases demand for local feedstock which raises commodity prices farm inco mes and rural employment ethanol ethanol or ethyl alcohol is an alcohol made by fermenting and distilling simple sugars13 as result ethanol can be

cellulosic feedstock are significantly less expensive than corn however at pres ent they are more costly to convert to ethanol because of the extensive processing required currently cellulosic conversion is done using either dilute or concentr ated acid hydrolysis both processes are prohibitively expensive however the doe suggests that enzymatic hydrolysis which processes cellulose into sugar using cellulase enzymes offers both processing advantages as well as the greatest potential for cost reductions current cost estimates of cellulase enzymes range from 30 to 50 per gallon of

the cost to less than 5 per gallon but this may still be decade or more away were this to happen then the significantly lower cost of cellulosic feedstock would make cellulosicbased ethanol

67 by usda in 2004 it is likely that cellulosic biomasss net energy balance would also have experienced parallel gains for the same reasons imp roved crop yields nd production practices and improved processing technology recen t review of research on ethanols energy efficiency found that cellulo sebased ethanol had neb ratio of 10 ie 1000 net gain62 as with cornbased ethanol the ne b varies based on the production process used to grow harvest and process the feedstock another factor that favors cellulosic ethanols energy balance over cornbased ethanol relates to byproducts cornbased ethanols byproducts are valued as animal feeds whereas cellulosic ethanols byproduc ts are expected to serve directly as processing fuel at the plant this adaptation is expected to greatly improve both the economic efficiency and the net energy balance of cellulose ethanol over cornbased ethanol longrun supply issues cellulosic feedstock have an advantage over corn in that they grow well on marginal lands whereas corn requires fertile cropland as well as timely water and the addition of soil amendments this greatly expands the potential area for growing cellulosic feedstoc k relative to corn for example in 2006 about 78 million acres were planted to cor n of which 75 or about 59 million acres were from the nine principal corn belts i il in mn mo ne oh sd wi in contrast that same year the united stat had 243 million acres planted to the eight major field crops corn soybeans wheat cotton barley sorghum oats and rice 433 million acres of total cropland including forage crops and temporarily idled cropland and 578 million acres of perman ent pastureland most of which is potentially viable fo r switchgrass production63 2003 usda study suggests that if 42 million acres of cropped idle pasture and crp acres were converted to sw itchgrass pr oducti on 188 million dry tons of switchgrass could be produced annually at an implied yield of 45 metric tons per acre resulting in the pr oduction of 167 billion gallons of ethanol or 109 billion geg64 this would represent about 8 of us gasoline use in 2005 existing research plots have produced switchgrass yi elds of 15 dry tons per acre per year suggesting tremendous longrun production poten tial however before any supply potential can be realized research must first overcome the cellulosic conversion cost issue through

current u s petroleum consumption usdas very optimistic assessment is mpered somewhat by 2005 university of minnesota study that uses the results from three major biofuels studies to estimate the potential supplies of biofuels from both cornbased ethanol and cellulosicbased ethanol from biomass cr ops and crop residue66 the analysis suggests that about 1304 million tons of biomass could be produced directly from switchg rass with another 1305 million tons from crop residue if th biomass total of 2609 million tons were converted to ethanol at rate of 897 gallons per t on it would pr oduce 234 billion gallons of anhydrous ethanol adding 2 denaturant yields 239 billion gallons adding an additional 7 billion gallons of co rnbased ethanol brings the total to 309 billion gallons or 207 billion geg this would represent about 227 of total us gasoline consumption in 2005 methane from an anaerobic digester an anaerobic digester is device that promotes the decomposition of manure or digestion of the organics in manure by anaerobic bacteria in the absence of oxygen to simple organics while produc ing biogas as waste product67 the principal components of biogas from this process are methane 60 to 70 carbon dioxide 30 to 40 and trace amounts of other ga ses methane is the major component of the natural gas used in many homes for cooki ng and heating and is significant fuel in electricity production biogas can also be used as fuel in hot water heater if hydrogen sulfide is first removed from the bi ogas supply as result the generation and use of biogas can significantly reduce the cost of electricity and other farm fuels such as natural gas propane and fuel oil by early 2005 there were 100 digester sy stems in operation at commercial us livestock farms with an add itional 94 planned for construction68 epa estimates that anaerobic digester biogas sy stems are technically feasib at about 7000 dairy and swine operations in the united states th majority of existing

encourages methane recovery at confined livestock operations that manage manure as liquid slurries economic efficiency the primary benefits of anaerobic digestion are animal waste management odor control nutrien t recycling greenhouse gas reduction and water quality protection except in very rge systems biogas production is highly useful but secondary benefit as result anaerobic digestion systems do not effectively compete with other renewabl energy production systems on the basis of energy production alone instead they co mpete with and are costcompetitive when compared to conventional waste management practices according to epa70 depending on the infrastructure design ge nerally some combination of storage pond covered or aerated trea tment lagoon heated digest er and open storage tank anaerobic digestion systems can range in investment cost from 200 to 500 per animal unit ie per 1000 pounds of live we ight in addition to the initial infrastructure investment r ecurring costs include manure and effluent handling and general maintenance according to epa these systems can have financially attractive payback periods of three to seven years when energy gas uses are employed on average manure from lactating 1400pound dairy cow can generate enough biogas to produce 550 kilowatts per year71 200head dairy herd could generate 500 to 600 kilowatts per day at 6 pe r kilowatt hour this would re present potential energy cost savings of 6000 to 10000 per year the principal byproduct of anaerobic diges tion is the effluent ie the digested manure because anaerobic digestion substantially reduces ammonia losses the effluent is more nitrogenrich than untreated manure making it more valuable for subsequent field application also digest ed manure is high in fiber making it valuable as highquality potting soil ingredient or mulch other cost savings include lower total lagoon volume requirements for animal waste management systems which reduces excavation costs and the land ar ea requirement and lower cover costs because of smaller lagoon surface areas government support federal assistance in the form of grants loans and loan guarantees is available under

anaerobic digesters are most feasible alongside large confined animal feeding operations cafos according to epa biogas production for generating cost effective ectricity requires manure from more than 500 cows at dairy operation or at leas t 2000 head of swine at pig feeding operation as animal feeding operations stead ily increase in size the opportunity for anaerobic digestion systems will likewise incr ease in addition some digester systems may qualify for costshare funds under usdas environmental quality incentives program eqip biodiesel biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel that is produced from any animal fat or vegetable oil such as soybean oil or r ecycled cooking oil about 90 of us biodiesel is made from soybean oil as result us soybean producers and the american soybean association asa are strong advocates for greater government support for biodiesel production according to the national biodiesel board nbb biodiesel is nontoxic biodegradable and esse ntially free of sulfur and arom atics in addition it works in any diesel engine with few or modifications and offers similar fuel economy horsepower and torque but with superi or lubricity and important emission improvements over petroleum diesel72 biodiesel is increasingly being adopted by major fleets nationwide the us postal service the us military and many state governments are directing their bus and truck fleets to incorporate biodiesel fuels as part of their fuel base us biodiesel production has shown strong growth in recent years increasing from under 1 million gallons in 1999 to an estimated 386 million gallons in 2006 figure 5 however us biodiesel producti on remains small re lative to national diesel consumption levels in 2005 estimated biodiesel production of 200 million gallons represented 04 of the 449 billion gall ons of diesel fuel used nationally for vehicle transportation73 in addition to vehicle use 185 billion gallons of diesel fuel were used for heating and power generation by residential comme rcial and industry and by railroad and vesse l traffic in 2005 bringing total us diesel fuel use to nearly 631 billion gallonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32712crs28 74

according to the nbb as of octobe r 15 2007 there were 165 companies in the united states with the potential to produce biodiesel commercially that were either in operation under expansion or under construction but sche duled to be completed within the next 18 months74 the nbb reported that the combined annual biodiesel production capacity within the oleochemical industry of these 165 plants once fully operational including capacity under construction would be an estimated 185 billion gallons per year because many of these plants also can produce other products such as cosmetics estimated total capacity and capacity for expansion is far greater than actual biodiesel production economic efficiency despite the rapid expans ion of biodiesel production capacity there are two major economic impediments to future growth first biodiesel production is not profitable under the current set of market prices for vegetable oil feedstocks and the biodiesel produced second the cost of producing biodiesel is generally more than the cost of producin g its fossil fuel counterpart making the finished biodiesel uncompetitive with its fo ssil fuel counterpart in the marketplace 2004 doe study suggests that since the cost of the feedstock whether vegetable oil or restaurant grease is the largest single component of biodiesel production the cost of producing biodiesel varies subs tantially with the choice of feedstock75 for example in 200405 it cost 075 to produce gallon of petroleumbased diesel compared with about 286 to produce gall on of biodiesel from soybean oil and 159 from

found biodiesel to have an neb of 32 that is 220 more energy was returned from gallon of pure biodiesel than was used in its production77 longrun supply issues both the asa and the nbb are optimistic that the federal biodiesel tax incentiv will provide the same boost to biodiesel production that ethanol has obtained from its federal tax incentive78 however many commodity market analysts are skeptical of such claims they conte nd that the biodiesel industry still faces several hurdles the retail distri bution network for biodiesel has yet to be established the federa l tax credit which expires on december 31 2008 does not provide sufficient time for the industry to develop and potential domestic oil feedstock are relatively less abundant than ethanol feedstock making the longrun outlook more uncertain in addition biodiesel production confr onts the same limited ability to substitute for petroleum imports and the same type of consumption tradeoffs as ethanol production as an example consider hypothetical scenario as shown in table 5 whereby 2 usage requirement for vehicle diesel fuel were to be adopted this would replicate the european unions goal of 2 of transporta tion fuels originating from biofuels by 2005 then growing to 575 by 2010 this hypothetical mandate would require about 898 million gallons of biodiesel compared to estimated 2006 production of about 386 million gallons or approximately 67 billion pounds of vegetable oil during 200506 total of 367 billion pounds of vegetable oils and animal fats were produced in the united states table 6 however most of this production was committed to ot her food and industrial uses uncommitted biodiesel feedstock as measured by the availabl stock levels on ptember 30 2006 were about 4 billion pounds thus after

19blending requirement this exceeds th 2 billion pounds of total vegetable oils exported by the united states in 200506 and is nearly double the 13 billion pounds of soybean oil exported that during same period79 if us soybean vegetable oil exports were to remain unc hanged the deficit biodiesel feedstock could be obtained eith er by reducing us exports of whole soybeans by about 250 million bushels then crushing them for their oil or by expanding soybean production by approxima tely 6 million acres assuming yield of about 42 bushels of soybeans per acre80 of course any area expansion would likely come at the expense of some other crop ch as corn cotton or wheat current high corn prices make such an area shift seem unlik ely at least in the near term further possibility is that us oilseed producers c ould shift towards the production of higher oil content crops such as canola or sunflower the bottom line is that small increase in demand of fats and oils for biodiesel production could quickly exhaust available feedstock supplies and push vegetable oil prices significantly higher due to the low elasticity of demand for vegetable oils in food consumption81 rising vegetable oil prices would reduce or eliminate biodiesels competitive advantage visàvis petroleum diesel even with the federal tax credit while increased oilseed crushing woul d begin to disturb feed markets as with ethanol production increased soybean oil production dedicated to biodiesel production would gene rate substantial increases in animal feeds in the form of highprotein meals when bushel of soybeans is processed or crushed nearly 80 of the resultant output is in the fo rm of soybean meal while only about 18 19 is output as soybean oil thus for every 1 pound of soybean oil produced by crushing whole soybeans over 4 pounds of soybean meal are also produced crushing an additional 250 million bushels of soybeans for soybean oil would produce over 75 million short tons st of soybean

is proportional to the cube of the wind speed so slight increase in wind speed results in large increase in electricity generation improvements in turbine design and configuration the taller theturbine and the larger the area swept by the blades the more productive the turbine economies of scale larger systems operate more economically thansmaller systems by spreading operationsmaintenance costs over more kilowatthours transmission and market access conditions see below and environmental and othe r policy constraints for example stricter environmental regulations placed on fossil fuel emissions enhance wind energys economic competitiveness or alternately greater protection of birds or bats90 especially threatened or endangered species could reduce wind energys

restriction under current us tax law irc 469 whereby individuals are not eligible to deduct losses incurred in businesses that they do not actively participate in legislation hr 2007 wa s introduced in the 109th congress to allow passive investors that provide capital for wind energy facilities and projects to be eligible for up to 25000 passive loss deduction in the in ternal revenue code the

offset is only available for oil gas and real estate investments the inclusion of the federal tax cred it reduces the cost of producing wind generated electricity to 25 to 4 per kilowa tt hour in some cases the tax credit may be combined with fiveyear accelerated depreciation schedule for wind turbines as well as with grants loans and loan guarantees offered under several different programs95 to the extent that they offset substantial portion 30 to 40 of the price risk and initial financing charges government incentives often provide the catalyst for stimulating new investments in rural wind energy systems longrun supply issues despite the advantages listed above us wind potential remains largely untapped particularly in many of the states with the greatest wind potential such as rth and

speed is reached at about 50 miles per hour at this speed the rbine is stopped and the blades are turned 90 degrees out of the wind and parked to prevent damage the doe map of us wind potential confirms that the most favorable areas tend to be located in sparsely populated re gions which may disfavor windgenerated electricity production for several reasons first transmission lines may be either inaccessible or of insufficient capacity to move surplus windgenerated electricity to distant demand sources second transmi ssion pricing mechanisms may disfavor moving electricity across long distances due to distancebased charges or according to the number of utility territories crossed third high infrastructure costs for the initial hookup to the power grid may discour age entry although larger wind farms can benefit from economies of scale on the initial hookup fourth new entrants may see their access to the transmission power grid limited in favor of traditional customers during periods of heavy congesti on finally wind plant operators are often penalized for deviations in electricity delivery to transmission line that result from the variability in available wind speedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32712crs40 environmental concerns three potential environmental issues impacts on the visual landscape bird and bat deaths nd noise issues vary in importance based on local conditions in some rural localities the merits of wind energy appear to have split the environmental movement for example in the kansas flint hills local chapters of the audubon society and nature conservancy oppose installation of wind turbines saying that they would befoul the landscape and harm wildlife while kansas sierra club leaders argue that exploiting wind power would help to reduce americas dependence on fossil fuels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32712crs41 box primer on measuring electric energy news stories covering electric generation t opics often try to illustrate the worth of megawatt mw in terms of how many homes particular amount of generation could serve however substantial variation may appear in implied household usage rates so what really is mw and how many homes can one mw of generation really serve basics watt w is the basic unit used to measure electric power watts measure instantaneous power in contrast watthour wh measures the total amount of energy consumed in an hour for example 100 w light bulb is rated to consume 100 w of power when turned on if 100 w bulb were on for 4 hours it would consume 400 wh of energy kilowatt kw equals 1000 w and megawatt mw equals 1000 kw or 1 million w electricity production and consumption are measured in kilowatthours kwh while generating capacity is measured in kilowatts or megawatts if power plant that has 1 mw of capacity operated nonstop ie 100 during all 8760 hours in the year it would produce 8760000 kwh more realistically 100 mw rated wind farm is capable of producing 100 mw during peak winds but will produce much less than its rated amount when winds are light as result of these varying wind speeds over the course of year wind farm may only average 30 mw of power production on aver age wind power turbines typically operate the equivalent of less than 40 of the peak full load hours in the year due to the intermittency of the wind wind turbines ar online actually generating electricity only when wind speeds are suffi ciently strong ie at least 9 to 10 miles per hour average mw per household in its 2004 analysis of the us wind industry the government accountability ffice gao assumed that an average us household consumed about 10000 kwh per year gao renewable energy wind powers contribution to electric power generati on and impact on farms and rural communities gao04756 sept 2004 however the amount of electricity consumed by typical residential household varies dramatically by region of the country according to 2001 energy information administration eia data new england residential homes consumed the least amount of electricity averaging 653 kwh of load in month while the east south central region which includes states such as georgia and alabama and tennessee consumed nearly double that amount at 1193 kwh per household the large regional disparity in electric consumption is driven by many factors including the heavier use of air conditioning in the south as result 1 mw generator in the northeast would be capable of serving about twice as many house holds as the same generator located in the south because households in the northeast cons ume half the amount of electricity as those in the south so how many homes can wind turbine rated at 1 mw really serve in the united states wind turbine with peak generating capacity of 1 mw rated at 30 annual capacity placed on tower situated on farm ranch or other rural land can generate about 26 million kilowatthours 1mw30876 kwh in year which is enough electricity to serve the needs of 184 east s

passed by the house expands and extends several provisions from the energy title of the enacted 2002 farm bill with substantial incr eases in funding and heightened focus on developing cellulosic et hanol production key depa rture from current farmbill related energy provisions is that most new funding would be directed away from corn starchbased ethanol production and towards either cellulosicbased biofuels production or to new asyet undeveloped technologies with some type of agricultural linkage funding complication relating to paygo budget restrictions on new energy funding arose during the hous agriculture committees hacs bill preparation because the congressional b udget offices march baseline showed funding in the farm bill for new energy title however the house ways and means committee resolved this issue for the hac by finding 24 billion in revenue offsets from outside of the agriculture budget the senate agriculture committee sac is expected to mark up its version of 2007 farm bill in lateoctober the senate is also expected to adhere to paygo budget restrictions which may in and of themselves lead to different funding

competitive with cornbased ethanol by 2012117 state of the union sou 2007 in his 2007 sou president bush announced his 20 in 10 pla n which calls for reducing us gasoline consumption by 20 in 10 years ie by 2017118 the president proposed two major approaches for achieving his 20 in 10 goal increasing the supply of renewable and alternative fuels by setting mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 this would be nearly five times the 2012 rfs target of 75 billions now in law if accomplished the administration estimates that this would displace 15 of projected annual gasoline use in 2017 reforming and modernizing corporate average fuel economy café standards for cars and extending the current light truck rule according to the administration this will reduce projected annual gasoline use by up to 85 billi on gallons by 2017 further 5 reduction that in combination with increasing the supply of renewable and alternative fuels will bring the total reduction in projected annual gasoline use to 20 according to the administration th presidents fy2008 budget will request 27 billion for the advanced energy initia tive an increase of 26 above the 2007 request and 53 above 2006 president bush has called for increased federal investment in hydrogen fuel technology re search as well as increased investment in advanced
