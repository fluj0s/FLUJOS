government with the changing composition of federal revenues has come significant increase in the share of national income devoted to funding the federal government throughout the nations history federal revenues have come predominately from tariffs and taxes while raising revenue is the primary goal of both tariff and tax policies they are often used to achieve other goals sales tax changes for example can encourage or discourage the consumption of particular goods in addition the income tax code is sometimes used to achieve variety of economic and social goals lastly tariff policy can be used to protect certain industries from import competition figure 1 shows the five major sources of federal revenues as percentage of gross domestic product gdp from 1820 to 20051 the five sources of revenue are customs duties sales of public lands excise taxes income taxes individual and corporate and social insurance revenue payroll taxes these five sources have accounted for about 94 of annual total federal revenues over this period federal revenue from these sources has increased from about 2 of gdp in 1820 to 20 in 2000 1 the dollar amounts are shown in the appendix annual gdp data

adjusted from time to time as revenue was needed but the changes were generally moderate tariff policy during this period generated little controversy since the primary goal of tariff policy was to raise revenue rather than import protection the most heated debates during this period were over the use of internal revenue sources excise and direct taxes the federalists wanted to wield the taxing powers provided in the constitution in 1791 an excise tax on distilled spirits was enacted while revenue from this excise tax never amounted to much it was widely unpopular and touched off the whiskey rebellion of 1794 in 1798 direct tax on property was enacted to help finance the naval build up against france after the election of thomas jefferson in 1800 the jefferson administration moved to abolish excise and direct taxes by 1811 total internal revenue amounted to about 2000 or about 001 of total federal revenues the war of 1812 brought new demands for revenue the tariff schedule was doubled in 1812 but customs revenue fell as international trade was curtailed by the war and probably by the tariff gross imports fell by 71 between 1812 and 18132 in 1813 congress approved set of excise and direct taxes the taxes however were as one historian notes clearly devoted to prosecution of the fighting and they were just as clearly designed to end as soon as the crisis ended3 internal revenue accounted for almost 30 of federal revenue in 1815 and for less than 1 by 1819 the reduced import competition during the war of 1812 contributed to the development and expansion of us manufacturing after the war debate over tariff policy shifted from raising revenue to protecting the young manufacturing industries the tariff act of 1816 has been described as the beginning of protectionist era in us trade policy in truth however the tariff act was only moderately protective and less protective than many manufacturers had hoped4 while there was some support for protective tariffs in congress there appears to have been little public support for protection until the financial crisis of 18181819 internal revenue excise and direct taxes was negligible source of federal revenue for the next 40 years often amounting to less than 500 annually the major source of revenue was customs duties accounting for about 85 of total revenue see figure 1 protectionist pressure was building in the early 1820s in the middle states of new york pennsylvania new jersey ohio and kentucky the southern states and new england were generally opposed to many of the demands 2 f w taussig

1824 1828 and 1832 were protectionist ostensibly safeguarding the young manufacturing industries in the middle states the tariff act of 1828 is often referred to as the tariff of abominations the 1832 tariff act while protectionist in nature removed the abominations of 18285 between 1832 and the civil war tariff policy fluctuated between high tariffs and low tariffs between 1832 and 1842 there was gradual reduction in tariffs only to be followed by strongly protectionist period to 1846 the tariff act of 1846 reduced tariffs and tariffs were again reduced by the tariff act of 18576 the other significant source of federal revenue during this period was sales of public land on average revenue from public land sales was equal to about 14 of the revenue generated from customs duties in some years however the revenue from land sales was nearly equal to customs duties revenue over this early period in the nations history federal revenues averaged about 18 of gdp between 1820 and 1862 federal revenues were as low as 09 of gdp and as high as 3 of gdp the rise of the excise tax 18631913 federal expenditures increased dramatically during the civil war to reach almost 14 of gdp by 1865 to help meet this wartime spending tariffs were raised in every year of the war but proved insufficient on july 1 1862 the beginning of fy1863 president lincoln signed revenue measure that created permanent internal revenue service called the bureau of internal revenue until 1953 and levied excise and income taxes by 1865 these internal revenues accounted for 63 of total federal revenue with the bulk coming from excise taxes these taxes financed about onefifth of the unions war costs7 the income tax was abolished in 1872 at time when the federal government budget was in surplus the income tax was briefly reestablished in 1894 but was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1895 on the ground that it was direct tax and was not apportioned among the states in conformity with the constitution8 in 1909 as part of the tariff act corporate excise tax became law which established 2 excise tax on corporations based on their net income the corporate excise tax was repealed in 1913 5 f w taussig the tariff history of the united states series of essays 4th edition new york g p putnams sons 1898 p 103 6 ibid p 115 7 w elliot brownlee federal taxation in america short history

us taxes was retained after the civil war the high tariffs were retained until reduced in 1913 many excise taxes were dropped after the war but the excise taxes on distilled beverages and tobacco were retained and became major source of federal revenue over the 50year period between 1863 and 1913 excise taxes generated about 40 of federal revenue and customs duties generated 49 the excise tax was used not only as revenue source but also as policy tool to regulate an excise tax was levied in 1899 on opium manufactured in the united states for smoking purposes the goal was to discourage opium use and not to raise revenue9 the corporate excise tax in 1909 was justified by president taft as long step toward that supervisory control of corporations which may prevent further abuse of power10 total federal revenue averaged about 3 of gdp over this period ranging from 6 by the end of the civil war to less than 2 at the close of this period in 1913 the excise tax era closed with proposal to amend the constitution giving the government the power to tax income the 16th amendment became effective on february 25 191311 the era of the income tax 1914present the modern progressive income tax was enacted in the tariff act of october 3 1913 three months into fy1914 the act levied 1 tax on individual and corporate income and surtax was applied to income over 20000 with six brackets the income tax allowed for personal exemptions and certain deductions the first tax loopholes or tax expenditures12 the act also reduced tariffs even with the income tax between 1914 and 1917 most federal revenue continued to come from customs duties and excise taxes since only 2 of us households paid income taxes13 to meet the growing needs for increasing national defense expenditures and to replace reduced tariff revenues due to falling wartime trade the revenue act of 1916 increased income taxes introduced progressive inheritance tax and levied 9 ibid p 22 10 cited in roy g blakey and gladys c

revenue measures in 1917 1918 and 1919 also increased tax revenue as the united states was drawn into world war i the most controversial measure was the excess profits tax as result of the tax increases internal revenues primarily excise and income tax revenues accounted for 72 of total federal revenue in 1917 and 88 by 1918 total federal revenue increased by almost 500 between 1917 and 1919 the harding administration elected in 1920 moved to reduce the wartime taxes the reason behind the changes in the tax code was not only to reduce taxes but also to thoroughly revise the revenue act of 191815 however the resulting legislation the revenue act of 1921 pleased almost one and was subsequently described as merely collection of patches on an old act by former commissioner of internal revenue16 the act reduced the rates of the income surtax eliminated the excessprofits tax and increased various exemptions and deductions throughout the 1920s tax rates were reduced and tax loopholes were added in the midst of the depression however the revenue act of 1932 imposed new excise taxes raised income tax rates and reduced income tax exemptions the reason for this contractionary economic policy was to close the growing budget gap despite the 1932 tax hikes and subsequent increases in 1933 and 1934 income tax revenue actually fell until 1935 the economic recovery contributed to rising income tax revenues beginning in 1935 the repeal of prohibition in 1933 brought in revenue from the excise tax on alcohol taxes which had remained on the books during prohibition the social security act of 1935 created the social security program and imposed payroll tax to pay for social security benefits see the area marked social insurance in figure 1 between 1929 and 1941 tax revenues increased from 29 billion or 28 of gdp to 73 billion or 57 of gdp the increased tax revenues were almost entirely due to increased income tax rates the introduction of the payroll tax and the economic recovery17 taxes were increased significantly and the tax base greatly expanded during world war ii the number of individual taxpayers increased from 175 million in 1941 to 426 million in 1945 furthermore total tax revenues reached 423 billion or 19 of gdp in 1945 although income taxes were reduced after the end of the war tax revenues still amounted to 13 of gdp in 1950 over twice the percentage before the war the growth in federal revenues after 1935 was to fund the new deal programs and after 1941 to fund the war effort after the war revenues were needed to continue funding the new deal social welfare programs one 14 see davis rich dewey financial history of the united states 12th edition new york augustus m kelley publishers 1934 15 see roy g blakey and

crs7 historian argues that the world war ii emergency had institutionalized new tax regime consisting of progressive massbased personal income taxes flat corporate tax rate and regressive payroll tax for social insurance18 over the next 60 years federal revenues varied as percentage of gdp from 14 in 1950 to 21 in 2000 with the an average of about 18 of gdp on the one hand income tax individual and corporate revenues as percentage of gdp generally fell from 126 of gdp to 97 of gdp between 1946 and 2005 see figure 1 on the other hand social insurance taxes increased from 14 of gdp in 1946 to 65 of gdp in 2005 this growth was due to the expansion of the payroll tax base as more workers were covered by social security and increases in payroll tax rates customs duties and excise tax revenues were relatively small source of revenues accounting for less than 5 of federal revenues by 2005 conclusions the composition and economic importance of federal government revenues has changed over the past 200 years the nation has gone from almost exclusive reliance on customs duties to almost exclusive reliance on income and payroll taxes furthermore federal revenues have increased relative to the national economy from less than 2 of gdp to over 20 of gdp the major changes in composition and economic importance have occurred at times of national emergencies the civil war world war i world war
