miley 1 u this is an action request to embassy ankara please see paragraph 7 background 2 s the us has information about several transactions involving turkish firms planning to export and import from iran arms and related material controlled by the wassenaar arrangement specifically iran is interested in procuring full metal jacket fmj 38 caliber and wadcutter bullets 40 mm automatic grenade launchers 556 mm composite magazines for m16 assault rifles and 762 x 39 mm and 762 x 51 mm composite magazines from turkey in addition we understand that turkish firm may also be pursuing deal to import plastic explosives and nitrocellulose from iran 3 s the us wants to provide this information to turkish officials request that they investigate this activity and use all available means to prevent these firms from exporting and importing such arms to and from iran in addition to any domestic turkish authorities that may apply these activities may also be in violation of both united nations security resolution unscr 1747 and us domestic authorities 4 s unscr 1747 unscr 1747 paragraph 5 prohibits iran from supplying selling or transferring from its territory any arms or related materiel it also requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from iran by their nationals or using their flag vessels or aircraft whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of iran the procurement of plastic explosives from iran would violate unscr 1747 5 s the iran north korea and syria nonproliferation act inksna inksna authorizes sanctions against any foreign person that transfers to or from iran north korea or syria goods services or technology controlled by multilateral control lists eg nuclear suppliers group missile technology control regime australia group or wassenaar arrangement of the same kind as those on multilateral control lists but falling below the control list parameters when it is determined that such goods services and technologies have the potential to make material contribution to wmd or cruise or ballistic missile systems on us national control lists for wmdmissile reasons that are not on multilateral lists or with the potential of making material contribution to wmd or cruise or ballistic missile systems accordingly the us is concerned that if the turkish firms proceed with transferring the grenade launchers bullets and ammunition magazines we would be required to report this to the us congress and the turkish firms could be subject to us sanctions 6 s the us is also concerned about the potential exports to iran because one of the items may be of us origin according to defense security cooperation agency dsca records turkey received 181 mk19 40 mm grenade launchers from the united states in 1995 however we do not know definitively if any of these are among the 40 mm grenade launchers contemplated as part of the sale to iran we note however that if any usorigin defense equipment including technical data is retransferred to iran that would violate section 3 of the arms export control act aeca as consequence turkey could lose its country eligibility under the aeca to purchase or lease defense articles including patriot or reaper unmanned aerial vehicles or services or to receive credits or guarantees relating to any purchase or lease action requestobjectives 7 s post is requested to approach got officials to pursue the following objectives and to deliver the talking pointsnonpaper in paragraph 8 below as appropriate thank turkish officials for turkeys continued cooperation and support in preventing the transfer of arms or related material to and from iran inform the got that we are very concerned that turkish firms may be exporting to and importing from iran arms and related material note that the export of wassenaar arrangement controlled items to iran could require report to the us congress under the iran north korea and syria nonproliferation act inksna and may result in sanctions being imposed on the entities and individuals involved point out that the import of arms or related material from iran would violate unscr 1747 which prohibits iran from supplying selling or transferring from its territory any arms or related materiel and requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from iran by their nationals emphasize this is not the time for business as usual with iran remind the got that both the dio and parchin were designated for an asset freeze under unscrs 1737 and 1747 respectively and were sanctioned by the us under executive order eo 13382 strongly urge the got to use available legal authorities including appropriate domestic laws and authorities related to implementing unscrs 1737 and 1747 to immediately terminate these deals and freeze any assets of dio note that iran has long history of providing arms and other military equipment to terrorist groups and that these items could easily end up in the hands of alqaida hamas hizballah and the taliban talking points 8 srel turkey begin talking points we appreciate the government of turkeys continued cooperation and support in preventing the transfer of military equipment and related materiel to and from iran in the spirit of this cooperation we want to share with you some additional information about turkish firms involved in dealings concerning arms and related materiel with iran exports to iran we have information that the turkish firms mercan tanitim dis ticaret ve muhendislik ltd and makina ve kimya endustrisi kurumu mkek may sign contract to export military material to iran the items covered by the contract include fmj full metal jacket 38 caliber and wadcutter bullets 40 mm automatic grenade launchers 556 mm composite magazines for m16 assault rifles and 762 x 39 mm and 762 x 51 mm composite magazines all of which are specified on the wassenaar arrangement munitions list in addition according to the defense security cooperation agency dsca records turkey received 181 mk19 40 mm grenade launchers from the united states in 1995 we do not know definitively if any of these were among the 40 mm grenade launchers contemplated as part of the sale to iran we should note however that if any usorigin defense equipment including technical data is retransferred to iran that transfer would violate section 3 of the us arms export control act aeca as consequence turkey could lose its country eligibility under the aeca to purchase or lease defense articles this could potentially include patriot or reaper unmanned aerial vehicles or services or the ability to receive credits or guarantees relating to any purchase or lease imports from iran in addition to our information related to the export of arms material to iran we also understand some of the same turkish firms involved in the exports are interested in procuring arms material from iran specifically we understand that in september 2009 mercan tanitim was pursuing deal with mkek to import 2000 kg of composition a4 military plastic explosives produced by parchin chemical industries an iranian government military company and an element of the defense industries organization dio we further understand that in september 2009 the turkish companies kolorkim kimya san and mercan tanitim were considering deal to import nitrocellulose nc from iran nc is dualuse material that serves as major component in smokeless gunpowder as subordinate of dio parchin acts on behalf of dio importing and exporting chemical goods throughout the world in april 2007 parchin chemical industries was identified as the final recipient of sodium perchlorate monohydrate chemical precursor for solid propellant oxidizer possibly to be used for ballistic missiles as you know dio is one of seven iranian nuclearrelated entities designated for an asset freeze in the annex to unscr 1737 in addition to being listed in the annex for unscr 1737 dio was sanctioned previously by the united states for wmd or missilerelated activities under the iran and syria nonproliferation act isna the arms export control act aeca executive order eo 13382 and the export administration act we would further note that parchin chemical industries has been designated for an asset freeze under unscr 1747 and us eo 13382 in july 2008 as consequence of its work on behalf of irans ballistic missile program we therefore urge you per unscr 1747 to freeze any assets of parchin chemical industries that may come under turkish jurisdiction we would like to inform you that turkish firms engaged in business with entities designated under eo 13382 are eligible for sanctions if such activities are not halted given the security councils grave concern over irans nuclear and ballistic missile program activities we urge you to encourage all turkish firms to avoid any affiliation with this company iran usdesignated state sponsor of terrorism has long history of providing arms and other military equipment to terrorist groups and other nonstate actors including in iraq afghanistan and lebanon we are concerned that the materials being negotiated for transfer by the turkish companies in question could be diverted by iran to such groups iran has long supplied nonstate actors including terrorist groups such as hizballah with arms and other military equipment the terrorist applications of small arms and light weapons salw are obvious but iran has also supplied terrorists with larger weapons systems that threaten regional security and stability failure to prevent these sales could result in the retransfer of military material and explosives by iran to groups like alqaida hamas hizballah and the taliban this would harm the turkish governments reputation as nato ally and demonstrated opponent of terrorism and would reflect badly on the turkish business community these transactions could also be damaging to our bilateral relationship as these items can be used to kill and severely injure coalition forces in iraq and afghanistan and elsewhere in the region turkey is also required to prevent the transfers from iran as noted in unscr 1747 paragraph 5 which prohibits iran from supplying selling or transferring from its territory any arms or related materiel all states are required to prohibit the procurement of such items from iran by their nationals or using their flag vessels or aircraft whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of iran we believe the arms and explosives acquisitions being pursued by mercan tanitim and mkek with iranian entities would clearly violate this provision of unscr 1747 and that the kolorkim and mercan tanitim deal involving the transfer of nitrocellulose may as well action to prevent such transfers would clearly demonstrate turkeys commitment to the full and effective implementation of unscr 1747 such action would also remove the possibility that these firms could be subject to us sanctions under the iran north korea and syria nonproliferation act inksna we strongly urge you to investigate this information and prevent any transfers being contemplated by the entities involved by using authorities available under turkish domestic law please share with us the results of your investigation at your earliest convenience end points reporting requirement 9 u post is requested to
