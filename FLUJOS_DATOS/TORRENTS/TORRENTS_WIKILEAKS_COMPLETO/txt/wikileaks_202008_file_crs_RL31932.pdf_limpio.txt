the process of negotiating number of trade agreements in addition the 110th congress may also address the issue of trade promotion authority tpa which expired on july 1 2007 these agreements range from bilateral trade agreements with countries that account for meager shares of us trade to multilateral negotiations that could affect large numbers of us workers and businesses during this process congress likely will be presented with an array of data estimating the impact of trade agreements on the economy or on particular segment of the economy an important policy tool that can assist congress in assessing the value and the impact of trade agreements is represented by sophisticated models of the economy that are capable of simulating changes in economic conditions these models are particularly helpful in estimating the effects of trade liberalization in such sectors as agriculture and manufacturing where the barriers to trade are identifiable and subject to some quantifiable estimation barriers to trade in services however are proving to be more difficult to identify and therefore to quantify in an economic model in addition the models are highly sensitive to the assumptions that are used to establish the parameters of the model and they are hampered by serious lack of comprehensive data in the services sector nevertheless the models do provide insight into the magnitude of the economic effects that may occur across economic sectors as result of trade liberalization these insights are especially helpful in identifying sectors expect ed to experience the greatest adjustment costs and therefore where opposition to trade agreements is likely to occur this report examines the major features of economic models being used to estimate the effects of trade agreements it assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the models as an aid in helping congress evaluate the economic impact of trade agreements on the us economy in addition this report identifies and assesses some of the assumptions used in the economic models and how these assumptions affect the data generated by the models finally this report evaluates the implications for congress of various options it may consider as it assesses trade agreements this report will be updated as events warrant

congress plays direct role in formulating and implementing us international trade policies during the 108th 109th and 110th congresses this role gained increased importance as the united states negotiated an unprecedented number of trade agreements the 110th congress may also address the issue of trade promotion authority tpa which expired on july 1 2007 under this authority congress grants the president the authority to enter into certain reciprocal trade agreements 1 currently the united states is involved in multilateral negotiations in the doha development agenda under the auspices of the world trade organization wto on regional level the united states is involved in negotiations on free trade area of the americas ftaa and with countries in southern africa in addition the united states is pursuing bilateral trade agreements with malaysia the united arab emirates and thailand it has concluded agreements with australia bahrain chile morocco oma n singapore south korea the dominican republic and the five countries of the central american common market guatemala honduras nicaragua salvador and costa rica and congress has approved them 2 the bush administration has also concluded agreements with panama peru and colombia separately from ecuador and bolivia the other members of the proposed andeanus free trade agreement building broadbased public consensus on international trade issues often has proved to be difficult especially as certain industries and labor groups within the economy have been adversely affected by international competition based on previous experiences with international trade agreements members of congress and the public may view these agreements with varying degrees of support and opposition while few critics are likely to oppose outright all of the trade agreements being negotiated critics will oppose some aspects of the agreements because certain groups within the economy will incur disproportio nate share of the adjustment costs associated with each trade agreement economists and others have developed economic models that utilize advanced techniques to assess the economic impact of trade agreements on the economy as whole and on specific sectors within the economy to help congress evaluate the potential economic effects this report examines sampling of these studies and offers an assessment of the estimates they have generated g3g151g561g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g15g138g147g152g155g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g156g561

trade liberalization to achieve number of national objectives economists argue however that free trade or the international trade of goods and services free from restrictions and barriers provides nations with broad group of economic benefits18 these benefits are categorized as onetime or static benefits which include gains for consumers and gains for producers and dynamic benefits that accrue over time and can positively affect the longterm rate of growth of country while it is not always possible to measure these effects precisely most economists believe that the net effect of international trade on the national economy as whole is positive ie that the total gains exceed the total costs g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g9g138g146g151g156g561 international trade is one among number of forces that determine the complex makeup of jobs industries wages and products in the economy for an economy such as that in the united states international trade alone does not determine economic expansions or contractions the level of income the level of national output the overall wage rate or even have much of an impact on the distribution of income 19 trade liberalization however by reducing foreign barriers to us exports and by removing us barriers to foreign goods and services helps to strengthen those industries that are the most competitive and productive and to reinforce the shifting of labor and capital from less productive endeavors to more productive economic activities g3g141g147g158g156g157g150g142g151g157g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 economists have long recognized that the longterm production gains associated with greater specialization in the economy create wide range of shortterm adjustment costs as labor and capital are shifted from less efficient industries and activities into more efficient industries and activities these adjustment costs are difficult to measure but they are potentially large over the short run and can entail significant dislocations for some segments of the labor force for some companies and for some communities in nego tiating trade agreements governments are most mindful of the adjustment costs involved and at times are constrained in their ability to fashion such agreements because of opposition by groups within the economy that will bear heavy costs from trade liberalization these costs are especially acute for labor groups within the economy that lack advanced education and training skills th at provide them with the means necessary to be redeployed in other sectors of the economy 18 economic trade theory argues that natural resources which serve as the building blocks of production within an economy are limited at any one point in time whereas demands for those resources are unlimited creating scarcity of resources this scarcity of resources means that nations strive to use their resources in the most efficient way possible in order to maximize the goods and services that are available to their citizens common definition of nations standard of living nations then specialize in the production of certain goods and then trade with other nations for the goods they do not produce these concepts of specialization and trade lead to the conclusion that nation will find that it is in its economic selfinterest to engage in trade with other nations even if it can produce all goods and services at lower cost than any other nation by specializing in the pr oduction of those goods and services in which it is most efficient or in which it has comparative advantage nation maximizes its total productive capability and national income 19 gottschalk peter and timothy m smeeding crossna tional comparisons of earnings and income inequality journal of economic

arise from international trade and therefore from any reduction of trade barriers trade models attempt to estimate these effects indirectly change in trade policies should lead to changes in prices for traded goods and therefore in consumers real incomes as well as to changes in the efficiency of production which will also improve nations overall economic welfare consumption gains mean that consumers benefit from international trade by having broader selection of goods and services available to them at lower prices than are available from purely domestic production also the wider array of product selection likely enhances consumer wellbeing because the competition that arises from international trade also affects the quality of the goods and services that are available in some cases this means that consumers have choice of different levels of quality and that they can acquire not only the particular type of good they desire but also the level of quality they desire since international trade encourages specialization the production gains from trade also mean that consumers are offered greater selection of prices for the goods they consume if consumers choose lower priced goods their real incomes rise which allows them to consume an even broader assortment of goods and services and it expands national incomes

the economy the full range of these effects are difficult for trade models to capture because they extend beyond the estimation timeframe of the models research into dynamic trade models concludes that there are important feedback effects and channels through which trade can alter the structure of markets and the rate of economic growth over the long run by stimulating trade and investment trade liberalization could add to these feedback effects the literature on dynamic trade models concludes that free trade or trade liberalization alters all participants rate of economic growth through number of channels including improved access to specialized capital goods human capital accumulation learningby doing and the transfer of skills and the introduction of new products 20 these activities alter the rate of economic growth by changing the incentives for firms to invest in research and developmenttechnical changewhich in turn leads to permanent changes in the rate of economic growth in assessing this body of re search us international trade commission study asserted that formal empirical application of the new growth theory in trade context has barely started but that the dynamic effects of trade policy changes can yield substantially larger estimates than those based on static models 21 20 krugman paul r rethinking international trade cambridge the mit press 1990

g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 since the stakes involved in liberalizing trade are potentially very large number of economists has attempted to analyze the economic effects of removing barriers to trade in goods and services and to derive monetary values for those effects several different approaches are used to estimate the cost and effect of reducing barriers to trade in goods and services22 the most common approach uses sophisticated mathematical models of the us economy to simulate the effects of trade liberalization the three models used most often are gravity models partial equilibrium models and general equilibrium models gravity models are based on the theory that large economies have greater pull on trade flows than do smaller economies 23 as result the size of an economy and its distance from trading partners are important factors in estimating the monetary value of changes in trading rules partial equilibrium models are used to measure the effects of trade restraints on specific sector rather then on the economy as whole both gravity models and partial equilibrium models provide aggregate estimates of the effects of changes in trading rules and barriers but they offer limited detailed information on the labor and sectoral effects of trade liberalization general equilibrium models or computable general equilibrium cge models attempt to encompass all economic activity within an economy and attempt to estimate the economywide effects of changes in trade or economic policy these models can offer comprehensive assessments of cross and interindustry

organization for economic cooperation and development november 21 2000 23 gravity models have been used for 40 years to estimate trade flows between countries they are based on the conclusion that the volume of exports between any two trading partners is an increasing function of their national incomes and decreasing function of the distance between them although the models have been criticized for lacking strong theoretical basis recent work has demonstrated that the model is consistent with the ricardian and heckscherohlin models an important drawback of the model is that it can estimate only

frequently to analyze the economic effects of changes in trade policy is the model maintained by economists drusilla brown robert m stern and alan v dear dorff at the university of michigan 26 in recent study brown stern and deardorff used the model to estimate the economic effects on the united states of trade negotiations in the multicountry doha development round and various proposed regional and bilateral trade agreements in each scenario the trio begin by using available data to develop base estimate of the present level of trade next they adjust the model to reflect some basic assumptions about how trade negotiations will reduce barriers to trade and then use these estimates to make an adjusted projection of major macroeconomic data the difference between the initial set of data on the economy and the projected macroeconomic data that reflects anticipated changes in the economy as result of trade negotiations gives rise to the numerical estimates of the effects of trade negotiations on trade employment industrial composition and other macroeconomic data one important drawback to the estimates derived by brown deardorff and stern and others is that the general equilibrium models used to derive most of the estimates of trade liberalization do not capture the adjustment costs that inevitably arise from trade liberalization as result the data generated by the models represent the positive effects of changes in trade rules but not the overall net effectspositive and negativeof trade liberalization using the technique described above brown st ern and deardorff developed estimates of the impact on the us economy of reaching an agreement on the various components of the doha development round they adopted number of ke assumptions including an assumption that the negotiations will result in 33 reduction in the barriers to trade in agriculture manufactures and services which is projected to give rise to combined increase in economic activity of 164 billion in the us economy as indicated in table 1 27 this and the other estimates used in this report that were derived by the michigan model estimated permanent change in economic activity between the before and after states of the economy and should not be considered either as an annual change in economic welfare or as an annual amount that can be accumulated over time brown stern and dear dorff also projected the impact on the united states if all barriers to trade worldwide were removed unilaterally which they estimate at 497 billion with current us gross domestic product gdp of over 13 trillion the monetary gains for the us economy associated with the above estimates of trade liberalization would be less than 15 and 45 of gdp respectively 26 now known as the michigan

agricultural sector reflects reductions in agricultural import tariffs export subsidies and production subsidies in this formulation these reductions produce offsetting effects in the agricultural sector itself28 but they induce slightly negative effects on other sectors in the economy as result of changes in prices for agricultural goods and for the us terms of trade prices of exports relative to prices of imports gains in the manufacturing sector arise from reduced foreign tariffs on us manufactured goods exports which increases us exports and domestic manufacturing output and improves production efficiency these gains also represent shift of capital within the economy from less productive activities into manufacturing areas that are more productive and capital flows from abroad in the form of foreign direct investment the large gains indicated in the services sector reflect the relatively high level of foreign barriers us exporters presently face in this sector and the high

trade arrangements would produce modest gains for the us economy as whole given the smaller value of bilateral trade relationship for the us economy these arrangements are expected to be of greater importance to the trading partners because of the size of their trade with the united states relative to the size of their overall level of trade and the size of their respective economies trade agreements with chile singapore australia morocco and south korea for instance are estimated to result in trade benefits for the us economy of 4 billion 17 billion 19 billion 6 billion and 30 billion respectively free trade agreement with the 21 nations that comprise the asiapacific economic association cooperation is projected to offer economic benefits of 244 billion for the united states and surpass those of the doha round most likely because free trade agreements tend to be more comprehensive in terms of the number of industrial and services sectors that are involved compared with the wto negotiations an agreement with asean is projected to yield benefits of 13 billion while free trade agreement of the americas ftaa would give rise to an estimated 68 billion in economic benefits 29 an agreement with the southern african customs union would be expected to yield 126 billion in trade benefits to the united states30 28 reducing agricultural import tariffs lowers import pri ces and spurs the substitution of imports for domestic production causing the domestic industry to contract the extent of this contraction would depend on whether the tariff reduction in the us sector was more or less than in other countries reducing export subsidies lowers world prices similarly reducing production subsidies raises prices the net of these effects depends on the extent of tariffs and

approach provides an estimate of the magnitude of employment effects that might be expected and view of the possible job gains and losses across industrial sectors in the economy as indicated in table 3 and table 4 in the approach used by brown stern and deardorff it is assumed that job losses will be perfectly offset by job gains so that the data in tables 3 and 4 are not projections of the job losses and job gains for each sector instead the model provides an estimate of the relative magnitude of employment effects that might be experienced in various industries thereby identifying those industries that are most vulnerable to increased competition as result of trade liberalization according to this approach global free trade or trade without restrictions would add jobs to the us agricultural sector but reduce jobs in textiles apparel retail trade and services 31 similarly completing the liberalization schedule of the uruguay round of trade talks was shown to result in the largest gains in jobs in agriculture with losses in textiles and apparel although there would be job gains in services due to the more limited schedule of liberalization the doha round with its focus on agriculture and services would generate gains in the agricultural sector but employment continued positive effects that are possible under the proposed terms of the agreement these effects are

drawback to the present state of development of general equilibrium models is that they still do not compare in complexity with the real economy nor do they capture all of the potential economic effects that could arise from trade agreements for instance the michigan model incorporates investment flows that reflect shift of resources within the economy from less productive to more productive economic activities and shift of resources across national borders in the form of foreign investment in the economy 32 as result of trade liberalization inflows of foreign capital would be expected to increase as us industries become more productive and therefore more profitable and attractive to foreign investors by the same token us direct investment abroad would increase as trade liberalization improved the prospects of foreign economies in some estimates the flows of foreign capital comprise large part of the overall economic gains that are derived within the models the models however do not reflect the corresponding appreciation or depreciation of the dollars exchange rate that would accompany such flows these corresponding changes in th dollars value could blunt or reinforce the

the effects of trade liberalization is the dearth of information on barriers to trade in services as table 1 shows the michigan model and other general equilibrium models estimate that the largest gains from trade liberalization likely would arise from the liberalization of trade in rvices this result conforms well with most notions of where additional benefits from trade liberalization may reside and from the dominating role of services in the us economy in developing their estimates of the benefits of liberalizing trade in services brown deardorff and stern use estimates developed by bernard hoekman33 on the average gross operating margins of firms listed on national stock exchanges in 18 countries as proxy for estimating barriers to services trade hoekman bases his estimates on standard economic assumption that the prices firms charge should reflect their marginal costs market restrictions or barriers to entry by foreign firms however drive wedge between market price and marginal cost so that firms operating in protected markets will generate higher than expected profits or experience higher than average rates of return hoekman considers this wedge to be indicative of the magnitude of domestic barriers in services sectors according to hoekmans data all us service sectors except construction had profit margins above average which would imply that all us service sectors except construction have erected relatively high barriers to entry by foreign firms as result the model simulation estimates large employment losses in this sector under global free trade and the doha development round of trade negotiations this conclusion however does not conform well with the estimates of most studies on market openness for instance the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd concluded after analyzing the services sectors of the 30 member countries of the oecd that the us services sector was among the very least restrictive 34 hoekman also offered caution in using the estimates because in general large number of factors will determine the ability of firms to generate high gross operating margins including market size number of firms the business cycle the state of competition policy enforcement the substitutability of products fixed costs etc 35 in addition hoekmans estimates do not differentiate between industries that have high profit margins as result of barriers and those that have high profit margins because they possess some sort of economic competitive advantage without better data on the extent and nature of barriers to trade in the services sectors it will continue to be difficult to develop monetary estimates of the costs of those barriers and therefore estimates of the economic 33 hoekman bernard the next round

after reviewing various studies that have attempted to assign values to national barriers to services trade hoekman concluded summing up although the data situation is not very good quite bit can be done by analysts to quantify the relative magnitude and distribution of the gains of increasing competition on services marketsthe research clearly suggests that potential gains from liberalization may be very large while this work is important and useful the state of the data on barriers is such that in the near term policymakers will have to continue to rely primarily on rules of thumb in determining negotiating priorities 36 brown deardorff and stern make an assumption that the doha round of negotiations will result in 33 reduction in barriers to trade in services agriculture and manufactured goods while such an assumption is essential in order to run the economic model it may not reflect realistically the outcome of the negotiations in addition it is not clear what 33 reduction in the barriers to trade in services would look like since the nature of this sector and the barriers it faces are substantially different from those that exist in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors and the barriers in the services sector do not lend themselves to similar process of reciprocal exchange of market access economic activities that comprise the services sector range from such business services as accounting financial and architectural activities to broad range of consumer services that are not easily defined and categorized 37 anticipating the effects of liberalizing trade in these areas is difficult for most nations because they do not know the full extent of the barriers their exports face in addition nations are grappling with subtle but important distinction in the services sector between liberalizing barriers to market access that involve eliminating discrimination in the treatment of foreign and domestic services providers and governmental activities that involve range of regulatory and supervisory activities especially in the areas of public health and safety the environment and clean water and air standards such issues become even more complicated in countries like the united states where regulatory responsibilities are shared by the federal state and local governments and professional governing bodies

agreements range from bilateral agreements with trading partners that account for very small shares of total us trade to multinational trade agreements that could have significant effect on certain us workers industries and businesses at some point congress may well be asked to consider legislation that implements these agreements in doing so it may consider number of different and perhaps conflicting objectives and it will be presented with data and information that emphasize differing viewpoints on how the agreements will affect the economy and the nation econometric modeling aided by recent advances can assist policymakers in analyzing the economic effects of trade agreements these models are particularly helpful in exploring the effects of trade liberalization in such sectors as agriculture and manufacturing where the barriers 36 ibid p 41 37 for instance see the scope of the us services offer at the doha round crs report rs21492 services negotiations in the wto an overview

estimates in most cases these barriers are represented by tariffs or quotas that can be adjusted on reciprocal basis barriers to trade in the services sector however are proving to be more difficult to identify and therefore to quantify in an econometric model although progress is being made it likely will be some time before the models can provide realistic estimates of the effects of trade liberalization in this sector the models however do provide sense of the magnitude of economic effects that can be expected to occur across sectors in the economy this is especially helpful in identifying which sectors likely will experience the greatest adjustment costs there are drawbacks to using the econometric mode ls such modeling is highly sensitive to the assumptions that are used to establish the parameters of the model and are hampered by serious lack of comprehensive data in the services sector such shortcomings likely will not be as apparent in analysis of bilateral trade agreements between the united states and another trading partner but they likely will become important when the analysis involves large number of countries such as in regional or multilateral trade agreement in addition these models likely understate the adjustment costs that are inevitab ly involved in liberalizing trade and they may well understate the positive effects of trade liberalization over the long run because such effects are beyond the timeframe of the estimates as result it is possible that trade liberalization may have larger positive impact on the us economy over the long term than most economic models indicate nevertheless even if the derived benefits from multilateral negotiations were twice as great as the most optimistic estimates indicate except for unilateral reductions in trade barriers in all countries the overall impact on the us economy is expected to be modest at best the effects on the economy from liberalizing trade on bilateral basis through the proposed bilateral free trade arrangements will yield especially minor gains for the us economy congress may choose to reject any trade agreement in favor of maintaining the status quo or it may choose to circumvent the arduous task of negotiating multilateral trade agreements and unilaterally remove all barriers to us trade while unilaterally removing all trade barriers would please economic purists it is unlikely given the issues it would raise and the prospects that it would leave us negotiators with few bargaining chips during trade negotiations such an action likely would engender public backlash particularly from those labor and trade groups that would be most directly affected by such policy in addition the task of demonstrating the benefits of liberalizing trade is complicated by the fact that the short term adjustment costs associated with trade liberalization are difficult to equate clearly with the benefits that accrue slowly over time this means that it is difficult to demonstrate conclusively at the early stages of negotiations that the longterm benefits of trade liberalization will outweigh the shortterm adjustment costs given these prospects it seems likely to assume that policymakers will weigh the benefits of greater trade liberalization against the anticipated dislocations for workers and industries and determine whether to accept or reject each agreement on the basis of broad set of factors while such analyses cannot forecast every outcome they can aid policymakers in assessing which industries and sectors likely will experience the highest adjustment costs and therefore which industries and groups may need assistance in receiving training or other assistance often congress has addressed tradeinduced changes through trade adjustment assistance for workers and firms displaced as result of trade agreements and trade liberalization such assistance has often been promoted as principle of fairness by spreading out the adjustment costs beyond those most directly affected and as method for persuading those who are affected to buy into the changes by reallocating some of the gains from t hose who benefit to those who bare the greatest share of the adjustment costs these adjustment costs likely will rise if the scope of trade
