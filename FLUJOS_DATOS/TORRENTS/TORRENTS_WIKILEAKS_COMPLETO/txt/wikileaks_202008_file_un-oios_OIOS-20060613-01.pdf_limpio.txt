summary towards the end of 2005 and extending into 2006 oi conducted an audit of the unhcr international professional roster ipr at headquar ters the audit covered activities related to the ipr from its establishment in 2004 the responsibi lity for these activities was the roster unit of th recruitment and postings section during an exit c onference held on 21 april 2006 oios presented the audit results to the head of the rost er unit positive reaction was received to the recommendations made overall assessment oios assessed the establishment and startup manage ment of the ipr as above average this was new initiative in unhcr that needed dedicated input and creativity by dhrm staff as well as close support and observance by management overall apart from normal teething problems it was well managed and monitored closely and the activities were reassessed early on allowing corrective action in timely manner in oios opinion the ipr pilot project was successful and although some enhancements are still required it has to great extent helped unhcr in meeting certain recruitment and staff adva ncement needs call for candidates the annual calls for candidates attracted an increa sed number of applications each year it has resulted in fairly wide range of applications by job profiles the most popular was for protection functions the roster unit made concerted efforts to attract more applicants with technicallogistics backgrounds by targeting them w hen announcing the call for candidates as well as making presentations to universities in cer tain countries to raise awareness to the roster to attract and motivate potential candidates to app ly entry tests the entry tests which were initially mandatory for external candidates and optional for internal candidates have proved very helpful in the roster process by clearly identifying strong candidates through its rating system the policies and procedures surrounding the entry test have developed since the launch of the roster all pote ntial candidates are required to pass the entry test before being accepted the tests formulation has been changed to assess competencies and skills rather than knowledge of the and unhcr nd of its policies and procedures the tests have been conducted in english but certai n sections allowed candidates to demonstrate their skills and competency in french or arabic ios agrees with such an approach as competency in other languages is very important sidering unhcrs rotation policy and the fact that unhcr has already identified that the num ber of staff with competency in french should be increased placing candidates on shortlists after candidates pass the screening and entry test they are placed on the roster and can be presented on the shortlists given to managers selec ting personnel for vacancies for selected candidates an interview was not mandatory but it w as oios view that the manager responsible for the selection process should conduct an intervi ew this would aim to verify the test results and to assess whether the candidate had the require d language and other skills necessary to effectively carry out the functions to be assigned ipr database system all relevant data on the roster is kept in stand alone database system which was created and developed within the roster unit it was customma for the roster from common openly available system oios noted there were user gu ides or other documentation available on its functions or processes and guaranteed technical support oios recommended that this be addressed to ensure the integrity and

31 32 34 v acknowledgement 35 i introduction 1 oios carried out an audit of unhcrs interna tional professional roster ipr during the period from late 2005 extending into early 2006 the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the profession practice of internal auditing 2 as unhcr normally fills posts through reass ignments and the rotation of internal staff there have been some difficulties in filling vacant posts particularly in the least attractive locations some posts had to be readver tised causing long delays in filling them as result the ipr was established through iom02 2004 fom022004 dated 7 january 2004 as pilot project to enable unhcr to maintain list of qualified candidates that could be included with the vacancy shortlists for manager s review if there was an insufficient number of internal applicants ie less than three the roster aimed at filling entrylevel international positions p2 and p3 in timely m anner with qualified professionals 3 the roster contains data on prescreened and preselected candidates who meet various unhcr requirements and can be employeddepl oyed by unhcr within relatively short period it includes various categories of hcr internal staff staff and persons from the common system as well as external candidate s also staff at the g category jpos and unvs can apply to be included on the roster it can therefore serve as an instrument for promotions and assignments to higher or more perman ent employment categories in unhcr 4 the ipr is maintained by the division of hum an resources managementroster unit the roster subunit consists of two gs regular staf f and occasionally one temporary assistant reporting to the head of the recruitment unit which also includes the jpoconsultants subunit additional resources wer allocated when required eg during the prescreening process or the conducting of the entry tests during these periods the roster unit sourced assistance from their colleagues of th postings unit or from staff in between assignments for the design development and the ad ministration of the entry tests the roster unit hired assistance from the united nations syste m staff college unssc in turin 5 apart from staff resources direct costs are associated with the ipr initially some travel and other costs for candidates were incurred however such costs are longer accepted 6 the findings and recommendations contained i n this final audit report have been discussed with the officials directly responsible f or the audited activities during the exit conference held on 21 april 2006 draft of this r eport was sent to the director division of human resources management and the head of the rost er unit on 2 may 2006 on which comments were received on 30 may 2006 and are refle cted as appropriate in this final report dhrm has responded positively to all of the audit r ecommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 7 the main objectives of the audit were to eva luate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls established for the international professi onal roster and to assess the level of improved recruitment actions af ter its establishment 2 with regard to timeliness of recruitment and the in creased level of appropriate candidates for selection purposes determine the level of compliance with the requirem ents established under iom022004 fom022004 and rev 1 assess the appropriateness of the ipr database info rmation including the regular updating and maintenance of the roster system iii audit scope and methodology 8 the audit focused on activities undertaken d uring the period from the establishment of the roster in 2004 until early 2006 it included review of two calls for candidates the pre screening process the design and administration of the entry tests including the marking process it also reviewed the management and admini stration of the ipr data system and the recruitment procedure including the shortlisting f candidates for selection by managers the audit activities included interviews with staff an alysis of applicable data and review of the ipr data system as well as available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations call for candidates 9 since the establishment of the ipr there ve been three annual calls for candidates they were advertised in either december or january via the unhcr broadcast system for the attention of internal candidates and on the unhcr w ebsite for external candidates in july 2004 there was an exceptional second call for inter nal candidates the calls for internal candidates set out all the criteria required and co ntained relevant information concerning the application eg recruitment profiles specific igibility criteria deadlines as well as the required documents and application forms that were to be completed for external candidates all the necessary information concerning the applic ation and the respective forms were provided on the unhcr website the period for recep tion of applications was about four to six weeks from the time the advertisement was place d major communication or technical problems were identified by the audit in this area 10 the calls for candidates were successful s many applications were received it is also interesting to note that while the number of xternal candidates increased considerably every year the number of internal candidates reduc ed drastically the relevant details are as follows 2004 applicants eligible passed test inc in ipr unhcr staff 602 281 test optional 281 external candidates 598 533 252 252 exceptional 2 nd internal call unknown 100 test optional 100 2005 applicants eligible passed test inc in ipr unhcr staff 162 82 test optional 82 external candidates 2193 932 180 180 unvs 150 75 16 16 3 11 the 2006 call resulted in over 4000 applic ations from which well over 1400 candidates passed the initial screening done to firm their qualifications and were offered to sit the entry test on 30 may 2006 of those there were over 1000 external candidates and 420 internal ones the above figures show the growing interest in the ipr as total applications moved from 1200 to 2500 to 4000 over three calls from 2004 to 2006 12 at the end of each calendar year the ipr u nit writes to the candidates and asks them to express their interest in remaining on the roste r at the end of 2005 about 650 candidates were requested to confirm their interest around 1 70 candidates did not revert within the deadline which appeared to the roster unit to be reasonable number as likely they got jobs elsewhere as part of this annual exercise candid ates were asked to send updates on their curriculum vitae so that they can be recorded in th ipr database 13 during 2004 and 2005 about 215 unhcr entry level vacancies mainly p2 and p3 posts were filled with roster candidates there w as rather negative feedback by managers concerning the shortlisted candidates for technical job profiles eg logistics the roster unit discussed these concerns with the managers inv olved and initiated action to improve the situation in order to increase the number and qual ity of roster candidates with technical background the roster unit contacted other interna tional organizations that may have had pool of suitable candidates the ipr information wa s also posted on targeted websites which may have been frequented by potential candidates f urthermore there have been presentations from unhcr representatives in university circles in the usa norway and japan in which the ipr has been presented and discussed in an effo rt to attract and motivate potential candidates to apply recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management should continue to target potential candidates with required backgrounds to ensure that the roster will meet unh cr recruitment needs for all functions rec 01 14 in response dhrm stated that the ipr unit will tinue to request assistance of technical departments in unhcr such as public infor mation and supplylogistics in order to expand the information on the ipr the outcome f the 2006 ipr will show whether the expanded and targeted publicity has resulted in an increased number of suitable candidates for these profiles oios is pleased to note the action to be taken and will monitor the outcome of the 2006 ipr 15 only the candidates having met the eligibil ity criteria were considered for the roster to determine whether applicants met these criteria the candidates were prescreened by checking their curriculum vitae if it was difficu lt to determine whether the candidates met the requirements the cases were presented discuss ed and resolved within panel the relatively small roster unit needed assistance to c ope with the large number of interested candidates and to complete the related prescreenin g the recruitment unit will be discontinued on 30 june 2006 and the roster subun it will be attached to the postings unit reporting to the head of that unit as of 1 july 200 6 4 b entry tests 16 according to 18 of the iom022004 f om022004 and its subsequent revision external candidates applying for the roster were re quired to take an entry test while internal candidates were given the option as whether to sit the test or not in 2005 it was decided that irrelevant of their status all future applicants s hould sit the entry test and only the successful ones be considered for the roster only candidates applying for finance posts who have successfully passed the competitive finance exam ination or the nce were exempt 17 the high commissioner announced on 19 decem ber 2005 that henceforth the ipr test was mandatory for all ipr applicants candidates f or finance posts as referred to above were except as was those for field safety adviser posts are not required to undergo the ipr test since they are subject to rigorous selection and vetting process which involves the secretariat undss previously unsecord 18 since the establishment of the ipr two ent ry tests have been conducted the first on 18 march 2004 and the second on 28 april 2005 of t he 381 candidates who attended the first entry test total of 305 candidates 53 internal nd 252 external 80 per cent passed almost 800 applicants took the second entry test in april 2005 and this time the overall pass rate was lower and only 204 25 per cent candidate s passed the disparity in the percentage passing the tests was due to the different approach taken when 2004 is compared to 2005 the passmark for the 2004 test was set after the g radingassessment while for the 2005 test the passmark 50 out of 100 was set in advance an d was strictly applied oios understands that several candidates only just failed eg 49 48 out of 100 in few cases borderline applicants were reconsidered and included in the ro ster after an examination of their files 19 dhrm stated that the disparity in the percentage co uld be explained by the fact that the first entry exam was done in noncontrolled nvironment and the second one in controlled environment candidates who passed the ntry test in 2004 had full working day to return the exam and could work from any location even from home in 2005 candidates were given fixed time venue and focal points wer designated to monitor the test location in 2006 the test will again be conducted in contr olled environment 20 the initial intention was to evaluate inter alia the applicants analytical skills awareness of the international environment knowled ge of the united nations and refugee affaires skills in english and computer literacy demonstrated working knowledge of french as well as another official language was to be taken into account accordingly dhrm developed the entry tests in collaboration wit h divisions and functional units at headquarters and in consultation with the unssc th staff college was also involved in the grading process and provided comprehensive evalua tion of the 2004 entry test dhrm is in the progress of implementing the recommendations ma in the evaluation report these mainly relate to modifying the test structure towar ds more general test to examine candidates core competencies dhrm further explained that the staff development s ection was charged with validation and preparation of the future ipr test and in this capacity invited the unssc in 2004 for postfacto validation of questions and methodology as well coordinated the stakeholders from other concerned d ivisions dos dip in 2005 they were involved in validation and correction procedures h owever the ipr unit does all the work from the initial call to the candidates until the f irst screening furthermore ipr unit 5 provides the database of all screened candidates as well as the focal points to the unssc so that they can focus on the design of the entry exam and its final administration 21 the entry test was in english however the f irst entry test in march 2004 gave candidates the choice to answer 4 out of 10 questio ns of part iv in french or arabic to demonstrate their language skills it is also plann ed that the 2006 candidates can choose to answer some of the questions in french oios is of the opinion that language skills are essential to perform unhcr assignments worldwide be cause of the unhcr principle of staff rotation therefore the entry test should b designed not only to test the candidates proficiency in english but also their knowledge of other unhcr working languages dhrm stated that considering the fact that important ref ugee situations are in francophone areas candidates who are proficient in french will be giv the opportunity to reply in that language to one of the sections in the forthcoming 2006 ipr test apart from that unhcr will continue to ensure to the maximum extent poss ible that ipr candidates are appointed who are proficient in at least one other official u n language oios is pleased to note dhrm agrees with our recommendation and we will monitor its implementation recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management should not limit the entry test to assess candidate s proficiency in english but design it to also assess their abil ities and level of proficiency in other unhcr working languages re c02 c functional clearance 22 each candidate can apply for up to three di fferent occupational groups job profiles the candidates should possess the necessary and req uired qualifications work experience and core competencies as defined and described in the sample job profiles for each occupational group to be considered for finance functions can didates have to pass the competitive finance examination 23 to assess whether roster candidates have th required skills and qualifications the respective unhcr sectionsunits eg dip for prote ction officers check the statements made in the candidates curriculum vitae and applica tion forms against the requirements if candidates meet all the criteria and requirements s outlined in the job profiles they are endorsed by the respective occupational group if r ejected for specific group they could still qualify for another group dhrm added that candidates who are not endorsed by any of the technical departments are placed in the field offi cer profile group for which there is endorsement requirement d roster unit processing and data maintenance 24 staff members under the supervision of the roster unit are responsible for the input and update of the database the data has to be cons tantly updated whenever the status of candidate on the roster changes such as when cand idate is recruited oios testchecked the data entered and did not find any major errors or f aults in all sample cases examined by oios the personnel data in the ipr correlated with the information of other available sources eg p11 application forms 6 25 the roster unit discussed with the msrp pro ject team the possibility of the incorporation of this data system into the msrp hum an resources module although there is firm planning on this yet it would be to unh crs advantage to have fully integrated system for example an automated prescreening proc edure within the system would be very helpful 26 the msrp hr module will include an automate d online application process to handle ipr applications as and when candidates will be invited to apply for the roster the msrp hr module related to recruitment and postings is scheduled to go live as of 1 november 2006 the next ipr invitation for which date has been fixed yet will make use of the new online application system the info rmation in the existing ipr database is to be incorporated in the new msrp hr module 27 oios also met with the management performan ce section of dhrm and reviewed some performance appraisal reports par of staff r ecruited through the roster this allowed oios to get some feedback on the performanc of roster candidates in general the work performance reporting was positive and simila r to that of other staff members only in few cases especially for external roster candidate s was it considered that there was some lack of an introduction period to enable them to get more familiar with unhcrs work rules guidelines and procedures before being emplo yed unhcr may want to consider the tracking and monitoring of pars from the roster can didates particularly the first cycle after recruitment 28 dhrm agreed that ideally new recruits from the ipr should come to headquarters for an induction but it is dependent on the budget of the hiring departments and their operational needs since these new recruits from th ipr are often sent to emergency operations priority is given to their quick deploy ment tracking system is in place to the extent that newly recruited staff are given oney ear fixedterm contract upon appointment which may only be extended upon recommendation fr om the supervising manager such recommendation has to be supported by performance appraisal report the fact that extensions have been recommended for virtually all new recruits indicates that the screening process while still open to further improvement is highly successful in identifying qualified and suitable candidates placing candidates on shortlists 29 oios reviewed the process of placing candid ates on the general recruitment shortlists for vacant posts whenever there are less than thr ee internal compendium candidates eligible persons from the roster are included for c onsideration by managers the shortlists are compiled and prepared by the postings unit and candidates are taken from the ivn view the database field that keeps track of which candidate applied to which vacancy notice there is mechanism in place to avoid roster candidate being recommended for more than one post this is taken into account ong with the order of preference by managers at the appb when decisions are made 30 candidates from the roster who are appoint ed through the appb or who have rejected offers have their names promptly blocked nd they are longer visible under the normal view of most users of the roster it theref ore eliminates the risk of including someone longer available on shortlist 7 31 frequently roster candidates were selected for post without being interviewed as interviews are not mandatory part of the employme nt process channelled through the roster in oios view managers responsible for the selectio n process should arrange interviews with the candidates particularly to confirm the entry t est results and to assess basic competencies dhrm fully agrees that as part of the recruitment p rocess the recommended candidates should be interviewed by the manager of the post an d that this should be reflected in the recommendation managers are currently strongly enc ouraged to do so it is intended to include this as requirement in the revised appb p rocedural guidelines due to enter into force in september 2006 oios is pleased to note the proposed action and t his requirement will be included in the revised appb guidelines recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management should ensure that candidates selected from the int ernational professional roster be interviewed by managers resp onsible for the selection process before being offered an emplo yment with unhcr to confirm the entry test results and to asse ss basic competencies rec03 f ipr database system 32 the ipr data system was created and develop ed in the roster unit by temporary assistant who has changed functions and longer works in the unit the system is easy to use and has sufficient features to manage the roste r eg search tools by different criteria occupational groups languages external internal candidate printout functions statistics etc and it was continuously modified and improved since its introduction appropriate access controls such as passwords limited and restricted use are in place to prevent misuse or unauthorized use of the data and the system 33 oios noted that the developer of the system whenever needed to provide some technical assistance could still be contacted in u nhcr in 2005 nonetheless this is tenuous arrangement oios noted that distapplicati ons development and support section had not been involved in any maintenance or support for this system if the system is going to continue in the longerterm their involvement may be required 34 oios found that there was backup copy f the data system and standard data backup procedures were followed furthermore ther are user or maintenance guides available or any other documented information on t he system although so far there have not been any serious or major technical problems with t he data system oios considers the above shortcomings as an unnecessary risk as the system contains valuable information that should not be lost or corrupted dhrm explained that the ipr database is located on the main unhcr server dhrm ldrive and techline and lanops are responsible for the backup system on daily basis dhrm nevertheless fully agrees that there is risk involved in maintaining homemade database and the issue i s being addressed through the introduction of the msrp hr module for recruitment in november 2006 8 recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management should ensure the availability at all times of adeq uate technical support and basic information on the systems funct ions and processes rec04 v acknowledgement 35 i wish to express my appreciation for the ssistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of the division of human reso urces management
