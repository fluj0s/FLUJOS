armys modular redesign issues for congress summary in what the army describes as the most significant army restructuring in the past 50 years it is redesigning its current active duty division force to 48 brigade combat team bct force the army national guard and army reserves will also redesign their forces in similar fash ion the planned addition of active duty brigades and the conversion of army nati onal guard brigades could provide larger force pool of deployable combat units to ease the burden on units presently deployed and possibly to shorten the length of time that units are deployed on operations the army has three other concurrent initiatives underway that it considers inextricably linked to its brigadecentric redesign rebalancing to create new high demand units stabilizing the force to foster unit cohesion and enhance predictability for soldiers and their families and cyclical readiness to better manage resources and to ensure ready force for ope rations these initiatives involve substantial cultural policy organizational and personnel changes some experts believe that modular redesign selective rebalancing stabilizing and cyclical readiness are prudent acti ons that should provide the army with additional deployable units and also eventually bring stability to soldiers and their families as long as additional sign ificant long term troop commitments arise many feel that these initiatives could help ease the stress on both the active and reserve forces as the army continues its modular conversion it ma have to contend with budget personnel and equipment shor tages which could impede plans to build this new force as intended some also question if the army can afford both its future combat system fcs progra m and its modularity program the 110th congress might decide to examine these and other concerns in greater detail this report will be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32476contents i s s u s f r c n g r s s 1 background 2

combat and support units to better meet cu rrent and future ope rational requirements this redesign effort as well as associat ed rebalancing stab ilization and cyclical readiness initiatives are deemed important by proponents as they are intended to sustain both the active and reserve army through potentially long term manpower and resource intensive war on terror the overall issue facing congress is how well the armys modularity program is progressing and what are some of the issues affecting this major redesign effort also of critical importance is the armys ability to fund both the future combat system fcs program and its modularity prog ram concurrently key poten tial oversight questions for the 110th congress can be summarized as follows how will the administrations pr oposed increase of 65 thousand soldiers impact the modularity program are some brigade combat teams vulnerable to enemy armor is the armys overlyoptimistic in its ability to fully fund modularity and the future combat system fcs how are the armys rebalancin g stabilization and cyclical readiness efforts progressing and what are their associated costs how does the armys force gene ration model impact the manning and equipping of army modular forces the 110th congresss decisions on these and other related issues could have significant implications for us national security army funding requirements

in the rotational pool of ready units by at least 50 army operating forces that require less augmentation when deployed reducing the requirement for ad hoc organizations creation of deployable jo

2007 announcement that it would increase the size of the active army by 65 thousand soldiers23 there were concerns that it would be difficult to fully man modular forces the armys decision to convert to modular force structure significantly changed the requirement for army officers the armys previous plan to convert to 42 modular bc ts increased the armys requirement for officers by 41 31 approximately 88 of this increase 3635 represent requirements for captains and majors this requirement for captains and majors has resulted in projected shortage of 2708 in fy2007 and an additional shortage of 3716 in fy2008 in these grades the recent announ cement that the army would now create 48 bcts and additional modular support br igades will undoubtedly exacerbate these projected shortages in the grades of captain and major and might also create additional shortages in both officer and enlisted grades these potential shortages might significantly affect the ability of the army to adequately man not only bcts but also modular support units if this is the case th army might be hardpressed to create the additional 6 bcts that it needs to relieve the stress on the army equipment issues as previously stated the army is also faced with equipment shortages as it implements its modularity program according to gao modular brigade combat teams will require significant increases in the levels of equipment particularly command control and communications quipment wheeled vehicles and artillery and mortars24 command control and communicati ons equipment are of

reduce requirements for immediate mobilization of reserve units28 stabilizing the force this initiative transitions the army from an individual replacement manning system to unitfocused system this stabilization initiative is applicable only to active component forces the objective is to keep soldiers in units longer in order to reduce historically high turnover rates of soldiers nd their leaders and to foster unit cohesion and opera tional effectiveness29 in addition this initiative is intended to provide stability to army families and could ultimately save the army money as it could result in fewer moves for soldiers and their families cyclical readiness army force generation30 in fy2006 the army implemented new readiness system modeled on the cyclical readiness systems of the other services to replace its old tiered readiness system which according to th army created haves and haves not culture with most of the haves not consisting of army national guard and reserve units under this readiness system called the army force generation model units will move through structured progression of unit readiness over time intended to produce predictable periods of availability of trained ready and equipped units available for deployment under this model units will fall into one of three pools the resetretrain pool the ready pool and the available pool in the resetretrain pool units will not be ready or availabl for major combat operations but could conduct homeland security and disaster relief operations its in the ready pool are conducting training and receiving additiona l personnel and equipment to bring them up to full strength and units in this pool can be deployed to meet surge requirements if need be after passing the ready pool units are assigned to the available pool for one year where they beco eligible to deploy for combat and other operations the army hopes to main tain 20 bcts 14 active and 6 reserve in the available pool on continuous basis the army maintains that the army force generation model for readiness will result in steadystate supply of 20 read fullyresourced bcts and supporting units stabilized personnel to join train ploy and

constrained resources particularly equipment based on unit deployment schedules more predictable unit deployments for soldiers their families and employers and opportunity to synchronize unit r eadiness with wide variety of institutional army requirements such as professional schooling needed for promotion and military specialtyspecific training potential oversight issues for congress how will the increase in the size of army impact modularity congress may decide to examine how the proposed 65000 soldier increase will impact the armys modularity program wh ile there are few details available dod officials have proposed crea ting six additional active com ponent bcts about 21000 soldiers which would leave 44000 soldiers to be used for other purposes given personnel shortages in the existing bcts nd modular support units it is reasonable to assume that an unspecified number of the remaining 44000 soldiers will be used to fill these shortages this scenario could result in the inability to create other types of units either functiona l or multifunctional that are needed to support the addition of six additional bcts another consideration is the equipmen t issue reports suggest that current modular forces are significantly short of equipment in wide variety categories these shortages combined with equipment loses from operations in iraq and afghanistan have compelled the army to adopt the ar my force generation model where units are only fully equipped wh they deploy on operations these circumstances call into question the armys ability to even marginally equip new units for example new heavy brigade combat team would require the procurement of 177 armored vehicles and 870 wheeled vehi cles of all classes if new army units are less than optimally equipped there is potential for significant increase in wear and tear on the armys existing equipmen t as more units use disproportionally smaller amount of equipment with this increase in equipment wear and tear will likely come an increased requirement for funds for reset and equipment replacement an expansion of 65000 soldiers might also have an impact on current and future basing plans new units will likely require additional training areas barracks and motor pools as well as family housing even if funds are available today to accommodate these needs the real estate at home or overseas may not be available and the requisite physical facilities may take many years to construct thereby precluding the armys ability to station these forces where intended httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32476crs14 infantry and stryker bct vulnerabilities infantry units historically have been vul nerable to enemy armored forces and even when equipped with antitank systems are considered to be at disadvantage when attacking enemy armored units these vuln erabilities however could be exacerbated when enemy armored forces are equipped with explosive reactive armor and active protection systems because infantry and st ryker bcts constitute early entry forces they might conceivably come up against thes enhanced enemy armored forces before the heavy bcts can be deployed and find themselves at distinct tactical disadvantage congress might decide to examine this issu of infantry and stryker bct firepower vulnerabilities with the army in greater detail such an examination could address potential organizational or w eapons systems changes to pr ovide enhanced lethality or changes to employment doctrine that might mitigate these bcts vulnerabilities the armys funding assumptions the army contends that it can afford both modularity and the fcs program but this affordability appears to be predicated on an increased army budget more in line with historical precedents while it is not unreasonable to assume that the army may receive greater share of the defense budget as it attempts to reorganize the army and at the same time modernize some consider it highly unlikely that the defense budget will increase relative to gdp to wo rld war ii levels as the army suggests congress may wish to address the armys apparent assumption to insure that the army is not basing the funding of its modularity and fcs programs on what many believe are unrealis tic expectations rebalancing and stabilizing the force congress might act to review in greater detail the armys rebalancing and stabilization initiatives the army has characterized these initiatives as critical to the modular transformation of the army but little is publically known as to how well they are progressing in terms of new units that have been created or how stabilization is affecting unit cohesion or family life for soldiers given that these two initiatives involve significant structural and cultural change for the army they also likely have significant budgetary implications that some feel are not adequately discussed as part of army modularity cyclical readiness congress may decide to examine the armys force generation model of cyclical readiness in greater detail this new model departure from the longstanding tiered readiness system will supposedly provide th army with trained and ready force pool of 20 active and reserve bcts at all times such change will likely have significant impact on how the active and reserve army sta ffs equips and trains its units and will almost certainly have budget ary and resource implications that congress might decide to review some argue that while it is beneficial to reduce readiness standards in wartime others maintain that it permits the army to under resource units in terms of personnel and equipment while advertising 48 brigade combat team army that in reality it does not have in terms of soldiers and equipment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32476crs15
