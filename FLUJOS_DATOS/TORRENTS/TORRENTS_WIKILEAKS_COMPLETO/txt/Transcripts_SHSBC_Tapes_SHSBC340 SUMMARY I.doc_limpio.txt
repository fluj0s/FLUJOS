summary i lecture given on 24 september 1963 thank you well weback in the running here where we were year ago twentyfour is that it audience yes twentyfour sept ad 13 now this is what youre going to get your talk about today summary now you may not be aware of the fact completely in concrete way but from the 24th of july the lecture of the 24th of july on down to thursdays lecture of this week you have complete summary of modern scientology on all levels and all processes on those levelsthe tapes from 24 july on forward until the tapes of this coming thursday which is the 26th of september and in those twentyfive lectures you have totality and summary of modern scientology nothing lying outside the province of those lectures has any great validity as far as cases are concerned theres been work over long long period of time all of that work has value its flabbergasting how much material exists all the basic material of course is of great value and quite valid as far as technical application is concerned in the resolution of eases you have from the 24th on through that also happens to include presentation of scientology to the public this is the direct and definite result of the sprint i started on in january to speed up research along this particular line and the material which you have in your hands now is workable beyond allanybodys dream on the subject it does not mean that case is easy to handle but it means that if you know this material and can apply it you can handle case the finite results are beyond anything anybody had ever hoped for this comes oddly enough at time when psychology and other nineteenthcentury materials had thrown in the sponge and the head of london psychology department the other day made the announcement that mental treatment did not work and nobody was ever made well by any mental treatment of any kind whatsoever interesting isnt it theyre trying to make wrong in the direction of our continued developmentas one of the more fantastic chapters in the area first they said you know nobody ever changed and we proved to them that people did change so they haventthen they said well they could change people and then they threw out and invalidated all of their own tests and now as were walking forward and so forth why the word is out that psychotherapy works there is such thing as psychotherapy this from people who make their total living of psychotherapy i suppose theyre going back to advising advertisers how to trick people with subliminal advertising which was their basic function anyway psychology lasted its time out and is mostly devoted today to getting somebody fired who wasnt nice to him in the canteen by giving him bad personality report or aptitude test for his job thats cynical isnt it but actually the subject must have some use and i think maybe losing people their jobs is about the highest they ever could have attained anyway its really regrettable where psychology is operating on the part of industry regulating this because regulating jobs and hirings and aptitudes for the excellent excellent reason that they will defame themselves you see theyll get in trouble and then mental healing will get in trouble but theyre now in position where they say theyre saying mental healing mental treatment things you can do with the mind these things dont exist at all this is the most remarkable thing anybody ever heard of since that is the first basic on which they were founded of course that something could be done they have reason for existence now lets take off along that line you of course have existence as an auditor unless you can bring about change in case thats terribly fundamental thats terribly fundamental now were in the drivers position today of being able to say that if you have followed the rules you will get change in the case now that is horrible position to put practitioner in because the practitioner is then hung by the fact that if the pc didnt get change then it must be the fault of the practitioner in some fashion or another remember it can also be the fault of the pc somebody goes out and spends all night in the bar and that sort of thing and comes in for his session somebody who is breaking rules in pushing his ptps and overrestimulation in present time up to the zenithzenithzenith naturally is influencing his own case too i had an example of this the other day i did my mail us mail sunday and it isnt that anything new or strange has happened you see but terrific amount of restimulative material of one kind or another which i immediately couldnt get at that is to say i couldnt get at the source of the situation right at that moment i got restimulated and the first hour or so of my session was just about the lousiest mess i think ive looked at for some time and for that to happen to is bit of clincher there we were also running slight errors and so forth in the puttogethers of the gpms i was running but nevertheless i had been working very hard and it stacked up tremendous amount of correspondence and that sort of thing was trying to take care of situations i couldnt take care of very directly or immediately and i just merely felt sorry for the washington staff i just got to thinking about sitting there and being slugged with all this bunk thats being handed out and around living in highly restimulative atmosphere governora government which has apparently turned insurrectionist and is against the people and so on and it isnt that theyre doing anything really different than any other business in the united states i made it my business one time or another to find out how bothered other businesses in the united states were and i did little canvass and i went all around to find out and theyre bothered man theyre bothered perhaps more than we are so that it isnt any direct action its just that theyve got too much government they havent got anything to do there isnt that much crime so they have to invent crime and so on and they do they invent it for the little shopkeeper and for this person and that person and so forth and i just feltstarted feeling sorry for these people got restimulated to the degree of living in lawless type state or government at the behest of the powers that were and i it simply just upset to that degree that i went straight from doing that folder you see straight into the session see bang bang you see trying to cope with bank feeling sorry for the washington staff you see cope with the bank you know and so forth and so on terrificthis condition youve had it all on present time problem of course but i was looking at something very directly because it wasnt present time problem see beyond the fact that one cant immediately say and straighten it all out dont you see there was problem connected with it it was just restimulation pure and simple of one kind or another situations which exist which you cant do anything about dont you see it doesnt even have to be special ri you see get the idea you dont have to blame it on the particularities or significances of bank dont you see its just you are being you have certain pride certain belief in yourself certain confidence certain feelings that you should be able to do things in life you have some kind of belief or feeling that the sphere in which you exist should be calmer because of your existence in it you find yourself incapable of immediately effecting result to straighten something out and bang restimulation it doesnt have to be an ri on the basis of well you dont have to have an ri government to be restimulated by bunch of guys shooting at you you get the idea so the upshot of the situation is that pc has great deal of bearing on this sort of thing if id had any sense whatsoever i letwould have let it cook you see till next week or something like that instead i do all this mail i get all restimulated i go into the session the auditor has horrible time an hour or so man were really climbing the wall see too muchtoo much split of attention well this becomes very important factor in processing extremely important and it is so important it is so extremely important that this has been theyou probably think you have seen many breakthroughs you have you have undoubtedly but you thinkyou think that they lie hither and there actually they lie right here in this direction finding the pcs own goal and his present time gpm and then finding as you can the two top ris which is his service facsimile becomes feasible and running the actual gpms of the pc becomes feasible only when you handle that which hits the restimulation square on the head which are the present time ris which is also the service facsimile those two top ris of the actual gpm that are riding in present time are the service facsimile the interreaction between those two risthat is the service facsimile so you can approach it through r3sc you can scoop this stuff off and get tone arm motion youre bound to get tone arm motion in that area now you can go ahead and destimulate the person to the best thing that you can now ill get on with the rest of this story about this particular session it took us until the next session to find an ri you see it took us until the next session to find an ri that even vaguely fitted this situation but because one was simplyyou know something fitted the situation and immediately we pulled that out the restimulation diminished but the ri wasnt even really directly connected with the restimulation dont you see now the present time environment and the present time ris are what you as an auditor are handling and lets not get off into whole lot of balderdash or monkey business because that is what you are handling i dont care what process you are doing r1c or any process that you are doing you are handling the two top ris of the pcs last gpm now the reason it is possible to return to the technology which was first represented in the form of r3m2 and which is carried forward consistently under the heading of r3 and which is to be found in all the records under routine 3 dont you see consistently and which has now got to be upgraded because of the new classification levels to r4that technology was difficult to manage simply because we didnt hit the present time gpm goal and the two top ris of that gpm now as long as you tried to do the rest of the bank the earlier goals earlier gpms do earlier patterns all of this kind of thing your poor pc is sitting there being hammered to death on his present time gpm bow bow bow bow bow bow and man he hasnt got enough attention to put it back down the bank at all you could almost redefine clear only you cant achieve it technically but you could define it theoretically as somebody who had the two top ris destimulated or out just the two top ris of the last gpm you understand now that gpm has got maybe twenty thirty forty ris see its got those reliable items twenty thirty forty reliable items there they are great big cracking reliable items you know bong they make 212 item you know look like alook like aabout as offensive as an ant at sunday school picnic see as compared to jet bomber landing in the middle of the picnic table see the difference is about of that magnitude so what are we going to do all processing then cones up against the two top ris the two top reliable items which are sitting in present time from the gpm which is sitting in present time now of course that gpm stretches back and these gpms the pcs actual gpm plots against time and the time is pretty vast for one gpm its also very interesting they measure i suppose at the absolute minimum would be thousands of years per ri the minimum now look at the crackshow long do you think itd take you to run out all the engrams of the past two hundred lives of the pc how long do you think that would take oh brother you wouldnt be able to do it and yet that whole period is probably covered by one pair of ris thats fascinating isnt it get those out of the way get those things destimulated and that whole area ceases to be aberrative just like that two hundred lifetimes worth of engrams gone up in smoke get some idea of the order of magnitude one ri not just the whole helatrobus implants but the bear the gorilla helatrobus right on down to the train goals and the betweenlives implants one pair of ris now of course some of you have been diffident and some of you have managed to put two or three in during the period and here and there youre going to find somebody who was able to put whole gpm in during the period he was thinking about it all the time or something he was worried about it see but as general statement im just giving you the order of magnitude of aberration theres the jet bomber landing in the middle of the picnic table see as compared to one ant eating one crumb at tree remote from the table see slight difference of value and youve got two of these confounded things sitting riding in and forming in the pcs present time area either one of those things has more qualifications and significance than the whole concept of the reactive mind as advanced by sigmund freud its quite interesting the early definition of the service facsimile carried in the glossary section of advanced procedures and axioms in the glossary the glossary section the definition of it carries theicarries the description of an ri that is the embryonic description of reliable item in that little definition its not more than paragraph long and it says the pcs doing it and it says the pcs holding it in place quitequitequite remarkable but that still holds good see we havent veered off of that out of all the pieces and bricabrac of the mind what is it that you have to hit and that choice of target has been the problem in research and application of scientology that choice of target what is the target now naturally one of these ris is so capable of dispersing the pc that research work on it always finds you veering you get in toward it and you veer and you get in toward it and you veer and you get in toward it and you veer and you get in toward it and you veer so of course its been very hard to isolate it aside maybe from some ot at some vast period of the backtrack some vast period in time who wrotewho found out knew he was doing it perhaps and found out the exact character of goals and ris and perhaps left it in document form which was then picked up by implanters aside from that except for that as far as i know the data is not known in the universe see theyit must have been somewhat on that order because if theyd developed scientology with that information as they very well could have they wouldnt have had to go in for implanting see so they went different route so the information must have come to them in such way that it didnt deaberrate the thetan so therefore you can apparently find just on guess because implant gpms exist you see and because they did have something that looked like gpm then one must then assume that one can find these things without deaberrating them one assumes that you could sketch one out or do something like this without taking the charge off of it in some way now you feel that that would be pretty difficult and actually it would be very difficult be fairly hard to do but nevertheless its apparently as i would say probably been done otherwise they would have had something that resembled scientology and if theyd had something that resembled scientology it would have won out along the line because theta always has more force than entheta regardless of what you think it isnt that it always wins out and that sort of thing you actually have practically experience with theta communication on social level there practically isnt any you say well if this fellow led such good pure life and that sort of thing why is he getting his head kicked in how do we know that he just isnt leading totally withdrawn life introverted that is inviting the inflow see how do we know this well we dont know this in fact we look it over and all the evidence is that people have redefined what good being is good being is somebody who doesnt communicate i think the stories of harold bell wright and his strong silent men which were appearing there at the beginning of this century marvelous stories these fellows are strong and silent you know they never said anything these fellows were set up as paragons of virtue that isnt theta that guy must have been crazy used to irritate like mad when i was little boy id read these books and theydidmy hair would stand on end you know id be horrified at this you know i remember seeing an early silent movie one time and the parents of some child were in vast trouble i think i was all of about six and they were in vast trouble and this thing was getting more and more complicated see and more and more complicated and i finally was getting awfully bored with it and the two companions i was with were more than bored with it you see and i remember explaining to them that the whole thing was silly because why didnt they just communicate with each other now therefore one very seldom sees straight communication line and the power of scientology based on straight communication lines and that sort of thingyou see over the years weve had history that apparently well it permits somebody who was in kansas city to write letter which was in my standing order number 1 lines yesterday he had attended some original lectures and hed followed my ups and downs mostly downs see i look at thisyou know with astonishment 1 suppose when youwhen you read an ama regulated press or that sort of thing you might possibly get this wild impression you see unless you looked at the growth graphs of organizations and other things over the years and you actually have to remember how it was maybe in 1955 or something to give yourself real shock and here it goes now you think this fda thing and income tax nonsense and that sort of thing in washington dc amounts to anything what it amounts to is i just sawthe kids arestaff there are upset and it made sad about all they havent got prayer those poor guys have been climbing the barber poles all over america theyve been trying to find somebody who would really complain about scientology and they released their witnesses the other day weve not heard of them we have none of these people in ourin our central files we have record of most of their people but one of them was an fda agent who attended class for some time and then blew name was quinn and hethey advanced this as witness and so forth well now what can that man testify to that hes actually seen meter cure somebody not in an hca class actually were graduallywere gradually mounting up very heavy casualty schedule against the government very heavy the fda has now been forbidden to make such raids hmm the uproar which has come about in general is rather historic up on capitol hill people are nervy about this you did good job getting letters in to the government and that sort of thing you see the attorney who first handled it has slowed down the government case like mad because the guy studied it for long time and then went down with very serious illness he couldnt bring himself to attack this the casualty figures are growing and they still arent getting anyplace well theyre going to have trial of some kind or another and theyre going to hear lot of things theyve been going all over the place trying to find some evidence but sitting back of that ive already seen this function several times they know they are lying and they know the more evidence they collect that they are attacking something which is good and decent and beneficial and they know they have to be lying in their teeth and when they start somebody to investigate it he comes up against the fact that makes him wrong makes him wrong so he gets sort of enturbulated and savage and so forth but he keeps trying but he just gets wronger and wronger the more he tries dont you see and we have had far more serious things on the backtrack than the fda one of the things you dont realize is the old man sat there somehow or another and kept the lid on in the early years i was very discouraged fromi mean everybody advising never to say anything see about these things never put in any itsa line on the stuff that was happening because it would enturbulate everybody i think it was terrible mistake but in the early years i was overridden you have to defer to somebody elses opinion on these things now and then particularly in that zone and time but much more serious things have occurred which had greater threat value in all directions why weve had federal court actions to seize every single piece of research and so forth i have been sued for using my own name on the material there are very serious actions along the way none of these things succeed so if anybody had ever developed scientology you wouldnt have the universe you have thats what you have to adjudicate about the thing itd be perfectwith perfect aplomb we could import it into russia we could give them all the plots for implant gpms we could give them all the material we could give them everything that you could possibly think of could give them the material let them study it let them fool around with it let them fool around with set techniques we must have techniques however that they can understand and do in an elementary fashion i was very interestedan oldtimer was down here this afternoon and she hadnt been anywhere near scientology for long time and she wanted to know how to handle herone of her relatives who was upset with her mothers death and i was very interested to be able to give her the itsa line on solutions you see and decisions with regard to her mother you see thats all shed had to do and keep the girl talking she dug this at once that seemed to be very reasonable thing to do and there it was you see terrifically easy communication communication of process complications involved in it well thats what makes theta is actually the ease of reach the ease of the communication of what you are doing entheta enturbulated theta becomes enturbulated only by going through numerous vias its vias which enturbulate the thing because it longer is straight line dont you see i had big problem the other day why dont thetans use weapons thats quite problem ive been trying to solve it for some little time why dont they use tools i got very intrigued with this why dont they use tools and so on and i remembered one bloke i collided with much to my own disaster by the way long time ago and he was using tools he was using scoop of some kind or another to make sea he was toolusing thetan he really did in at that particular time i was in queasy enough state to permit myself to be done in but there he was using tools and i wondered why wed never used tools you see and i got to thinking about the cave man could defeat the treetop man because the cave man used stone tools you see and the treetop man wasnt using tools and i could figure outwas trying to figure out how the free thetan you see lost his dominance you see and exactly how he sort of lost out huh ive been trying to go over this and go over this youll find this is quite problem how has he lost out dont you see what are the factors involved with it well this is way up ahead see this is scientology v you have to know answers to the situation and i found out finally why he doesnt use tools and why you never use tools and why you dont like to use tools in the first place you dont need them and in the second place if you get the idea of using well let us say using an ice cream scoop see over here in the ice cream see well actually youve got to withhold the length of the ice cream scoop get the idea see youre holding back just to that slight degree see all right well lets take another one instead of knocking somebodys head off who is in your road you pull gun and shoot him do you realize that you just figure it outthis is little fun to make test on for yourself see you get the idea of doing something to somebody on via and if you go through the mechanisms of trying to do to somethingto somebody on via youll get the idea of withholding ability and you suddenly realize that youre on withhold and then you begin to realize that you must be withholding ability youre withholding the ability of knocking the guys head off yourself why are you doing it with this gun see matter how intriguing and entrancing it might be to use gun it is still withhold you see you start studying this out and therefore thetans who are in pretty good shape have never used tools and those who have used tools make up populations such as convict planet earth which probably is far highertoned than the organization and political organization that runs this planet all of which is speculative but as far as thats concerned tools tools appear to be so good but actually bring about downfall how do youhow do you figure this well why is it why is it that there are races on the planet right now which are apparently stronger and more powerful than the white race see white supremacy how white supremacythey now talk of as myth in most of these publications and so forth well it isnt but they talk about it like that well what happens what happened well actually you have ayou have some racial virulence you see amongst those who havent been corrupted by lot of tools and dependencies you see you still have some vitality i dont care if these fellowsit isnt just necessarily the colored races lets takelets take some berbers or something like this and they havent been sitting everyday looking at television set you see and that sort of thing now all of sudden we move those fellows up within reach of the possibility of achieving some political dominance dont you see they have vitality they have ideas they have these various things and they give the appearance you see of virulence and you know muscles theythey give thisthey give this appearance now culturallyculturally the democratic system opened the door but in actual fact aristocratic systemit isntit isnt actually problem you see in nationalities not problem in nationalities at all or problem in color or problem in any of these things it is simply problem in what group is the least corrupted or decayed by modern civilization now if you stop and think for moment the greek civilization once dominated the entirety of earths civilization it was well before the roman and the extent of the greek civilization was probably wiped out by roman history rewriting these blokes wiped outthe roman wiped out the actuality of greek history you have to actually go out to india and get your feet dirty with the red clay to really find out that the history book as you read in western civilization isnt correct thealexander the great didnt go charging out to india and say oh too bad i have more worlds to conquer gather up his army and come all the way home and kick the bucket or something this was maybe shallow look at it but in actual fact greek administration was established in india there was not shadow they were once administering india whats this thats quite wild look at the sway and zones of dominance of early greek civilization and it was huge it was big and those communit was big enough so those communication lines still exist today you go down to athens they think they own the world still they havent found out they havent they speak of our colonies in spain our iberian colonies the guitar greek instrument of course thats right they have sort of this atmosphere and you look around youll see that theres an awful lot of greek flags on the high seas tremendous shipping interests are greek the lines and shadows of the lines of that ancient civilization are still in and if you dont think theyve made the grade in some directions greek philosophy absolutely dominates all western thinking youre living in the shadow you see of an ancient civilization and if you said today if you said today well the greek is menace to world peace or something like this and everybody would look at you sort of blankly what awhat weird remark to make dont you see because the greek civilizations not militant greek went through tremendous period tremendous period of conquest and dominance and her people were very very down to earth crude rugged tough oneblow type gents see these were tough boys and they spread their dominance out through the known world at that particular time and then somebody started working them over and the next thing you know they had this and they had that and one of the reasons why the greek nightclub the idea of nightclubs is greek you see and you get the reason why they are so adept you by the way go to nightclub in athens you getyoull get far better entertainment than the best one in new york and this nightclub in athens you see they thinkwhat are greeksstand for as floor show well it has to be very very highlevel show and it has to go on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours new york they come out and do tap dance and disappear you see thats notthats not the greek how did they get to this high level of entertainment must have been their last method of conquest they cant any longer knock the invader out see but when he arrives they can say what good fellow you are and have good entertainment and have something to eat and some nice wine and the guy said these greeks are nice people that was the last method of defense do you see this they could still handle somebody on highly introverted basis and so forth they hadnt entirely disappeared along this particular line but there isthere is theprobably the greatest civilization on this planet and look how far down you might conceive it now because if i said this was one of the greatest powers on earth you would say what the hells he talking about right this minute you see you fly over greece you see their denuded hillsides you seeyou see the stuff couldnt grow there anymore thats all and you look at their coasts and the harbors and that sort of thing its shot man but whats going to happen you see another great empire the roman empire i dont know if there might even be some political official on earth today still he calls himself the holy roman emperor i think there possibly is one isnt there who is it the pope or somebody or did it die out with the hohenzollerns i dont know but im sure the title is active ill bet if you dreamed up in all directions and looked everyplace youd wind up with the emperor of the holy roman empire you see quite fascinating various aspects have taken place but roman civilization is far more present right at the present moment than this you see youve got this cycle now going the greek civilization you see about where it is the roman civilization is perhaps little more so we still had ait still could resurge in the form of mussolini and scare everybody to death before it folded up you know in world war ii its still got little power in it you still have roman lines you see out its interesting that in england theyre trying to get rid of their roman background they say well it happenedit was long time ago and its all different and so forth and up and down the street walk these fellows direct descendants of romans you see you look at them their faces and everything see walking up and down the streets same size same everything you see you go around and you look at the ideas of british liberty and this country has got the greatest background for jurisprudence and material of that particular kinds and legislative system and so on it was just the furthest thing from rome in which roman jurisprudence was implanted and it survived long time the magna carta other stuff you see thats the old roman empire you know just going along going along doing its business stable data on this subject of course they have to kind of get rid of that kind of have to get rid of that because its zone and area of dominance there are various other reasons why it had to be gotten rid of because this started to work when the angles and the jutes and so forth came in here they had to get rid of this thing and they had to establish first danish and then saxon civilization and so on and they had to keep saying it isnt roman province it belongs to us and everybody would say heil see youre the conquerors and they never really did knock it in the head and thesethis thing keeps revolting because these ideas were good ideas dont you see and these ideas keep reaching forward in time they had useability and you have very strong civilization here which in its turn was great empire were just now at the period where its trying to give it away i dont know why its trying to but it is i dont know i think it makes more lords or more seats in the united nations or something but lot oflot of stuff is going on at this present time they talk more about the disintegration of the empire than it actually is but i notice right now its having trouble in indonesia you see its got new problems now this new empire has new problems its newer empire its now considered an old empire its now considered that the british they dont even call it imperial anymore things are all commonwealthian dont you see bits of it are being taken off one way or not really necessary that it go in this particular direction but its force and power in the world today is tremendous its amount of finance manufacture potential and so forth isnt anything on the united states and yet the united states looks at things british and says aye aye yes sir yes oh yes my lord and theyre really scared to spit unless they ask the permission so here is your next cycle see here is the british empire see and then they got johnnycomelately empire called the united states see and its been going and trying to spread all these various sentiments in all directions and handle and pound and buy friends and do this and show everybody that theyre all set and put shipping lines in their manufacturing potential is flooding into the rest of the world today the same way that in 600 500 ad or even in 100 ad the pots and linens of rome were flooding into england and here we have this newthis new empire see and its hardly an empire you cant quite put your finger on it because it isnt the right thing today to say i own dont you see and nowno its taken its responsibility in the world its pushed out ahead of everything and its going along here at great rate of speed and trying to make its way forward and so forth dont make any mistakes about it its trying to become dominant empire whatever its saying that is what is happening you see and its looked on rather intolerantly by bunch of other fellows who are sitting around whove already been the route and they say well yes hmhmhmhm got the idea because ive been describing to you four gpms on the third dynamic which apply totally on the first because thats just the way gpm acts got the idea just as you to some tiny fragment at this moment are influenced by the greek civilization so you would be tinily influenced by the fourth gpm back see and just as today you are very much more but not much really influenced by the roman empire you see you still have some influence on it but thats the third gpm back you see and now we got the american empire and its actually blown its cork and we have new empire already forming called an internationalism and its stumbling around and it hasnt got grip on anything and mostly its matter of confusion and that would be your present time gpm the two ris on it right now god knows i dont know quite what they would be but there are two ris from the united nations i dont know what it was maybe wendell willkie put it in when he said one world or something like that the goal possibly to have one world you know something like this yet everybody sort of believing and working dynamically very dynamically in the direction of creating just one world see and if you want to really get somebodys attention and so on in shop in england or in greece and so forth you talk to him about the decay of nationalism and he will pretty well agree with you that it is now internationalism that exists see hell kind of beat the drum little bit with you too for internationalism and so on thats forming gpm we dont know where that ones going to go but thats very truncated we actually have already seen the top oppterms of the american empire weve already seen them theyre going into history rapidly but still be influenced over fabulous periods of time dont monitor say its less but the new force is this now what are you affected by right this minute actually youre affected more by the decay of the american empire without tracing why well its got to have money its got to maintain fantastic commitments its got to maintain all kinds of defenses its in frantic state dont you see its people are sort of agin it but theyre not for it but well their dream of liberty has dwindled you see they dont have that anymore maybe it was like the goal to be free dont you see somethingsomething went on here dont you see but you stillwe get the kickback of this particular thing but the dynamic ris in the present time arehow can we live all together without having an atomic war maybe thats one pair back dont you see we might have another one forming right this minute it would take very careful analysis to look at exactly what was forming on the third dynamic that we could call the top existing top ris see well we certainlywe havent gotten rid of these last two top ris international war and atomic fission or whatever the two top ris are dont you see you follow this well now thats the picture with every pc youre operating on thats his picture now were going to enter his case see were going to enter his case and were going to say all right now were going to get i suppose greek civilization could have said to spread greek culture see or to culture everyone if it kills them some type goal to be cultured maybe that would be its goal see something like that or maybe that was later day goal it was certainly to conquer possibly to conquer maybe thats the gpm line maybe the roman one was just simply to govern well but now we take this pc see lets call him world you know lets call himthis pc called world were going to say now were going to straighten you all out now world were going to run out the top ris of the gpm greek civilization go ahead go out here on the street right now and tell the world you see that youre now going to run outyoure going to make the world well youre going to run out the greek civilization and do you know i dont think youre going to get anybody to agree with you at all you could tell them well now look if you just get rid of plato see thats big ri there and its reliable item and if you just get rid of plato see youd be all set plato plato youd list the thing and the fellow would say yeah but hed really only do that so long as all the other gpms were in place dont you see there comes time when he could become very interested in the greek civilization dont you see but not right now the world would say to you all right youre going to run out the greek civilization well what about these atom bombs wouldnt that be the response which youd get and thats the same response you get from the pc only youre not given to know exactly what the top ris are of the pc when you start auditing him on the face of earth you can see quite obviously it must have something to do with international war and atom bombs see thats very visible to you but theres the pc sitting there now what the hell is he stuck in we dont know but in actual fact the influence upon him in gpms his ancient greek onenot that he was in ancient greece you seeto conquer see that gpm its still influencing him the roman to govern well see british empire something on the order to have freedom of the seas or something like this i dont know what that gpm was whatever it is see yeah all those influence him oh yes you could get tone armlittle tone arm action yeah you could get some interest and so forth and all the time hes doing that hes got one eye cocked up at the sky to see whether or not that mushroom plume has formed yet yeah yeah plato yeah well lets see against plato there were poisoners or that was socrates lets seeso ondid you hear an airplane go overhead oh all right now lets get back lets get back and lets list thislets list thisthis out here little bit lets see now thermopylae marathonand so on what was that did you hear something sound to like somebody crying an extra out on the street you see i heard the word russia what was it what was it what was it oh well wasnt anything lets get back into session now wonder what thewhat it was get the idea of split attention well hes got two top ris that are just split his attention just that much all the time all the time all the time and they might not look very logical to you but theyll sure look logical to him lets saylets say its aits got an oppterm child murdererschild murderers you see and with the ri police officer see theythe terminal police officer versus child murderers you see thats his own actual gpm its sitting right up here in present time dont you see and you misscome to the auditing session as the auditor in blue dress with some brass buttons on it and this particular session you cant figure out whyyou didnt get particularly much tone arm action the pc was sort of nervous all the time dont you see and so on and so so soandso and so and so on and he seems to be very fixated on you and he arc breaks sort of very easily and you cant find out what it was actually if you assessed the whole environment you might be able to find out something about it and it might lead you in toward it and i wont discount it as method of finding somebodys service facsimile but youre just looking at some restimulator of some kind or another you see now what are those things well those things are the two topped formed items which extend from goal which may be as new as the united nations or actually as old as the united states dont you see its ait may be brandnew and it may have very few items in it or it may be quite old as goal and it may have lot of items in it he may be almost anyplace in the formation of that particular bank but it is that goal which has its immediate command value over the pc and youll find as you drop back from it you have right into the top of the next goal just below you will have influence on present time you wont solve all of his problems bywith those two top ris only dont you see because youve got these other gpms which are influencing him and the influence however ceases well lets put it this way the influence has total command value the two top reliable items of present time has total command value over the pc total unquestioning unseen just any flicker any whisper of any of this of any kind whatsoever finds him going tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk salute salute salute yesyes yes siryes sir yes do it right oh yeah worry about ityeahohcomply aaaaah uhooohf see frantic you know total and just below that merely desperate desperate desperate desperate about something the next two ris you see next couple of ris worry worry worry worry worry worry worry worry worry all the time all the time worry worry worry worry worry worry worry worry about them think about them hoping they wont occur worry about them but theyre in state of worry and the couple of ris just below that sort of thing sort of dull feeling of apprehension constant and continuous dull feeling of apprehension actually all those emotions are combined in present time we get much earlier than that we get an idea of sort of enduring it whatever the goal is you know well we canwe must all die sometime and be sick and have to brace up toyou know face it you know that type of situation but now youre about six pairs down thei mean six pairs down the line you see and thats the kind of present time reaction he would have to that you know well wewe can live with it i guess sort of hope if iif i confront up to it i can probably endure it that type of reaction dont you see and you get about eight ten back its oh well thats life nothing you can do about that thats just the way life is thats life might as well be philosophic about it in other words thats about how his attention is spread over the dozen pairs that are immediately adjacent to present time his attention cones down in terms of less and less desperate but still with him see and then it goes off into these things influenced by life and once in while hes noticed that hes done something peculiar in this particular direction he hasnt thought about it particularly dont you see you get earlier and earlier than actually his present time attention isnt on them at all see but can flip into them and out of them see all right now these immediate ris and thethat compose with their goal the immediate present time gpm see those arent the things which make the pc concerned with present time theyre the things which make it impossible for him to beto get his attention off of the things hes concerned with in present time get the idea he cant change his mind it doesnt mean that if those were all gone and he saw kids bicycle run over in the middle of the street hed feel nothing see i mean but the presence of those things means he cant take his attention off of it his automatic response to the situation you see is big and hes not able to sleep that night he gets very heavy high level of effect from this sort of thing you see he cant change his mind with regard to these things so that observations which come in upon him have tremendous influence with him to the degree that he really cant shift his mind on them regardless of the significance of the operation we do know that he now lacks fluidity or power of choice over his reaction to his observations in other words when something happens in present time hes stuck right there with it and thats all he can do about it so he comes into session and you say well put in the itsa line ononon what youve been doing since the last session and hes hmmmmm and so on he talks and talks and hes desperately trying to suppress and get rid of it and he really cant get his head off of it dont you see hehehehe has hard time feeling better about it see the difference and you have to work and work and work and work and then you get get half of his attention off of it and now youve got enough attention to maybe run bit of bank makes very rough auditing very hard on the pc and it doesnt give you such situation of tremendous send on the part of the pc by reason of auditing if you well duck back down the track and take stuff that isnt in particular restimulation but he can run it you can put his attention on it you can do something with it dont you see what youve got to do is tackle headon youve got to tackle it headon with his case now whether you call that r1c over things hes concerned with and has been solving in this lifetime dont you see thats undoing the two top ris or whether or not you do it with bunch of arc break assessments which is less good but nevertheless is less spectacular as it worksr2h or whether you do it in the direction of r3scjust as given youre still working with those two top ris and present time restimulation now you can actually destimulate the ease using in that gradient those processes which i just mentioned bring it up to point where the individual might be able to see goal like he sees to govern well see and he says well all right thats nice goal yeah that obviously is my present time goal thats good and safe see hell run it and you can find couple of top ris and they dont seem to have too much to do with the situation and his appreciation for wine rises and say well thats interesting in view of the fact that he doesnt drink wine what good is it see but youyou find youve taken off some present time restimulation youre handling this situation or you have reached back and found to govern well and youve opposed that and youve gotten to rule the seas you see and then to free everybody maybe that was the united states goal you see and then youve opposed that and youve got to have one world ah oh man were getting someplace now but boy is that stuff hard to read it is starting to fly apartcase is starting to fly apartyoure getting tone arm action like mad as youre doing this sort of thing but there is point and i warn you on this and you need the warning because you will veer off there is point as you approach pt when the auditing restimulation by reason of the bank and the goal and that sort of thing not from finding the goal you can get away with that seebut lets say we found the pt gpm the kickback and the nonconfront of those top ris is so great that it may obscure the actual pt goal you may have to free everybody the one of the us empire dont you see and go right along as though thats the top gpm see and everything reads that way and youre ouijaboarding the meter reads that way and everything goes along here gorgeously dont you see the top gpm that obviouslydont be so amazed after you tackled it for while and tried to get its top ris and done some other things with it to all of sudden find to have one world see there it sits whered it come from and then dont be surprised if you have very rough time listing the pc because youre running the pc in the middle of his living lightning man youre reaching into the middle of the gall bladder and pulling it out roots and all dont you see now it isnt the pcll run badly or anything like that up to point you will be able to get in but you will run into this action that when you start approaching the last dozen pairs itll keep reading all the time that there are pairs above them always read that youve got the last pair you may haveyou may haveyou may have ten pairs above you see and itlloh yes this is the two top ris youre ouijaboarding it see his noconfront on these things is getting terrific because its right up here in present time damned atom bombs liable to go off at any minute dont you see brrrrrrrrr dangerous to get near this situation see and uhhh any solution you might have to it like hes got an ri let us say duck see hethats the solution to the atom bomb duck you get anywhere near that thing why man youre running in chargedup bank because its got hanging on it every part and particle of the universe he has any connection with in this present time its hanging on it is restimulated by it is crossrestimulated into it well this is why we didntwerent able to find it it isnt that theyre downgraded it isntthis is why earlier we veered off again and didnt finish up the actual gpm to amount to anything that was because it required more technology to really tackle it well because right now with the technology you get which is listing by tone arm not rocket read that technology right there when you start for the last dozen pairs that are right up leading up here into pt is going to give you not an arc breaky pc but an exasperated worried upset frantic desperate pc who wont be able to get the item on the list in most cases without going through complete snit youll hear things like this but i told you ii keep putting it on the list its already on the list there it is it is youre getting the incomplete list arc break see its already on the list i keep saying it i tell you what the item is its duckfast and thats all it is and ive had the idea since you first began the list i know what it is he says i cant get it on the list itdamn you you justnever rocket reads for you why dont you look at your meter all right ill list for while longer farmyards parachutes caves holes quacking loudly but its the same one its the same item i know what it is you can expect that quite routinely it isnt really an arc break its really not quite dramatization he actually quite honestly feels totally desperate its just that he just feels totally desperate so you want to make awful darn sure that when you start listing it on him youre already listing from right goal dont make any mistakes like this because if you make littlea bunch of technical mistakes at slightly wrongly worded goal you see you ouijaboard the thing this is always ouijaboard these things when you start moving into this area see ask questions like is this correct goal is this an incorrect goal is it correctly worded i dont care if you get it reading its correct goal go on and analyze it see have we skipped gpm is it the pt one is there anything incorrect about its wording you know go through your little act see and look this thing over and youll all of sudden find theres word missing on it or something like this or its too long dont call the pc out because look supposing youve just got wrongly worded goal and then you find slightly wrong item for it and it moves up into these critical pairs im talking to you about and then you start listing against it and you already have set up the probability of desperate pc who will get desperate before he manages to complete that list see oh man youve got good reason now for him to be arc broken and desperate you can halfkill pc with it that way with dynamite youre listing dynamite pure dynamite so never take chance see every time you find an ri you see is this an ri from this gpm is it from another gpm you see is it correctly worded you see is itso on all these things you go over with this thing was the list complete that it came off of dont you see and the test of the item youre listing from does it tick and how does it compare you see go over this little analysis on that ri because youre already putting this boy over the jumps madly putting him over the jumps because if its right goal right ri and youre opposing this right ri its an absolutely correct reliable item and youre busy opposing that in the very best textbook absolutely correct fashion your pc is liable tonot always not for every one of them he wont go through thisbut hes liable to get in terrifically desperate arc breaky screaming state of mind he wont be able to quite approach it dont you see the reason why he cant obviously its data substituted for him and he gets into the vicinity of it he veers right off of it dont you see and he can list all around the edges of it dont you see i had one last night i sure know what im talking about nohaving canthave i was going to pieces on the thing finally turned out itto be not having see just t missing yes but the second it was hit the bank went bzzzzzzmmmmmone ri splat blew up practically blew up the meter but not canthave that didnt blow up the meter and not the other nine pages of lists which went with it all of that you see delivering terrific tone arm action the whole way but going up up up see listing by locks you would list the tone arm action out thats your 212 listing by lock rules well now youre doing this r4mta1 well if the tone arm action goes out of it you havent got it on the list if there is the faintest tiniest twitch microscopically viewed of the needle when he gives another item you havent got it on the list now your old r3m2 listing goes well you list it and you go 25 beyond that its all right you didnt have any ris and so you read the nexttothelast rocket reading item and the thing didnt rocket read you read the last item and it rocket read and bang thats all simple thats 212 lock listing and its absolutely guaranteed to give you locks and you can oppose locks against locks against locks against locks and you could probably find thousands of them in one gpm thousands of them you could have line plot five to ten thousand items long you could take thousand hours of auditing to clean up one its how you got these long line plots its how you went skidding out of one gpm into another gpm its how you got items listed backwards see youve got to list the tone arm action into it and only then have you got an ri and then your tone armyoud be surprised how hard it is to do sometimes and the pc says well that turned on little bit of mass and he just starts gratuitously givewell that isnt itgives you some more items and the next thing you know that needles going slash slash tick tick slash oh man if the needles going tick and slash on list you havent got it rrs its just the needlethe listthe action of listing is giving the needle ticks and slits and that list is not complete i dont care how desperate the pc looks you want to be awful sure then what youre listing up against you want to be awful sure that thats correct goal chances you want to be sure that that ri that you already have found came from list that you did have the main ri on now ive drawn you pictures of ris and theyre great big massive things surrounded by lot of ball bearings and you can just find any gods quantity of these small ball bearingtype ris and shells they sometimes look like onions too you can find any quantity of layers on them any quantity of items lying around them theyll all rocket read so the test is not whether it rocket reads the test is it gave you so much tone arm action that it obviously has knocked the bottom underneath that particular vicinity of bank and that listing further items doesnt give you tick and click or slash the tone arm action is listed in youll occasionally see your needle go up to 4 45 i mean your tone arm go up to 45 and your needle has gone sluggish and sticky you say oh my god what am i doing you know because there it is stuck and your needle isnt moving very much and your pc is getting edgy and he says there arent any more there are just more items on this list theres more nobody could think of another item on the list there arent any more you can only say it so many ways and ive said them all its up to you at that moment to be very diplomatic well just for fun give one more and i even have pulled this gag right or wrongly you havent given meyou havent given feathers yet oh havent i all right feathers and youll see that tone arm come down come down and all of sudden youll hit one of these blowdown areas theyll give an item itll give blowdown be followed by fall be followed by blowdown be followed by another blowdown psssww and its way down here and it goes lower and all of sudden youre up and down and its action and so on and so on and you look over here and that needle will be slashing dont stop the pc to read them the needles moving what are you doing why stop to read them the needles moving as the pc lists the needle is moving so obviously you dont have the item on the list because when you get the ri it kills all action on the list it kills all ticks on the list it kills all slashes on the list it kills all rrs on the list and sure doesnt kill ta motion thats the one thing it doesnt kill because he just thinks about ta and youll get psssssss and you will get blowdown motions of the ta youll see it going pssswww pssswwww pssssss needle see going pssss you try to read sometimes as youre listing through one of these blowing down needles you can get these blowing down needles without finding the ri the question is now when you read little blowdown area back to the pc did anything tick did itdid it slash once you better make list of these did it tick did it slash once and then not slash again does it read when the pc says it but not when you say it well its not the ri thats not the ri did two items go faintly tick and the next one go tick you havent got an ri on that list because two items went tick ah yes you say but id better get in the mid ruds id better get in suppress and careful of and fail to reveal and invalidate and suggest and mistake and protest and anxious about and decide and if ive got all those in maybe i could make it read save your time man save your time get in your session mid ruds if you want to but dont try to make an item read because you couldnt stop an ri from reading with an anvil parked against your needle so i repeat just as youve just listed there if youreif youreif ityou call it once and it goes pssww and then you call it again and it doesnt do anything thats not it you call it once and it goes little tiny slash and so forth theres sense in sitting there has this item been suppressed and so forth and so on theres sense there dumph whats the difference did it give you laggardly fall blowdown when you gave him the item you got blowdown its not the item i dont care if you didnt give it to him or not you just said the item you got blowdown two items ticked on the list much less two rred oh my god youre getting up into orders of magnitudetwo items fell two items slashed oh forget it man get out of there fast if any item after it slashed ticked clicked did anything you havent got it on the list it isnt on the list because when the ri an ri comes on that list you wontyoull get expert you probably wont make any mistakes at all first time youll say oh gee look at that beautiful blowdown there now look at it oh what lovely tone arm motion oh yes well lets read it back to him oh well one of the items ticked but the other one sure reads nicelyhaha so on well give that to him you see and well list against it and your pc will start getting sort of green and uuuuhhhhthis one is going off the rails in an awful hurry you see you finally find the item youre listing from continues to tick and if you eventually came back to it and continued your list youd find out that he would have put four more items on with the ta more or less motionless and then all of sudden you get twice as much blowdown as you had before and twice as much commotion so you say well gee thats all the commotion meter can produce ive never seen that much commotion before on meter so thats obviously an ri that ron really knows what hes talking about because that really is an ri look at the amount of tone arm motion that thing fell wow see that isnt it youll haveyoull have experience with this can think nothing of going through six areas on list where the meter falls apart and blows down and blue smoke comes out of the corners think nothing of it before the real ri goes on the list because when it goes on the list it is totally unmistakable anything else pc puts on the list now as he says it will not disturb the needle but youll be gettingyoull have to read between the fact that your needle is moving to give you ta blowdown but youhe says these items and nothing happens says them and theres slashes theres nothing nothing you read it back to him again it goes pppsssww and blows down and goes and he cognites and everything bwaa and he finally tells you thats it you sometimes give him the item and the pc if he has any honesty whatsoever heyou give him the item and it flicked ticked aaaaahh duck feathers things that come out from ducks hell start giving you items again quite common he recognizes this thing turns on it doesnt do anything for him so on you realize hes given youyouve given him wrong item of some kind or another so he just goes on listing so never stop him from listing anything that turns on lot of energy and mass and black ridges and that sort of thing that isnt the item thats all and you just have to get used to it you have to get used to one being awful doggone sure that when you find the pcs own goalits easy to find pcs own goals today but when you do find it make sure its the right wording make sure that you are listing the present time goal when you find an item lets make sure it is the right item and so forth and one little note before i cancel it off here coterm there is such thing as coterm thats the same ri appearing as terminal and an oppterm in the same gpm and very rarely appearing in two different gpms same item appearing in twobut it appears as terminal appears as an oppterm so of course it looks like its coterm so its both and that was the mystery of coterm ive now plotted it all down and straightened it all out drive you mad i mean this item the inability to duck or something of the sort you see thats halfway down one bank and its the top oppthe top terminal and the middle oppterm and it just takes that poor bank and it just ties it in pretzel and you finally list against one side and you list against the other side and you dont know which side youre on and so forthwell go ahead and list it but you know what youre doing now anyway there is the score with regard of r4mta this is the final product of this sort of thing youre actually handling all the time whether youre chipping in on it from the top ticketytick with awith little tack hammer with r1c that sort of thing as long as you get tone arm action youre carving down toward those two top ris and youre carving down to the top of the gpm and theres nothing else to carve down to doesnt matter what you run youre running those and when you find the gpms and move it on up and get the guys goal and get his present time gpm of course you list for those things always be suspicious that you havent got it you might be twelve pairs away from the top ones even though it looks like the top one but keep trying for them keep moving them up you can always take what you get as the top run down to the bottom of that bank to its goal and run it out and then go back and find the top and you will be surprised how much top there was still on the bank this is good programing but the main point im trying to make you is is that is the zone where the pcs interest is that is the zone where the pcs attention is that is the zone which produces the overrestimulation that makes pcs almost impossible to audit and thats the zone and area that youre trying to crack and it fits in across the lines technically and otherwise and when they blow you have never seen quite the same result on your pc as when you get the real top pt gpm and the two top oppterms for it and really get the pair that are really therenot the ones that you thought that were there at firstthe meter said but when you really get those and when you get those top twelve youll have wondered what you thought case result was that i can absolutely guarantee but remember you have to be careful auditor you have to do very good job and you mustnt miss anywhere along this line because you do something careless and you do something stupid and you do properan improper analysis on goal and you do an improper analysis on theon the ris you find and you start getting sloppy and goofing up one way or the other man you will never have seen such mess so youre going for the biggest win and the biggest mess therefore you have to know what youre doing in order to get there but let assure you it is very very well worth doing even the pc who is saying but i have put it on the list ive put it on the list twenty times ive put it on the list more than twenty times its duck eggs ive put it on the listduck feathers duck eggs ducking oh well all right all right all right all right barnyards ive given you the item before but ill give it to you again ill be nice barnyards barnyards cows pickenchickens pigs horses farms farmers so forth aaaaah geese geese eggs ill give it to you illall right i will oh you want to give it you then ill give it to you all right rrrrrrif i dont give it to you first in some other way oh wait minute wait minute its duck duck pssss your meter goes duck that was fifteen pages of hell later but he will say even then its worth it thank you 1 editors note per hcob 2 oct 63 gpms experimental process withdrawn technical bulletin volumes volume vii this process
