congressreceived through the crs weborder code rs21102 january 9 2002 international capital flows following the september 11 attacks james k jackson specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary major concern following the terrorist attacks on new york and washington was that foreigners would curtail their purchases of us financial assets and reduce the total inflow of capital into the us economy thereby weakening the value of the dollar the federal reserve moved aggressively on its own and in tandem with other central banks at an unprecedented level to avert potential crisis in the markets these efforts were largely successful by yearend us equity markets slowly recovered their preattack values and the exchange rate value of the dollar returned to its preattack rate after fluctuating within fairly narrow range data also indicate that capital outflows were higher than normal for the month of september but panic selling of us assets did not occur this report will be updated as warranted background the september 11 attacks on new york and washington struck at the heart of the us financial center disabling some stock and equity markets for short time these attacks raised concerns about the ability of the markets to absorb the shock and about the prospects that foreign investors would curtail their purchases of us financial assets and reduce the inflow of capital into the us economy thereby weakening the value of the dollar although decline in the value of the dollar would have benefitted exportsensitive and importcompeting industries in the economy it likely also would have pushed up interest rates and had negative impact on such interestsensitive industries as autos and housing international flows of capital around the world have grown dramatically over the last decade these flows exercise primary influence on exchange rates and global flows of goods and services they also allow the united states to finance its trade deficit because foreigners are willing to lend to the united states in the form of exchanging the sale of goods represented by us imports for such us assets as stocks bonds and us

foreign currencies totals more than 12 trillion or more than the annual amount of us exports of goods and services the data also indicate that 90 of the global foreign exchange turnover is in us

securities the attacks of september 11 added to existing concerns about the course of the economy over the next year following the attacks currency traders quickly forged voluntary gentlemans agreement not to profit from the event which helped stabilize the value of the dollar measured against broad range of currencies by september 14 however the agreement had faltered as currency speculators began driving down the value of the dollar9 the federal reserve concerned about the prospects of panic in international financial markets coordinated actions among central bankers and financial ministers around the globe to ensure the smooth operation of the international financial markets these actions included an infusion of liquidity by the federal reserve of about 40 billion10 and roughly equivalent amount by the european central bank and coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange markets on at least two occasions by the federal reserve the european central bank and the bank of japan to support the value of the dollar11 federal reserve officials also signaled to us banks that they would suspend temporarily some us bank regulations in order to provide us credit markets with needed liquidity adding to other efforts to stem market uncertainty concerning liquidity and settlement problems associated with the bank of new york12 two weeks after the attacks the dollar had declined 3 against the euro and 36 against the yen as foreigners demands both for dollars and for some us financial assets waned the bank of japan intervened in foreign currency markets on

financial reporting deadlines on september 3013 the federal reserve lowered key interest rates by one half percentage point on september 17 and on october 2 the onepoint drop in rates left the federal funds rate at 25 percent and the bank discount rate at 20 the lowest those rates had been since 1962 the drop in rates on september 17 was followed by other central banks including the european central bank the bank of canada and the swedish central bank14 the swiss central bank lowered its interest rates to stop the swiss franc which had been targeted by some investors fleeing from dollars from appreciating further the following day the bank of england cut interest rates by onequarter of percentage point at the european central banks bimonthly meeting on september 27 the bank decided to keep its interest rates unchanged at 375 similar action by the bank on october 25 sparked large selloff of corporat stocks in europe and strengthened foreign demand for dollardenominated assets15 panic selling of dollardenominated assets did not occur as some had feared following the september 11 attacks in many respects currency and financial markets remained more steady than many had expected and regained their preattack levels within weeks by midoctober investors had discounted the effects of the attacks and had turned firmly toward the dollar which recovered its preseptember 11 rates against the yen and the euro16 while some foreigners reduced their dollar asset holdings immediately following the attacks due to concerns about the safety and profitability of such investments17 other investors showed continued interest in dollardenominated assets issues of high quality investment grade corporate bonds and auctions for treasury securities after september 11 went smoothly with strong sales pushing up prices of benchmark 10year treasury securities18 initially this demand stemmed from expectations that the federal reserve would lower key benchmark interest rates by another onehalf percentage point on october 2 the price of bond is inversely related to the interest rate so lowering interest rates raises the price making the bond more valuable on october 4 the

of the financial markets that had been disrupted by the terrorist attacks from spilling over to other markets19 the lack of action by the european central bank in lowering key interest rates and poor economic performance of other economies further strengthened foreign demand for dollardenominated assets in addition the events of september 11th demonstrated that in times of crisis investors still seem to prefer the us dollardenominated bond market to its euro counterpart during the three weeks following the attacks not single corporation sold bond in euros while issues of corporate bonds in the us market fell by only third below its average recent report by the european commission states that the shift toward dollardenominated assets in times of crisis reflects the relative strength and resilience of the us dollar as financing currency in volatile market conditions20 policy analysis foreign investors appear to have shaken off their concerns about the effects of the september 11th attacks on the us economy and are focusing instead on other factors that will affect the course of the us economy during the next year over the long run the underlying economic prospects for the us and other nations will continue to determine the overall international flow of capital foreigners are continuing to invest heavily in us corporate bonds and rally in us stock markets could draw foreign investors back into buying these securities foreigners direct investments to acquire us businesses and real estate also held up well in the first half of 2001 although such investment activity is not expected to match the recordsetting performance of the previous year of more immediate concern however is the impact us economic downturn aggravated by the events of september 11 will have on the global economy the united nations released forecast on october 10 2001 for the world economy in the year ahead that was more pessimistic than previous reports according to the report this added pessimism stems from slowdown in foreign investment in and capital flows to developing economies investments in us treasury securities declined markedly over the past year due to the large federal government budget surpluses which were used in part to retire treasury securities as the surpluses shrink and new treasury securities are issued they are expected to be desired such securities continue to be perceived by most investors as among the most secure in the world moreover the overall monetary fiscal and regulatory framework of the us economy is perceived by most investors as being the best combination for providing the most attractive overall investment climate in the world despite the current weakness in the economy currency analysts expect the dollar to trade lower both in the near term and over the next year one additional complication will be the effects of the introduction of the euro which took place on january 1 2002 although the euro strengthened against the dollar over the summer concerns are growing over the disruptions that could arise from the move to full implementation of the eurohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21102crs6 options and implications for us policy the september 11 attacks dealt major challenge to the us economy and to policymakers around the world financial and foreign exchange market activities were slightly out of the norm the first few weeks following the attacks but actions by the federal reserve and by other central banks helped head off financial panic and loss of confidence by ensuring that the financial system was supplied with liquidity through coordinated actions central bank coordination in times of crises is not uncommon but the speed with which the coordination was reached and the aggressiveness of the banks to stem any loss of confidence in the financial system are unusual the high level of coordination among central banks likely demonstrates the lessons they learned and the techniques they developed by addressing other financial crises over the last two decades it likely also demonstrates the recognition that national economies have become highly interconnected and that shock to one creates spillover effects onto other economies and markets the highly developed and broadbased nature of the us financial system proved that it could weather one of the worst blows in decades not even the aggressive actions by the federal reserve however could anticipate or forestall all of the potential repercussions the federal reserve for instance performs number of functions that although transparent to most market participants are essential to the smooth operating of the system by providing for the timely settlement of market transactions and for sufficient financial resources or liquidity disruptions to this process can create additional and potentially serious problems in other financial markets that may not seem apparent at first glance the crisis also demonstrates that the financial markets are highly efficient at processing information phenomenon which aids in spreading both good and bad news quickly as result the markets absorbed the impact of the september 11 events quickly and likely moved on in short time to assess the economic effects of other economic events and other economic news this means that the overall course of the us economy rather than the events of september 11 likely determined the flows of capital into and out of the united states through the remainder of 2001 the fiscal stimulus provided to the economy by additional federal government spending combined with the measures taken by the federal reserve to lower interest rates are the most important us policy factors affecting the flows of capital into and out of the united states the federal reserve moved aggressively following the terrorist attacks to reassure investors and to demonstrate the strength of the us economic system congressional actions to reinforce that approach appear to have had similar reassuring impact on foreign investors currency traders and the domestic economy such actions included the 40 billion emergency supplemental appropriations for reconstruction and defense pl 10738 september 18 2001 and 15 billion to aid the airline industry
