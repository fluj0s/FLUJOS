environmental policy resources science and industry division wetlands an overview of issues summary the 110th congress like earlier ones considered numerous policy topics that involve wetlands few of the topics were new to this congress such as wetlands provisions in the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 while most were examined but not resolved in earlier congresses such as applying federal regulations on private lands wetland loss rates and restoration and creation accomplishments the 110th congress also considered wetland topics at the program level responding to legal decisions and administrative actions affecting the jurisdictional boundary limits of the federal wetland permit program in the clean water act cwa perhaps the issue receiving the greatest attention was determining which wetlands should be included and excluded from permit requirements under the cwas regulatory program as result of supreme court rulings in 2001 in the swancc case that narrowed federal regulatory jurisdiction over certain isolated wetlands and in june 2006 in the rapanoscarabell decision that left the jurisdictional reach of the permit program to be determined on casebycase basis in the 110th congress house and senate committees held hearings on legislation intended to reverse the courts rulings hr 2421 s 1870 wetland protection efforts continue to engender intense controversy over issues of science and policy controversial topics include the rate and pattern of loss whether all wetlands should be protected in single fashion the effectiveness of the current suite of laws in protecting them and the fact that 75 of remaining us wetlands are located on private lands one reason for these controversies is that wetlands occur in wide variety of physical forms and the numerous values they provide such as wildlife habitat also vary widely in addition the total wetland acreage in the lower 48 states is estimated to have declined from more than 220 million acres three centuries ago to 1077 million acres in 2004 the national policy goal of net loss endorsed by administrations for the past two decades has been reached according to the fish and wildlife service as the rate of loss has been more than offset by net gains through expanded restoration efforts authorized in multiple laws many protection advocates say that net gains do not necessarily account for the changes in quality of the remaining wetlands and many also view federal protection efforts as inadequate or uncoordinated others who advocate the rights of property owners and development interests characterize them as too intrusive numerous state and local wetland programs add to the complexity of the protection effort contents introduction 1 wetlands science and information 2 what is wetland 3 what functional

different regions as swamps marshes fens potholes playa lakes or bogs although these places can differ greatly they all have distinctive plant and animal assemblages because of the wetness of the soil some wetland areas may be continuously inundated by water while other areas may not be flooded at all in coastal areas flooding may occur daily as tides rise and fall prior to the mid1980s federal laws and policies to protect wetlands were generally limited to providing habitat for migratory waterfowl especially ducks and geese some laws encouraged destruction of wetland areas including selected provisions in the federal tax code public works legislation and farm programs since the mid1980s the values of wetlands have been recognized in different ways in numerous national policies and federal laws either encourage wetland protection or prohibit or do not support their destruction these laws however do not add up to fully consistent or comprehensive national approach the central federal regulatory program found in section 404 of the clean water act requires permits for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into many but not all wetland areas however other activities that may adversely affect wetlands do not require permits and some places that scientists define as wetlands are exempt from this permit program because of physical characteristics or the type of activity that takes place one agricultural program swampbuster is disincentive program that indirectly protects wetlands by making farmers who drain wetlands ineligible for federal farm program benefits those who do not receive these benefits 56 of all farmers received federal farm payments of any kind in 2006 have reason to observe the requirements of this program numerous other acquisition protection and restoration programs complete the current federal effort although numerous wetland protection bills have been introduced in recent congresses the most significant new wetlands legislation to be enacted has been in farm bills in 1996 2002 and 2008 during this period congress also reauthorized several wetlands programs mostly setting higher appropriations ceilings without making significant shifts in policy the bush administration endorsed wetland protection in legislation such as the farm bill and the north american wetlands conservation act reauthorization and at events such as earth day presentations the bush administration also issued guidance on mitigation policies and regulatory program jurisdiction the latter has been controversial see discussion below congress has provided forum in numerous hearings where conflicting interests in wetland issues have been debated these debates encompass disparate scientific crs2 and programmatic questions and conflicting views of the role of government where private property is involved broadly speaking the conflicts are between environmental interests and wetland protection advocates who have been pressing for greater wetlands protection as multiple values have been more widely recognized by improving coordination and consistency among agencies and levels of governments and strengthened programs and others including landowners farmers and small businessmen who counter that protection efforts have gone too far by aggressively protecting privately owned wet areas that provide few wetland values they have been especially critical of the us army corps of engineers corps and the us environmental protection agency epa asserting that they administer the section 404 program in an overzealous and inflexible manner wetland legislative activity in the 110th congress centered broadly on two issues one was on wetlands conservation provisions in the 2008 farm bill which was enacted in june 2008 food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110 246 the new law reauthorizes and increases the acreage enrollment cap in the wetlands reserve program with goal of enrolling 250000 acres annually and extends provisions to enroll up to million acres of wetlands and buffers in the conservation reserve program other agricultural conservation programs while lacking explicit wetlands protection provisions are still likely to be beneficial to wetlands the second major area of legislative interest centered on proposals to reverse supreme court rulings that addressed and narrowed the scope of geographic jurisdiction of wetlands regulations under the clean water act this interest arises because federal courts have played key role in interpreting and clarifying the limits of federal jurisdiction to regulate activities that affect wetlands especially since 2001 supreme court ruling in the socalled swancc decision and 2006 ruling in rapanos v united states house and senate committees held hearings on legislation intended to reverse the swancc and rapanos rulings hr 2421 s 1870 the clean water authority restoration act wetlands science and information scientific questions about wetlands with answers that can be important to policy makers include how to define wetlands how to catalogue the rate and pattern of wetland declines and losses as well as restorations and increases and how to assess the importance of wetland changes to broader ecosystems wetlands science has made considerable strides in developing fuller and more sophisticated knowledge about many aspects of wetlands in the more than two decades since crs3 protecting wetlands became general policy goal in federal law and program administration1 two topics where scientific information and wetland protection policies remain inconsistent continue to be should all regulated wetlands be treated equally and if all scientificallydefined wetlands are not covered by the federal regulatory program what subset should be covered and how should such decisions be made while discussion of either question has major science elements both are primarily addressed in the section below about the clean water act section 404 program what is wetland scientists generally agree that the presence of wetland can be determined by combination of soils plants and hydrology the only definition of wetlands in law in the swampbuster provisions of farm legislation pl 99198 and in the emergency wetlands resources act of 1986 pl 99645 lists those three components this definition does not include more specific criteria such as exactly what conditions must be present and for how long thus leaving interpretation to scientists and regulators on casebycase basis controversies are exacerbated when many sites that have those three components and are identified as wetlands by experts either may have wetland characteristics only some portion of the time or may not look like what many people visualize as wetlands also many of these sites have been directly or indirectly modified by human activities that diminish their appearance and their ability to perform wetland functions wetlands currently subject to federal regulation are large subset of all places that members of the scientific community would call wetland these regulated wetlands under the section 404 program discussed below are currently identified using technical criteria in wetland delineation manual issued by the corps in 1987 this manual was prepared jointly and is used by all federal agencies to carry out their responsibilities under this program the corps epa fish and wildlife service fws and the national marine fisheries service nmfs it provides guidance and fieldlevel consistency for the agencies that have roles in wetland regulatory protection second and slightly different manual agreed to by the corps and the natural resources conservation service nrcs is used for delineating wetlands on agricultural lands while the agencies try to improve the objectivity and consistency of wetland identification and delineation judgment continues to play role and can lead to sitespecific controversies cases discussed below see section 404 judicial proceedings swancc and rapanos center on whether wetlands should be included or exempted from the regulatory program in certain circumstances such as the physical setting 1 two places to view some of the changes in scientific knowledge and understanding are through the products of the society of state wetlands managers httpwwwaswmorg and the society of wetland scientists httpwwwswsorg crs4 what functional values are provided by wetlands functional values both ecological and economic at each wetland depend on its location size and relationship to adjacent land and water areas many of these values have been recognized only recently historically many federal programs encouraged wetlands to be drained or altered because they were seen as having little value as wetlands for example flood protection programs of the corps and department of agriculture have modified or eliminated many flood plain wetlands through alterations of the hydraulichydrologic regime wetland values can include habitat for aquatic birds and other animals and plants including numerous threatened and endangered species production of fish and shellfish water storage including mitigating the effects of floods and droughts water purification recreation timber production food production education and research and open space and aesthetic values usually wetlands provide some combination of these values single wetlands rarely provide all of these values the composite value typically declines when wetlands are altered in addition the effects of alteration often extend well beyond the immediate area because wetlands are usually part of larger water system for example conversion of wetlands to urban uses has increased flood damages this value has received considerable attention as the costs of natural disaster costs mounted since the 1990s how fast are wetlands disappearing and how many acres are left number of reports document recent changes in wetland acres the us fish and wildlife service periodically surveys national net trends in wetland acreage using the national wetlands inventory nwi it has estimated that when european settlers first arrived wetland acreage in the area that would become the 48 states was more than 220 million acres or about 5 of the total land area according to its most recent report issued in 2006 by 2004 total wetland acreage was estimated to be 1077 million acres according to data it presented in its most recent survey2 data compiled by the nrcs and the fws in separate surveys and using different methodologies have identified similar trends both show that the annual net loss rate dropped from almost 500000 acres annually nearly three decades ago to 2 us fish and wildlife service national wetlands inventory status and trends of wetlands in the coterminus united states 1998 2004 march 2006 110 pp this is the most recent of several reports by the inventory over the past 25 years which document wetlands trends at both national and regional scale crs5 slight net annual gains in recent years the fws survey estimated that the average annual gain between 1998 and 2004 was 32000 acres while nrcs using its natural resources inventory of privatelyowned lands estimated that there was an average annual gain of 26000 acres between 1997 and 20023 nrcs cautioned against making precise claims of net increases because of statistical uncertainties some environmentalists caution that the increases identified in the latest fws data are tied to proliferation of small shallow ponds rather than natural wetlands in 2002 the bush administration endorsed the concept of nonetloss of wetlands goal declared by president george h w bush in 1988 and also embraced by president clinton to balance wetlands losses and gains in the short term and achieve net gains in the long term on earth day 2004 president bush announced new national goal moving beyond nonetloss of achieving an overall increase of wetlands4 the goal was to create improve and protect at least three million wetland acres over the next five years in order to increase overall wetland acres and quality by comparison the clinton administration in 1998 announced policies intended to achieve overall wetland increases of 200000 acres per year by 2005 the presidents strategy also called for better tracking of wetland programs and enhanced local and private sector collaboration in april 2008 the administration issued report saying that more than 36 million acres of wetlands had been restored protected or improved as part of the presidents program to create improve and protect wetlands since april 2004 and that the number will climb to 45 million acres by the original date set by that program earth day 20095 the report documents gains but not offsetting loses it summarizes accomplishments for each federal wetland conservation program environmental groups criticized the report as presenting an incomplete picture because it fails to mention wetlands lost to agriculture and development numerous shifts in federal policies since 1985 and changes in economic conditions as well strongly influence wetland loss patterns but the composite effects remain unmeasured beyond these raw numbers there usually is large time lag from the announcement and implementation of changes in policy to collection and release of data that measure how these changes affect loss rates also it is often very difficult to distinguish the role that policy changes play from other factors such as agricultural markets development pressures and land markets further these data only measure acres this may have been appropriate two decades ago when scientists knew less about how to measure the specific functions and values found in wetlands by providing data limited to number of acres these data provide few insights into changes in their quality as measured by the values they provide which is often determined by factors such as where wetland is located in 3 natural resources conservation service national resources inventory 2002 annual nri wetlands see httpwwwnrcsusdagovtechnicalnri2003nri03wetlandshtml 4 see

april 2008 crs6 watershed and what are the surrounding land uses nevertheless in his earth day 2004 wetlands announcement discussed above president bush said that as the nation is nearing the goal of nonetloss it is appropriate to move towards policies that will result in net increase of wetland acres and quality selected federal wetlands programs federal program issues include the administration of programs to protect restore or mitigate wetland resources especially the clean water act section 404 program relationships between agricultural and regulatory programs whether all wetlands should be treated the same in federal programs and which wetlands should be subject to regulation and whether protecting wetlands by acres is an effective proxy for protecting wetlands based on the functions they perform and the values they provide in addition private property questions are raised because almost threequarters of the remaining wetlands are located on private lands some property owners believe that they should be compensated when federal programs limit how they can use their land and for decisions that arguably diminish the value of the land the clean water act section 404 program the principal federal program that provides regulatory protection for wetlands is found in section 404 of the clean water act cwa its intent is to protect water and adjacent wetland areas from adverse environmental effects due to discharges of dredged or fill material enacted in 1972 section 404 requires landowners or developers to obtain permits from the corps of engineers to carry out activities involving disposal of dredged or fill materials into waters of the united states including wetlands the corps has long had regulatory jurisdiction over dredging and filling starting with the river and harbor act of 1899 the corps and epa share responsibility for administering the section 404 program other federal agencies including nrcs fws and nmfs also have roles in this process in the 1970s legal decisions in key cases led the corps to revise this program to incorporate broad jurisdictional definitions in terms of both regulated waters and adjacent wetlands section 404 was last amended in 1977 this judicialregulatoryadministrative evolution of the section 404 program has generally pleased those who view it as critical tool in wetland protection but dismayed others who would prefer more limited corps jurisdiction or who see the expanded regulatory program as intruding on private landuse decisions and treating wetlands of widely varying value similarly underlying this debate is the more general question of whether section 404 is the best approach to federal wetland protection some wetland protection advocates have proposed that it be replaced or greatly altered first they point out that it governs only the discharge of dredged or fill material while not regulating other acts that drain flood or otherwise reduce functional values second because of exemptions provided in 1977 amendments to crs7 section 404 major categories of activities are not required to obtain permits these include normal ongoing farming ranching and silvicultural forestry activities further permits generally are not required for activities which drain wetlands only for those that fill wetlands which excludes large number of actions with potential to alter wetlands third in the view of protection advocates the multiple values that wetlands can provide eg fish and wildlife habitat flood control are not effectively recognized through statutory approach based principally on water quality despite the broad objectives of the clean water act the permitting process the corps regulatory process involves both general permits for actions by private landowners that are similar in nature and will likely have minor effect on wetlands and individual permits for more significant actions according to the corps it evaluates more than 85000 permit requests annually of those more than 90 are authorized under general permit which can apply regionally or nationwide and is essentially permit by rule meaning the proposed activity is presumed to have minor impact individually and cumulatively most general permits do not require prenotification or prior approval by the corps about 9 of all permits are required to go through the more detailed evaluation for standard individual permit which may involve complex proposals or sensitive environmental issues and can take 180 days or longer for decision less than 03 of permits are denied most other individual permits are modified or conditioned before issuance about 5 of applications are withdrawn prior to permit decision in fy2003 the most recent year for which data are available corpsissued permits authorized activities having total of 21330 acres of wetland impact while those permits required that 43379 acres of wetlands be restored created or enhanced as mitigation for the authorized losses6 regulatory procedures on individual permits allow for interagency review and comment coordination process that can generate delays and an uncertain outcome especially for environmentally controversial projects epa is the only federal agency having veto power over proposed corps permit epa has used its veto authority fewer than dozen times in the 30plus years since the program began however critics have charged that implied threats of delay by the fws and others practically amount to the same thing reforms during the reagan earlier bush and clinton administrations streamlined certain of these procedures with the intent of speeding up and clarifying the corps full regulatory program but concerns continue over both process and program goals controversy also surrounded revised regulations issued by epa and the corps in may 2002 which redefine two key terms in the 404 program fill material and discharge of fill material the agencies said that the revisions were intended to clarify certain confusion in their joint administration of the program due to previous differences in how the two agencies defined those terms however environmental groups contended that the changes allow for less restrictive and inadequate regulation of certain disposal activities including disposal of coal mining waste which could be harmful to aquatic life in streams the senate environment and public works 6 us army corps of engineers regulatory statistics all permit decisions fy2003 see httpwwwusacearmymilcwcecworeg2003webchartspdf crs8 committee held hearing in june 2002 to review these issues and legislation was introduced to reverse the agencies action by clarifying in the law that fill material cannot be composed of waste but further action occurred7 similar legislation was introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses and was again introduced in the 110th congress hr 2169 the clean water protection act nationwide permits nationwide permits are key means by which the corps minimizes the burden of its regulatory program nationwide permit is form of general permit which authorizes category of activities throughout the nation and is valid only if the conditions applicable to the permit are met these general permits authorize activities that are similar in nature and are judged to cause only minimal adverse effect on the environment individually and cumulatively general permits minimize the burden of the corps regulatory program by authorizing landowners to proceed without having to obtain individual permits in advance the current program has few strong supporters for differing reasons developers say that it is too complex and burdened with arbitrary restrictions environmentalists say that it does not adequately protect aquatic resources at issue is whether the program has become so complex and expansive that it cannot either protect aquatic resources or provide for fair regulatory system which are its dual objectives nationwide permits are issued for periods of longer than five years and thereafter must be reissued by the corps on march 12 2007 the corps issued package of nationwide permits replacing those that had been in effect since 2002 the 2007 permits establish six new nationwide permits for total of 49 and also revise number of existing permits and general terms and conditions that apply to all nationwide permits8 citizen groups have filed lawsuits seeking to halt the corps use of one of its nationwide permits nwp 21 to authorize type of coal mining practice called mountaintop mining these critics contend that the adverse environmental impacts of activities authorized by nwp 21 are far greater than the minimal adverse effects limits prescribed by the clean water act for all nationwide permits in 2004 federal district court in west virginia ruled that nwp 21 violates the cwa by authorizing activities that have more than minimal adverse environmental effects the district courts ruling was overturned on appeal another lawsuit challenging the applicability of nationwide permits to mountaintop mining in kentucky also has been filed and is pending9 section 404 authorizes states to assume many of the corps permitting responsibilities two states have done this michigan in 1984 and new jersey in 7 for additional information see crs report rl31411 controversies over redefining fill material under the clean water act by claudia copeland 8 us department of defense department of the army corps of engineers reissuance of nationwide permits notice 72 federal register 1109111198 march 12 2007 9 for background see crs report rs21421 mountaintop mining background on current controversies by claudia copeland crs9 1992 others have cited the complex process of assumption the anticipated cost of running program and the continued involvement of federal agencies because of statutory limits on waters that states could regulate as reasons for not joining these two states efforts continue to encourage more states to assume program responsibility section 404 judicial proceedings swancc and rapanos the section 404 program has been the focus of numerous lawsuits most of which have sought to narrow the geographic scope of the regulatory program swancc an issue of longstanding controversy is whether isolated waters are properly within the jurisdiction of section 404 isolated waters those that lack permanent surface outlet to downstream waters which are not physically adjacent to navigable surface waters often appear to provide few of the values for which wetlands are protected even if they meet the technical definition of wetland in january 2001 the supreme court ruled on the question of whether the cwa provides the corps and epa with authority over isolated waters and wetlands the courts 54 ruling in solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 held that the denial of section 404 permit for disposal on isolated wetlands solely on the basis that migratory birds use the site exceeds the authority provided in the cwa the full extent of retraction of the regulatory program resulting from this decision remains unclear even more than seven years after the ruling environmentalists believe that the court misinterpreted congressional intent on the matter while industry and landowner groups welcomed the ruling10 policy implications of how much the decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied and since the 2001 court decision other federal courts have issued number of rulings that have reached varying conclusions some federal courts have interpreted swancc narrowly thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few read the decision more broadly attorneys for industry and developers say that the courts will remain the primary battleground for cwa jurisdiction questions so long as neither the administration nor congress takes steps to define jurisdiction the governments view on the key question of the scope of cwa jurisdiction in light of swancc and other court rulings came in legal memorandum issued jointly by epa and the corps in january 200311 it provides legal interpretation essentially based on narrow reading of the courts decision thus allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue in cases where factors other than the presence of migratory birds may exist thus allowing for assertion of federal jurisdiction but it calls for more review by higher levels in the agencies in such cases administration press releases said that the guidance demonstrates the governments commitment to nonetloss wetlands policy however it was 10 for additional information see crs report rl30849 the supreme court addresses corps of engineers jurisdiction over isolated waters the swancc decision by robert meltz and claudia copeland 11 see httpwwwepagovowowwetlandspdfjoint_memopdf crs10 apparent that the issues remained under discussion because at the same time the administration issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm seeking comment on how to define waters that are under the regulatory programs jurisdiction the anprm did not actually propose rule changes but it indicated possible ways that clean water act rules might be modified to further limit federal jurisdiction building on swancc and some of the subsequent legal decisions the government received more than 133000 comments on the anprm most of them negative according to epa and the corps environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules saying that the law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the clean water act and narrow interpretation of swancc but developers sought changes to clarify interpretation of the swancc ruling in december 2003 epa and the corps announced that the administration would not pursue rule changes concerning federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands the epa administrator said that the administration wanted to avoid contentious and lengthy rulemaking debate over the issue nonetheless interest groups on all sides have been critical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance which constitutes the main tool for interpreting the reach of the swancc decision environmentalists remain concerned about diminished protection resulting from the guidance while developers said that without new rule confusing and contradictory interpretations of wetland rules likely will continue in that vein government accountability office gao report concluded that corps districts differ in how they interpret and apply federal rules when determining which waters and wetlands are subject to federal jurisdiction documenting enough differences that the corps has begun comprehensive survey of its district office practices to help promote greater consistency12 concerns over inconsistent or confusing regulation of wetlands have also drawn congressional interest13 rapanoscarabell federal courts continue to have key role in interpreting and clarifying the swancc decision in february 2006 the supreme court heard arguments in two cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of the cwa permit program as it applies to development of wetlands the issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the cwa to cover waters that were not navigable waters in the traditional sense but were connected somehow to navigable waters or adjacent to those waters the act requires federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters many legal and other observers hoped that the courts ruling in these cases would bring greater clarity about the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction the courts ruling was issued on june 19 2006 rapanos et v united states 126 sct 2208 2006 in 54 decision plurality of the court led by 12 us government accountability office corps of engineers needs to evaluate its district office practices in determining jurisdiction gao04297 february 2004 45 pp 13 us congress house of representatives committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment inconsistent regulation of wetlands and other waters hearing 10858 108th cong 2nd sess march 30 2004 crs11 justice scalia held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the cwa justice kennedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and remand the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the substantive issues raised by the cases as did four other dissenting justices14 legal observers suggested that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by the justices did not draw clear line regarding what wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one likely result is more casebycase determinations and continuing litigation there also could be renewed pressure on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking the senate environment and public works committee held hearing on issues raised by the courts ruling on august 1 2006 members and number of witnesses urged epa and the corps to issue new guidance to clarify the scope of the ruling on june 5 2007 nearly one year after the rapanos ruling epa and the corps did issue guidance to enable their field staffs to make cwa jurisdictional determinations in light of the decision15 according to the guidance the agencies will assert regulatory jurisdiction over certain waters such as traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands jurisdiction over others such as nonnavigable tributaries that do not typically flow yearround and wetlands adjacent to such tributaries will be determined on casebycase basis to determine if the waters in question have significant nexus with traditional navigable water the guidance details how the agencies should evaluate whether there is significant nexus the guidance is not intended to increase or decrease cwa jurisdiction and it does not supersede or nullify the january 2003 guidance discussed above which addressed jurisdiction over isolated wetlands in light of swancc in accompanying documents the agencies said that the administration was considering rulemaking in response to the rapanos decision but they noted that developing new rules would take more time than issuing the guidance they also noted that while the guidance provides more clarity for how jurisdictional determinations will be made concerning nonnavigable tributaries and their adjacent wetlands legal challenges to the scope of cwa jurisdiction are likely to continue the guidance was effective immediately but the agencies also solicited public comments for sixmonth period further changes could follow after reviewing the public comments the agencies said but changes have been made so far while the issue of how regulatory protection of wetlands is affected by the swancc and rapanos decisions continues to evolve the remaining responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states and localities whether states will act to fill in the gap left by removal of some federal jurisdiction is likely to be constrained by budgetary and political pressures but few states wisconsin and ohio for 14 for additional information see crs report rl33263 the wetlands coverage of the

guidancecwawatershtml crs12 example have passed new laws or amended regulations to do so in comments on the 2003 anprm many states said that they do not have authority or financial resources to protect their wetlands in the absence of federal involvement legislation to reverse the swancc and rapanos decisions was introduced in the 110th congress hr 2421 and s 1870 the clean water authority restoration act of 2007 similar legislation was introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses it would provide broad statutory definition of waters of the united states is intended to clarify that the cwa is meant to protect us waters from pollution not just maintain their navigability and includes set of findings to assert constitutional authority over waters and wetlands16 the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings on hr 2421 and related jurisdictional issues on july 17 and july 19 2007 another hearing was held april 16 2008 the full senate environment and public works committee held hearing on issues related to the rapanos ruling on december 13 2007 and held legislative hearing on s 1870 on april 9 2008 proponents of the legislation argue that congress must clarify the important issues left unsettled by the supreme courts 2001 and 2006 rulings and by the recent corpsepa guidance bill sponsors argue that the legislation would reaffirm what congress intended when the cwa was enacted in 1972 and what epa and the corps have subsequently been practicing until recently in terms of cwa jurisdiction but critics assert that the legislation would expand federal authority and thus would have unintended but foreseeable consequences that are likely to increase confusion rather than settle it critics question the constitutionality of the bill arguing that by including all nonnavigable waters in the jurisdiction of the cwa it exceeds the limits of congresss authority under the commerce clause supporters contend that the legislation is properly grounded in congresss commerce power in light of the widely differing views of proponents and opponents future prospects for this legislation are uncertain the bush administration did not take position on any legislation to clarify the scope of waters of the united states protected under the cwa17 one difficulty of legislating changes to the cwa in order to protect wetlands results from the fact that the complex scientific questions about such areas see discussion above wetlands information and science are not easily amenable to precise resolution in law the debate over revising the act highlights the challenges of using the law to do so should all wetlands be treated equally under the section 404 program there is perception that all jurisdictional wetlands are treated equally 16 other legislation to restrict regulatory jurisdiction was introduced in the 109th congress hr 2658 it sought to narrow the statutory definition of navigable waters and define certain isolated wetlands and other areas as not being subject to federal regulatory jurisdiction it also would give the corps sole authority to determine section 404 jurisdiction for permitting purposes 17 for additional information see crs general distribution memorandum analysis of the clean water restoration act of 2007 hr 2421 and s 1870 by claudia copeland and robert meltz october 3 2007 crs13 regardless of size functions or values in reality this is not the case because the corps general permits do provide accelerated regulatory decisions for many activities that affect wetlands however this perception has led critics to focus on situations where wetland has little apparent value but the landowners proposal is not approved or the landowner is penalized for altering wetland without federal permit critics believe that one possible solution may be to have tiered approach for regulating wetlands legislation introduced in past congresses proposed to establish multiple tiers typically three from highly valuable wetlands that should receive the greatest protection to the least valuable wetlands where alterations might usually be allowed some states new york for example use such an approach for stateregulated wetlands the corps and epa issued guidance to field staff emphasizing the flexibility that currently exists in the section 404 program to apply less vigorous permit review to small projects with minor environmental impacts three questions arise 1 what are the implications of implementing classification program 2 how clearly can line separating each wetland category be defined 3 are there regions where wetlands should be treated differently regarding classification even most wetland protection advocates acknowledge that there are some situations where wetland designation with total protection is not appropriate but they fear that classification for different degrees of protection could be first step toward major erosion in overall wetland protection also these advocates would probably like to see almost all wetlands presumed to be in the highest protection category unless experts can prove an area should receive lesser level of protection while critics who view protection efforts as excessive would seek the reverse locating the boundary line of wetland can be controversial when the line encompasses areas that do not meet the image held by many controversy would likely grow if tiered approach required that lines segment wetland areas on the other hand consistent application of an agreedon definition may lead to fewer disputes and result in more timely decisions some states have far more wetlands than others different treatment has been proposed for alaska because about onethird of the state is designated as wetlands yet very small portion has been converted legislative proposals have been made to exempt that state from the section 404 program until 1 of its wetlands have been lost some types of wetlands are already treated differently for example playas and prairie potholes have somewhat different definitions under swampbuster discussed below and the effect is to increase the number of acres that are considered as wetlands this differential treatment contributes to questions about federal regulatory consistency on private property agriculture and wetlands national surveys more than two decades ago indicated that agricultural activities had been responsible for about 80 of wetland loss in the preceding decades making this topic focus for policymakers seeking to protect the remaining wetlands congress responded by creating programs in farm legislation starting in 1985 crs14 conservation programs in the farm bill use both disincentives and incentives to encourage landowners to protect and restore wetlands swampbuster and the wetlands reserve program are the two largest efforts but others such as the conservation reserve programs wetland and buffer acres pilot program and the conservation reserve enhancement program are also being used to protect wetlands the 110th congress enacted legislation to reauthorize farm programs through 2012 food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill authorized new programs that could further assist wetlands conservation the most recent wetland loss survey conducted by the nrcs comparing data from 1997 and 2002 indicates that there was small annual increase for the first time since these data have been collected of 26000 acres18 however the agency warns that statistical uncertainties preclude concluding with certainty that gain is actually occurring wetlands were major topic of discussion in debate on the 2008 farm bill members of the farm community have expressed wide range of views about wetland protection from strong opposition to strong support these views are frequently framed in the context of two general concerns about wetland protection efforts first as philosophical matter some object to federal regulation of private lands regardless of the societal values those lands might provide second many farmers want certainty and predictability about the land they farm to limit their financial risk therefore if wetlands are located on property that they farm they want assurances that the boundary line delineating wetlands will remain where located for as long as possible swampbuster swampbuster enacted in 1985 uses disincentives rather than regulations to protect wetlands on agricultural lands it removes farmers eligibility from all government price and income support programs for activities such as draining dredging filling leveling or otherwise altering wetland swampbuster has been controversial with farmers concerned about redefining an appropriate federal role in wetland protection on agricultural lands and with wetland protection advocates concerned about inadequate enforcement since 1995 the nrcs has made wetland determinations only in response to requests because of uncertainty over whether changes in regulation or law would modify boundaries that have already been delineated nrcs has estimated that more than 26 million wetland determinations have been made and that more than 4 million may eventually be required swampbuster amendments in 1996 pl 104127 granted producers greater flexibility by making changes such as exempting swampbuster penalties when wetlands are voluntarily restored providing that prior converted wetlands are not to be considered abandoned if they remain in agricultural use and granting goodfaith exemptions they also encourage mitigation established mitigation banking pilot program and repealed required consultation with the fws amendments enacted in the 2008 farm bill will require an additional layer of review within usda for compliance with swampbuster 18 see httpwwwnrcsusdagovtechnicalnri2003nri03wetlandshtml crs15 other agricultural wetlands programs under the wetland reserve program wrp enacted in 1990 landowners receive payments for placing easements on farmed wetlands it provides longterm technical and financial assistance to landowners with the opportunity to protect restore and enhance wetlands on their property and to establish wildlife practices and protection the 2002 farm bill reauthorized the program through fy2007 and raised the enrollment cap to 2275000 acres with 250000 acres to be enrolled annually nrcs has also taken administrative actions implementing this program such as announcing new enhancement program on the lower missouri river in nebraska to enroll almost 19000 acres at cost of 26 million working with several public and private partners in june 2004 through fy2005 9226 projects had enrolled 1744 million acres and easements have been perfected on 137 million of those acres majority of the easements are in three states louisiana mississippi and arkansas most of the land is enrolled under permanent easements while only about 10 is enrolled under 10 year restoration agreements according to data supplied by nrcs in support of its fy2007 budget request prior to the 2002 farm bill farmer interest had exceeded available funding which may help to explain why congress raised the enrollment ceiling in that legislation the 2008 farm bill increased the wrp maximum enrollment cap from 2275 million acres to 3014 million acres and expanded eligible lands to include certain types of private and tribal wetlands croplands and grasslands as well as lands that meet the habitat needs of wildlife species the bill made certain program changes including specifying criteria for ranking program applications and requiring usda to submit report to congress on longterm conservation easements under the program the legislation authorized new wetlands reserve enhancement program which will allow usda to enter into agreements with states in order to leverage federal funds for wetlands protection and enhancement the 2002 farm bill expanded the 500000acre wetland and buffer acreage pilot program within the conservation reserve program crp to 1millionacre program available nationwide crp allows producers to enter into 10 to 15year contracts to install certain conservation practices the 2008 farm bill amended the pilot program to increase the amount of acreage that states can enroll up to 100000 acres or national maximum of one million acres participants must agree to restore wetland hydrology establish appropriate vegetation and refrain from commercial use of the land the wetland and buffer program may become more important to overall protection efforts in the wake of the swancc decision discussed above which limited the reach of the section 404 permit program to many small wetlands that are isolated from navigable waterways through september 2006 more than 166000 acres had been enrolled in this program through more than 10000 contracts with about 70000 of those acres in iowa in august 2004 the administration announced new wetland restoration initiative to allow enrollment of up to 250000 acres of large wetland complexes and playa lakes located outside the 100year floodplain in the crp after october 1 2004 the administration estimated that implementation of this initiative will cost 200 million participants receive incentive payments to help pay for restoring the crs16 hydrology of the site as well as rental payments and cost sharing assistance to install eligible conservation practices the 2008 farm bill included amendments for several agriculture conservation programs including the environmental quality incentives program eqip the farmland protection program and the wildlife habitat incentive program in ways that may have incidental protection benefits for wetlands because of higher funding levels or because of program changes for example eqip supports the installation or implementation of structural and management practices and the 2008 farm bill expanded the program to include practices that enhance wetlands finally some programs could less directly help protect wetlands including the conservation security program renamed the conservation stewardship program which provides payments to install and maintain practices on agricultural lands the new agricultural water enhancement program replacing the previous ground and surface water conservation program it is funded through eqip which is designed to address water quality and quantity concerns on agricultural land and several other programs to better manage water resources19 agricultural wetlands and the section 404 program t h c w section 404 program applies to qualified wetlands in all locations including agricultural lands but the corps and epa exempt prior converted lands wetlands modified for agricultural purposes before 1985 from section 404 permit requirements under memorandum of agreement moa and since 1977 the clean water act has exempted normal farming activities the supreme courts swancc decision apparently exempts certain isolated wetlands from corps jurisdiction nrcs estimated that about 8 million acres in agricultural locations might be exempted by this decision while these exemptions and the moa displease some protection advocates they have probably dampened some of the criticism from farming interests over federal regulation of private lands on the other hand the prospect that congress might enact legislation to reverse the courts 2001 and 2006 rulings discussed above has particularly alarmed farm groups who fear that changes in law or regulations could negatively affect their activities the corps and nrcs have been unsuccessful in revising the moa since 1996 despite decade of negotiation although they signed very general partnership agreement on july 7 2005 some of the wetlands that fall outside section 404 requirements as result of judicial decisions can now be protected if landowners decide to enroll them into the revised farmable wetlands program or under other new initiatives private property rights and landowner compensation an estimated 74 of all remaining wetlands in the coterminous states are on private lands questions of federal regulation of private property stem from the argument that land owners should be compensated when taking occurs and alternative uses are prohibited or restrictions on use are imposed to protect wetland 19 for more information on these provisions see crs report rl34557 conservation provisions of the 2008 farm bill by tadlock cowan and renee johnson crs17 values the us constitution provides that property owners shall be compensated if private property is taken by government action the courts generally have found that compensation is not required unless all reasonable uses are precluded many individuals or companies purchase land with the expectation that they can alter it if that ability is denied they contend then the land is greatly reduced in value many argue that taking should be recognized when site is designated as wetland in 2002 the supreme court held that rhode island man who had acquired property after the state enacted wetlands regulation affecting the parcel is not automatically prevented from bringing an action to recover compensation from the state instead the court ruled that the property retained some economic use after the states action palazzolo v rhode island 533 us 606 2002 congress while under republican control explored these wetlands property rights issues on several occasions an example is an october 2001 hearing by the house transportation and infrastructure committee subcommittee on water resources and the environment20 recent congresses considered but did not enact property rights protection proposals democratic leadership appears less interested in bringing attention to this topic the bush administration did not state an official position on these types of proposals21 wetland restoration and mitigation federal wetland policies during the past decade have increasingly emphasized restoration of wetland areas much of this restoration occurs as part of efforts to mitigate the loss of wetlands at other sites the mitigation concept has broad appeal but implementation has left conflicting record examination of this record presented in june 2001 report from the national research council found it to be wanting the nrc report said that mitigation projects called for in permits affecting wetlands were not meeting the federal governments net loss policy goal for wetlands function22 likewise 2001 gao report criticized the ability of the corps to track the impact of projects under its current mitigation program that allows in lieufee mitigation projects in exchange for issuing permits allowing wetlands development23 both scientists and policymakers debate whether it is possible to restore or create wetlands with ecological and other functions equivalent to or better than those of natural wetlands that have been lost over time results so far seem to vary depending on the type of wetland and the level of commitment to monitoring and maintenance congress has repeatedly endorsed mitigation in recent years 20 us

wetlands has occurred coastal wetlands are about 5 of all us wetlands the current rate of loss is more than 15000 acres per year decline from higher rates in earlier years24 in response to these losses congress authorized task force led by the corps to prepare list of coastal wetland restoration projects in the state and also provided funding to plan and carry out restoration projects in this and other coastal states under the coastal wetlands planning protection and restoration act of 1990 also known as the breaux act25 the projects range from reintroduction of freshwater and diversion of sediment to construction of shoreline barriers and planting of vegetation in total the estimated total cost to complete all 147 approved projects is 178 billion in 2007 report gao reported that it is impossible to determine the collective success of restoring coastal wetlands in louisiana because of an inadequate approach to monitoring gao had reviewed the breaux act program to identify the types of projects that have been designed and lessons that have been learned from 74 projects that have been completed so far26 others including the national oceanic and atmospheric administration disagreed with gaos findings observing that long term data being provided through ongoing project monitoring are intended to yield insight into qualitative and quantitative project performance in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita in the summer of 2005 multiple legislative proposals were introduced to fund additional restoration projects already planned by the us army corps of engineers and to explore other opportunities that would restore and stabilize wetlands in southern louisiana without remedial action the net effect of these storms will likely be major permanent losses especially along the coast these losses are partially offset as some destruction was temporary and in few situations new wetlands were created the extent of change and loss continues to be documented by federal agencies and others more specifically before the hurricanes congress was considering legislation that would have provided about 2 billion to the restoration effort since the 2005 hurricanes more expansive options costing up to 14 billion that were proposed in the 1998 report coast 2050 are also being considered27 s 3711 the gulf of mexico energy security act was passed during the final days

for which these revenues can be spent is wetland restoration and the availability of these funds may affect the amount and scale of wetland restoration activity in the central gulf coast other federal protection efforts many federal agencies have been active in wetland improvement efforts in recent years in particular the fish and wildlife service fws has been promoting the success of its partners for fish and wildlife program which congress reauthorized through fy2011 in 2006 pl 109294 through voluntary agreements the partners program provides technical assistance and cost share incentives directly to landowners for wetland restoration projects on private lands29 other programs also restore and protect domestic and international wetlands one of these derives from the north american wetlands conservation act reauthorized through fy2012 in pl 109322 with an appropriations ceiling of 75 million annually this act provides grants for wetland conservation projects in canada mexico and the united states according to the fws fy2007 budget notes the united states and its partners have protected more than 185 million acres and restored created or enhanced an additional 59 million acres through almost 1500 projects the fws has combined funding for this program with several other laws into what it calls the north american wetlands conservation fund under the convention on wetlands of international importance more commonly known as the ramsar convention the united states is one of 158 nations that have agreed to slow the rate of wetlands loss by designating important sites these nations have designated 1822 sites totaling 415 million acres since the convention was adopted in 1971 the united states has designated 24 wetland sites encompassing 56 million acres mitigation mitigation also has become an important cornerstone of the section 404 program in recent years 1990 moa signed by the agencies with regulatory responsibilities epa and the corps outlines sequence of three steps leading to mitigation first activities in wetlands should be avoided when possible second when they can not be avoided impacts should be minimized and third where minimum impacts are still unacceptable mitigation is appropriate it directs that mitigated wetland acreage be replaced on oneforone functional basis therefore mitigation may be required as condition of section 404 permit some wetland protection advocates are critical of mitigation which they view as justifying destruction of wetlands they believe that the section 404 permit program should be an inducement to avoid damaging wetland areas these critics also contend that adverse impacts on wetland values are often not fully mitigated and 28 continued hr 6111 pl 109432 for additional information see crs report rl33493 outer continental shelf debate over oil and gas leasing and revenue sharing by marc humphries 29 see httpecosfwsgovpartnersviewcontentdoviewpagepartners crs20 that mitigation measures even if welldesigned are not adequately monitored or maintained supporters of current efforts counter that they generally work as envisioned but little data exist to support this view questions about implementation of the 1990 moa and controversies over the feasibility of compensating for wetland losses further complicate the wetland protection debate in response to criticism in the nrc and gao reports discussed above in november 2001 the corps issued new guidance to strengthen the standards on compensating for wetlands lost to development the guidance was criticized by environmental groups and some members of congress for weakening rather than strengthening mitigation requirements and for the corps failure to consult with other federal agencies in december 2002 the corps and epa released an action plan including 17 items that both agencies believe will improve the effectiveness of wetlands restoration efforts30 in march 2008 the corps and epa promulgated mitigation rule to replace the 1990 moa with clearer requirements on what will be considered successful project to compensate for wetlands lost to activities like construction mining and agriculture31 the rule sets performance standards and criteria for three types of wetlands mitigation mitigation banks inlieu programs and permitteeresponsible compensatory mitigation it sets standards to mitigate the loss of wetlands and associated aquatic resources and is intended to improve the planning implementation and management of compensatory mitigation projects designed to restore aquatic resources that are affected by activities that disturb halfacre or more of wetlands it also is designed to help ensure net loss of wetlands by addressing key recommendations raised in the 2001 nrc report under the rule all compensation projects must have mitigation plans that include 12 fundamental components such as objectives site selection criteria mitigation work plan and maintenance plan32 the concept of mitigation banks in which wetlands are created restored or enhanced in advance to serve as credits that may be used or acquired by permit applicants when they are required to mitigate impacts of their activities is widely endorsed numerous public and private banks have been established but many believe that it is too early to assess their success in study of mitigation the environmental law institute determined that as of 2005 there were 330 active banks 75 sold out banks and 169 banks seeking approval to operate33 provisions in 30 us environmental protection agency and us army corps of engineers national wetlands
