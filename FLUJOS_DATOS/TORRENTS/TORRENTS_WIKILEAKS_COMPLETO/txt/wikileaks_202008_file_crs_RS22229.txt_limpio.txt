steven maguire government and finance division august 25 2005 abstract this report presents average marginal income tax rates by filing status and detailed adjusted gross income agi class for the 2001 tax year the most recent year for which data are available the source of data is the 2001 internal revenue service irs public use microsample general finding is that the average marginal tax rates by filing status begin to converge with agi above 75000 below that amount married taxpayers filing joint returns had significantly lower average marginal tax rates order code rs22229 august 25 2005 crs report for congress received through the crs web average marginal income tax rates by adjusted gross income and filing status steven maguire analyst in public finance government and finance division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22229 this report presents average marginal income tax rates by filing status and detailed adjusted gross income agi class for the 2001 tax year the most recent year for which data are available the source of data is the 2001 internal revenue service irs public use microsample general finding is that the average marginal tax rates by filing status begin to converge with agi above 75000 below that amount married taxpayers filing joint returns had significantly lower average marginal tax rates this report will be updated when new data are released overview this report provides rough approximation of the marginal tax rate faced by taxpayers of different income levels by filing status eg single married filing joint married filing separate and head of household in 2001 statutory rates the rates in the income tax code are often termed marginal tax rates because they represent the amount of tax due on the last dollar earned for example single taxpayer with net taxable income of 60000 would be in the 25 statutory tax bracket and would pay 25 cents in taxes for the next dollar earned above 60000 policymakers and researchers are interested in marginal tax rates because they are the rates that influence taxpayers decisions to work or invest higher marginal tax rate reduces the incentive to earn more through work or investments the 2001 tax cuts contained in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act pl 10716 egtrra reduced the higher marginal tax rates and expanded the taxable income brackets for married taxpayers filing joint returns congress believed that these tax cuts were necessary because of 1 the projected federal budget surpluses 2 high marginal rates that reduced the incentives for taxpayers to work save and to congressional research service the library of congress crs2 invest and 3 the slowing economy could use the stimulative boost of tax reductions1 the data in this report provide the average marginal tax rates by income class and filing status when the first incremental steps of the egtrra tax cuts began to take hold the data can serve as benchmark for comparison to the burden distribution after egtrra has been fully implemented in addition egtrra is scheduled to sunset in 2011 and if congress chooses not to act marginal tax rates will revert to ones approximating 2001 rates marginal tax rates in 2001 the federal personal income tax is progressive tax because it collects larger percentage of income as income rises this outcome is achieved through graduated statutory rates that increase with taxable income in addition the federal income tax requires taxpayers to claim filing status ie single married filing joint married filing separate and head of household the statutory rates across filing status are the same but are applied to different levels of income in 2005 the individual income tax rates are httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22229 10 15 25 28 33 and 35 however there are additional rates that apply to different types of income eg the capital gains tax rate for taxpayers in the 10 or 15 bracket is 5 table 1 reports the frequency of the marginal tax rates and type of income for the which the rate applied for the 2001 tax year the internal revenue service irs provides researchers with public use data on individual returns that are based on sample of taxpayers from all states and from all income ranges income is reported in ranges and taxpayers filing status and marginal tax rates are included in the sample data weights are assigned to each sample return that inflate the returns to represent the full taxpayer population the data are from 2001 the most recent year that is publicly available the data are scrubbed by the irs to mask any information that could reveal the identity of taxpayer the summarized results of the scrubbed public use data do not match the irs published tables exactly because the irs publications are based on the actual data in the full population of returns 1 us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of tax legislation enacted in the 107th congress jcs103 us government printing office january 24 2003 pp 68

rate information by adjusted gross income agi and filing status agi is gross income less selected abovetheline deductions such as qualified ira contributions moving expenses or student loan interest the marginal tax rate or tax bracket is determined by net taxable income which is adjusted gross income less personal exemptions and either itemized deductions or standard deduction thus net taxable income is less than agi and can vary significantly based on an individual taxpayers situation in each agi range in table 2 taxpayers could have variety of marginal tax rates based on the amount of deductions standard or itemized and the number of exemptions which together generally determine taxable income the average marginal tax rates in the table represent the weighted average of the tax rates of all the taxpayers in the income group the average marginal tax rate can be used as rough approximation of the marginal tax burden for groups defined by income class and filing status crs4

2001 public use tax file crs5 the average marginal tax rate by filing status begins converging at an agi of 75000 and above the average marginal rates converge because the amount of income subject to lower statutory rates becomes smaller share of adjusted gross income and the higher rates are closer together in addition many special deductions and credits are phased out as income increases and finally the top bracket amount applying to income above 297350 148675 for married filing separate is the same regardless of filing status in contrast below the 75000 threshold married taxpayers filing jointly had average marginal tax rates significantly lower than the other three filing status groups taxpayers in these lower income groups can take fuller advantage of most special deductions and credits in the individual income tax code married taxpayers in lower income classes were more likely to receive marriage bonus thus reducing taxable income and the associated marginal tax rate2 looking forward the rates in 2001 reported and analyzed here represent the first step in the gradual rate reductions and bracket adjustments implemented by the egtrra in 2005 the higher rates those above 15 are reduced and the 15 and 25 married filing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22229 joint brackets are expanded to twice that of the single bracket amounts this means that many married taxpayers who were in the next higher rate in 2001 dropped into the lower rate bracket with the expansion of the lower bracket amounts table 3 below compares the 2001 and 2005 tax year rates and brackets by major

2001 275 25 bracket in 2005 entry bracket for single was 27050 in 2001 and 29700 in 2005 an average annual growth rate of just over 23 just keeping pace with inflation for married taxpayers filing joint returns the entry bracket increased from 45200 to 59000 an average annual growth rate 68 the faster growth represents the congressional intent through egtrra to eliminate the marriage penalty for taxpayers in these groups by expanding the brackets to be twice the size of the single 2 us congressional budget office for better or for worse marriage and the federal income tax washington dc june 1997 crs6 bracket amounts thus married taxpayers enter into the next higher bracket amount at proportionally higher taxable income level note that the entry points for the brackets above 275 25 in 2005 increased at roughly the same 23 average annual rate in 2011 the top four rates will revert to slightly higher rates half of one percentage point than in 2001 28 31 36 and 396 the effect of the egtrra changes on the 2001 average marginal tax rates reported here would likely be significant in particular married taxpayers filing joint returns with agi under 75000 would likely experience significant reduction in average marginal tax rates all taxpayers would benefit from the new 10 bracket and the higher income taxpayers from the reduced statutory rates while the alternative minimum tax amt was not directly addressed in this report the amt is parallel tax to the income tax that is designed to serve as floor or minimum tax liability for relatively wealthy taxpayers the base of the amt is much broader than the regular income tax and the rates are 26 and 28 although because these rates are applied to different base than the regular income tax they are not directly comparable to the marginal rates presented here in 2001 relatively few taxpayers less httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22229 than 09 were subject to the amt and most of these taxpayers were in higher income classes the 2001 data indicates that 002 of returns with agi below 20000 have amt liability and just 005 of returns between 20000 and 50000 table 4 below exhibits the percentage of amt filers by income class the egtrra tax cuts lowered rates for many high income taxpayers who may be captured by the amt whose rates have remained unchanged congress has increased the exemption amount periodically to prevent more taxpayers from becoming subject to the amt the most recent adjustment expires after the 2005 tax year table 4 percentage of amt filers by agi class 2001 nonamt filers in agi amt filers percent amt
