waterway and gulf ports production losses for major crop and liv estock producers in the affected region and potential consequences for agricultura l production as result of high energy costs it also discusses the federal g overnment response to agricultural concerns agricultural producers from the states directly impacted by katrina have suffered economic losses although this varies greatly by crop and locality preliminary estimates by usda is that hurricane katrina contributed to 882 million in total crop livestock and aquaculture losses those activities most affected were aquaculture 151 million sugar cane 50 million and cotton 40 million the damage estimate does not include losse s in timber and nursery and greenhouse products preliminary estimate has been releas ed by usda concerning agricultural damage from hurricane rita hurricane katrina temporarily halted the flow of agricultural trade through new orleans major gateway for us oil imports and agricultural exports causing commodity prices to decline in interior markets along the mississippi river waterway although partia l recovery of marketing infrastructure occurred soon following katrinas passage with br ief shutdown in late september due to hurricane rita substantial congestion nd high costs continue to plague the mississippi river grain transport network this traffic bottleneck and its depressive effect on farm commodity prices c ould persist into the spring of 2006 energy prices jumped substantially in early september 2005 as significant portion of us petroleum nd natural gas production impor t and refining facilities were damaged and shut down there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the permanency of energy price rises and their potential impact on the us economy in general and us agriculture in particul ar by raising the overall price structure of production agriculture sustained high ener gy prices could result in significantly lower farm and rural incomes in 2006 certain ongoing federal pr ograms primarily crop insu rance and disaster loans are available to eligible producers the combination of hurricanes katrina and rita with midwestern drought might also cau

commercial shipping albeit at substantially reduced levels relative to the pace of trade from year earlier timeline following is brief timeline surrounding major events at the port of new orleans august 29 2005 hurricane katrina made landfall as category 4 hurricane just east of new orleans temporarily closing all transportation and shipping activities between the gulf of mexico and the missi ssippi river an estimated 400 barges out of over 11000 barges that ply the mississippi river were destroyed or damaged of the ten major grain elevators located w ithin the new orleans region only one myrtle grove sustained any substantial damage august 31 2005 the us coast guard reopened the mississippi river to tug and barge navigation ocean vessels were s till barred pending coast guard investigation of the status of channel pths and navigation aids the us coast guard reported that about 70 of the na vigation aids such as buoys marking the river channel along the mississippi river were damaged or missing8 the river channel itself had to be surveyed to guard against possible shoals or other obstructions that might have been left in the hurricanes wake in the early period following the hurricane the us coast guard focused its full resources on search and rescue operations in the ar eas affected by the hurricane september 4 2005 the communications manager for the port of new orleans announced that the mississippi river was open in one dir ection to ships with draft of 35 feet during daylight hours th at same day the port president and ceo gary lagrange announced that the port of new orleans river front terminals had survived hurricane katrina in relatively good shape and although slightly damaged they would be workable once electrical power and manpower were

transportation overview of barge transportation barge transportation represents the lowestcost transport mode for moving high volume of bulk commodities long distances table 3 because barge rates are generally significantly lower than either rail or truck the mississippi river na vigation system provides considerable transportation cost savings to the regional and national economy14 most economists and market analysts agree that inexpensive barge transportation helps check rates charged by the rail and truck transporta tion industries in addition low internal transport costs relative to export competitors such as argentina and brazil have helped us products compete in inte rnational corn and soybean markets15 table 3 barge transport moves large volumes relative to truck or rail

supply and mand conditions determines how and when grain moves through the us grai nhandling network comprised of onfarmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33075crs9 storage trucks railroads barges and grain elevators including county subterminal and export elevators price changes at any point along the chain can result in shifts to alternate transport modes or routes as grain marketers search for the lowestcost method of moving grain between buyer and seller hurricane such as katrina or any s imilar weather or catastrophic event that dramatically slows or severely limits barge traffic will usually have the effect of raising barge freight rates as the dema nd for barge services exceeds their supply higher barge freight rates for corn and soybeans will in turn shift these commodities to alternate uses feed food industrial or storage to alternate transport modes rail or truck or to alternate trade routes eg to the atlantic via the st lawrence seaway or overland to canada mexico or alternate ports along the gulf coast or as far away as the pacific northwest the degree of shifting depends in part on the perceived permanency of the price change because truck and rail are significantly more costly than barge transport shiftin g bulk commodities to truck or railbased routes can substantially rais the cost of moving grain hurricane damage to barge transportation when hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast region an estimate d 400 barges out of over 11000 barges that ply the mississippi river were destroyed or damaged and s ubstantial number of barges and vessels in the area surrounding new orleans were displaced although this physical damage was costly it is not the major factor limiting the quick reprise of barge transportation the primary problem for bargebase d agricultural transportation on the mississippi river system is the problem of restoring the entire transportation system encompassing trains trucks barges ports and oceangoing boats to synchronized schedule of deliveries nd arrivals as of september 30 2005 the entire transportation network remained somewhat out of sync waterways and rail lines are backed up and congested with barges and tr ains arriving to deliver their goods to boats that are berthed in t slots awaiting delivery for goods other than those being delivered in addition to an outofsync tran sportation network approximately 140 barges containing hurricaneda maged corn primarily water damage were left in the new orleans region these barges needed to be offloaded and the barges moved back upriver to elevators eagerly awaiting barge transport to ship their grain down river however because of the water damage the corn was longer acceptable for contract delivery and could not be offloa ded at any of the exportservicing grain elevators in the new orleans vicinity b ecause of the poor condition of their cargo these barges must be towed to special locations primarily back up river for off loading and removal before they can reenter the normal barge traffic commodity prices the immediate effect of the slowdown of barge traffic on the mississippi river was reported sharp decline in grain elevator bid prices for corn and soybeans in interior grain markets many grain elevators serving barge traffic were already near their maximum storage capacity and felt compelled to reduce their bid prices to avoid buying grain that they could not stor the problem has been made more acutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33075crs10 by the approaching harvest when producers will likely need all of their onfarm storage capacity to store their new crop rvests as result many producers have been looking to sell the remaining supplie s from last years harvest to clear space it is expected that this situation will be remedied and elevator bids will strengthen when barge traffic returns to more normal levels however usda officials have expressed concern that the price decline resulting from the temporary delay in the mississippi bargebased expor t flow of agricultural products could persist for at least three months and possi bly into the spring depending on several factors including how quickly barge traffic resumes how early the winter freeze and shutdown of the upper mississippi river ccurs and whether the low water levels of the missouri and upper mississippi rivers are replenished by rainfall harvesttime concerns harvest time generally signals the busiest period of export movement for agricultural products for several reasons first supplies are generally most abundant at harvest time and can often exceed onfarm or local storage capacity as result both producers and marketers are eager to move surplus production through the marketing channels second the more northerly inland waterways the upper mississippi river waterway and the st lawrence seaway shut down during the winter months due to freezing conditions this limits export opport unities and increases the urgency for moving excess production into marketing channels ahead of the winter third the arrival of surplus agricultural production into marketing channels at rvest time tends to pressure commodity market prices to their season lows nd frequently offers the best purchasing opportunities for foreign buyers table 4 harvest period for major us crops cropmajor us growing zonesoutherntier statescentral tier statesnorthern

agricultural output value in 2003 was 15 in mississippi 12 in louisiana and 5 in alabama preliminary estimates by usda economists are th at hurricane katrina contributed to 882 million in total crop livestock and aquaculture16 losses in the southeast17 estimates for hurricane rita are not yet available but are expected to be significantly less than for katrina usda reports that the greatest agricultural losses caused by katrina in terms of va lue of production were to aquaculture 151 million sugarcane 50 million and cott on 40 million other crops such as soybeans and rice were also prone to some wind damage the 882 million loss estimate does not include gulf state losses of timber which usda says could be in the billions of dollars depending on its salvage value see the following section for more details or losses of nursery and greenhouse products and facilities in florida for which florida trade association pr ojects 370 million in structural damage and plant losses18 also the loss of electricity the s hortage of fuel and infrastructure damage temporarily interrupted the flow of poultry milk and other agricultural products to markets for some crops particularly sugarcane the extent of losses will not be known until harvest damage to the regions sugarcane crop initially appeared to be extensive because the high winds flattened the crop some analysts report that much of the crop that was downed by the storm was not destroyed and can still be harvested usda estimates that louisiana s sugarcane production will be 9 below prehurricane estimates which translates into an estimated processed value loss of 50 million katrina also caused two louisian sugar refineries to temporarily halt operations which exacerbated what was alread tight supply of sugar in response usda increased available sugar supplies by increasing the quantity of domestic sugar that may enter the market under the sugar price support program19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33075crs12 19 continued nlytruecontentid2005080338xml 20 global insights agriview september 8 2005according to usda the largest cotton production areas east and west of the storm track were spared significant crop losses mississippi and alabama which account for 10 and 3 of expected us cotton production respectively experienced some damage cotton production is timated by usda to be down 24 in alabama and 43 in mississippi fo llowing hurricane katrina total cotton losses in the gulf region are expected to be about 40 million some of the damage to the crop might be quality losses rather than production losses similarly minor rice losses were experienced since the storm track was east of the major rice growing areas and most of the louisiana rice acreage already had been harvested before katrina struck the corn and soybean crops were also ffected by the hurricane but the region normally accounts for less than 3 of na tional production of these two crops the most serious market effects attributable to corn and soybeans are more transportation related as discusse d above according to usda estimated regional losses are 14 million for corn and 17 million for soybeans industry analysts also report that the gulf regions dairy industry experienced production and processing losses us da reports that 60000 dairy cows were located in counties that experienced hurricanestrength winds some of these cows were lost but estimates ar available the regions dairy industry was hampered by the loss of production caused by power outages in milking facilities and the inability to transport milk because of damage d roads and bridges as well as the loss of refrigeration and metropolitan retail dairy markets alabama louisiana and mississippi combined account for less than 1 of us milk production hence market effects are expected to be limited to the region usda also reports losses to cattle ope rations and broiler production in the threestate region the region accounts for about 4 of nationa l beef production so national market effects are expected to be minimal poultry is significant enterprise in the region alabama and mississippi rank third and fifth respectively among all states in broiler production most of th broiler losses were concentrated in mississippi where facilities were either damaged or wit hout power for an extended period according to usda an estimate d 6 million chickens were killed and 2400 poultry barns were damaged in mississippi alone and anothe r 200000 chickens were lost in alabama the broiler losses are valued by usda at approximately 15 million some analysts estimate that large ar ea broiler losses could cause an increase in market broiler prices in the short term 12 months however increased production elsewhere would eventually fill th gap so that market effects would be minimized by the end of the year20 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33075crs13 21 available at http wwwmfcstatemsus pdfkatrinatimberdamagepdf visited on sept 15 2005table 5 top 5 agricultural

protection such as reducing wildfire and insect threats from trees damaged by the hurricane the impact of the hurricanes on wood pr oducts is less certa in damages to structures has prompted an urgent mand for plywood for temporary repairs if plywood prices follow the pattern that sued from hurricane andrew in 1993 prices might have peaked at about the time of th event in anticipation of the damage and will fall back to more normal levels within few weeks longerterm impacts are less clear rebuilding will incr ease the demand for additional w ood products although demand depends grea tly on interest rates the dead and damaged trees might provide significant boost to w ood product supplies as salvage and mill operations convert the trees to usable pr oducts however salvage operations are hampered by the increasingly fragmented owne rship of forest land and by rising fuel costs and some mills may have been damaged by the hurricane the effect over the coming weeks and months is thus likely to be both greater wood products demand and greater wood products supply and the net effect on wood product prices after the current urgent demand for plyw ood has passed is indeterminate

costs as share of total agricultural pr oduction expenses varies greatly by both activity and region although there are many kinds of operations performed by the different farm types nearly all mechanized field work as well as marketing and management activities involve machinery trucks and cars that are dependent on petroleum fuels dryers and irrigation equipment are often more versatile in that they can be powered by petroleum fuels natural gas or electricity while electricity is the primary source of power for lighting heatin g and cooling in homes barns and other farm buildings some activities such as dairy and poultry produc tion that require constant supply of energy for refrigeration or cooling are partic ularly vulnerable to cutoff of energy supply as evidenced by the damage sustained in the hurricane affected region in the immediate term higher diesel fuel and gasoline prices will raise the cost of harvesting and postharves t treatment eg drying m oving and storing of crops still in the field for those farms that have been indirectly impacted by katrinas damage to the regions marketing infrastructure higher fuel prices will make the overall cost of marketing pr oducts more expensive while making rail and truck more costly options relative to barge transport such higher marketing costs inevitably result in widening farmtomarket basis and lower prices received at the farm gate this in turn will alter the farm income outlook for affected farm households and rural economies in the longer term sustained high ener gy prices through the winter could lead to significant regional shifts in agricultu ral activities as early as 2006 high natural gas prices are particularly troublesome becau of their relations hip with nitrogenous fertilizer production natura l gas accounts for substantial portion 75 to 90 of nitrogen fertilizer production cost s either directly as f eedstock or indirectly as fuel to generate the elect ricity needed in production because

fertilizer production capacity over 25 decline since 1999 in addition higher na tural gas prices have contributed to significantly higher nitrogen fertilizer prices figure 6 the postkatrina jump in us natural gas prices casts cloud of uncertainty over the future of the us nitrogen fer tilizer industry as well as raising concerns about the potential supply and price of nitrogen fert ilizer for crops in 2006 producers are undoubtedly eyeing fuel and fertilizer price developments and will consider shifting away from crops that rely heavily on fueldependent field work or fertilizer app lications and towards those crops and activities that are less energy dependent corn is perhaps the most vulne rable crop due to its high peracre energy usage rates27 in the longer term sustained rise in energy prices may have serious consequences on energyintensive industries like agriculture by reducing profitab ility and driving resources away from the sectorfigure 6 anhydrous ammonia and natural gas

program to help alleviate the urgency of marketing grain at distresslevel prices28 usdas commodity credit corporation ccc is implementing changes to allow producers to obtain loans for onfarm storage on grain stored on the ground in addition to grain bins and other normally approved structures this action was designed to alleviate shortterm logis tical problems and s upport local cash prices above the distressed levels that have resulted from the slowdown of barge traffic on the mississippi river on september 20 2005 secretary of agriculture mike johanns announced that usda was taking four additional steps to alleviate the grain transport congestion29 first usda acting through the ccc was providing temporary incentives to facilitate the immediate m ovement of 140 barges of damaged corn over 7 million bushels from new orleans to upriver locations for offloading once unloaded the barges can return to duty moving newcrop commodities second usda was providing incentives for alternative grain storage30 under this activity the ccc would provide special onetime assistance to operators to help with the costs associated with storing corn and wheat in alternative storage facilities up to 50 million bushels of corn or wheat could be eligible for this activity third usda was encouraging alternative shipping patterns through regions other than the central gulf by providing for transpor tation differential incentive on the movement of up to 200000 metric tons of corn wheat or soybeans fourth for those producers with farmstored commodities under loan to usda whose loans mature at the end of september and october and who would otherwise forfeit those commodities to usda usda would allow such producers to buy back the grain at the posted county price normally these producers would be required to move the forfeited grain to commercial warehouses this offer is being made on st atebystate basis current usda disaster au thorities nd programs usda has at its disposal three major ong oing programs designed to help crop producers recover from the financial effects of any natural disaster federal crop insurance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33075crs19 noninsured assistance prog ram nap payments and emergency disaster loans all three of these programs have perman ent authorization and available funding for background information on these and ot her farm disaster programs see crs report rs21212 agricultural disaster assistance by ralph m chite for the 2005 crop year alabama mississippi and louisiana crop producers purchased just over 1 billion in crop insurance coverage with nearly 70 of the value of coverage being for cotton soybean s and rice according to preliminary reports from usda the threestate region has relatively high participation rates in the crop insurance program however much of that coverage is at the catastrophic level which provides an indemnity pa yment only on losses in excess of 50 of normal production for example 90 to 95 per cent of the cotton acreage in the three gulf states is enrolled in the federal crop insurance program however in louisiana and mississippi just over onehalf of that acreage is enrolled onl at the catastrophic level for those producers who grow crop that is not eligible for crop insurance coverage usda makes nap pa yments available for catas trophic losses as long as the producer signed up for coverage and pa id an administrative fee in advance agricultural producers in county that s been declared disaster area may be eligible for lowinterest emergency disaster em loans available through usdas farm service agency usda currently s authority to provide just over 150 million in em loans an eligible producer must be familysized farmer who suffered minimum crop loss of 30 and is unable to qualify for loan from commercial lender em loan funds may be used to help eligible farmers ranchers and aquaculture producers recover from pr oduction losses when the producer suffers significant loss of an annual crop or from physical losses such as repairing or replacing damaged or destroyed structures or equipment or for the replanting of permanent crops such as orchards qualified applicant can then borrow up to 100 of actual production or physical sses not to exceed 500000 at below market interest rate usda announced on september 8 2005 that 20 million in emergency conservation program funding will be given to louisiana 1245 million mississippi 71 million alabama 8550000 and tennessee 25000 to help these states clean up debris and restore fe nces and conservation structures eligible participants

programs with additional emergency aid funding for these programs generally are provided in emergency supplemental appropriations bills among these major adhoc farm disaster programs are 1 direct disaster payments 2 livestock assistance 3 tree assistance and 4 emergency conservation assistance most recently the fy2005 military constr uction appropriations act pl 108324 contained supplemental funding to provide an estimated 35 billion in assistance for 2003 and 2004 crop livestock and tree losses primarily in response to ongoinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33075crs20 31 congress has provided

katrina and rita portions of the midwest were experiencing significant 2005 crop losse s caused by prolonged drought the combination of the midwest drought nd losses caused by the two hurricanes is expected to provide momentum for c ongress to consider emergency crop and livestock assistance for 2005 production losse s some time this ear several bills have been introduced in the 109th congress that would provide supplemental agricultural assistance primarily in the form of crop disaster payments and livestock assistance to date these include bills hr 3809 hr 3754s 1692 hr 3702 s 1636 that would provide di saster assistance to all regi ons of the country that meet certain loss requirements using similar payment formulas as in past years other bills hr 3958 and s 1766 have been introduced that include agricultural assistance as part of much larger package of assistance for recovery and relief from the effects of hurricane katrina in louisiana congressional leadership has not yet determined the specifics of any agricultural disaster assistance package or what legislative vehicle might be used to authorize this assistance31 the most likely vehicle for agricultural assistance is in the context of third supplemental appr opriations bill for hurrican katrina recovery which many expect will provide billions of dollars of assistance for rebuilding the infrastructure of the affected region other possibilities include agricultural assistance being attached to the pending fy2006 ag riculture appropriations bill hr 2744 which is currently in conference committee or the agriculture committees potentially could report emergency agricultural legisl ation to the floor for consideration
