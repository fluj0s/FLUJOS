6109c21 shspec57 smoothness in auditing if an auditor keeps going for total perfection in his auditing he will miss the state of acceptable mediocrity in his frantic figurefigure desperation for technical perfection it is better to do some personalized auditing with majority of rightnesses and have wins the pc forgives anything but auditing if the auditor is worried about the ritual instead of getting in comm with the pc the pc has person to talk to and goes out of session if the pc is already starting to tell you about his case before you get him in the chair dont worry about the formal procedures just audit the pc the session starts when the pc recognizes you as the auditor not when you say start of session difficulties in starting sessions always come because the auditor doesnt recognize the start of session the pc may be leery of going into session because hes been denied sessions too often but you can handle it with ruds if you see that pc is interested in his case and starting to talk to you about it youll see hes in session if if happens in public say im sorry heres my card come see at 200 tuesday this will work to have him not be arc broken lrhs difficulty is getting people out of session not into session if you work very hard to start session youll have corresponding amount of trouble doing it how do you handle the situation of the pc telling you before youve started the session about his case you hear him out but not all the way theres difference between just listening to the pc and auditing the pc the liability of letting pc run on and on is that hell lower his havingness and slip downtone auditing consists in directing the attention of the pc your questions are what direct his attention to where you want him how do you interrogate you should have knowledge enough of the mind to know what to ask be smooth dont arc break him if hes nattering away about something you want to get him to look at his own overt you dont get far with direct what did you do you can always ask when did it all start you dont want to shift the pcs attention too abruptly you can ask him question he cant answer immediately and put him in the chair during his comm lag youve got to size up the situation obnose what needs handling and direct his attention there youll seem very smooth to the pc if you can shift his attention deftly without his awareness of being pushed around this gives you altitude you may be weak at directing the pcs attention because you have low reality on the pcs ability to direct it himself his attention must at one time have been restraining factor for keeping things from coming in on him when we get on the subject of something hes been restraining from coming in on him the pcs attention wanders or disperses because he cant control it because it has been overwhelmed thats what aberrated him if the auditor doesnt direct his attention it will be directed by the valence hes in and the valence will do god knows what with it if you leave session on automatic youre asking for it to be taken over by the valence dont blame the pc who has very little energy to exercise at this point for what goes wrong in the session you can almost predict how hell react once you know his terminal if you lose control of the session how do you direct the pcs attention the pc has put his hope for survival which is totally useless since he cant help surviving in beingness valence to do it for him so these beingnesses have lot of survival mixed up in them once you have survival on via however it becomes succumb valences actions are usually out of time it is incapable of change because its characteristics are all set for survival ie continuing unchanged past civilizations have tried to use punishment to change valence that doesnt work if you do break the valence you have nothing not even person an operating valence is better than nothing but person is far better genetic entity is super packaged valence meat body isnt necessarily bad body form it should be possible to smash it into wall without even bruising it if you can heal body with an assist it must have been the thetan who was perpetuating the process of destruction theres real liability in running meat body in our mechanized society unless one is in body oriented to fighting lions fixed condition of valence which is unchangeable and out of date will make an unhappy person medicine has never been able to handle readjustment of beings or handling valences processing does have an effect of valences which will object to it the most basic processes dont clear someone unless his valence gets audited out the pc is unaware of being who he is being the valence is of help to him it is an addiction to some skill and beingness package you cant excel when operating as valence because it is nonsentient operation an operation in the absence of knowingness when thetan is overwhelmed and has totally given up so that he becomes the valence that did him in he cant even do good job as that valence because of his own overts against that valencebeingness the pcs basic impulse toward the valence is destruction of the valence every time the thetan wakes up even slightly in situation requiring decision it will be destructive decision for the valence this should make your job as an auditor very easy youll also understand the activities of men better and what you are trying to do is to direct the pcs attention toward eradication of all the points on the track which made him slave to valence if you fail to direct his attention theres nothing else there if you overwhelm him hell dramatize the valence the more you know about the valence the easier it is to audit the pc and to predict what the valence will do so when the pc does that you know youd better get ruds in you need ways to observe the pc to know better when hes out of session if hes in the valence that he dramatizes he has rudiment out you dont necessarily put ruds in at the exact point you see it if hes in the middle of some engram youd do better to direct his attention to keep control from the valence anything youre doing which detracts from directing the pcs attention overcoming valences rehabilitating the thetan so he can operate again is utterly unnecessary dont worry about directing your attention and your technical perfection do direct the pcs attention fortunately auditor and pc very rarely have the same terminal
