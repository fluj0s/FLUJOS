for the united states summary ministers of the 29 members of the organizat ion for economic cooperation and development oecd have struggled since 1995 to negotiate multilatera l agreement on investment mai negotiations n many aspects of final agreement have progressed rapid ly but oecd members have been unable to resolve numerous thorny issues before the latest deadl ine set for the oecd ministerial meeting in april 1998 us negotiators have indicated that they will not sign the present agreement without significant changes and oppose establishing another deadline as whole the oecd favors eliminating most of the national rules governing inward and outward dir ect investment one notable exception would be exemptions for each country for industries or sectors that individual members deem to be f national security or of especial national importance the united states also favors the national or unbiased treatme nt of foreign direct investment at times however the us commitment to this standard has waned as other policy objectives have take n precedent presently the united states is leading the way for the other develope d countries to adopt more open standard with an agreed upon and enforceable dispute settlement procedure the oecd ministers stated goal in adopting mai is to create strong an d comprehensive legal framework on fo reign direct investment among the participating countries this agreement is intended to be standalone agreement and to b accessible to any country developed or developing that is willing to abide by it s precepts through the mai the oecd members also seek to reduce barriers an d discriminatory treatment of foreign direct investment an d to increase the legal security for investme nts and investors to give force to this agreement the mai will b legally binding and contain effective provisions for settling disputes despite overall progress on the agreement number of issues remain i n particul ar negotiators have not agreed on how many and what type of exception s nations will be allowed to take the united states also is taking issue with th european commission over its request for broad exception for regional economic integration organizations us negotiators believe this type of exception will allow the commission to exclude itself from parts of the agreement and to discriminate in favor of european union member states us negotiators also have to consider how the clinton administration wil l approach the issue of an mai with the congress the administration is concerned about the timing and approach of bringing the issue before congress so that th agreement does not interfere with such other trade issues as the debate over fasttrack negotiating authority at the least congress likely will be asked to approve th agreement as treaty it is not clear if any additional legislative action will b requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97469contents overview 1 background 1 us overseas investment policy 3 existing

the 1990s12 bilateral investment treaties bilateral investment treaties have emerged as the favored investment instrument because previous attempts at developing multilateral agreements have been s unsuccessful there are two main approaches used in admitting foreign investment under bilateral treaties the united states requires that nations apply most favored nation mfn or nondiscriminatory treatment and that countries also observ national treatment with respect to both the admission and the subsequent treatment of foreign direct investment exceptions are ma for industries or areas reserved for national security or for other national objectives in contrast most other nation s apply bilateral treaties that require nations to encourage and to admit into thei r territories investments by nationals and companies of the other party thi s commitment however is subject to any existing or future restrictions on the entry of foreign investment contained in domestic laws which historically have been applied to investments only after they have been admitted into country accordin g to the world trade organization wto general standards f treatment of foreign investment commonly found in bilateral investment treatie s include num ber of measures such measures generally require that investments be accorded fair and equitable treatment full protection and security and that nation s refrain from interfering in ways that disrupt the normal man agement maintenance use or disposal of investments in addition most treaties acc ord the parties involved most favored nation and national treatment standards13 multilateral investment treaties at the multilateral or multination level there are at lest two major types f arrangements there are investment treaties that are part of broader arrangement s that aim to integrate rules on foreign investment into framework of rules geare d toward economic cooperation an d integration such arrangements include the treaty establishing the european community and the north american free trad agreement in addition there are arrangements wh ich cover only foreign investment of particular prominence among this second group is the oecd code f liberali zation of capital movements and the code of liberalization of curren t invisible operation s in addition the oecd has issued basic statement on foreign investment the

that attempt to invest abroad the oecd governments decided to begin negotiations among themselves on mai and to conclude the agreement by the time of the oecd ministe rial meeting in may 1997 the goal of the negotiations is to create strong and comprehe nsive legal framework for foreign direct investment among the participating coun tries according to senior oecd official this means the mai w ill seek to reduce barriers and discriminatory17 treatment of foreign direct investment and to increase the legal security fo r investments and investors to give force to the agreement the mai will be

investme nt incentives has grown sharply over18 the last decade nevertheless few are willing to consider restrictions on such incentive s beyond the limitations imposed by rules on nondiscrimination while the negotiators appear to favor the principle that rules on national treatment should apply to incentives it appears unlikely the negotiating group will reach consensus before the may 1997

exceptions nations will be allowed to take every nation wants some industries or areas exempted from unfettered national control either because of national security concerns or becaus of specific domestic political issues too many exemptions however would render the mai useless and ineffective the united states also is taking issue with th european commission over its request for broad

firms gain through more efficient allo cation of capital throughout the world critics acknowledge the gains in efficiency which result from greater foreig n investment but argue that t hese gains are achieved at high cost in particular they argue that foreign investment has contributed to the growth in disparities in wealt h and income between the richest and poorest groups within the united states an d between the richest and poorest nations furthermore these critics contend tha t foreign investment increases the mobility of transnational corporations which allows them to play countries and localities against each other bidding down wages an d other labor standards in addition they argue that this global competition weakens environmental standards workplace sa fety rules and similar safeguards by adopting an mai thes critics state governments would be restricted in their ability to shape domestic investment policies to promote social economic and environmental goals and would create whole set of rights for multinational firms that would requir governments to defend even when those rights conflicted with the rights needs r interests of individual nations and their

firms that are investing i n both developed and developing countries and would aid them in gaining access to ex port markets abroad while these actions are not likely to boost us employment they might help sustain or enhance us wages and incomes fewer restrictio ns on international direct investment could also add to us incomes by allowing for more efficient allocation of resources among nations on the negative side an international investment agreement ultimately coul d stalemate further progress towards reducing national restrictions and controls i n essence mai may act to set status quo that becomes entrenched in practice and less subject to change than the present situati on an agreement among the developed countries also could add to tensions between the developed and the developin g economies such an agreement could alienate many of the developing countries who see an investment agreement as protective measure established by the riches t economies the oecd members to preserve their economic status relative to th developing economies by limiting the amount of investment that flows to thos economies us negotiators also have to consider how the clinton administration wil l approach the mai issue with the congress the administration has indicated that it will send t he agreement to the senate for approval as treaty but growin g dissatisfaction among us negotiators over the numbers and extent of exceptions the europeans and canadians are requesting coupled with public unease at home augurs poorly for consideration of t he agreement during the present legislative session the administration woul d also be leery of broaching the issue with congress until other higher priority trade issues have been resolved congress may also consider th impact ma i will have on state and local governments the other nation s participating in the mai negotiations exp ect that the provisions of the agreement will apply not only at the us federal level but at the subfederal or state and local level as well at the very least this likely will require the cooperation of the nonfederal levels of government it also is unclear how many exceptions us negotiators will32 request for
