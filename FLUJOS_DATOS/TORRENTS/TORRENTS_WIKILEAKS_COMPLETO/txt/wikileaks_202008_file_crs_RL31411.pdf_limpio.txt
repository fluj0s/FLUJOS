re vised rule focusing on how it changes which material and type s of activities are re gulated under section 404 and the significance of these issues especially for the mining industry the clean water act contains two different permitting regimes 1 section 402 permits called the national pollutant discharge elimination system or npdes permit program address the discharge of most pollutants and 2 section 404 permits address the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters of the united states at specified sites these permit programs differ in nature and approach the npdes program focuses on the effects of pollutant discharges on water quality the 404 program considers effects on the quatic ecosystem and other national and resource interests the corps and epa have complement ary roles under section 404 landowners seeking to discharge dredged or fill material must obtain permit from the corps under section 404 epa provides environm ental guidance on 404 permitting the determination of what is fill material is important since fill material is subject to 404 permit requirements while discharge of nonfill material is regulated by epa under the section 402 np des permit program the revised rule was intended to clarify the regulatory definition of fill material by replacing two separate and inconsistent definiti ons with single common definition it expanded the types of discha rge activities that ar subject to section 404 specifically to include construction or maintenance of the infrastructure associated with solid waste landfills and mining overburden further the revised rule removed regulatory language which previously excluded waste discharges from section 404 jurisdiction change that some argue allows the use of 404 permits to authorize certain discharges that harm the aquatic environment the final rule completed rulemaking begun in april 2000 by the clinton administrati on its pr oposal had generated support from the mining industry and other regulated groups and consider able opposition from environmental gr oups the final rule is substantially similar to the earlier proposal environmental groups say the rule allows for inadequate regulation of certain disposal activities including disposal of coal mining waste the clinton and bush administrations said that the regulatory changes are intended to conform corps and epa regulations to existing lawful practice but opponents contend that those practices violate the clean water act legislation to reverse the revised regulations has been introduced in the

introduction on may 3 2002 the environmental protection agency epa and the us army corps of engineers the corps announ ced final rule whic h redefined two key terms fill material and discharge of fill material that identify the scope of activities subject to regulation under section 404 of the clean water act1 the 2002 final rule completed rulemaki ng begun in april 2000 by the clinton administration2 its proposal had generated s upport from the mining industry and other regulated groups and opposition from environmental groups their relative positions in support and opposition did not change when the final rule was issued because it is substantially similar to the earlier proposal the agencies received over 17000 comments on the proposed rule the revised rule was specifically intended to clarify the regulatory definition of fill material under section 404 by replacing two separate and inc onsistent definitions with single common definition in terms of the types of regu lated filling activities it expanded the types of discharge activitie s that are subject to section 404 permit requirements specifically to include construction or maintenance of the infrastructure associated with solid waste landfills and mining overburden further the revised rule removed regulatory language which previously excluded waste discharges from section 404 jurisdiction change that some argue allows the use of 404 permits to authorize certain discharges that could harm the aquatic environment this part of the rule conforms with pos itions taken by the clinton administration and endorsed by the bush administration in litigation brought by environmental groups which challenged regulation of surface coal mining practices in appalachia the administrations position supported industr ys view concerning the proper clean water act mechanism for regulating coal mining however that position was opposed by environmental groups who believe that disposal of coal mining and other waste should be regulated mo re stringently under other provisions of the clean water act not section 404 thus at issue wa s whether the rule change was largely procedural as proponents argued or whethe r it allowed weaker regulatory practices to apply to coal mining as opponents arguedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31411crs2 3 navigable waters means the waters of the united states including the

foreign commerce 33 cfr part 328 4 65 federal register 21293background the law and prior regulations under the clean water act cwa it is unlawful to discharge any pollutant into waters of the united states without permit issued under that act the act contains two different permitting regimes 1 section 402 permits called the national pollutant discharge elimination system or npdes permit program address the discharge of mo st pollutants and 2 sec tion 404 permits address the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters3 of the united states at specified sites the npdes permit program is administered by epa the corps and epa have complementary roles under secti on 404 landowners seeking to discharge dredged or fill material must obtain permit to do so from the corps epa provides environmental guidance on section 404 pe rmitting and can veto corps permit based on environmental impacts of the proposed discharge activity the acts two separate permit programs differ in nature and approach the npdes program focuses primarily on the effects of discharges from industrial facilities and municipal sewage treatment plants on water quality and evaluates whether the discharge will adversely affect the chemical physical or biological integrity of the water under that program pollutant discharges are controlled through the imposition of effluent limitations which restrict the quantities rates and concentrations of discharged constituen ts section 402 per mits include limitations that reflect treatment with available pollution control technology either to meet national minimum standards established by epa or more stringent treatment levels where needed to meet stateestablished water quality standards the standard for issuance of 402 permit is compliance with the effluent limitation and toxic pollutant control provisions of the act ep is authorized to issue npdes permits the agency has delegated this responsibility to 45 states and epa is the permitting authority in the remaining states the section 404 program focuses on disc harges of two materials dredged material and fill material as described in the ap ril 2000 proposal fill material differs fundamentally from th types of pollutants covere d by section 402 because the principal environmental concern is the ss of portion of the water body itself4 in contrast to the npdes programs specific focus on water quality the section 404 program has broader focus on effects of the discharge on the aquatic ecosystem as whole including wetlands it requires eval uation of alternatives to the discharge and of measures to minimize and compensate for unavoidable adverse effects discharges that would have significant adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems are not allowed and discharges also are not allowed if there are practicable alternatives with less adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem the standard for issuance of 404 permit is considerati on of the full public interest by balancing the favorable impactshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31411crs3 5 cwa section 404f exempts certain activitie s from 404 permit requirements most are related to agricultural practices these incl ude normal farming silviculture and ranching activities maintenance of existing dikes dams levees or causeways construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irri gation ditches construction of temporary sedimentation basins on construction sites and construction or maintenance of farm or forest roads section 402 npdes permits are not required for these discharges section 404f also exempts federal projects specifically authorized by congress however these activities may require other federal or state environmental permits including under section 402 6 however the corps definition at 33 cfr 3232f also included the statement that the term does not include plowing cultivating seeding and harvesting for the production of food fiber and forest products activities which are part of the normal farming exemption under section 404fagainst the detrimental impacts of proposed activity to reflect the national concerns for both the protection and utilization of important resources the corps and epa have complementary roles and regulations for the section 404 program the corps regulations t 33 cfr parts 320330 describe general regulatory policies permit procedures and processing and program definitions epas regulations at 40 cf r parts 230232 provide the environmental guidelines for specifying disposal sites for dredged or fill material procedures for possible epa veto of permit and definitions among the definitions of key terms c ontained both in the corps and epas regulations are two closely related definitions fill material and discharge of fill material neither term is defined in the clean water act leaving it to the administrative agencies to do so both the 404 and the npdes programs regulate the discharge of pollutant which th act defines as incl uding among others dredged spoil solid waste chemical wast biological materials rock sand and cellar dirt discharged into water the determination of what is fill material is important since fill material is subject to 404 permit requireme nts while discharge of non fill material is subject to npdes permit requirements5 epas and the corps defi nitions of discharge of fill material previously were identical6 and remain so in the revised definitions to mean the addition of fill material into waters of the united states they list by way of example activities typically related to construction for site development roadways erosion protection etc where the filling in of waterbody occurs as necessary element of the project 40 cfr 2322 and 33 cfr 3232f while the two agencies previously defined discharge of fill material in identical terms they had different regula tory definitions for the related term fill material the corps definition at 33 cfr 3232e which was adopted in 1977 stated the term fill material means any material used for the primary purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land or of changing the bottom elevation of an sic water body the term does not include any pollutant discharged into thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31411crs4 water primarily to dispose of waste as that activity is regulated under section 402 of the clean water act while the corps definition centered on eval uating what is the primary purpose of prospective discharge to determine whethe r it would be regulated by section 404 or section 402 epas definition at 40 cfr 2322 focused on the effect of the material the epa definiti on had remained unchanged since it was adopted in 1988 it stated fill material means any pollutant which replaces portions of the waters of the united states with dry land or which ch anges the bottom elevation of water body for any purpose redefinition of key terms central purpose of changing the agencies rules was to conform the corps purposebased definition of f ill material with epas eff ectsbased definition this change was widely supporte d in public comment s on the proposed rule in the proposal and the final rule the two ag encies acknowledged that the different definitions and the primary purposes basi s of the corps separate definition had caused confusion for some time and had d to extensive litigation as well for example the primary purpose test in the co rps definition appeared to require the corps to make subjective determination about the prima ry purpose of prospective discharge and it also allowed project pr oponent to seek to affect which regulatory regime would apply secti on 404 or section 402 by s imply asserting purported purpose thus in the may 2002 revision the agencies said that they were adopting an identical definition of fill material that is more consistent with epas previous rule it now states the term fill material means material placed in waters of the united states where the material has the effect of i replacing any portion of water of the united states with dry land or ii changing the bottom elevation of any portion of water of the united states in addition however the revised definiti on of fill material eliminated language contained in the corps previous regu lation which had excluded any pollutant discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste from section 404 authorization this change reflected the agencies view that an exclusion for all waste is inappropriate view suppor ted in industry comments but opposed by environmental groups simply because material is disposed of for purposes of waste disposal does not in our view justify excluding it categorically from the definition of fill some waste eg mine overburden consists of material such as soil rock and earthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31411crs5 7 67 federal register 31133 8 67 federal register 31134that is similar to traditional fill materi used for purposes of creating fast land for development7 the agencies explained that while trash or garbage discharges are generally excluded from section 404 because of nvironmental and health concerns such discharges may be permissibl in some circumstances an example would be where recycled porcelain fixtures are cleaned and placed in waters of the us to create environmentally beneficial artificial reefs such material would not be considered trash or garbage and thus would not be subject to the exclusion8 epa and the corps believe that this is appropriate and even environmentally beneficial in situations where the otherwise excluded materials are being discharged in manner consistent with traditional uses of fill material and where the review of the discharges under section 404 can effectively ensure that the material will not cause or contribute to adverse environmental impacts the final rule clarified the term discharge of fill material previously identical for both agencies by adding two additional examples of 404regulated activities when these discharges have the effect of fill first it added pl acement of fill material for construction or maintenance of any liner be rm or other infrastructure associated with solid waste landfills to distinguish fill material used for construction of solid waste landfills from di scharges of leachate from ndfills into waters of the us which are subject to cwa secti on 402 second the final rules language concerning mine overburden expande d language in the 2000 proposal which specified placement of coal mining overburden based on comments that this language created confusion concerning whether under the pr oposal over burden or similar materials from other mining processes might not be covered the agencies amended the definition in the final rule to include placement of overburden slurry or tailings or similar miningrelated materials discharges identified as fill material under the redefinition the agencies revised rules define certain types of discharges as specifically outside of the requirement s of section 404 and convers ely define others as specifically subject to secti on 404 thus not to section 402 first as discussed above the final rule narrowed the regulatory definition of fill material the term fill material does not include trash or garbage second the final rule included specific examples of materials that according to epa and the corps often constitute fill and thus shoul d be subject to section 404 requirements not section 402 the agencies added the follo wing new text as further explanation of fill materialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31411crs6 9 for additional information see crs report rs21421 mountaintop mini ng background on current controversies by claudia copeland 10 the corps authorizes dredged and fill activities either through individual permits for environmentally significant projects or th rough nationwide general permits covering categories of activities that are similar in nature and will likely have minor effect on the environment surface mining activities are generally authorized by one of these general permits nationwide permit 21 for additional information see crs

construction debris wood chips overburden from mining or other excavation activities and materials used to create any structure or infrastructure in the waters of the united states revised 33 cfr 3232e2 and revised 40 cfr 23222 in summary epa and the corps did not delist or remove from section 404 coverage any of the types of constructionrelated activities previously defined as fill material but did narrow it to exclude tras h or garbage they modified their definitions by adding examples of several additional specific types of materials which will be considered as fill material controversies concerning coal mining overburden the most controversial aspect of the final rule was elimination of the waste exclusion previously contained in the corp s definition of fill material coupled with the specific inclusion of mining overburde n to be regulated under section 404 in some parts of the country par ticularly in appalachia wast material that results from coal surface mining operations is deposited or discharged into waters of the united states as part of the overall mining activity9 historically the corps has regulated this type of discharge as fill on the basis that such discharges result in the placement of rock and other material in such way as to replace portions of water body with dry land10 the corps believes that this existing practice is the most effective way to regulate activities associated with coal mining which involve discharge of polluta nts into waters of the united states however some persons contend that the placement of such material is more polluting activity than filling activity since the characteristics and quantities of material can alter the chemi cal physical or biological integrity of waterbody and thus they argue should be regulate d by epa as waste under cwa section 402 this latter argument was made by plaintiffs in several lawsuits the first was brought in west virginia in 1998 by citizens group the west virginia highlands conservancy challenging regulation of mountaintop re moval surface coal mining practices in that state mountaintop min ing involves removing large portions of mountain in order to expose coal seams and depositing the dirt and rock into nearby valleys and streams an october 1999 opini on and order by the us district court in that case held in dicta that the primary purpose of the

court permanently enjoined th corps from issuing section 404 permits for the disposal of mountaintop mining overburden where the sole purpose is to dispose of waste the government appealed the

environment report 87 may 6 2002 p a11lawful and the administrations position in that lawsuit12 epas and the corps justification of the revised rule is that the changes are necessary to conform the agencies rules and to bring those rules in line with current practice ie of treating mining overburden as fill to be regulated under section 404 the coal mining industry supports th practice of regu lating m ountai ntop mining discharges under section 404 and t hus supported the redefinition industry groups such as the national mining asso ciation contend that section 404 is the appropriate regulatory mechan ism for addressing activities th at convert waters to dry land but requiring section 402 permits woul d effectively prohibit broad range of mining activities which have been allowed by longstanding current practice as described above the types of materials ssociated with surface mining activities eg rock and sand are defined in the clean wa ter act as pollutants when discharged into us waters if such materials are subject to the acts section 402 npdes requirements they are evaluated on the basis of whether they alter the chemical physical or biological integrity of the water that standard is more stringent than evaluation under section 404 which authoriz permits for fill discharges for constructive or useful purposes environmental groups strongly criticized the agencies regulatory action to define coal mining overburden and other waste material as fill material more generally the environmental community opposed any proposal to allow additional discharges of waste into any waters of the united states13 thus environmentalists opposed eliminating language in the corps previous regulation which had excluded waste discharges from section 404 they argued that the prior waste exclusion language in 33 cfr 3232e correctly ba rred the corps from issuing 404 permit for waste disposal activities eliminating th waste exclusion in their view blurs the distinction between authority to regulate discharges for waste disposal given to epa under section 402 and au thority to regulate discharges of dredged or fill material given to the corps under section 404 according to these groups the changes contained in the may 2002 final rule codify practice which is contrary to the clean water act14 they contend that under the revised definition the corps has the discretion to interpret the term fill broadly and to authorize any waste discharges including those detailed in the final rule and others such as coal ash refuse so long as the effect of the discharge is to c onvert waters of the ited states to dry land or change the bottom elevation but irre spective of the impact on water quality or possible destruction of the waterbody one analyst observed that the result of th 2002 rule revisions was to change the baseline of what is regulated by the 404 program compared with the npdes program under the corps previous re gulation the disposal of waste was
