craftsmanship fundamentals lecture given on 3 may 1962 tape 6205c03 shsbc142 shsbc142 ren 151 3 may 62 craftsmanship fundamentals clearsound checked against old reels 60 min begin lecture thank you thank you well how are you doing tonight audience good youre looking better practically unrecognizable some of you marvelous marvelous got at least 25 new students here pretty good huh and herbie forgot my robin forgot my emeter second time its happened anyway id like to make few small comments on the session you saw last night note the session referred to here is the demonstration of 2 may 1962 tvd4ab renumbered shsbc 14950 lets see this is what 3 mar may ad 12 saint hill special briefing course first lecture where is the pc is it all right if i make comment on that female voice thats fine yes all right very good now some of you i understand were thank you suah sir thank you getting that suah from reg hes restimulating my life as confederate officer audience laughter this lecture in general is what i expect out of an auditor thats what this is but before we go into that too broadly i want to make few comments on that theres apparently considerable amount of surprise expressed here and there that one would stop buying skim milk and if you were to replay that tape you would find out at the beginning that the auditor spent something like five or six minutes getting the pc to say something she had done not something she had intended got it missed withhold picked up in session is anything the pc thinks anything the pc is withholding that doesnt matter thats session missed withhold you understand pc didnt tell the auditor he was uncomfortable thats all right for session missed withhold but we were prepchecking and prepchecking means meat we only buy meat in prepchecking see we dont buy skim milk see we want meat preferably with blood dripping off of it get the idea we want some meaningful acts we dont want meaningless acts why thats big difference see we dont want antisocial acts particularly like i picked my nose you know just because this is seamier the seamier side of life you see an auditor can actually start specializing in just the seamier side of life and they have nothing to do with anybody didnt do anything to anybody dont you see and specialize in picking up weird and peculiar practices on the part of the pc he didnt do anything to anybody you understand he just had weird and peculiar practice you know it doesnt mean shucks heh worthless for instance you could take some of the book one subjects like masturbation something like that oh this is embarrassing yes it shows up as something of the sort its the human race you see and its not really doing anything to anybody unless it is doing something to somebody you get the idea lot of auditors specialize in embarrassing things see as the very thing you must pick up to hell with them you know well pick them up but thathathabooh were interested in things people have done to people see were interested in overts we is not interested in withhold because it is simply seamy do you get the difference here theres considerable difference hed done something to somebody he has an accusative attitude toward somebody and we want to find out immediately afterwards what hed done to somebody accusative attitude so what it merely means hes done something to this person thats all see hes critical of joe well why is he critical of joe well hes critical of joe because hes done something to joe see heh you pick up missed withhold well i was critical of joe balderdash nonsense you can pick up 8762 see and the pc wont be any better and all of sudden somebody gets bright and says well what have you done to joe and he oh this is nothing slept with his wife didnt tell him she committed suicide later and he always thought he did it i realized all the time i had you know oh yeah this starts getting something see this is more the comparative side of existence dont you see i mean this is more factual done something see now in this session we found out something and good auditor could have extrapolated from this we found out affection was trapping people see it was bad thing affection was bad thing now if you reach way back into your fundamentals auditors either audit by fundamentals or by music and the best auditors audit by fundamentals but the job can be done auditing by the words and music see you know just auditing by rote and ritual fundamentals theres an old triangle and if you think real hard you might be able to remember it its called the arc triangle and we have found the triangle was an overt so therefore things must look pretty unreal so therefore communication of any kind is an overt so therefore the thing to do is withhold and withholding is virtue not an overt so my next zero question having cleaned up the zero question we went in on would have been what communication in some portion or another added up to an overt act got the idea as matter of fact we were picking some up hit girl with rock in the stomach communication overt act see now part of the present time problem was the dissemination of scientology and if affection lets just audit by the seat of our pants here see if affection is trapping people then communication of scientology would be reprehensible reactively you got it audience hmmm im sorry pc female voice thats fine thats an evaluation female voice thanks all right but there it is see that she had two ptps and we were cleaning up two chronic present time problems and one of them was continuing present time problem shes having all the time with her husband which enters into communication battle all the time see see letters and telephone calls and then she has an upset and cant get into session see how could anybody sit around and look at this for long time you see without doing something about this see at this point i should get cross with you because obviously obviously theres something else see must have been but you didnt have the technology you didnt have the technology down pat all right lets get the technology down pat i understand you had the technology down pat today and that is it must have been missed withhold of the magnitude of doingness to cause continuous present time problem the withhold missed by the person with whom we had the present time problem so that cleaned it up huh in the process of doing this we didnt have second session following immediately after this but the second session we would have cleaned up the other side of the ptp which is cant disseminate scientology and we had the answer right there see got the answer gratuitously see arc if affection trapped people then communication must do them up in ball see all right so wed have to clean up communication withholds that is things that she had done with communication that were reprehensible see we clean some of those up and we find out all of sudden the whole problem falls apart we also find out any iq difficulty that she kept complaining about the iq would soar do you see why itd soar see it must be down because she mustnt communicate which in itself is continuous withhold and stupidity equals withhold you understand so she feels stupid so therefore its the area of withhold okay that make sense to you female voice yes all right thats auditing by fundamentals see i wanted to call something else to your attention which you might have found very very interesting is that we had twenty or thirty incidents on that chain that we never touched the old man just went earlier do you realize i picked up the first incident on the chain uhhuh and went earlier what was i doing going earlier if the first incident on the chain showed that there was sexual activity prior to the first incident on the chain what were we doing going earlier well i just went earlier because you go earlier and did you see that the question nulled nulled beautifully do you realize there are twenty or thirty incidents the pc probably never recounted well where were they what happened to the charge see thats the mystery of it all what happened to that charge well you pull basicbasic on the immediate chain by pulling all the underpinnings out of basicbasic if you want to get it that way anything that added up to why she would do this we pulled the rest of it must have just gone brrrzt see so if you go at it on the basis that youre running engrams called withholds and you run every engram do you see if youre going at it on that basis its going to take you forever see i think the pc will tell you we had nice win last night see yet we never did touch the upper part of the chain we never even touched the subject of the ptp isnt that fascinating there was only one comment on it and then from there on we cleaned it up you see that audit by fundamentals get the earliest on the chain and release it and if you can get the earliest on the chain you can pull it out of the mud and all the later ones go there was one oddity about this case that you might find real odd is that basicbasic was notknowingness about nothing fascinating you know that was fascinating there was basicbasic the pc thought there was and we looked in vain and why did we look in vain because every auditor had always looked in vain how come youre always looking for somethingness this was trick case this was very trick the whole trick about it was is there was nothing at the basic and she hadnt done anything but thought she had and must have because auditors had kept her looking for it but we must also add into the fact that she must have kept handing it to auditors see and then we must have had the auditor never look at the emeter now did you see this last night i said what happened when you were four years old and we had some ticks and tocks and we cleaned that up now what happened when you were four years old and eventually we could find nothing there was charge on anything happened when she was four years old obviously nothing had happened that was very tricky and very freaky but how come i found it well i found it simply because i audit by fundamentals notknowingness is notknowingness wrote story once called fear guy lost four hours in his hat you know all you have to do is lose four hours in your hat sometime and youve had it see particularly if somebody keeps insisting that something happened im sure some of you in college or around and about have tried to convince some compatriot of the terrible things he did while he was drunk or while she was drunk of course it adds in notknow because they cant say they did and they cant say they didnt so youll get notknow basic which serves mechanically it is notknowingness that begins the chain so of course this chain stood hooked in because there was notknowingness about it but the notknowingness was in reverse at this time there was nothing had happened right its just crazy you by the way wont find that ordinarily in auditing pcs that was just freaky but you audit by fundamental and of course not knowingness at the bottom of the chain of course is just not knowingness at the bottom of the chain it doesnt have to even be notknowingness about something it doesnt have to be anything about the bottom of the chain thats elementary well enough about that this should give you some kind of an idea of what i mean by auditing by fundamentals you just never give up on the fundamental now ill give you an idea here see pc yap yap yap yap yap yap yap and i am tired of listing see and i cant think of any more now the reasonable auditor says of course you can get tired listing and it is true he couldnt think of any more this is absolutely true but the auditor says have i missed withhold on you see he audits not by reasonableness but by fundamental when the pc gets nattery he has missed withhold he doesnt care whether this missed withhold is justified or not justified understandable or not understandable he just audits by the fundamental that missed withhold must be present and you ask for it and pull it and the fellow keeps on listing again that happened today and i was very very interested to hear about it see you mustnt be reasonable you must be fundamental there are certain basic truths and laws about the human mind they are not very many they are astonishingly few you audit by those not by how reasonable it is that something else would be the case you actually have to isolate out for yourself what is true and what is fundamental i could give you list of things here and punch it down your gullet and get you examined on this thing until you were green in the face you see and id say these are the truths and thats all there is to it well thats something like feeding this boa constrictor i was talking about see and if the auditor is unable to regurgitate the proper datum at that instant why hed be sunk in any tough situation you see in an auditing session wouldnt he hed be sunk right there well actually stable datum fixed in by confusion and not by understanding doesnt happen to be available in tight spot so you dont audit by fundamentals you audit by being reasonable so you must recognize fundamental for what it is fundamental is fundamental i can go this far i can say to you this is fundamental damn it all find out about it and tell you eight ten fifteen times its fundamental find out about it see and then one fine day you say well i havent got anything else to do i think ill find out about this oh my god it is fundamental at that point it becomes usable tool you can go on believing these fundamentals are fundamentals and never using them or never spitting them out at the time theyre required and youll go on being ritualist you go right on being ritualist all of sudden pc after pc youll miss on and you say why am i missing on this pc itll be something on this basis since here was pc we hadnt been missing on one way or the other be on the basis of the auditor does not feel free to recognize that fundamental applies here were always asking this question what is an overt to one case its one thing and to another case its another thing but we had this gratuitously offered see on this case i audited case described an overt well were not much interested in sensation auditing sensation so therefore affection see traps people all right great i can tell you secret that it isnt going to move very far in prepchecking why isnt it going to move very far well because youre just auditing straight sensation youre saying have you ever grief have you ever grief have you ever grief have you ever have you ever used communication so as to harm somebody or something like that oh well now were on real fruitful ground arent we see by taking the arc triangle and moving around to another corner of it that does apply weve got it well thats fundamental all of you have arc down real well well its fundamental it exists when the r goes down the goes down the c goes down when the r goes up then the c goes up when the goes up you know they always go up all of them all together so theres an opportunity to improve communication and of course lack of communication or jammed communication withholds equals stupidity we could have made the case brighter this is by fundamentals you see one day you yourself will be puzzling around you will be puzzling as to why withhold makes people so stupid and after youve sat there being stupid about it for some time you will suddenly realize that it has something to do with something that has nothing to do with communication that the reverse of communication must be happening here and youll eventually think the whole thought out all by yourself and look back on it and say oh well hehheh huh i sure been feeling stupid for the last five minutes i wonder if i was withholding something well i was withholding the answer to it or something like this and you suddenly add it up and say hahaha withholds equals stupidity heh for sure see so therefore lack of communication equals stupidity you see quite fascinating but you can take these things and because these data are known you can get hoppedup speededup enormously increased look at the things you got chance to look at these things and you will eventually see that they knock out other things and you dont need these 8655 superstitions like i must not stand under karo tree because its what gives women babies you know i mean other true data of the human race i imagine theres girls right here that have been polynesians or something like that and have been part of tabooridden society and they dont realize why they always flinch alongside of lampposts or something like that and on the other hand some of us have often lived canine life laughter but these are superstitions and when you get down to the bottom of the pile why all these superstitions become understandable but what i expect of an auditor is to audit the pc thats right there in front of him by the most fundamental fundamentals that he can command and understand and if he does that he will always get wins see this auditor will always get wins he wont go around in any kind of fog about it and hell see that the prepcheck system is put together very adroitly but it becomes totally nonfunctional when you take off from zero question get overt put down any what that should have been zeroa or something get overt on it buy lot of thinks and supposedtos and that sort of thing go on down whole long chain of meaningless stuff you know not even getting the soles of the shoe wet and nothing is clearing up and its all very arduous and just goes on and on when youve done that little while you get the idea i wonder if there isnt some better way to go about it and you go for broke about that point and i can put your attention forward to this point that unless you get something the pc has done you see for your what question specific incident i dont care whether youre asking for missed withholds because it all depends on the zero what youre asking for but unless you get specific incident and it actually has doingness in it and you make chain at that point you just spot that theres chain here at that point and word it at that that youre not going to get anything happening you will see this and then the mechanics of the mind sort of start unraveling oh well yes of course you know and after youve run some of these chains down to the bottom then youll find out that all chains are anchored because of notknowingness in the bottom incident i point out something to you on two or three demonstrations you have seen that my what question was not on the button see it was close enough to have created breeze past somebodys ear see but it was not dead center because the only time you know enough to ask the exact what question is when youve finished prepchecking see and then you can ask the exact what question and if you want to appear genius to an instructor why never write the what question down until youve finished the session see the what questions are never quite on theyre just sighting questions thats all theyre never quite on because you really dont quite know whats on that chain you see so you should realize that if its that unknown to the pc what god given turbanwearing prescience do you have that youre going to know all about it when the pc doesnt and you havent found out from the pc yet well you cant find it out that exactly but because when youre auditing by fundamentals you know something about it you know about whats going to turn up you ask what question that will probably turn up something that resembles this and id say its the sheerest luck one out of hundred that what question is dead on we had what question of what about sleeping with men to trap them see oh thats pretty good that was pretty good served our purposes beautifully and went null gorgeously but it wasnt the chain the chain all followed that what question we had chain that went on from there but we were actually taking it back from an incident and were asking questions which relieved the what question which wasnt described by the what question which i thought was quite fascinating but i never expect your what question to be any closer on than that pc gave you an overt you actually did get an incident and the pc actually did something in this and then you put your what question to it so as you get chain of that type of incident and then go earlier youll almost always find yourself out in the blue if that was the first incident but it doesnt relieve there must have been lot of other factors and you find yourself asking questions about other types theyre almost on dont you see theyll be on the same dynamic they will be the same type of personnel you know and you get those erased and all of sudden the rest of the chain will blow your what questions are almost never dead on you would be swami beyond all swamis if your what questions were absolutely accurate every time see so you just get what question which describes the incident in its workably general not too general terms and ope for the best and fire from there and youll work it out every time and thats all youre bound and determined to have to get null is the incident you found and sometimes the incident will go null well if you notice in working prepcheck question i will only go over these things couple of times with eye on the meter and nothing was dying down and that told loads because i tell you one withhold system you know i mean one when all appear you know and who and it didnt blow well its something like the curiosity well we fired an 18inch shell into the middle of the jam tin and it still sat there there must be some other thing holding down this mirage called jam tin we couldnt possibly have fired at the jam tin we must have an image of the jam tin now lets find the jam tin see and the jam tin always lies earlier nothing ever locks up because of later incident and you all of sudden one you go down and you finally pick up this pebble and you dont even use the withhold system on it it just kind of goes whooh and you go back up the line and maybe use withhold system on something else that was little bit hangy and then come back to your what question and just ask the what question again and its null see it is an inexact activity prepchecking is not an exact activity it depends on the pc in front of you i expect you to be able to audit and understand the pc who is in front of you now heres what else i expect of you because prepchecking itself is an inexact activity i ask you to do it on the framework of total exactitude see just groove that in madly that sounds weird doesnt it but give it in model session godelpus you see your trs marvelous your emetering superb and when youve got those things all down so that you dont think any more about them than you think about your coat while youre eating dinner man can you prepcheck you see got an exact frame you got the withhold system thats exact you got your model session thats exact your emetering is exact the fundamentals on which your chains are stacked up in the pcs mind will be found to follow those exact rules always held in at the earliest incidentt its cousin to the chain and you take your exactitudes and just play by ear from then on theres probably nobody plays by ear better than symphony soloist theres nobody better trained in music you see these jam sessions you hear some of these boys whoopin up down around norleans huh got record upstairs that tells how that impromptu jam session was put together you see they worked on it eighteen or twenty hours and managed to get its impromptuness to sound imprompt but the upshot of this is well you take symphonyorchestra drummer i dont know how come they get these guys into symphony orchestras unless its the highclass or snoblevel something or other and then they get them into symphony orchestras and they must trap them there in some fashion because these guys make krupas look awfully awfully dim theyre technicians man theyre marvelous one guy one night you know your jazz orchestra boys they all have to use these whiskers or something these whisks you know and they get one of these whisks and they go over the top of the snare drum and it says snif snif snif snif snif you know that sort of thing symphony orchestra man does it with pair of drumsticks and it goes whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk you know and wheres his whisker it isnt anyplace you know i swear those guys could play snare drums with their kettle drums if you asked them to see theyre marvelous but they are precision musicians they really can play by note you see they really can do their stuff and after that why hell they can do anything you see but lets get some highschool kid and before he learns how to back up wagner why lets let him extrapolate with some jazz it sounds that way too never seems to its just noisy see its just noise and actually this is always the illusion of any craftsman is that he can do it offhandedly it looks as though there is terrific ease theres just nothing to it you see you see weller out here whittling block of wood and you say well anybody could do that or look at something hes built or something like that and you say well anybody could do that go ahead see it looks so easy the mahogany dispatch boxes that sit on the back ledge of my desk back there he didnt cause any fuss building those things theyre all hand fitted and hand carved without any tools to amount to anything you see the guy is craftsman hes been at that for long time and you give old jenner out here pile of stone you see nobody can work stone give old jenner pile of stone and you say build wall well you can give him specifications about the wall but somehow or another wall happens its all so easy you see him working out there and you see stuff going up and theres nothing much to it well now and then he makes mistake but the only mistakes he actually makes is when he and come into planning or design disagreement and once in while why we wont see eye to eye on some planning or design thing something else is going to go up after that that he doesnt know about or something like that but as far as actually doing it it looks awful easy it looks awful easy till you get somebody else in who calls himself bricklayer and the guy goes out and my god you know he works and hes got bricks stacked up and hes got mortar you know and he picks up bricks you know and he puts them down and he smooths them out and he gets the mortar on top of them and it falls all over the drive and weve there must have been such bricklayer at work around here because one wall that we found out there was plumb and he makes lot of work out of it and you wind up with wall well its just basically because he just doesnt the guy wouldnt know really how to handle mortar with trowel it comes down to little tiny fundamentals you know you take the fellow who does great job of sculpture he knows his clay and he knows this and he knows that theyre not something hes trying to learn while he is making the sculpt see hes all set and then he sculpts he knows how to do these things your oldtime painters had this down to perfection i know i was kicking around over on that side of the channel back in them thar days i mean the real oldtimers around 1350 1360 the real flemish school that the other fellows just hah you know came along afterward and pspt you know rembrandt pfhooh well he copyist but in those days you couldnt run down to the paint store you could have run down but there would have been paint store and the way you learned how to paint is you went and found master someplace and you ground color for him and your little girlfriend would be saying to you jan how come you is so blue tonight and youd mortar and pestle his color and you finally found out all there was to know about drying and color and pigment and what pigment did and what pigment didnt and how it was blended and how it was put together and what the constituency of it is and the darned paintings painted with it are still there fascinating they must have known something huh when you got all through you knew how to youd find out how to spread the stuff and how to work it and so on and you actually go on for years and someday one day why the master would give you brush an old used brush of some kind or another and say well you see the wall over there well make paint stroke on it and then youd go over and youd make paint stroke on the wall you know and hed say oh my god give that brush you know youd say what have i done wrong you know well he couldnt find out what youd done right that was you look at the japanese work with brush and that sort of thing they dont do it overnight you know it looks so easy you know you look at jap and he paints his bamboo you know he paints it all up and so on he paints and when its all finished heres beautiful free sketch you see of bamboo you say thats easy you take some charcoal or something you know you take big piece of paper and you say well now lets see and go bzupt and bzupt well the little jap he knows where to get the inkstone you know and he knows how to grind it up and he knows how to mix it and he knows how to handle brushes and he could probably write with brush as fast as you can write with pen amazing and all of those things however are built out of great ability to do small detail thats the common denominator of all great art its great ability to do small detail and out of that you get great art and thats why these schools of drawing that you see down in greenwich village well theyre all lined up along the board fence and so forth and why in fifty years nobody can find those pictures around theyre definitely not going for 285 thousand pounds for one sketch more likely you find them filling mouse hole someplace to keep the draft out and thats because those boys went on an entirely different idea they see the ease with which it is done and mistake the tremendous skill in the tiny detail because the tiny det it looks so easy you see they see one of these boys painting they see the results of the painting it all looks so natural it all looks so easy so they use the same abandon with which the master works you see they use the same abandon with which the master works to paint their paintings or sculpt their sculptings and its mud its mud and the only thing thats missing is how do you take small brush and flip it across palate to bring it out to point and paint an absolutely straight line how do you do that give you some idea of this michelangelo used to go calling on his friends and if they werent home hed take piece of chalk and hed draw circle on the door and they always knew michelangelo had been to visit them he was the only man in all of italy who could draw freehand circle that was perfect hed draw perfect circle all of his friends recognized it as badge you know craftsmanship is built out of these the exact skill the exact response the thing i dont care how great the mans name is or how splendid the accomplishment hes trying to accomplish or how tiny or unimportant the thing is the factor is still there its still craftsmanship and craftsmanship is built out of tremendous expertness on the tiny detail thats all you really have to know now our tiny details consist of meter one of the reasons we can clear today and get further today on cases and get goals assessments and find terminals on cases is because we have better meter all right thats all right thats neither here nor there it still takes an auditor who is absolutely fabulous on reading meter i went through session this afternoon that i yesterday my auditor said he sort of wound up the end of the session and he was sort of stunned because he thought sudden thought struck him this was what if some beginning student had been trying to do that goals check it whumped him for second he suddenly realized how far he himself had come he was reading microscopic clean needle but it was microscopic and he was reading some that were going sporadic and some that were going unsporadic and were going naturally and well you see and it was job of work you see and because he was centering in toward the center of goal of course he was getting suppressions and invalidations left and right because already he was stirring up its oppterm you see he was stirring up both its terminal and oppterm he was picking off missed withholds invalidations and suppressions and getting the read and getting the read off suppressions and missed withholds and invalidations and getting the read back on the goal then he had to test all of the goals that had been there to make sure that each one of those didnt have invalidations or suppressions do you see or missed withholds on them and about them you see and then he had to check those to make sure that they werent still reading make sure they were null and he was working around on this for about an hour or so well more than that checking out this goal line you see and the thought afterward struck him all of sudden he realized how far hed come i guess what thought really occurred to him is what would he have done year ago see the guy was doing it very easily and very naturally see there was nothing to it meter was talking all the way now he didnt have time to do that and worry about the meter and worry about rote and ritual and so forth he didnt have time to worry about these other things he had to have lot of things down pat didnt he he had to know this meter backwards he had to know exactly what this meter was capable of and so forth in other words his attention couldnt be on the meter his familiarity had to be sufficiently great that he could take the meter for granted and it still wouldnt knock his head off furthermore his model session had to be absolutely perfect he didnt have any time to worry about his model session he had to know the exact fundamentals of what he was handling he didnt have any time to figure out what he was handling see the whole thing was wrapped up in the fact that he was right in the middle of goalsproblemmass goal and all of its little masses and so forth were just kicking the living daylights out of the goal because he had them stirred up like mad do you see and he read the thing out and the end of the line why perfectly fine about it and as i say it suddenly struck him that what if hed been trying to do it year ago i think thats what hit him but it was all made out of little pieces it was all made out of little pieces the tremendous ease with which he could run meter the worry of any kind on model session he didnt have to fuss around with his trs dont you see he didnt have any worries about these things whatsoever he was totally relaxed he knew those things backwards he knew them forwards and he knew he knew them so he had at moment any worry about them now he could think of fundamentals and the fundamentals are is goals get invalidated and rudiments go out in any session particularly goals assessment so all he had to do was just outguess the next missed withhold you see thats all he had to do and keep checking and keep rolling and it was dead easy but it would have been insurmountable utterly insurmountable if he had been had any worry about his meter if hed had any worry about his sessioning you know his trs or if he didnt know for sure that if the pc starts doping off all you did was pull the missed withhold you know it goes like this he sees the pc start to get dopey he pulls the missed withhold see and bang the pc is right back there again get the idea and he suddenly sees that the goal is not reading and it was reading moment ahead well he doesnt say thank god we have nulled it out at last he says is there an invalidation on this pang all right what was that clean it up is there an invalidation on that thats clean all right now he repeats the goal again he gets read on the goal now he says thats null careful workmanship see pays off all the way down the line how do you get to be superb auditor its just by knowing all those little parts thats all and just knowing them perfectly and if an auditor finds out that he is apparently creaking on one of these infinitesimally unimportant skills you see hell be creaky on it if he ever is sitting there auditing and is saying i wonder i wonder if that pc is getting my acknowledgments if he finds himself worrying about this or wondering about that you see i swear hell never have time to do anything else but what he should do at this particular time if he finds himself worrying about these things ah he ought to practice with some tr 4 get somebody there until he really gets that tr 4 in there you know really gets it going good or 3 or 2 or whatever else hes out on see thats the smart auditor the smart student of auditing would make himself checksheet of these various parts of auditing im talking now about the parts of mixing the pigments you see grinding the lapis lazuli that stage of the game well just make himself checksheet on these things and go over that checksheet very carefully wondering if at any time in any recent session he has worried about any part of his checksheet see make checksheet which includes the various parts of the emeter you know the sensitivity knob the trim the dial tonearm dial something that hes had trouble with or worried about just go over this checksheet which has all of these various parts and items and trs and things like that and go over that and just ask himself honestly now in the last few sessions have i had any concern with this see well then how about this one i have trouble confronting pcs lately oh yeah all right well well cross that one and then just take those points hes crossed and just go ahead and drill them just drill them just treat it like paradeground drill thats all dancer he finds out that he usually stumbles on his exit youll find him going out on the stage and practice that step that gets him exited until he doesnt stumble on his exit only then will you be free to be craftsman be master of what youre doing only then will you be free to audit the pc in front of you you wont be free to audit the pc in front of you as long as youre enslaved with dontknows amongst your auditing tools because youve got chain of error which mounts in the session on the basic notknowingness and your session errors just mount like mad oh my god what am i doing and you eventually checking these things off and the chances are you might not find out what youre doing wrong for little while until youve cleaned some of the garbage off and you suddenly find out you know i i really have never dared ask anybody because of embarrassment but what what is null needle hmmhmhmmm well thats what it takes to become master of craft and dont think that youre going to get results real honesttogod results if youre anything less and thats the discouraging point of auditing todays auditing is not aimed at the repetitive process attention on the pc you just run repetitive process on the pc and you hope for the best now the funny part of it is is that system circa 50 on started to develop in 50 was best developed along about 52 53 that system actually does make lot of people well and you could be fooled by the fact that it does make lot of people well so does engram running see theres lot of things you can do with the skills of yesterday and if anything we are victimized slightly by the tremendous workability of what we have been able to do here and there and any auditor who has audited consistently along the line this person and that person and so on well has had some rather interesting wins he gets hung on his own wins because we have never had techniques before 1962 which reached all cases and thats something we havent all learned yet and the other thing about it is is these techniques require masters touch they are that strong they are that powerful you can unman the pcs mind his reactive mind doesnt have prayer you do these things right you have broadly broadly workable technology thats been going in that direction but at the same time we inherit along with it precision of application which knows secondclass or just as good as all of the various points which make precision in auditing must be actually precise when you sit down across from an auditor who does his emetering so well that he never worries about an emeter he does his trs so well that he never worries about his trs he does his model session so well that he never worries about his model session he knows what hes supposed to do with the processes hes given whether theyre routine 3 or prepcheck or anything else you see and he does just these things and honest the pc as pc hell just say gosh you know gosh huh its so easy i am so comfortable sitting here being audited how come what makes this how did that combination of events take place is it because the auditor was born as the seventh of seventh is it because he gave present once to the witch of endor is it some fantastic prescience of some kind is it because his thetan can read your thetan well it doesnt happen to be single one of these things it would be because the auditor knew the little points of auditing absolutely perfectly did them as whole with perfection so that he was under tension by reason of auditing because he knew all the parts and could then apply fundamentals to what he was doing when you will sit down someday across from such an auditor youll all of sudden say whew uhh and you yourselves if you learn your business here will go home and youll sit down and start to audit somebody somebody that you used to audit and theyll say my god what happened to you and there really wasnt anything happened to you except you are doing less and youre doing it much less arduously than you used to do and the results just fly nothing to it you finish up two three fourhour session youre perfectly calm so what youd just as soon audit another two or three hours because youre under tension youre under not knows but first and foremost in order to attain any result requires technology well we have those technologies and you have to also get confidence that when you sit down and audit somebody he is by these technologies he is going to get result so that that takes out the last notknow out of it is is the pc going to gain or win and what youre doing today you do it right the pc keeps winning that pc just wins thats all the pc goes on winning and you all of sudden get confident in the fact the pc is going to win if you audit him the pc will win bang thats all there is to it youll win the pc wins everybody wins and thats the final tension that goes out of it and after that my god the results you can get in auditing are just fantastic and frankly thats what i expect of you here thats what i expect you to learn how to be able to do to audit like master before you get out of here thank you end of lecture
