the boomer ang system when moved to the on position it works by pulling an box si gnal low which energizes solid state relay whic h powers up the syste m the switch is locking type th toggle must be deliberately pulled away from the box in or der to change its position from on to off r visa versa bbn technologies page 11 rev c 32 alphanumeric display this is 2 row x 20 character serial interface backlit yellowgreen lcd with rs232 interface it is used to disp lay gpsgrid coordinate and boomerang status data 33 gps jack this jack provides passthrough via which the external gps module is attached to the corresponding rs232 port within the signal processing unit this allows baddamaged gps to be swapped out without having to swap out the entire forw ard wiring harness 34 led rosette this is 12 led rosette done in gr een the center led is always lit the peripheral leds are lit either singly 13 possible combinations including none lit or in pairs 66 additional combinati ons for grand total of 79 the led pair combinations can be implemented by toggling rapidly between single led selections multiplexing this approach which was successfully implemented for the previous display m odule version requires only 4 of the alphanumeric display output bits to achieve the 13 possible single led combinations the illumination level of the leds is controlled using the remaining 2 gpsstatus display output bits offdim lowdim highon and synchronized with that of the gpsstatus display 35 speaker the speaker provides audio output for boomerang it uses the left channel output from the sbc audio interface stereo amplifier cated within the box the speaker output level is i ndependent of the gunner headphone level and is digitally controlled by the left channel of the ebox audio subsystems integrated stereo mixer 36 gunner headphone jack this jack provides audio output for gunners headphones its level is independent of the c abin speaker level and is digitally controlled by the right channel of the ebox audio subsystems integrated stereo mixer it is amplified by the right channe l of the stereo am plifier that is used to drive the onboard speaker 37 ethernet jack this jack provides an easily accessible interface point for attaching maintenance computer typically lapt op to boomerang it includes dust coverplug that is inserted when other computer is attached bbn

source controlled by the disp lay dimmer every button press is acknowledged by beep from the audio output speaker 381 test the test button puts the display in test mode it is used to verify that all boomerangs microphones and microphon electronics are functioning properly in this mode boomerang listens for test sound source whistle and indicates on which individual microphones any are detected when operating properly every microphone s hould be able to detect the test sound source the numbers of the crophones are displayed on the top line of the alphanumeric display and corresponding or is displayed on the bottom line when m ode 6 is first selected 7 s are displayed one for each microphone microphone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 health test data are then generated by whistle or other sufficiently characterized sound source when any microphone channel exhibits the expected stimulus its corresponding becomes microphone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 health if all 7 s become s then all 7 microphones are operating properly microphone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 health if any s never becomes then the corresponding microphone is bad and should be replaced if replaci ng the microphone does not fix the problem then the boomerang

onoff the system draws p ower from the vehi cle batteries there are two power switches one power switch is located on the side of the signal processing unit as shown in figure 8 the sign proc essing unit is located under the right rear passenger seat the other power swit ch is located on the topside of the display as shown in figure 9 the display is mounted to the vehicle dash both s witches must be in the on position for the system to operate to turn the system on first turn the power switch on the signal processing unit from the off to t he on position then turn the the power switch on the display from the off to the on position the system can be shut down by moving either the po wer switch on the display or the power switch on the si gnal processing unit from the on position to the off

lock is available then n pos is displayed in place of all grid coordinates if gps is attached or the gps is not functioning properly gps will be displayed 4 vehicle heading and shooter gr id coordinates are included among these descriptions both are best determined using magnetic bearing digital compass which is not currently included in the boomerang hardware but is an anticipated enhancement for the short term vehicle hea ding will be determined using gps while the vehicle is underway and shooter grid coordinates will not be provided 5 the system always starts with the speaker unmuted and the display at full brightness 6 there are two possible error messages mic data data being received from hub bad mics _ _ _ _ _ _ _ indicates microphones that are not operating properly to clear the error message press the mode button 5 detection when gunshot is detected the rosette and alphanumeric display change to indicate the azimuth range and elevation of the shooter correspondingly the display remains in this state for 30 seconds or until another shot is detected whic hever is sooner corresponding announcement is also made via the l oudspeaker shot xoclock xxx meters shot xoclock xxx meters where the xxx meters value is the range to the shooter and is given to the nearest 10 meter increment if shot is detected but the shooter cannot be localized then the center indicator of the rosette blinks all shooter display values are set to and the corresponding announcement is shot shot ambiguous shots are calle d out as shot xoclock or yoclock and displayed with two leds on the rosette the data for only the most likely solution is displayed on the alphanumeric display bbn technologies page 17 rev c the system detects smallarms fire traveling toward the vehicle for bullet trajectories that pass within approximately 30 meters of the vehicle and from range of 50150 meters inclusive solutions for bullet trajectories and ranges not within those paramet ers may be detected although solutions may become less accurate detections and shooter positions are determined in less than 50 milliseconds the system resets and will detect and announce following shot in one second false shot detections will be less than one per thousand hours of system operation at vehicle speed under 50 miles per hour missed shots will be less than one per 500 shots at vehicle speeds over 50 miles per hour the system is calibrated to detect the 762x39mm round which is the round fired by the ak47 and similar sma ll arms this round belongs to the family of 30caliber rifle rounds and tr avels supersonically when fired from rifle however this calibration does not preclude the system from detecting larger and smaller rounds and in fact the system has been tested also with 556 nato and 50 bmg 50 caliber rounds and has performed satisfactorily 51 general the system indicates the relative position of the shooter both aurally and visually in one of the twelve clockhour positions clockwise from front of vehicle when viewed from above when on occasion the system can narrow the location of the shooter further than one of two locations it will indicate both the first dire ction announced is the more probable 52 aural indication the system announces shot detection and shooter relative position by voice from speaker in the manner shot 3 oclock or in the case of two possible positions shot 3 oclock or 6 oclock when two solutions are given the first one is the more probable 53 visual indication the system indicates shot detection and shooter relative position by means of glowing spot on visual clock face in the case of two possible positions both are indicated by glowing spots the visual indication persists for 10 seconds unle ss other shots are detected sooner in addition the azimuth bearing range and elevation are reported on an alphanumeric lcd display as shown below az 168 deg 1234567890 nnw rg 123m _23f mut
