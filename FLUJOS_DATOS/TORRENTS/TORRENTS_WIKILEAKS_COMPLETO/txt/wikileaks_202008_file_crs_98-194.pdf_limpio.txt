110th congress the us house of representatives considered 104 contested election cases the vast majority of these cases were resolved in favor of the contestee term referring to member or memberelect of the house of representatives whose election was challenged the term contestant refers to an individual who challenged the election of memberelect of the house of representatives it appears that of the 104 contested election cases considered by the house since 1933 in at least three cases the house ultimately seated the contestant and in at least one case the house ultimately refused to seat any individual declaring vacancy in the majority of the other cases the contest was dismissed based on reasons including lack of evidence determination that voting irregularities fraud or misconduct was insufficient to affect the results of the election failure to sustain the burden of proof necessary to award the contested seat to the contestant and improper initiation of contest or other procedural failures with regard to procedures followed on the first day of new congress of the 104 contested election cases considered by the house since 1933 it appears that in at least 15 cases the memberelect was asked to step aside or remain seated while the oath of office was collectively administered to the other memberselect of those 15 cases where memberelect was asked to step aside it appears that in at least two instances the memberelect was subsequently administered the oath on an expressl provisional basis in at least 2 of the 15 cases where memberelect was asked to step aside the house declined to administer the oath of office to that memberelect until after the committee to which the question was referred had conducted an investigation and issued report in the remaining 11 of the 15 cases where memberelect was asked to step aside in most instances the house adopted resolution providing merely that the memberelect be now permitted to take the oath of office with specific reference to final determination of the right to the seat nor any express reference to filed election contest as has been noted by house parliamentarians the seating of memberelect does not prejudice contest pending under the federal contested elections act fcea regarding the final right to seat the summaries of contested election cases contained in this report focus primarily on the nature of the contest and the disposition of the case this report examines only cases considered by the house of representatives involving the question of whether memberelect was duly elected that is questions

of fraud or other election improprieties of these cases vast majority were resolved in favor of the contestee since enactment of the federal contested elections act of 1969 fcea5 most cases have been dismissed due to failure by the contestant to sustain the burden of proof necessary to overcome motion to dismiss

the presentation of credentials that is certificate of election from the appropriate state authority8 by memberelect at the beginning of congress is considered to be only prima facie evidence that the person holding those credentials was elected by the people of his or her district9 memberelect is not member of congress until that person is sworn in and seated by the respective house10 under express provisions of the us constitution the final authority over the elections returns and qualific ations of its own members is clearly lodged within each house of congress11 although procedures have not been absolutely consistent house practice is that any member elect on the first day of the new congress and before the memberselect have been sworn ie at the time when the speaker asks the memberselect to rise to take the oath of office may object to the seating of another memberelect based on the objecting memberelects own responsibility as memberelect andor on f acts and statements that the memberelect considers reliable 12 the memberelect about whom the objection is made is generally asked to step aside or to remain seated while the other memberselect rise to be collectively

are three different procedures th at may then be followed with regard to the challenged memberelect the house may agree to resolution to simply seat the member at that time determining both his prima facie as well as final right to the seat14 second with regard to memberelect who presents valid credentials and is qualified to be member resolution may be offered to seat the memberelect provisionally or conditionally even though those words are not expressly used based on his or her prima facie right to the seat by resolving to seat the memberelect but to refer the question of the final disposition of his or her entitlement to the seat to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction now the committee on house administration 15 in some instances the resolution offered to swear in the challenged memberelect did not expressly provide that condition or mention any election contest filed but the house later considered the matter of election on merely majority vote basis thus demonstrating in fact that the swearing in and seating was provisional conditional or without prejudice to the houses right to eventually and finally resolve the question of who was duly elected 16 as stated by brown and johnson in house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house the seating of memberelect does not prejudice contest pending under the federal contested elections act fcea over final right to the seat17 third the resolution may refer both the prima facie right to the seat as well as the final right to the seat to the committee without authorizing the swearing in and seating of anyone18

1933 it appears that in at least 15 cases the memberelect was asked to step aside or remain seated while the oath of office was collectively administered to the other memberselect on the first day of new congress19 of those 15 cases where memberelect was asked to step aside it appears that in at least two instances the memberelect was subsequently administered the oath on an expressly provisional basis20 typically during such provisional administrations of the oath the house adopts privileged resolution authorizing the speaker to administer the oath and further providing that the question of the final right of the memberelect to seat in the new congress be referred to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction and that such committee shall have the power to send for persons and papers and

and deceit contestant was deprived of sufficient votes necessary to overcome contestees majority the main issue in this case involved one voting booth in the city of waterbury the elections committee recognized that the contestants allegations were general vague and uncertain as to necessary particulars and that while the allegations did not meet the statutory requirements the committee would nevertheless pierce the veil the committee set forth guiding postulates for its consideration of the case 1 the official returns are prima facie evidence of the regularity and correctness of official action 2 election officials are presumed to have performed their duties loyally and honestly 3 the burden of coming forward with evidence to meet or resist these presumptions rests with the contestant the committee held hearings and ascertained that while confusion existed at the polling place as to voting for repeal of the 18 th amendment in instance was single complaint made to anyone at the polling place as to irregularity interference or fraud and this in spite of the fact that the election board was nonpartisan therefore the committee found that the contestant failed to establish his case by fair preponderance of the evidence concluding that contestee goss was duly elected disposition of the contest on april 20 1934 the house adopted hres 346 awarding the seat to contestee goss 78

the official returns contestee burnham received plurality of 518 votes contestant chandler charged that he had received majority of the lawful votes cast specifically contestant argued that he was deprived of rightful count because election officers rejected ballots favoring him citing that such ballots had been void spoiled mutilated or marked contestant also maintained that the unused ballots together with the stubs of the used ballots exceeded the number of ballots delivered to some precincts while in other precincts the unused ballots together with the stubs of the used ballots was less than the number of ballots delivered contestant further charged that many used ballots were missing from the ballot boxes as in gormley v goss supra the elections committee reiterated its warning about vague charges and pointed out that the statute required the notice of contest to contain particulars in addition to the three general guidelines for judging contested elections cases it set forth in gormley the committee prescribed two more 4 that fraud is never presumed but must be proven and 5 that the mere closeness of the result of an election raises presumption of fraud irregularities or dishonesty the committee found that the record disclosed evidence of fraud or deception and that private recount taken by the contestant without the knowledge of the contestee which supposedly showed decided gain for the contestant was inadmissible as uncorroborated and selfserving in respect to the contestants charge that not all election board members signed the returns in some precincts and that in others none signed the returns the committee stated the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to suffrage may be divided into two classes first mandatory which defines the right of suffrage second directory which directs the manner of its exercise the first confers the right and the last throws safeguards around that right the laws enacted for the purpose of conserving the right of the elector to exercise his franchise are mandatory or directory depending upon whether the statutes make them so if the statute provides that unless certain procedure is followed the election is void then the law is mandatory if however it prescribes for the doing or not doing of certain thing in certain manner by the election officers and fixes penalty for the disobedience of the law but does not provide that such violation shall void the election then it is directory the rules prescribed by law fo r conducting an election are designed chiefly to accord an opportunity for the free and fair exercise of the elective franchise to prevent illegal voting and to ascertain with certainty the resu lt departure from the mode prescribed will not vitiate an election if the irregularities do not deprive any legal voter of his vote or admit an illegal vote or cast uncertainty on the result and has not been occasioned by the agency of party seeking to derive benefit from them the committee concluded that the contestant had failed to establish fraud in this case disposition of the contest hres 386 declaring contestee burnham to have been duly

the election officials saw to it that every person entitled to vote was granted the opportunity that person not entitled to vote was permitted to vote and that the result of the balloting as certified by the officials was correct the committee did find that some irregularities occurred including failure to maintain registration books in some of the precincts as prescribed by oklahoma law but concluded that it is not the business nor the province of this committee to attempt indirectly to compel the state of oklahoma to enforce its laws with respect to certain provisions therein which patently were not complied with but grossly disregarded the electors the people of the district did choose between two candidates and they should not be deprived of their rights by the failure to those responsible for the administration of the law to do their duty the committee decided that while the constitution and laws of oklahoma required registration books to be kept in the precincts failure to comply with this requirement was not such an irregularity as to vitiate an election unless the performance of the act of keeping the book be declared by law to be essential to the validity of the election according to the committee under oklahoma law it follows therefore that the provision is merely directory and the final test as to legality of the election is whether or not the electors have been given an opportunity to express and have fairly expressed their will the committee determined that the alleged irregularities were insufficient to cons titute claim of fra ud that is due to the fact that the irregularities were not of such nature to invalidate the election because the provisions of law governing the alleged irregularities were directory and not mandatory the

the contest the committee concluded that jurisdiction of an alleged contested election case cannot be conferred on the house or one of its committees by any joint agreement of the parties unofficially

the contestants had not availed themselves of legal steps to challenge in court the alleged exclusion of negroes from the ballot nor the issuance of the certificates of election to the contestees the report found that the contestants had not been candidates at the election and thus under house precedents had standing to invoke the house contested election statute according to the report there been an election in mississippi in november 1964 for members of the us house of representatives under statutes which had not been set aside by court of competent jurisdiction and that at the same election presidential electors and us senator had been elected without question the report further observed that case challenging the mississippi registration and voter laws was progressing through the us courts and that the question of the constitutionality of the statutes was proper one for the courts to determine according to the report it was doubtful that any disenfranchisement even if proven would have actually affected the outcome of the november 1964 mississippi congressional elections in any district the report concluded that the house in following its rules and procedures should dismiss the cases because the contestants did not qualify to utilize the house contested elections statute and because the contestees had been elected under laws that had not been set aside at the time of the election the report did state however that in arriving at such conclusions the committee did not condone disenfranchisement of voters in the 1964 or previous elections nor was precedent being established to the effect that the house would not take action in the future to vacate seats of sitting members it noted that the v oting rights act of 1965 had been enacted in the interim and

contest specifically the committee found that alth ough there may have been human errors committed at the polls on election day there was evidence of fraud or willful misconduct it found that the burned ballots were unused ballots and the practice of burning such had been uniform one for numerous years the allegation of more ballots cast than names listed on the polls was discharged by the conclusion that some inadvertent errors had been made but the errors were insufficient to change the result even if l the excess ballots were added to the total of the contestant the charge respecting the counting of absentee ballots was found to apply to one polling place and the circumstances were such as to make it inadequate as charge the disappearing tally sheet was located and involved technical operation of voting machine not the counting of the results it was further disclosed by the contestant that the request for recount was in the nature of fishing expedition and that he knew of fraud by which to substantiate it the committee acknowledged that iowa had recount statute applicable to us house election but found that the matter had effect on the jurisdiction of the committee that the committee would proceed to recount if substantial allegations of irregularity or fraud were alleged and the likelihood existed that the result of the election would be different were it not

contestee received the highest vote at the general election it then declared that assuming arguendo that the substitute nomination of the democratic candidate for congress was contrary to georgia law it did not follow that the house would unseat the republican contestee the committee stated that it was unaware of any precedent for depriving member of his seat solely on the basis of the

the party of losing candidate in general election to impeach the election of the winning candidate by claiming that the election was invalid because the losing candidate had not been nominated in accordance with election laws and party rules the committee also noted that suit brought in the georgia courts by the contestant seeking special primary had been dismissed the contestant had been writein candidate in the general election but his candidacy had been of only few days duration and he had publicly announced his withdrawal from the race several days prior to the general election the

presumption of fraud or irregularities moreover the panel found that the minor discrepancies in the number of unused ballots returned were either explicable or normal thus the ad hoc panel concluded

request was denied the contestant then filed suit in us district court for the western district of north carolina requesting recount the court ruled against the contestant the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit although agreeing that parts of the law governing the election were unconstitutional refused to order recount or invalidate the outcome of the election the contestant then filed notice of contest under the fcea claiming that the program used to tabulate the computercounted ballots violated the equal protection clause of the 14 th amendment of the constitution and that had not votes been erroneously counted for the contestee the election result would have been different the contestant sought either recount or invalidation of the vote the contestee filed motion to dismiss the house administration committee recommended dismissal on two grounds first the contestants evidence was too speculative to meet the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the election was affected by the manner in which the five counties counted ambiguously marked ballots second the committee found that recount was an unwarranted remedy moreover invalidation of the election would be improper because the contestant failed to challenge the ambiguities of the ballots in court prior to the election in question the committee considered the rationale of the court of appeals in making its determinations disposition of the contest the committee adopted motion to report hres 304 dismissing the election contest the house passed the measure on november 15 1983

nature of the contest the contestant filed notice of contest under the fcea asserting that when the contestant challenged the late representative patsy mink in the 2002 democrat primary where he received 15 of the vote representative mink should have been disqualified as primary candidate because she was seriously ill at the time of the primary election and passed away one week later contestant argued that he should have been declared the democrat nominee by default and that as the nominee he therefore would have been the inevitable winner of the general election the committee found that the fcea does not contempl ate considering notices of contest that are based on the conduct of primary elections therefore the committee concluded that the basis for the contestants notice of contest was outside the scope of the fcea and voted to dismiss as frivolous election contest disposition of the contest the committee adopted motion to report hres 317 dismissing the election contest and on july 15 2003 the house passed the measure

nature of the contest the contestant filed notice of contest under the fcea alleging that contestee gordon committed violations of the constitution amounting to acts of insurrection because contestee as an incumbent member of congress did not resign his seat prior to seeking reelection and because as an inactive member of the tennessee bar contestee violated the separation of powers principle in the us constitution by remaining judicial officer of the courts of tennessee while serving as legislative officer of the united states the contestant made allegations of irregularities fraud or wrongdoing with respect to the election the committee on house administration announced that in order to have standing under the fcea contestant must have been candidate for election to the house of representatives in the last preceding election and claim right to the contestees seat the committee found that the contestant met the first prong of the twopart test with regard to the second prong the committee found that by claiming right to the contestees seat because the contestee was ineligiblenot qualified to appear on the november 5 2003 ballot the contestant fails to explain the logical

contest only if the notice states grounds sufficient to change the result of the election that is the committee found that contestant must allege irregularities fraud or wrongdoing that if proven

nature of the contest in virtually identical notice of contest to the one filed and dismissed during the 108th congress the contestant filed notice of contest under the fcea asserting that contestee gordon committed violations of the constitution amounting to acts of insurrection because as an incumbent member of congress the contestee did not resign his seat prior to seeking reelection and because as an inactive member of the tennessee bar the contestee violated the separation of powers principle in the us constitution by remaining judicial officer of the courts of tennessee while

fraud or wrongdoing with respect to an election that if proven would likely overturn the original election outcome absent that the committee noted it would recommend dismissal of the contest in this

while pursuing state remedies the contestant also filed notice of contest unde r the fcea alleging widespread voting machine irregularities in response the contestee filed motion to dismiss arguing that the contest was based on conjecture and speculation while awaiting timely state resolution of the case the committee on house administration deferred acting on the contest for five months with state resolution forthcoming the committee initiated an investigation on may 5 2007 enlisting assistance from the government accountability office gao the committees investigation focused on whether voting machine malfunction in sarasota county caused the unusually large number of undervotes in february 2007 gao reported its findings to the committee concluding that voting machine malfunction did not contribute to the undervote in sarasota county while acknowledging that it is the constitutional duty of the house of representatives to investigate valid election contest the committee noted that only clear and convincing evidence can provide the basis to overcome the presumption of the regularity accorded states certified results without such evidence the committee concluded that floridas certification of the election results in the 13 th district must be confirmed by the house therefore the committee voted to dismiss the contest disposition of the contest on february 12 2008 the
