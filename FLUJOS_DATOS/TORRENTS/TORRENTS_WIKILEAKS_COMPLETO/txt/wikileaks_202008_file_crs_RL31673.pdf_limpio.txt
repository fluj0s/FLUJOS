issues and concludes with synopsis of recent legislative activity on the program in 1986 two contractors were selected to build competing prototypes lockheeds yf22 and northrops yf23 which were flight tested in late 1990 in april 1991 the air force selected lockheeds yf22 design for fullscale development now termed system development and demonstration sdd the aircraft is powered by pratt whitneys f119 engine selected in competition with general electrics f120 engine in december 2005 the air force announced that the 12 f22 aircraft with the 27th fighter squadron 1st fighter wing langley air force base had reached initial operational capability ioc 184aircraft program was estimated by the department of defense dod in september 2006 to cost about 652 billion in actual prioryear and projected outyear expenditures the administrations fy2007 budget requested 26 billion for the f22a program and the authority to enter into multiyear procurement myp for the final three years of production congress granted both these requests congress denied the air forces request to incrementally fund f22 procurement the f22a has had strong congressional support although some have criticized the program on grounds of cost requirements and coordination with other tactical aircraft programs deletion of procurement funds in the fy2000 defense appropriation bill passed by the house made the future of the program major issue for house and senate conferees in 1999 under dods current plan fy2009 is the final year of f22 procurement funding sufficient funds have been provided by congress and disbursed by dod to keep the f22 production line open until the next presidential administration is in place many including air force leaders argue that more f22s are required than are currently planned and urge congress to provide additional funds others including dod leaders argue that the current plan is appropriate and that dod has other m ilitary aviation priorities that would be threatened by continued spending on the raptor the f22 airframe is produced by lockheed martin in marietta ga and ft worth tx and by boeing in seattle wa with engines by pratt whitney in middletown ct

intended to be the worlds preeminent combat aircraft designed as fighter with some groundattack capability the f22a raptor uses the latest developments in stealth technology to reduce the probability of detection by enemy radar as well as thrustvectoring engines for high maneuverability and avionics that fuse and display information from onboard and offboard sensors in single display the first prototype of this nextgeneration stealth fighterattack plane was flown on september 29 1990 followed by the first flight of development aircraft seven years later the f22 achieved initial operational capability in late 2005 and full operational capability on december 12 2007 1 the final f22 is currently planned to be delivered to the air force in 2011 the major contractors are lockheed martin in marietta ga and fort worth tx and boeing in seattle wa for the airframe with engines made by pratt whitney in middletown ct 2 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 during the early 1980s the air force began development of stealth aircraft called the advanced tactical fighter tf then expected to enter service in the 1990s to replace f15 fighter planes developed in the early 1970s the tf was viewed as necessary response to expected advances in the soviet unions development and production of combat aircraft in the 1990s naval variant of the tf that could operate from aircraft carriers the natf was expected to replace the navys f14 fighter however funding for the na tf was not requested by the defense department after 1990 meanwhile development of the air forces tf continued in hopes of controlling costs the defense department emphasized competitive prototypes for airframes engines and avionics the air force selected two teams of airframe contractors to develop tf prototypes lockheed teamed with boeing and general dynamics and northrop teamed with mcdonnell douglas on october 31 1986 the air force awarded each team 691 million fixedprice contract to build two prototypes lockheeds yf22 and northrops yf23 powered by new enginesone using pratt whitneys f119 and one using general electrics f120 power plant the air force announced in 1989 that the fullscale development phase would be delayed to allow more time for development of engines and avionics each contractor team reportedly spent over 1 billion in company f unds to develop competing prototypes two yf22s and two yf23s which were flighttested and evaluated in late 1990 on april 23 1991 the air force selected the lockheed teams yf22 design for development as the f22 powered by pratt whitneys new f119 engines former air force secretary donald rice stated that the choice was based on confidence in the ability of the lockheed team and pratt whitney to produce the aircraft and its engine at projected costs he emphasized the importance of the lockheed teams management and production plans and added that the yf22 offered better reliability and maintainability neither design was significantly more maneuverable 1 michael sirak air force f22 raptor stealth fighter reaches fulloperationcapability milestone defense daily december 13 2007 2 the number of companies involved in the f22a program is

has been steadily reduced from the initial goal of 750 aircraft the f22as developmentproduction schedule has also been delayed several times citing budgetary constraints reduced threats in europe and the f15s longer service life as reasons for deferring production thensecretary of defense richard cheney told congress in april 1990 that production of the aircraft could be delayed two years instead of beginning in fy1994 as originally planned with annual production peaking at 48 aircraft in 2001 instead of increasing to 72 by fy1999 as previously planned these 1990 projections of the f22s development and production schedules were further revised later when the development program was extended and the number of prototypes was reduced the defense departments 1993 bottomup review bur

would support three fighter wings in 20wing force structure of 12 active and 8 reservenational guard wings th qdr also recommended reducing the maximum production rate from 48 to 36 planes per year as more affordable rate of production the 2001 qdr did not make specific recommendations on the numbers of f22s to be produced based on the fy2009 presidents budget submission the bush administration hopes to procure 184 f 22as originally conceived of as an air superiority fighter with minimal airtoground attack capability the air force has increasingly emphasized the f 22as potential for airtoground attack over time an for attack was added to the f22 designation in september 2002fa22to signify the planes ability to conduct these types of attacks in december 2005 the air force returned to the f22 designation adding an to the end of the designation f22a letter at the end of military aircrafts alphanumeric designation is used to differentiate significant block upgrades within an aircraft program such as new engines or radar some interpret the air forces addition of an to the end of f22 to mean that the service anticipates there to be an f22b variant on december 12 2005 the

of six aircraft paid for with rdte funds the air force can currently afford to build 184 raptors under current projections 3 any further increases in the cost of the f22a program have to be mitigated by further reducing the number of aircraft produced or by relaxing or eliminating the cost cap funding of the f22a began in the early 1980s as the advanced tactical fighter or tf and procurement

raptors per year this myp will be funded by procurement budgets in fy2007 fy2008 and fy2009 dod currently has plans to procure additional f22s dod had hoped to extend f22 procurement spending through 2010 by incrementally funding the myp but congress objected to this plan f22 critics note that this production profile 20 aircraft per year will increase program costs 18 billion more than the programs cost estimate under the fy2006 plan which would procure four fewer aircraft but at more efficient rate of production4 f22 supporters note that the myp is expected to cost 225 million less than if the final 60 f22s were procured through three single year procurements under the current plan the final lot of raptors will be delivered to the air force in december 2011 but production line shutdown will begin much sooner prior to passage of the fy2009 defense authorization bill dod reported that this process will begin in november 2008 eg tool disposal and environmental cleanup unless decision is made to procure more raptors than currently planned 5 congress provided sufficient funds to keep the f22 production line open until the next administration takes office g8g4g556g344g344g561 lockheed martin initiated the study of radically modified version of the raptor called the fb22 this variant would seek to significantly increase the f22as airtoground capabilities primarily through redesign that would double the aircrafts range and significantly increase the aircrafts internal payload some estimate that the deltawinged fb22 could carry up to 30 of the developmental 250lb small diameter bombs 6 these potential improvements would likely result in some performance tradeoffs such as reduced acceleration and maneuverability although not officially part of the f22a program and still very much in the conceptual phase some air force leaders have expressed enthusiasm for the idea former secretary of the air force james roche reportedly favors the

the current bomber force and followon capability other air force leaders have reportedly shown less enthusiasm in the fb22 concept former air force acquisition chief marvin sambur said that the f22as difficulties would have to be solved before the fb22 could be considered8 also the cost of developing the fb22 are debated some argue that by leveraging the f22a cockpit engines computer systems production methods and materials the fb22 could be produced relatively cheaply others argue that redesigning an aircraft to perform mission it was not originally intended to perform is difficult and usually costly some estimate that developing the airframe could cost up to 1 billion also some question the attractiveness of medium range bomber with relatively small payload representative duncan hunter for example is reported to have commented that it was counterintuitive that our modernization program has on the average encompassed acquisition of aircraft with shorter and shorter legs 9 on april 29 2004 the air force issued request for information rfi about resources or technologies available with the potential to substantially improve air force longrange strike capabilities it is expected that lockheed martin will offer the fb22 as one concept that could satisfy this requirement10 in congressional testimony former air force secretary james roche suggested that up to 150 fb22s could be procured fullrate production could be achieved by fy2011 roche estimated if development funds were committed in fy200411 funds in the f22a program have yet been devoted to the fb22 nor has money been allocated to the bomber program from other sources potential costs and schedule of the fb22 concept are still quite notional how this multirole aircraft would compete withor conversely

force leaders have argued that they require minimum of 381 raptors this disagreement between the office of the secretary of defense osd and the air force appears to have come to head when in june 2008 secretary of defense robert gates asked the air forces top civilian and military leaders to resign in numerous press articles it was reported and confirmed by former secretary of the air force michael wynne that air force leaders reluctance to accept fleet of 184 raptors was the key factor that led to their ouster 12 those nominated to replace secretary wynne and former chief of staff gen michael moseley have expressed more moderate positions than their predecessors on the f22 fleet acting secretary of the air force michael donley has refused to opine on the required number of raptors instead expressing his desire to keep the production line open until the next administration is in place chief of staff gen norton schwartz testified that he would study the issue closely because he believed that 184 raptors was insufficient but that 381 is too high 13 the debate over the number of f22s to be acquired has been driven by perceptions of threat and program cost there is strong consensus among defense professionals that dominating the air is critical advantages for all fielded us forces ground air and sea there is also little debate over the f22s capabilities if it performs as advertized it should be superb air dominance aircraft however as threats from hostile nations have apparently ebbed and as counterinsurgency stability operations and other lowintensity missions have grown many question whether dod needs and can afford such sophisticated aircraft us air superiority can and should be achieved by other more costeffective means they argue as the congressionally mandated budget cap see above and policy decisions by dod reduced the number of f22s to be purchased the air force adopted what it called buytobudget strategy in essence the air force recognized that it could afford only 184 f22s but hoped to purchase more aircraft in the future if production efficiencies could be achieved in march 2004 the general accounting office issued report gao04391 that criticized the buytobudget strategy instead the gao argued the air force should develop business case for the raptor based on capabilities need alternatives and spending constraintsrather than just purchasing the most aircraft that can be afforded air force leaders have argued that 381 f22s are required to populate the services 10 air expeditionary forces aefs the aef is the primary organizational unit that the air force uses to rotate equipment and personnel among training maintenance and operational assignments if the air force does not have enough f22s to rotate among its 10 aefs they argue the raptor force will have to be allocated on an as needed basis this obviates the principal benefit of the aef system which is to provide predictability and stability for airmen others point out that many other assets such as bombers and isr aircraft are too few to be permanently attached to aefs and are instead assigned on an asneeded basis further they argue decisions on how many f22s to be procured should be based on need not on force 12 see for example wynne speaks out tellall interview covers iraq withdrawal nuclear report procurement and more air force times july

of defense robert gatess recent testimony where he remarked that the reality is we are fighting two wars in iraq and afghanistan and the f22 has not performed single mission in either theater15 if the f22 is to be an infrequently used aircraft they argue organizing it outside the aef scheme and using it on an as needed basis would be appropriate on november 2 2007 an f15c eagle brokeapart during training mission and the entire f15 fleet was grounded until the cause could be determined an investigation discovered that the crash was caused by the failure of structure the longeron that holds together the f15 cockpit and fuselage and that longerons in other f15s were suspect the f15 fleet was grounded second time on november 28 when more sensitive test found that the longeron problem was evident in more f15s than previously believed16 some argue that the longeron problem is emblematic of the kinds of challenges and risks of operating an aging fighter fleet and that the air force would be well advised to purchase more than 184 f22s to hedge against the risk of additional f15 failures in hearings on the air forces fy2009 budget request air force leaders testified that due to new estimates of the life of the legacy fighter force the current f22 and jsf procurement plans would likely leave gap of up to 800 fighter aircraft would arise by the year 202417 some question the validity of this projected fighter gap arguing that it strongly influenced by assumptions on threats and whether the united states will fight alone or as part of coalition18 even if such fighter gap does emerge some argue that does not necessarily mean that purchasing additional f22s is the most costeffective way to address the shortcoming new f15s could be purchased some note with more advanced radars and other technology than the f15s currently in the fleet for relatively modest 60 million each19 final point made by f22 proponents is that the f35 has not yet entered fullrate production and that it would be unwise to shut down f22 production until there is confidence that f35 is on track even if it does not appear now that many stealthy fifthgeneration fighters is mandated by the current threat environment it is prudent hedge to keep at least one such production line alive in the event threat projections prove optimistic further once it is shutdown the f22 line will be expensive to reopen if needed the f22 and f35 share many of the same vendors and sub vendors therefore keeping the f22 line open will help protect the f35s industrial base supporters argue 14 william mathews

intense budgetary competition building additional f22s threatens the f35 program rather than lending it support therefore they argue f22 production should be ended as planned because the f35 is more costeffective aircraft they point to john young dods senior acquisition officials remarks that any decision to buy more f22s at the expense of jsf is not good choice for the taxpayer20 additionally f35 proponents note that it takes three years to build the raptor keeping the f22 production line open as hedge against an unexpected crisis does not make sense they argue because it is not possible

ground attack capabilities today the air force describes the raptor as multirole combat aircraft it is pursuing upgrades to the aircrafts ground attack and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr capabilities enhancing the raptors attack capabilities includes increasing the weapons payload from two 1000 lb bombs to eight 250 lb bombs and modifying and improving the aircrafts radar these changes include adding ground movingtarget indicator highresolution synthetic aperture radar and fourthgeneration electronically scanned array modernizing the raptor raises two broad issues are these capabilities needed are they worth the cost in their report gao04391 the gao suggests that the need for the f22as enhanced attack capabilities is unknown because business case for these aircraft have not been made also it does not appear that the air force had produce d an operational requirements document also called capabilities development document that describes what airtoground attack capabilities are required it appears that by making the f22a more of multirole combat aircraft the air force is blurring the distinction between the raptor and the joint strike fighter the jsf is also multirole combat aircraft that is projected to have superior internal payload 5700 lbs vs the f22as 2000 lbs and will also employ an advanced airtoground radar detailed description of how the f22a will improve upon the jsfs attack capabilities and how these aircraft might be used in operational scenarios could prove useful the gao reports that enhancing the raptors atta ck capabilities will cost an additional 117 billion over current budget projections 21 these capabilities will be added and costs incurred through three spirals from 2007 to 2015 air force officials are reported to contest these cost projections saying that these improvements have already been fully budgeted and suggesting that the gao and others are confusing the f22a with the conceptual fb2222 in november 2008

billion and if these efforts were covered by the current production cost cap on the f22a it could mean that the air force could not afford all the aircraft it hopes to build roughly speaking the air force might have to reduce its purchase by approximately 62 aircraft 117 billion 187 million per aircraft air force officials say that upgrading the raptors airtoground capabilities is modernization program and therefore not covered by the production cost cap24 air force officials have also emphasized the f22s potential to execute many of the isr missions that ua vs have performed in support of counter insurgency and lowintensity conflicts25 although the f22 may have effective onboard sensors and the ability to receive additional information from other isr platforms it has limited ability to transmit targeting information to other platforms or command and control c2 assets this restricted communications capability was purposeful desi gn choice intended to make the f22 more elusive to enemy defenses air force officials now wish to reprogram 85 million to accelerate an upgrade to the f22 that would enable this aircraft to more effectively share information with other aircraft26 some fear that adding new capabilities at this relatively late stage in the f22a program could increase costs by complicating the program and stretching out its development resolving instability problems with the f22as advanced avionics has been one of the biggest cost drivers in the development program adding new f eature such as an airtoground radar or new communications capabilities some argue could jeopardize the progress that has been made in the avionics software other concerns focus on the f22s signature quality its stealth if controlling radar and radio emissions was key component of making the f22 elusive to enemy defenses might these modifications reduce the f22s stealth if so are the benefits of these modifications worth the risks finally modernization and acquisition may be in competition for scarce funding dods top acquisition official for example reportedly argued that modernizing the currently fielded f22s should be considered before acquiring any additional raptors beyond the current program 27 g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g21g138g149g142g156g561 generally speaking arguments for foreign military sales tend to focus on advancing us industry supporting allied

oftdelayed schedule and dwindling budget leave little time or resources to address problems if they emerge examples of potential problems to be guarded against include technical problems and budget shortfalls leaders of both the air force and the raptors manufacturer lockheed martin corp have expressed confidence that the f22as development problems have been solved that the aircrafts design is sound and that modernization should go smoothly former air force acquisition chief marvin sambur for example reported that the f22as longstanding pr oblems with avionics software stability had been

these faulty titanium forgings will require increased inspections during the raptors 8000 hour lifetimes to avoid catastrophic failures 37 the air force the office of the secretary of defense osd and the gao have frequently differed in their estimates of the f22a budget over the course of the program the air force estimates have tended to be lower the gaos higher and osds in between38 which estimates are more accurate why do they differ one difference between the estimates is that the air force tends to emphasize future savings that it hopes to reap for example in june 2000 air force officials testified that the programs cost was estimated to be 1 billion above the spending cap placed on the production phase however they had identified 21 billion in future cost reductions they hoped to reap should future savings be included in budget estimates in subsequent report the gao cast doubt on the air forces cost saving claims the gao wrote that about one half of the cost reductions identified had not been implemented and that the air force may not be able to achieve many of these reductions because they depend on uncertain actions by either dod or congress 39 in july

would have resulted in increased costs and serious erosion of the supplier base the administrations fy2001 budget requested 39 billion for the f22a program 25 billion for procurement of ten lrip aircraft and 15 billion in rd funding in their reports issued in may and june 2000 the congressional defense oversight committees recommended authorization and appropriation of funds equal to the administrations request for both procurement and rd while they approved the administrations request for f22a funding the defense oversight committees expressed marked concern over the aircrafts testing program house appropriators noted that the f22a flight test program continues to fall short of air force projections for instance the program lost nine flight test months between november 1999 and march 2000 the committee was particularly concerned about slips in fatigue and static testing both of which are more than year behind schedule to emphasize the extent of their concerns the house appropriations committee restated the criteria established in pl 10679 which prohibits award of low rate production contract for the f22a until 1 first flight of an f22a aircraft incorporating block 30 software 2 certification by the secretary of defense that all defense acquisition board exit criteria for award of low rate production has been met and 3 submission of report by the director of operational test and evaluation assessing the adequacy of the testing to date house appropriators were also concerned that the air force may try to contain f22a program cost increases by further reductions in the test program therefore the house appropriations committee proposed replacing existing individu statutory budget caps on f22a development and production with single overall cap for the entire program the senate armed services committee also expressed concern that the air force might reduce testing to accommodate growing program costs to ensure adequate testing is accomplished senate authorizers included provision that would increase the f22a emd cost cap by 1 the fy2001 defense appropriations conference report hrept 106754 fully funded the administrations request for f22a
