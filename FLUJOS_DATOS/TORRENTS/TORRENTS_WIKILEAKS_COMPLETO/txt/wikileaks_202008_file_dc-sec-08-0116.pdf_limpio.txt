international starbucks site firebombed in london an attack was staged against starbucks coff ee shop on whitechapel roa d london between 2330 0000hrs on the night of 1213 january 2009 when three people threw br icks to smash the windows before hurling petrol bomb into the shop reports suggest that noone was hur t in the attack and there were customers in the premises which had already closed for the night however the manager was reportedly trapped in the offi ce at the time of the attack and saw the intruders smashing their way into the premises on the cctv and d to stay hidden reportedly then escaping through the fire escape at the back to raise the alarm the fire damaged the carpet tables and several glass panels but as the fire brigade were called early firef ighters managed to prevent flames sp reading to the rest of the building scotland yard have stated that one line of inquiry was that the incident was racial ly motivated followed by the fighting in gaza and it was carried out by the asian ouths wearing dark tops that may have been seen outside fast food restaurant earlier police have also stated that just four hours earlier possi bly the same gang of youths

metro supermarket in stepneys commercial road only mile away was ta rgeted at the weekend when several windows were smashed and the words kill jews were daubed in paint assessment the attacks are being seen as part of series of hate incidents in wh itechapel which have included anti semitic graffiti believed to be linked to protests over israels operations in gaza the incident at starbucks followed on from th action on 10 january 2009 against the kennington starbucks shop when police steel barricade was thrown through the store window by propalestinian supporters enroute to the isr aeli

george galloway mp who has also r ecently called on supporters to go to shopping centers and shut down israels shops in what was believed to be reference to retail ers with links to israel the motive behind targeting starbucks apart from the fact it is us company is that the companys ceo chairman and president howard schultz is jewish and has received numerous awards from the israeli state over the years for his proisrae li stance and for jewish entrepreneurship propalestinian activists have voiced criticism of starbucks for years because they clai m that schultz donates money to the israeli military the targeting of certain shops has even reached the exte nt of activists vandalizing american named shops such as the attack against leathe r clothing retailer t op gun in kensington on 10 january 2009 this shop is owned by an iranian and had its window s smashed and progaza graffiti sprayed on its walls because of its perceived links to the usa the action was posted on activist comm unications with the signature of smash the war machine it is possible that due to recent gathering of pacifist anar chists in edinburgh in november 2008 praising the actions of smash edo and calling

have been prompted by the israeli offensive in gaza and these are considered to be of relevan ce as they indicate the potential for any protest to see direct action as it may be hijacked by extreme elements assaul ts against jews and arson attacks on jewish congregations have taken place in france sweden and the uk among others in the uk the community security trust jewish defense group said it had seen rise in antisemitic incidents since the start of israels offensive against hamas in gaza the gr oup said it had recorded twenty to twentyfive incidents across the country in th past two weeks

this reason activists ar expected to continue to hold vigils and protes ts outside the israeli embassy in kensington london as well as against companies activis ts perceive to have lin ks to israel until ceasefire has been announced to resolve the conflict it is possible that extremist elements responsible for antisemitic violence in london in recent days may attempt to hijack future protests
