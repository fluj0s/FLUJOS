on triballyowned lands has always been an uneasy one particularly when the question of states ability to levy taxes on such lands arises the constitution vests the federal government with exclusive power with respect to indian tribes1 and the supreme court has held that as corollary of this authority and in recognition of the sovereignt retained by indian tribes even after formation of the united states indian tribes and individuals generally are exempt from state taxation within their own territory2 consequently while congress can allow states to tax indians within reserv ation land this congressional in tent must be expressed in unmistakably clear terms in order to be recognized by the courts3 the facts of sherrill some dispute exists as to when the oneida reservation in new

congress ratified the treaty of canandaigua4 which included promise by the fe deral government that the said reservation shall remain thei rs until they choose to sell the same to the people of the united states who have the right to purchase 5 emphasis added twenty years later new york began pressuring the tribes residing within the states borders including the oneidas to remove to the western territori and many did so the oneidas sold much of their reservation lands to new york state and to othe r nontribalmembers significantly these purchasers bought the land without the consent of the federal government despite the indian nonintercourse acts require ment that such consent be obtained before purchasing tribal land6 this practice of removal in essence paying tribes to move west picked up steam in other states and by the 1830s it was the po licy of the federal gove rnment to encourage eastern tribes to exchange their land for lands set aside in the west7 in order to facilitate the removal of the indians still rema ining in new york at the time the united states entered into the treaty of buffalo creek with the various new york tribes in 1838 congress ratified the treaty8 in which the approximately 5000 remaining oneidas agreed to remove tokansas as soon as they can make satisfactory rrangements with the government of the state of new york fo r the purchase of their lands in oneida9 the remaining oneidas never remove d to kansas and the last 150 years have been dotted with frequent litigation over the validity of the oneida sales and the rights of the oneidas visa vis the original reservation land10 in 1985 the supreme court ruled that the oneidas could recover damages against several counties for viol ating the oneidas aboriginal ri ghts to land unlawfully conveyed to and occupied by those counties11 the court specifically left open the question however of whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day

city of sherrill 145 fsupp2d 226 ndny 2001 16 second circuit opinion 337 f3d at 158 on this second point however the court noted that when confronted with the question of congresss intent to disestablish reservation or diminish reservation land the supreme court has looked to legislative history and the circumstances surrounding the treaty in question id at 159160 17 id at 162new york reportedly the settlement agreements would allow these tribes to build casinos in the catskill mountains13 the particular dispute in sherrill began in the 1990s when the oneidas started buying back parcels of former reservation land several in particular located in sherrill on two of these properties the sherrill prope rties the oneidas operated gas station convenience store and textile facility the oneidas refused to pay property taxes or to collect sales taxes related to the sherrill prope rties arguing that the properties are within their reservation and so are free from state and municipal taxation14 following the oneidas refusal to pay taxes sherrill offered some of the properties at tax sales and instituted eviction proceedings the lower court rulings and possible ramifications the tribal and municipal par ties brought their dispute to court the essential question being did the oneidas land re gain its reservation status when it was repurchased by the oneidas in light of the fact that the fede ral government never pproved the original sale that alienated the land from the oneidas the district court answered this question in the affirmative15 and the municipal parties appeal ed to the second circuit court of appeals the major question according to the second circuit was whether the oneida reservation had been explicitly disestablished by congress the municipal parties pointed to the aforementioned treaty of buffa creek as evincing congresss intent to disestablish the oneida reservation in ex amining this argument the court used two wellsettled principles for interpreting indian treaties 1 indian treaties are to be construed liberally in favor of the indians and ambiguous terms are to be interp reted to their benefit and 2 congressional inte nt to abrogate indian treaty rights can only be found with the help of explicit statutory lang uage to that effect16 with these principles in mind the second circuit examined the buffalo creek treaty the court found that while certain articles of the treaty implicitly disestablished various reservations with lang uage evincing an intent that the tribes in question would remove the oneidas conditioned their rem oval on future arrangements between the oneidas and the governor of new york becau these agreements were never made the court concluded the reserva tion was never disestablished17 as reservation land then it could not be alienated wit hout express approval of the fe deral government of whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22107crs4 18 id at 157 19 317 fsupp2d 128 ndny

inconsistent with federal law the tribe retains aboriginal indian title to the land and if the tribe at some point buys the land back the land reverts to its former reservation status largely free from state taxation18 potential ramifications of th second circuits holding cayuga indian nation while the second circuits holding wa s limited to taxation th rationale behind that holding that indian tribes can reacquire former tribal lands and thereby reestablish the reservation status of such lands d potentially broad consequences for state regulation of tribal activities in other areas most notably indian gaming this was evidenced by the federal district court ruling in cayuga indian nation of new york v village of union springs 19 in cayuga indian nation the tribe made an argument nearly identical to that put forward by the oneidas like the oneidas much of the cayugas treaty land had been sold to the state of new york without the federal governments pe rmission in the late eighteenth and early nineteen th centuries in 2003 the cayugas reacquired some of that land and went ahead with plans to build bingo hall on the property the village of union springs attempted to halt construc tion pursuant to the citys zoning and construction ordinances while the tribe argued that the land is part of the tribes reservation and therefore the i ndian gaming regulatory act igra20 not municipal regulation governs gamblin g facilities on the land rely ing largely on the second circuits rationale with respect to the oneidas the district court held that the cayugas title to the land in question c ould only have been legally divested by congress because that never happened the reservation never ceased to exist and the tribes reestablished the reservation status of the land when they repurchased it21 the court agreed with the tribe that the bingo hall project was governed by igra which preempts state and local attempts to regulate gaming on indian lands22 the supreme courts holding the supreme court approached the facts before it in sherrill from an entirely different angle from the lower courts or either of the parties indeed as the court wrote we resolve this case on considerations not discretely identified in the parties briefs23 as mentioned above in 1985 the supreme court found that while the oneidas were entitled to damages for the illegal conveyance nd occupation of lands to which they heldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22107crs5 24 oneida county v oneida indian nation 470 us 226 253 note 27 1985 25 sherrill slip op at 1314 the court cast the oneidas

at 19 30 id at 20aboriginal title the cour t explicitly left open the question of whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day oneida indians24 the court viewed the oneidas claims in sherrill as chance to answer this question in other words this case was not about the status of the land as the second circuit thought but rather the type of remedy due to the oneidas for the wrong ful occupation of that land the court then framed the oneidas claim thusly the oneida nation seeks declaratory and injunctive relief recognizing its present and future sovereign immunity from local taxation on parcels of land the tribe purchased in the open market properties that had been subject to state and cal taxation for generations25 recasting the oneidas claim as one for re dress of past wrong the court held that three doctrines each related to the passa ge of time since the wrong was committed prevent the oneidas from obtaining the redress they seek ie to be free from state and local taxation first the majority invoked the doctrine of laches doctrine focused on one sides inaction and the others legitimate reliance which bars longdormant claims for equitable relief26 the court noted that laches barred the oneidas claim not only because of the passage of time between th wrong committed and the claim for relief but also because of the intervening change in the value and character of the land in question27 the court next ruled that regardless of whether the original conveyance was lawful or not the oneidas had acquiesced over the last 200 years in the possession of the lands by other parties creating reasonable ex pectations among surrounding communities regarding who has the right to exercise regulatory control over the lands in question consequently the court ruled parcelbyparcel revival of their sovereign status given the extraordinary passage of time would di shonor the historic wisdom of repose28 finally the majority cited the doctrine of impracticality as bar to the oneidas claim holding that allowing the oneidas to unilaterally reassert regulatory control over former reservation lands simp ly by repurchasing them would have disruptive practical consequences29 the court noted that both the city of sherrill and oneida county are today overwhelmingly populated by nonindians and that ruling in favor of the oneidas would allow tribes to unilaterally create checkerboard of alternating state and tribal jurisdiction in new york state30 the court then pointed out that congress had considered the practical difficulties of such an arrangement and for that reason hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22107crs6 31 see 25 usc 465 32 sherrill slip op at 21 33 id at 20 in his dissent justice stevens intimat ed that the

procedure the court found that is the onei das proper avenue for acquiring lands that will be free from state and local taxation32 conclusion while the supreme court di d not directly address cayuga indian nation the majoritys opinion leaves little doubt that the court was looking beyond state and municipal taxation to questions of general regulatory authority as the court put it if the oneidas may unilaterally reassert sove reign control and remove these parcels from the local tax rolls little would prevent the tribe from initiating new generation of litigation to free the parcels from local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners in the area33 the court indicated the broad reach of its rationale at the very beginning of its opinion given the longstanding distinctly non indian character of the area and its inhabitants the regulatory authority c onstantly exercised by new york state and its counties and towns and the onei das long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the ited states we hold that the tribe cannot unilaterally revive its ancient sovereignty in whole or in part over the parcels at issue the oneidas long ago reli nquished the reins of government and cannot regain them through openmark et purchases from current titleholders34 it is unlikely that cayuga indian nation or any other opinion like it could stand against the weight of the courts strong nd clear direction with respect to new york tribes attempts to reassert sovereignty over former tribal lands by merely purchasing them on the open market it does not appear that the ruling will have any effect on the various claims for monetary compensation springing from the supreme courts 1985 ruling the court seemed concerned only with tribal attempts to shield newly acquired lands from state regulatory authority
