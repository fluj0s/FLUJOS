influences extend the realm of human suffering they foster an environm ent for extremism and the drive to acquire asymmetric capabilities and weapons of mass destruction wmd the threats to peace and stability are numerous complex oftentimes linked and sometimes aggravated by natural disaster the spectrum of likely operations describes need for arsof in joint combined and multinational formations for variety of missionsfrom humanitarian assistance to major theater wars including conflicts involving the potential use of wmd arsof are responsive and dominant at every point on the spectrum they provide to the nation an array of deployable agile versatile lethal survivable and sustainable formations which are affordab and capable of rapidly reversing the conditions of human suffering and decisively resolving conflicts arsof in support of the war on terrorism 11 the us military is engaged in one of the most challenging periods in its history arsof are and will be for the near future continuously engaged against terrorists whose goal is the destruction of american freedoms and the american way of life 12 united states special operations command usso com is the lead combatant

global infor mational and geographic operational environment by conducting so to influence deter locate isolate and stroy terrorists and their support systems arsofs strategic imperatives are z fight the wot z maintain force readiness z transform for the future 14 arsof must face four persistent and emerging challenges in this new more uncertain era often hard boundaries distinguish one challenge from another indeed the most dangerous circumstances are those where arsof face or will face multiple challenges simultaneously these challenges may be z traditional challenges posed largely by states employing legacy and advanced military capabilities and recognizable military forces in longestablished wellknown forms of military competition and conflict z irregular challenges arising from the adoption or employment of unconventional thods by state and nonstate actors to counter stronger state opponents such as terrorism insurgency or civil war z catastrophic challenges involving the surreptitious acquisition possession and possible terrorist or rogue employment of wmd or methods that produce wmdlike effects z disruptive future challenges emanating from competitors developing possessing and employing breakthrough technological capabilities intended to supplant arsof advantages in specific operational domains 15 arsof are key enabler in the wot by conducting so which obtain actionable intelligence such intelligence assists commanders in determining the appropriate force package and in preparing the force to destroy terrorist networks the force could be unilate ral special operations forces sof sof combined with surrogate forces or sof combined with joint conventional forces arsof provide joint interag ency intergovernmental and multinational jiim forces with organized trained and equipped elemen ts these elements can operate in hostile denied or sensitive environments to collect monitor or verify information of strategic or operational significance often requiring lowvisibility techniques the r esults of these activities may be fed directly to commander or country team or may be input into the intelligence process for processing analysis and dissemination to military and other government agencies ogas range of military operations 16 the united states employs arsof capabilities at ho and abroad in support of us national security goals in variety of operations these operations vary in size purpose and combat intens ity within range of military operations these operations extend from military engagement security cooperation and deterrence to lesser contingency operations and if necessary major operations and campaig ns figure 11 page 13 use of arsof capabilities in military engagement security cooperation and deterrence activities helps shape the operational environment and keep the daytoday tensions between nations or groups below the threshold of armed conflict while maintaining us global influence many of the missions associated with lesser contingencies such as logistics support and foreign hum anitarian assistance fha do not require combat but others such as oper ation restore hope in somalia can be extremely dangerous and require significant effort to protect us forces while accomplishing the mission individual major operations and campaigns often contribute to larger longterm effortfor example operation enduring freedom as part of the wot the nature of the security environment is such that arsof are often engaged in several types of joint operations simultaneously overview 20 september 2006 fm 305 13 figure 11 range of military operations global nature of operations 17 arsof have global reach and are capable of enga ging threats and influencing potential adversaries with variety of capabilities however global reach and influence are not just the purview of nationstates globalization and emerging technologies allow small gr oups to use asymmetric approaches to include criminal activity terrorism or armed aggression on transnational scale with relative ease and with little cost 18 adversaries place greater emphasis on developing cap abilities to threaten the united states directly and indirectly increased interdependence of national economies and rapid movement of information around the world create significant challenges in the defense of us interests identifying potential threats nation s and nonstate actors operating independently or in loose coalitions determining their intent and determining the best course of action coa to counter their actions are interagency and multin ational challenges for the united states 19 the elusive nature of adversaries and the everinc reasing speed of global communications and the media demand greater adaptability and networking from arsof particularly communications and intelligen ce resources consequently sof conduct some operations on global not theater scale for example so in the wot as part of the us security strategy to prevent direct or indirect attacks on the us homeland and other national interests these operations are conduc ted in depth focusing on the threat source across geographical regions including forward regions pproaches and the homeland the divisions among the three regions are not absolute and may overlap or shift depending on the situation and the threat military engagement security cooperation and deterrence 110 these ongoing and specialized activities establish shape maintain and refine relations with other nations and domestic civil authoritiesfor example state governors or local law enforcement security cooperation involves all dod interactions with fo reign defense establishments to build defense relationships that promote specific us security in terests develop allied and friendly military capabilities for selfdefense and multinational operations and provide arsof with peacetime and contingency access to host nation hn 111 joint actions such as nation assistance are applied to meet military engagement and security cooperation objectives nation assistance may include foreign internal defense fid secu rity assistance and humanitarian and civic assistance antiterror ism dod support to counterdrug operations showof force operations and arms control arsofs role duri ng military engagement in support of the wot is to develop an unconventional warfare uw network by developing indige nous or surrogate capabilities this allows capable hn forces the ability to defeat terrorist threats within their sovereign borders unilaterally or in conjunction with arsof security cooperation is key element of global and theater shaping operations and is pillar of wmd nonproliferation note military engagement occurs as part of secur ity cooperation but also extends to interaction with domestic civilian authorities chapter 1 14 fm 305 20 september 2006 lesser contingency operations 112 arsof are often used to respond to crisis that does not require largescale combat operations to resolve lesser contingency operation can be single smallscale limitedduration operation or significant part of major operation of extended duration involving combat the associated general strategic and operational objectives are to protect us interests and to prevent surprise attack or further conflict lesser contingency operation in response to crisis includes all of those operations for wh ich joint operation planning process is required and contingency or crisis plan is developed the l evel of complexity duration and resources depends on the circumstances included are operations to ensure the safety of american citizens and us interests while maintaining and improving us ability to operate with multinational partners in deterring the hostile ambitions of potential aggressors many of th operations involve combination of conventio nal and unconventional forces and capabilities in close cooperation with ogas and nongovernmental organizations ngos crisis may prompt the conduct of fha logi stics support noncombatant evacuation operations neos peace operations strikes raids or recovery operations major operations and campaigns 113 when required to achieve national strategic objectives or to protect national interests the us national leadership may decide to conduct major operation or campaign involving largescale combat placing the united states in wartime state in such cases the general goal is to prevail against the enemy as quickly as possible to conclude hostilities and to establish conditions favorable to the hn and the united states and its multinational partners such operations typically consist of multiple phases note some specific lesser contingencies may not involve largescale combat but they could be considered major operations or campaigns depending on their scale and duration types of military operations 114 army doctrine addresses the range of full spectrum operations across the spectrum of conflict as described in fm 1 the army army commanders at all echelons may combine different types of operations simultaneously and sequentially to accomplish missions for each mission the joint force commander j fc and army component commander determine the emphasis army forces place on each type of operation figure 12 figure 12 types of military operations overview 20 september 2006 fm 305 15 army full spectrum operations 115 missions in any environment require arsof to be pr epared to conduct any co mbination of offensive defensive stability and civil support operations described below z offensive operations destroy or defeat an enemy their purpose is to impose us will on the enemy and to achieve decisive victory z defensive operations defeat an enemy attack buy time economize forces or develop conditions favorable for offensive operations defensive operations alone normally cannot achieve decision z stability operations promote and protect us national interests by influencing the threat political and information dimensions of the operational environment through combination of peacetime developmental cooperative activities and coercive actions in response to crises arsof can also be employed to assist civil authorities foreign or domestic in responding to crises and in relieving suffering z civil support operations address the consequences of manmade or natural accidents and incidents beyond the capabilities of civilian authorities army forces do not conduct stability operations within the united statesunder us law the federal and state governments are responsible for those tasks instead army forces conduct civil support operations when requested providing army expertise and capabilities to lead agency authorities 116 when conducting full spectrum operations as part of an overseas joint campaign commanders combine and sequence offensive defensive and stability operations to accomplish the mission the j fc and the so component commander for particular mission determine the emphasis arsof place on each type of operation throughout the campaign offensive defensive and stability operations oc cur simultaneously as missions change from promoting peace to deterring war and from resolving conflict to war itself the combinations of and transitions between these operations require skillful assessment planning preparation and execution within the united states and its territories army forces support homeland security operations homeland security has two components the first component is hom eland defense if the united states comes under direct attack or is threatened by hostile armed forces army forces under joint command conduct offensive and defensive operations as part of homeland defense the other component is civil support which is the fourth type of army operation operations designed to accomplish more than one strategic purpose may be executed sequentially or simultaneously joint doctri ne describes the employment of us forces in joint operations arsof commanders are either subordinate to jfc or are designated as jfc 117 arsof can support the jfc at all levels z strategic the strategic level concerns the broadest aspects of national and theater policy decisions at this level reflect national and multinational goals integrate all the instruments of national power provide forces and determine cons traints on their use the president or the secdef and the gccs determine the strategicnational and strategictheater objectives and the manner of use of military means to achieve them the president or the secdef and the gccs may directly or indirectly through subordinate commanders empl oy arsof in pursuit of these objectives z operational the operational level focuses on theater campaigns and major operations jfcs determine operational objectives that lead to the attainment of strategictheater objectives these objectives are attained through the design organization and cond uct of campaigns and major operations that in turn guide tactical events gcc subordinate unified command commander joint task force cjtf commander service component commander or functional component commander may employ arsof as part of joint force to attain these operational objectives z tactical the tactical level focuses on battles and engagements decisions at this level apply combat power to create advantages while in co ntact with or close to the enemy arsof may support tactical actions offense defense an d stability actions designed to have significant effect in attaining operational objectives tactical actions may directly attain tactical operational and strategic objectives simultaneously chapter 1 16 fm 305 20 september 2006 war 118 war involves regular and irregular forces in series of connected battles and campaigns to achieve vital national tribal or ethnic objectives war may be limited with some selfimposed restraints on resources or objectives it may also be general with the total resources of nation or nations empl oyed and the survival of the nation at stake 119 arsof can support jfc in war thro ugh the conduct of variety of offensive defensive and stability actions these actions may either directly accomplish jfc objectives or indirectly attain these objectives through the directed pport to other subordinate forces of the jfc principles of war 120 so missions may require unorthodox approaches but these approaches do not negate the nine traditional principles of war rather they place different emphasis on their combination or relative importance in some so missions surprise achieve d through speed stealth audacity deception and new tactics or techniques can be far more effective and efficient than traditional conventional tactics based on massed firepower and tactical maneuvers the following discussion of the principles of war highlights their application to arsof 121 objective direct every military operation toward clearly defined decisive and attainable objective arsof objectives are as much political economic and informational as they are military in nature arsof planners must avoid adding secondary objective by balanc ing risks versus gain they must have clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of arsof the addition of objectives erodes the definition and decisiveness of the primary objective 122 offensive seize retain and exploit the initiative arsof are inherently offensive in nature because they seek to strike or engage the enemy to compel deter or counter enemy actions the strike or engagement conducted by arsof may take place alongside or by effect of surrogate force this force may be one previously trained or currently being trained by arsof civil affairs op erations cao exploit the initiative by gaining the support of the civilians in the area of operations ao 123 massconcentrate the effects of combat power at the decisive place and time commanders mass the effects of overwhelming combat power at the decisi ve time and place to overwhelm the enemy or to gain control of the situation arsof centrate the effects of combat power at critical times and discriminate selected targets to produce decisive results that accomplish the commanders objectives 124 economy of force allocate minimum essential combat power to secondary efforts and employ all combat power available in th most effective way possible arsof are an essential economy of force when military objectives are subordinate to political economic and informational objectives 125 maneuver place the enemy in disadvantageous position through the flexible application of combat power arsof conduct maneuvers in the traditional sense on strategic and operational environments arsof possess tremendous capability to gain position of advantage for the gcc particularly when applying decisive combat power in the enemys secure operating environment 126 unity of command ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander for every objective theater special operations command tsoc commander s under the cocom of the gcc can either tailor the c2 architecture for arsof operations under the dir ect control of the tsoc or recommend subordinate joint force command relationships to ensure unity of effort of sof psyop and ca forces and staff are not generally under operational control opcon of the tsoc therefore integration synchr onization and unity of effort for these forces are incumbent upon commanders and staffs at every level 127 security never permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage arsof can provide security to the jfc by denying the enemy the ability to use his expected advantages arsof provide security through various intelligencecollection methods force protection and force app lications 128 surprise strike the enemy at time and place or in manner for which he is unprepared arsof can deceive the enemy inhibit his decision making or restrict his capability to react to the commanders operations or campaign overview 20 september 2006 fm 305 17 129 simplicity prepare clear uncomplicated plans and concise orders to ensure thorough understanding arsof use unorthodox and sophisticated methods and equipment the plans and procedures the force employs must be simple and direct to facilitate understanding to withstand the stre ss of operational environments and to allow for rapid adaptation to changing situations other principles 130 other principles to consider are restraint perseverance and legitimacy these principles are discussed in the following paragraphs 131 restraint the purpose of restraint is to limit collateral damage and to prevent the unnecessary or unlawful use of force single act could cause significant military and political consequences therefo re judicious use of force is necessary restraint requires the careful and disciplined balancing of the need for security the conduct of military operations and the national strategic end state for example the exposur of intelligencegathering activities such as interrogation of detainees and prisoners of war could have significant political and military repercussions and therefore should be conducted with sound jud gment excessive force antagonizes those parties involved thereby damaging the legitimacy of the organizatio n that uses the force and potentially enhanc ing the legitimacy of the opposing party 132 arsof commanders at all levels must take proac tive steps to ensure their personnel are properly trained in the rules of engagement roe and are quickly informed of any changes failure to understand and comply with established roe can result in fratricide mission failure or national embarrassment roe in some operations may be more restrictive and detaile d when compared to roe for largescale combat to address national policy concerns but they should always be consistent with the inherent right of self defense roe should be unclassified if possible and widely disseminated 133 restraint is best achieved when roe issued at the beginning of an operation address most anticipated situations that may arise roe should be consistently reviewed and revised as necessary additionally roe should be carefully scrutinized to ensure that the lives and health of military personnel involved in jo int operations are not needlessly endangered in multinational operations use of force may be dictated by coalition or allied force roe 134 commanders at all levels must take proactive step s to ensure an understanding of roe and ways to influence changes to them since the domestic law of some nations may be more restrictive concerning the use of force than permitted under coalition or allied force roe commanders must be aware of n ational restrictions imposed on force participants 135 perseverance the purpose of perseverance is to ensure the commitment necessary to attain the national strategic end state measured protracted arsof military operations must be prepared for in pursuit of the national strategic end state some join t operations may require years to reach the termination criteria the underlying causes of the crisis may be usive making the achievement of decisive resolution difficult the patient resolute and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives is of ten requirement for success this effort frequently involves diplomatic economic and informational measures to supplement military efforts 136 legitimacy the purpose of legitimacy is to develop and maintain the will necessary to attain the national strategic end state legitimacy is based on the legality morality and rightness of the actions undertaken as well as the will of the us public to support the actions legitimacy is frequently decisive element the perception of legitimacy by the us public is strengthened if obvious national or hum anitarian interests are at stake and american lives are not being needlessly or carele ssly placed at risk other interested audiences may include foreign nations civil populations in the ao and participating forces 137 committed arsof must sustain the legitimacy of the operation and of the host government where applicable security actions must be balanced with legitimacy concerns all actions must be considered in the light of potentially competing strategic and tactical requirements and must exhibit fairness in dealing with competing factions where appropriate legitimacy may depend on adherence to objectiv agreed to by the international community ensuring the action is appropriate to the situation and fairness in dealing chapter 1 18 fm 305 20 september 2006 with various factions restricting the use of force re structuring the types of forces employed and ensuring the disciplined conduct of the forces involved may reinforce legitimacy combat power 138 combat power is the ability of army forces to fi ght and win it underlies success in all operations with or without lethal force combat power is the total means of destructive or disruptive force or b oth that military unit or formation can apply against the adversary at given time 139 the elements of combat power are warfighting functions tied together by leadership figure 13 they are the means by which commander visualizes describes and directs the generation and employment of combat power leadership is the least tangible and most dynamic element of combat power confident audacious and competen t arsof leadership focuses the other elements of combat power it serves as the catalyst that creates conditions for ccess arsof leaders inspire soldiers to succeed they provide purpose direction and motivation in all operations leadership is crucial it often make s the difference between success and failure particularly in small units figure 13 elements of combat power 140 warfighting function is group of tasks and systems people organizations information and processes united by common purpose that arso f commanders use to accomplish missions and training objectives the warfighting functions are z movement and maneuver the related tasks and systems that move forces to achieve position of advantage in relation to the enemy this

general engineering 141 arsof commanders use combat power to meet constantly changing requirements and to defeat an enemy defeating an enemy requires increasing the disparity between friendly and enemy forces by reducing enemy combat power arsof commanders accomplish this objective by synchronizing the elements of friendly force combat power to create overwhelming effects at the decisive time and place focused combat power ensures success and denies an enemy any chance to maintain coherent resistance massed effects created by synchronizing the elements of combat power are the surest means of limiting friendly casualties and swiftly ending campaign or operation nature of special operations warfare 142 the nature of so warfare is characterized by num ber of factors these factors described in the following paragraphs apply to arsof across the range of military operations preemption 143 arsof can preempt the enemy by neutralizing the enemys capabilities before the fight either directly or in support of conventional forces thro ugh z fid and uw efforts to build indigenous defense and intelligence capabilities z psyop directed at the enemys leadership armed forces and populace z civilmilitary operations cmo in areas brought under friendly control z cp activities to slow or inhibit development of capability z direct action da missions against the enemys critical operational or strategic targets z counterterrorist operations note deployed arsof often provide the gcc or subordinate jfc with firsthand information on local population perspectives intentions and other information dislocation 144 arsof can dislocate the enemy force from chosen positions either by forcing it to move from these positions or by rendering its strength useless or irrelevant to the fight da missions may force the enemy to reposition combat forces away from the main battle area to protect lines of communications and ther vulnerable areas psyop as part of io may support deception operations that will cause the enemy to deploy in manner favorable to friendly forces arsof possess the capabilities to organize and d irect large indigenous forces that cause the enemy to spread its forces thin thr ough uw or to assist an hn in creating military shield through fid behind which ogas can operate to remove the causes of insurgency disruption 145 arsof can disrupt the enemy through attacks against strategic and operat ional targets and centers of gravity cogs possibly precluding the enemy from conducting successful countermoves arsof can disrupt the enemy through z special reconnaissance sr support of operational actions by conventional forces z da strikes against critical operational targets z io to disrupt enemy decision makers z psyop directed at civilian and military leaders military forces and the enemy populationas well as an enemys political economic or military allies chapter 1 110 fm 305 20 september 2006 146 indigenous forces trained through uw operations can attack an ene my directly thus disrupting its operations when employed arsof seek to avoid enemy strengths and to create and attack enemy vulnerabilities exploitation 147 arsof can provide the jfc multiple means to attack the enemys will to resist exploiting psychological vulnerabilities can demoralize enemy troops weaken the resolve of enemy leaders separate the civilian population of an enemy nation from its leadership and reduce or eliminate any external source of support da and uw can create the impression that too many forces exist for the enemy t counter effectively with safe areas and enemy forces in rear areas subject to attack at any time enemy morale can be significantly weakened main effort 148 the sof joint task force jtf commander designates main effort for every operation the activity unit or area determined by the commanders constitutes the most important task at the time as the situation develops the commander should be prepared to change main effort to exploit opportunities or to handle crises as they arise generally the main effort should be aimed at some critical enemy vulnerability object or characteristic that if attacked will contribute most directly to accomplishing the mission intelligence 149 arsof require timely responsive and accurate intelligence support to overcome their relative lack of size and firepower initially arsof commanders use intelligence to find enemy weaknesses or vulnerabilities and to avoid enemy strengths perfect intelligence is rarely obtainable but adequa timely intelligence is prerequisite for successful operations l eaders must be able to act with lessthanperfect intelligence decentralization 150 although arsof personnel must be included in centralized planning at the ccdr and subordinate jfc levels successful arsof require decentralized planning and execution for individual missions independent judgment and effective coordination by arsof lead ers at every echelon are vital to successful so initiative 151 arsof encourage the ability and willingness to make independent timecritical decisions using all available information and guidance presented in the higher hqs commanders intent arsof leaders foster an environment that encourages trust freedom of action and initiative in subordinates successful missions result from subordinate leaders at all echelons exercising disciplined initiative within the commanders intent to accomplish missions special operations oper ational mission criteria 152 the employment of arsof in support of the joint force campaign or operation plan oplan is facilitated by five basic criteria these criteria provide guidelines for conventional and arsof commanders and planners to use when considering the employment of arsof 153 the following set of five basic operational mission criteria has evolved to provide clear guidance to commanders for planning and executing arsof see joint publication jp 3052 joint tactics techniques and procedures for special operations targeting and mission planning z is the mission appropriate arsof should be used to achieve effects that require arsofs unique skills and capabilities if the effects do not require those skills and capabilities arsof should not be assigned arsof should not be used as substitute for other forces overview 20 september 2006 fm 305 111 z does the mission support the campaign plan if the mission does not support the jfcs campaign or major oplan more appropriate missions available for arsof should be considered instead z is the mission operationally feasible arsof are not structured for attrition or forceonforce warfare and should not be assigned missions beyond their capabilities arsof commanders and their staffs must consider the vulnerability of arsof units to larger more heavily armed or mobile forces particularly in hostile territory z are required resources available for the mission some arsof missions require support from other forces for success support involves aiding protecting complementing and staining employed arsof support can include airlift intelligence communications io medical logistics space weather and numerous other types of support altho ugh target may be vulnerable to arsof deficiencies in supportability may affect the likelihood for success or may entirely invalidate the feasibility of employing arsof z will the outcome of the mission justify the risk arsof have highvalue and limited resources commanders must make sure the benefits of successful mission execution are measurable and in balance with the risks inherent in the mission assessment some operations that arsof can execute make only marginal contribution to the jfc campaign plan and present great risk to personnel and materiel commanders should recognize the highvalue and limited resources of arsof risk management considers not only the potential loss of arsof units and equipment but also the risk of adverse effects on us diplomatic and political interests if the mission fails risk assessment consists of the first two steps of the risk management processidentify hazards and assess hazards arsof capabilities 154 the unique capabilities of arsof are function of the quality of arsof soldiers the training and education of those soldiers and the mission profiles the soldiers must execute the competitive arsof selection process coupled with technological traini ng and education produces an arsof soldier who is adaptable mature innovative culturally aware selfassured and selfreliant thus policy decision makers use arsof as force to expand the range of available options 155 arsof are specially organized trained and equipped military forces they conduct so to achieve military political economic or informational objectives by generally unconventional means in ho stile denied or politically sensitive areas decision makers may choose the arsof option because arsof provide the broadest range of capabilities that have direct applicability in an increasing number of environments politicomilitary requirements frequently cast arsof into clandestine or lowvisibility environments that require oversight at the national level arsof operations differ fr om conventional force operations by their degree of acceptable physical and political risk their modes of employment and their operational techniques arsof allow the unified commander or jfc to perform critical smallunit m issions that directly strike or engage the aim or objective of his operational mission 156 early use of arsof in an operation may prevent or limit conflict and conserve national re sources when conflict is imminent arsof may be used in variety of prehostility missions to signal determination to demonstrate support to allies and to begin the complicated processes of positioning forces for combat and shaping the ao 157 during conflict arsof may be most effective in conducting strategic or operational econom yof force operations generating military and diplomatic ad vantages disproportionate to the resources they represent arsof can locate seize or destroy strategic or operational targets and obtain critical intelligence they can analyze an enemys defenses and diminish enemy morale arsof can disorganize disrupt and demoralize enemy troops they can also divert the enemys important resources 158 arsof expand the options of the president the secdef and gccs particularly in crises and contingencies that fall between wholly diplomatic initiatives and the overt use of large conventional fo rces the small size rapid reaction and selfsufficient nature of arsof elements provide military optio ns that do not involve the risk of escalation normally associat ed with larger more visible conventional forces the chapter 1 112 fm 305 20 september 2006 use of arsof enables decision makers to prevent conflict or to limit its scope therefore decision makers can better control committed us forces and resources arsof may be the best choice for actions requiring rapid response or surgically precise focused use of force 159 selected arsof need not use lethal force in mission language skills crosscultural training regional orientation and understanding of the political context of the operational envi ronments make arsof unparalleled when operating in complex environments arsof skills enable arsof to work as effectively with civilian populations as with other milita ry forces to influence situations favorably toward us national interests this ability to apply discreet leverage is very important arsof contribu tion to the national military strategy characteristics 160 to ensure missions selected for arsof are compatible with their capabilities commanders must be familiar with the following so characteristics z arsof personnel undergo careful selection proce sses or missionspecific training beyond basic military skills to achieve entrylevel so skills being proficient in these skills makes rapid replacement or generation of personnel or capabilities highly unlikely z mature experienced personnel make up arsof many maintain high level of competency in more than one military specialty z most arsof are regionally oriented for employment crosscultural communication skills are routine part of their training z arsof conduct specific tactical operations by small units with unique talents that directly strike or engage strategic and operational aims or objectives z planning for so may begin at the unified joint or interagency level for exec ution that requires extensive rigorous rehearsal z so are frequently clandestine or lowvisibility operations or they may be combined with overt operations so can be covert but require declar ation of war or specific finding approved by the president or the secdef arsof can deploy at relatively low cost with low profile less intrusive than that of larger conventional forces z selected arsof units often conduct so at great distance from operational bases these units employ sophisticated communications systems and means of insertion support and ext raction to penetrate and return from hostile denied or politically sensitive areas z so occur throughout the range of military operations z so influence the will of foreign leadership to create conditions favorable to us strategic aims and objectives z so are often highrisk operations that have limited windows of execution and require f irsttime success z employment of so may require patient longterm commitment and support to achieve u s national goals in an ao sf are ideally suited to perform so with through or by indigenous personnel z so require theater and frequently nationallevel intelligence support z selected so require detailed knowledge of the cultural nuances and l anguages of country or region where employed z so are inherently joint and sometimes multinational requiring interagency and international coordination the contribution of arsof to national security is greatest when arsof are fully integrated into the jfcs plan at the earliest stages of planning z arsof can be taskorganized quickly and deployed rapidly to provide tailored responses to many different situations z selected arsof can gain access to hostile and denied areas z arsof can provide limited security and medical support for themselves overview 20 september 2006 fm 305 113 z selected arsof can live in austere harsh environments without extensive support fo r long duration operations arsof require support from the army service component command ascc z selected arsof can survey and assess local situations and rapidly report these assessments z selected arsof work closely with regional military and civilian authorities and populations truths 161 arsof are not substitute for conventional forces they are however necessary adjunct to the capabilities of existing conventional forces depending on requirements arsof can operate independently or with conventional forces arsof can assist and comp lement conventional forces so they can achieve an objective that otherwise might not be attainable the special skills and lowvisibility capabilities inherent in arsof also provide an adaptable military response in situations or crises requiring tailored precise an d focused use of force 162 arsof provide capabilities that expand the options available to the employing commander however arsof are not the ideal solution to all problems requiring military response the best mean s of employing arsof is usually with conventional forces in which each force fulfills the role it is optimally designed to accomplish arsof imperatives 163 the following paragraphs discuss the arsof imperatives although the impera tives may not apply to all types of arsof arsof commanders must include the applicable imperatives in their mission planning and execution understand the operational environment 164 arsof cannot dominate the operational environment without first gaining clear understanding of the theater including civilian influence as well as enemy and friendly capabilities combat environmental researchpolitical economic sociological psychological geographic and militaryis an essential prerequisite to influencing the environment arsof must identify the friendly and hostile decision m akers their objectives and strategies and the ways they interact the conditions of conflict can change and arsof must anticipate these changes in the environment and exploit fleeting opportunities recognize political implications 165 many so are conducted to advance critical political objectives arsof must understand that their actions can have international consequences roe provide framework that considers political implications however roe cannot anticipate every situation arsof must understand the intent of the roe and act accordingly despite any military disadvantage that may result the advancement of the political objective may take precedence over the military disadvantages facilitate interagency activities 166 arsof support and complement us and multinational civilian programs driven by nonmilitary considerations arsof can also operate in the ambiguous and complex political environments found in coalition operations or alliances formed to avert situations that would lead to human tragedy engage the threat discriminately 167 arsof are limited resource that cannot be easily replaced arsof mission objectives require careful application of when where and how chapter 1 114 fm 305 20 september 2006 consider longterm effects 168 arsof must consider the political economic informational and military effects when faced with dilemmas since the solutions will have broad farreaching effects they must accept legal and political constraints to avoid strategic failure while achieving tactical success arsof must not jeopardize the success of national and theater longterm objectives by th eir desire for immediate or shortterm effects so policies plans and operations must be consistent with the national and theater priorities and objectives they support inconsistency can lead to loss of gitimacy and credibility at the national level ensure legitimacy and credibility of special operations 169 significant legal and policy considerations apply to many so activities legitimacy is the most crucial factor in developing and maintaining internal and international support the united states cannot sustain its assistance to foreign power without this legitimacy the concept of legitimacy is broader than the strict legal definition contained in international law the concept also includes the moral and political legitimacy of government or resistance organization the people of the nation and the in ternational community determine its legitimacy based on collective perception of the credibility of its cause and methods without legitimacy and credibility so will not gain the support of foreign indigenous elements the us population or the international community arsof legal advisors must review all sensitive aspects of so mission planning and execution anticipate and control psychological effects 170 all so have significant psychological effects some specifically produced and some based on perceptions arsof must integrate psyop and public affairs pa into all their activities anticipating and countering propaganda and disinformation themes as needed to allow for maximum control of the environment apply capabilities indirectly 171 the primary role of arsof in multinational operations is to advise train and assist indigenous military and paramilitary forces the supported nonus forces then serve as force multipliers in the pursuit of us national security objectives with minimum us visibility risk and cost the longterm self sufficiency of the foreign force must assume primary authority and accept responsibility for the success or failure of the mission all us efforts must reinforce and enhance the effectiveness legitimacy and credibility of the supported foreign government or group develop multiple options 172 arsof must maintain their operational flexibility by developing broad range of option s keys to operational flexibility include z developing contingency plans that antic ipate problems during critical events z using collaborative deliberate and inte ractive planning and rehearsal process z having the same people plan rehearse and execute the mission these types of actions on the objective become common point of departure not inflexible blueprints note under these circumstances the participants understand all the critical elements of the plan as well as alternate coas reasons for discarding alternate coas and unstated assumptions underlying unexpected difficulties ensure longterm sustainment 173 resourcing of arsof varies with each mission arsof must demonstrate continuity of effort when dealing with political economic informational and military programs they must not begin pr ograms that overview 20 september 2006 fm 305 115 are beyond the economic technological or cultural capabilities of the hn to maintain without us assistance such efforts are counterproductive so policy strategy and programs must therefore be durable consistent and sustainable provide sufficient intelligence 174 success for arsof missions dictates that uncertainty associated with the threat and environment must be minimized through the application of inte lligence operations and pro cedures because of the needed detailed intelligence arsof typically must so access theater and national systems to alleviate shortfalls and to ensure that timely relevant accurate and predictive intelligence is provided the key to effective intelligence support is for arsof to use the entire intelligence support system and architecture fully arsof units also provide intelligence through area assessments sr and postoperational debriefing of units humint is often the only source that can satisfy critical arsof intelligence requirements whether from overt or controlled sources balance security and synchronization 175 insufficient security may compromise mission excessive security may cause the mission to fail because of inadequate coordination arsof command ers must constantly balance the two and resolve these conflicting demands on mission planning and execution
