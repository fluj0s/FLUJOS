pollutants pops background and issues in the 107th congress summary persistent organic pollutants pops are chemicals that can harm human health and wildlife do not break down easily in the environment and tend to accumulate as they move up the food chain many po ps are transported in the air and water across international boundaries in the last f our years the united states has joined in negotiations of three international agreements to address pops the 2001 stockholm convention on pe rsistent organic pollutants pops convention negotiated unde r the auspices of the united nations to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants worldwide the 1998 aarhus protocol on persis tent organic pollutants to the 1979 geneva convention on longrange transboundary air pollution pops protocol regional agreement that seeks to to control reduce or eliminate discharge emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants in europe some former soviet union countries and the united states and the 1998 rotterdam convention on the prior informed consentprocedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade pic conven tion negotiated under the auspices of the that requires exportin g countries to provide prior notification to potential importing na tions of substances that are banned or severely restrict ed in the

abling also known as implementing legislation the pops protocol does not require senate approval however legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies between provisions of all three agreements and existing us laws this report compares two senate proposals in the 107 th congress to implement the agreements s 2118 and s 2507 as introduced both would amend two environmental statutes the toxic substances control ac t tsca and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra although both bills would have provided epa the necessary authority to implement the pops convention and protocol the bills differed in the extent to which they would have facilitated full compliance with the agreements especially with respect to any future amendments that might add chemicals to be regulated if similar propos als are introduced into the 108th congress concerns about the domestic and international ra mifications of each approach may be focal point for debate this report does not

down easily in the environment and tend to accumulate as they move up the food chain many po ps are transported in the air and water across international boundaries most pops are synthe tic industrial chemicals or pesticides but few are unintentional byproducts for example of combustion in the last four years the united states has participated in the negotiation of three united nationssponsored internationa l agreements to address global problems associated with pops the 2001 stockholm convention on pe rsistent organic pollutants pops convention the 1998 aarhus protocol on persis tent organic pollutants pops protocol an amendment to th 1979 geneva convention on long range transboundary air pollution lrtap and the 1998 rotterdam convention on the prior informed consentprocedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade pic convention the united states has signed all three ag reements but before the pops convention and the pic convention may be ratified by the united stat the senate must give its advice and consent to ratification and both houses of congress must enact enabling also known as implementing gislation the pops protocol does not require senate approva l however legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies between provisions of all three agreements and two us laws the toxic substances control act tsca and the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 1 in april 2002 senator jim jeffords iv t chairman of the senate committee on environment and public works introduced s 2118 which would enable

substance this report will discuss the similarities and differences between the senate b ills s 2118 and s 2507 two key issues were reflected in the differences in the two bills whether congress should amend tsca and fifra at this time to authorize epa to regulate pollutants added in any future amendments to the agreements eliminating the need for future enabling legislation and if so whether congress should exempt regulations for pops chemicals from certain statutory requirements so as to expedite rulemaking and whether legislation should include ancillary provisions that are not strictly necessary to implement the agreements although both bills would have provided ep the necessary authority to implement the pops convention and protocol the bills differed in the extent to which they would have facilitated full compliance with the agreements especially with respect to any future proposals to add chemicals to be regulated if similar proposals are introduced into the 108th congress concerns about th domestic and international ramifications of each approach may be focal point for debate this report does not constitute legal analysis of the bills or of amendments to existing law

provisions of the three international agreements brief summary of existing statutes tsca tsca 15 usc 26012671 author izes epa to identify potentially dangerous products or uses of chemicals in manufacturing and commerce that should be subject to federal control tsca mandates the screening of new and existing chemicals in commerce to determin whether their production importation processing distribution use or disposal might pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment to that end epa is authorized to require companies manufacturing chemicals to provide data on each chemicals characteristics and use under tsca epa is required to regulate chemical if the administrator finds that there is reasonable basis to c onclude that the manufacture processing distribution in commerce use or disposal presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment the act directs epa to regulate chemical to the extent necessary to protect adequately against such risk using the least burdensome requirements tsca au thorizes wide range of regulatory options to reduce chemical risks from requirement for labeling to total ban on production and distribution in commerce crs7 8 the federal food drug and cosmetic act was amended by the food quality protection act in 1996 it defines safe to mean that there is reasonable certainty of harm from pesticide exposure 9 such higher tolerance levels may be set onl for pesticides that are potential carcinogens or have some other health effect for which there is known level of exposure at which harm is anticipated known as nonthreshol d effect for more on these provisions of fifra see crs report 96759 enr pesticide legislation food quality protection act of 1996 pl 104170 tsca section 6 specifies the rulemaking procedure for chemicals in detail it combines an informal notice and comment procedure similar to that applied to most administrative rules 5 usc 553 with an opportunity for an informal hearing it also requires that epa consider and publish statement with respect to the health and environmental effects of the chemical the magnitude of human and environmental exposure to the chemical the benefits of the chemical for various uses and availability of substitutes and reasonably ascer tainable economic consequences of the rule after consideration of the ffect on the national ec onomy small business technological innovation the envir onment and public health the final chemical rule must be based on the matter in the rulemaking record as defined in section 19a which incl udes the rule the administrators finding that the chemical presents an unreasonabl risk the costbenefit statement the hearing transcript any written submission of interested parties and other relevant material tsca section 19 authorizes any person to file petition for judicial review of final rule within 60 days of its promulgation fifra fifra requires epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the united states through registra tion and labeling of pesticide products the act directs epa to restrict the use of pesticides to the extent necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on the environment the statute defines this to mean any unreasonable risk to man or the environm ent taking into account the economic social and environmental cost s and benefits of the use of any pesticide fifra prohibits sale in the united states of any pesticide unless it is registered and labeled indicating approved uses and rest rictions it is violation of the law to use pesticide in manner that is inconsistent with the label instructions epa registers each pesticide for each approved use for example to control boll weevils on cotton pesticides may not be registered for use on food unless any pesticide residues remaining on the food would be safe as defined by the federal food drug and cosmetic act8 however epa may not cancel an existing pesticide registration for use on food even if such use is not safe if the pesticide us avoids other greater risks to consumers or is necessary to avoid significant disruption in domestic production of an adequate wholes ome and economical food supply9 fifra does not regulate production of pe sticides intended solely for export however section 17 requires that pesticide exports must be prepared or packed according to the specifications or directions of the foreign purchaser and if the pesticide is not registered for use in the united states prior to export the foreign purchaser has signed statement acknowle dging that the purchaser understands that such pesticide is not registered for use in the united states copy of thatcrs8 statement must be transmitted to the gove rnment of the importing country epa is required to notify through the state partment government s of other countries whenever us pesticide registration or cancellation or suspension of registration becomes effective or ceases to be effective bill similarities and key differences similarities both s 2118 and s 2507 w ould have amended tsca to prohibit manufacture processing distribution in commerce use and disposal of the chemicals listed in annexes to the pops convention and the lr tap pops protocol the bills would have amended fifra to prohibit sale distribution use production and disposal that may lead to recovery recycling reclamation reuse or an alternative use of listed pops and lrtap pops pesticides both bills would have amended the existing statutes to provide for exemptions found in the convention and the protocol the bills also would have created process for epa to notify the public when chemicals and pesticides were proposed for listing under either international agreement s 2507 would ve authorized such notification while s 2118 would have mandated it differences s 2118 but not s 2507 would have given epa standing authority to regulate chemicals that might be added by future amendments to the annexes of the pops convention or th pops protocol if and when such amendments came into force with respect to the united states epa could have proposed regulations under tsca to prohibit or restrict manufacturing processing distribution in commerce use or disposal of chemicals if such activity were inconsistent with provisions of the inte rnational agreement as amended because the senate committee on foreign relations has not yet reported its views with respect to the pops convention it is not clear whether any pr oposed amendments to treaty annexes will be sub mitted to the senate for dvice and consent proposed amendments to the pops protocol will not be submitted to the senate because the lrtap convention and protocols are execu tive agreements rather than treaties under us law however the president may prevent any proposed amendments from coming into force with respect to the united states in the case of the pops convention through either the optin or optout procedure discussed on page 3 above or in the case of the pops protocol by refusing to agree to the proposal in contrast under provisions of s 2507 epa c ould not fully regulate new chemical even if the amendment adding it came into force with respect to the united states unless congress enacted additiona l implementing legislation s 2118 would have facilitated epa regu lation by exempting rules from the existing requirement of tsca section 6c1 that epa prepare statement of costs and benefits associated with rule regulation would have been further facilitated by the s 2118 provision that any activity in consistent with the pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol as they might be amended would be deemed to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment an unreasonable risk determination triggers ep regulatory action under ts ca however s 2118 would have exempted from this determination any activity necessary to prevent significant harm to an important sector of the economy if significantly greater risks were found to be associated with each substitu chemical ie chemical that could serve similar function evaluated by epa this last provision would have alignedcrs9 10 however the provision in s 2118 seems to apply more broadly to any pesticide rather than only to the nonthreshold pesticides ddressed by the existing fifra provision see footnote 9regulation of pop chemicals with that of other chemicals under tsca which provides that significant risk may not be unreasonable and required to be reduced through regulation due to the economic impacts and other risks that might follow from the proposed regulation s 2118 would have amended the tsca definition of chemical substance to include pesticides unless they may under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act 7 usc 136 et seq be lawfully sold or distributed for use in the united states the effect of the amendmen t would have been to subject unregistered pesticides eg pesticides intended only for export to tsca requirements pesticides covered by the pops convention and the lrta p pops protocol as they might be amended may or ma not be registered for use in the united states with respect to fifra s 2118 would have authorized epa regulation of production of pesticides that may be dded in future amendments to the pops convention or lrtap pops protocol this authority would be necessary to implement the agreements s 2118 would have facilita ted regulation by expanding the fifra definition of unreasonable adverse effect on the environment the trigger for fifra regulation to include any production or use of pestic ide inconsistent with an amendment to an annex of the pops conve ntion or lrtap pops protocol thus epa would have been able to cancel registra tions for newly listed pesticides in order to ensure us compliance with the amended agreements after amendments entered into force with respect to the united states as noted above the role of the congress in accepting such amendments to the pops convention is unclear but the president may reject proposed chemical amendments to either the pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol s 2118 woul d not have authorized epa to cancel pesticide registration if produc tion or use of the pesticide were necessary to prevent significant adverse effects on human hea lth or the environment that would pose significantly greater risks than the risks ssociated with the production or use of the pesticide or to avoid significan t disruption in domestic production of an adequate wholesome and economical f ood supply this exception probably was intended to make regulation of pops pesticides more consistent with existing fifra authority10 if epa were to cancel pesticides registration to comply with an amendment to either the pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol s 2118 would have prohibited with certain exemptions allo wed under the pops convention or lrtap pops protocol use production and disposal that could lead to recovery recycling reclamation reuse or an alternative use of the pesticide if pesticide were registered in the united states for uses not prohibited by an amendment to the convention or protocol s 2118 still woul d have prohibited use production andcrs10 11 epa would have to issue statement aft er public comment that there were existing us registrations preventing compliance with the amended international agreements and identify any us permitted uses that would not prevent compliance 12 susan bruninga broad support seen for pops treaty but witnesses differ on adding chemicals daily environment report 15 may 2002 a9disposal that could lead to recovery or reuse of that pesticide under certain conditions11 s 2118 also included several provisions that would not amend tsca or fifra first the bill would have required epa to submit final exposure and human health reassessment of dioxin to the house committee on energy and commerce and the senate committee on environment and public works within 90 days of the bills enactment epa has been conducting this reassessment for more than 11 years s 2118 would have required epa to deve lop strategy that will reduce public exposure to persistent bioaccumulative to xic substances pops are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic but other chemicals besides pops also have these characteristics s 2118 would have authorized an epa contract with the national academy of sciences nas to conduct research pr ogram in support of the pops convention under the contract nas would have to scr een potential pops provi scientific data on the pops and recommend those pops th at should be nominated for addition to the pops convention the bill specified numerous chemicals that the nas would be required to screen finally s 2118 did not addr ess inconsistencie s between us laws and the pic convention while s 2507 would have ame nded both tsca and fifra to authorize implementation of that international agreement these amendments would implement the export notification requirements beling requirements and importer consent terms of the pic convention this differe nce between the bills seemed relatively noncontroversial12 policy issues in hearing held by the senate committee on environment and public works on may 15 2002 bill differences were highlight ed with respect to two policy issues 1 whether congress should amend tsca and fifra to authorize epa regulation of pollutants added in any future amendments to the agreements eliminating the need for future enabling legislation and 2 whether legislation should include provisions that some argued were not necessary to implement the agreements addition of new chemicals until recently the administration opposed inclusion in implementing legislation of authority for epa to regulate chemicals added by future amendments to the po ps convention or lr tap pops protocol epa administrator whitman argued that consideration of implementation issues should be deferred until the conference of the parties cop velops detailedcrs11 13 johnson stephen l testimony before the environment and public works committee united states senate may 9 2002 httpwwwsenategovepwjohnson_051402htm 14 whitman christine todd letter to the honorable james m jeffords oct 9 2002 procedure for adding che micals under the convention13 thus s 2507 did not contain an adding mechanism senator jeffords bill did propose mechanism for regulating chemicals that might be added by amendment see description of s 2118 above however early in october 2002 administrator wh itman sent letter to senator jeffords proposing to work with h im toward development of legislative provision for regulating additional che micals under the pops convention the approach she proposed in her letter diffe red from that found in s 2118 but should not be construed as final opinion on the proposed pops bills nor should this information be interpreted as final administration position14 as introduced s 2118 would have au thorized epa to propose regulations under tsca or fifra to prohibit or restri ct manufacturing processing distribution in commerce use or disposal of chemicals if such activity were inconsistent with provisions of the international agreement as amended in addition regulation would have been facilitated because certain tsca requirements for chemical regulation would have been eliminated ie the costbenefit statement and other tsca and fifra requirements would have been satisfi ed by the international listing process without the need for additional data co llection or analysis ie to meet an unreasonable risk criterion for regulati on furthermore s 2118 appeared to modify the tsca requirement that epa must propose rule that is the least burdensome regulatory alternative to prevent or reduce risk to sufficient extent since the choice of regulatory action would ve been determined at least in part by epas authority to regulate chemical activities that were inconsistent with treaty provisions s 2118 gives epa discretion to dete rmine the location and process of deliberations about whether and to what ex tent regulation of ne w pops chemicals is justified the agency could follow normal tsca or fifra rulemaking procedures or defer to the cop and the decisionma king processes specified in the pops convention and pops protocol the key to understanding the potential impact of s 2118 is recognizing that although it would ve facilitated rule ma king for chemicals that might be added to the international agreements it did not mandate regulation of new chemicals under the pops convention or protocol the bills provisions would not have prevented the united states fro m acting or not on its own authority under tsca or fifra to regulate new pops chemicals domestically nor would the provisions have allowed the international agreements to impose new restrictions on the united states with regard to new che micals without its consent the united states would have retained the power to accept or reject any amendment adding new chemical through either the optin or th optout procedure described in the pops convention and summarized on page 3 of th is report s 2118 provided that epa rules would become final only after an amendment adding the chemical to the international agreement entered into force with respect to the united states crs12 s 2118 might have affected the review and oversight processes of proposed and final regulations however because s 2118 would have allowed epa to choose which criteria and process to use in decidi ng whether and how to regulate new pops chemicals either existing tsca and fifra criteria and processes or criteria and processes that will be established at some future date by the cop if epa chose to employ the latter the influence of the criteria established by congress in tsca and fifra might have been reduced with resp ect to pop chemicals in addition the influence of the public in general and of the regulated community in particular might have been reduced in selecting chemicals to be regulated and the degree of regulation if substantive delib erations about the costs benefits alternatives and risks were conducted nd resolved by the cop by re moving these subjects as topics of discussion during domestic rulemaking opportunities fo r the public to challenge final rules in us courts also might also be diminished the public role would not have been eliminated however because th bill and the international agreements provided for public notice and comment at tw points in the decisionmaking process for chemicals proposed to be added to ither agreement under the pops convention when new chemical is proposed for listing in annex b or c and meets the screening criteria in annex d under the po ps protocol when risk profile for chemical proposed for listing in annex i or ii is submitted to the executive committee and again when chemical ultimately is listed in an annex of the pops convention or protocol another potential concern if s 2118 had been enacted is wh ether there would have remained any role for congress in pproving through either the optin or the optout procedure proposed amendments to annexes of the pops convention or the lrtap pops protocol because the nate committee on foreig n relations has not yet reported its views with respect to th pops convention it is not clear whether any proposed amendments to the annexes w ill be submitted to th senate for advice and consent if not chemicals proposed fo r addition through amendments to annexes of the pops convention might have been added and regulated in the united states or not at the presidents discretion subject to expedited regulatory procedures and congressional review the senate will not be asked to advise the president or to consent to an amendment adding chemical to the pops protocol because the lrtap convention and protocols are execu tive agreements rather than treaties under us law on the other hand s 2507 could have prevented epa from fully implementing the pops convention for any chemical dded to the treaty until congress enacted new legislation amending tsca and fifra this would have ensured role for congress but could have significantly layed implementation of treaty amendments language proposed by the epa administrator late in the 107th congress addressed some of these concerns it would have provided mechanism for regulating chemicals added to the international agreements by amendment eliminating the need for additional tsca and fifra amendments but would not have facilitated the regulatory process by treating new pops chemicals in different more streamlined way than nonpops chemicals under tsca and fifra arguably nonessential provisions the second key difference between the bills and source of controversy was that s 2118 included provisions thatcrs13 15 walls michael testimony before the environment and public works
