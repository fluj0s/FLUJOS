from tom wigley wigleycgducaredu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re past 1000 yr date wed 06 oct 2004 115816 0600 xflowed see caps tim osborn wrote hi tom id be happy to contribute if i have something worth contributing im bit rushed today and away tomorrow but can respond to further emails later in the week at 1431 03102004 tom wigley wrote caspar ammann and i plan to publish some magicc results for the past 100 years presume you mean 1000 years hence relevance of echohvon storch oops yes part of the reason is the new solar forcing as in my science note with peter foukal yes i saw that with brief scan i didnt realise that you were presenting new forcing history just discussing reasons why longterm changes may be lower than previously estimated but presumably you can use such reasoning to develop new forcing history or better range or even pdf of such histories and then extend it using 14c or 10be or combination we say low freq forcing c14be10 are proxies for magnetic field changes there is adequate theory relating these to luminosity changes in fact theory suggests they are not related so we are suggesting different forcing history with implications as in the figure solarinduced lia in accord with the proxy climate reconstruxions further there is some recent work suggesting that part of the c14be10 changesw are due tochznges in the earths magnetic field so we address both forcing and senstivity uncertainties in addition the drift due to incorrect initialization is an issue surely not so in magicc but yes it is in gcms and particularly so in echog of course what i mean is to use magicc to quantify the initialization drift i have not yet read the storch paper or your comment but did you mention this problem we said that echog had redder spectrum than other model simulations there was room to say that it showed greater fluctuations but we cited the jonesmann paper which has an intercomparison figure in it we didnt talk about the reasons for this drift early on strong solar forcing throughout and tropospheric aerosols to mitigate recent warming because wed already said that the simulation didnt necessarily represent real climate history also can you remind just what was done with the echo run main problem in terms of introducing drift or adjustment was that they used control run with present day co2 as initial conditions although they allowed 70year spinup prior to ad 1000 to adjust back to preindustrial co2 this doesnt look long enough and the adjustment probably goes on for the first 400 years of the run ie there is gradually disappearing cooling trend over this period all based on magicc runs but still fairly convincing including nonzero heat flux out of the ocean in echog itself see the stouffer paper in clim dyn 23 327 2004 if you have something to add on this you can join as coauthor im not quite sure what you plan nor the input you need but hopefully i can help what i would like is your best estimate of the magnitude of the spurious initialization effect in terms of forcing cheers tim dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk email tosbornueaacuk phone 44 1603 592089 fax 44 1603 507784 web httpwwwcruueaacuktimo sunclock httpwwwcruueaacuktimosunclockhtm xflowed
