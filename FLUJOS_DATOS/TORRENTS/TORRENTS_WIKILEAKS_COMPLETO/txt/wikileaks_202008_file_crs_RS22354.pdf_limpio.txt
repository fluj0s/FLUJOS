public finance january 8 2009 abstract of the three broad categories of federal spending the only category that cannot be reduced by legislative action is net interest payments net interest payments accounted for about 7 of federal spending between 1962 and the late 1970s with the high interest rates in the late 1970s and the large budget deÔ¨Åcits in the 1980s net interest payments eventually rose to 15 of federal spending the low interest rates combined with budget discipline in the 1990s reduced net interest payments back down to 7 of federal outlays by 2003 however net interest payments have recently increased and are projected to continue increasing in the near termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22354g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156

g343g561ederal spending is divided into three broad categories first discretionary spending is provided and controlled by the annual appropriations acts and includes such things as defense and education spending1 discretionary spending currently accounts for about 40 of federal outlays second direct or mandatory spending is provided and controlled by laws other than appropriation acts and includes spending for such programs as social security and medicare2 mandatory spending accounts for over half of federal outlays lastly net interest payments are interest payments on federal debt held by the public and currently account for almost 9 of federal outlays in an effort to reduce spending the fy 2006 budget resolution hconres 95 included reconciliation instructions to reduce mandatory sp ending by 35 billion over the next five years congress ultimately voted to reduce mandatory spending by about 40 billion over five years in addition congress enacted 1 acrosstheboard reduction in fy2006 discretionary spending the only category of federal spending that cannot be reduced by legislative action barring default on the public debt is net interest payments while congress cannot affect current net interest payments congressional actions on the budget will affect future interest payments this report examines net interest payments and the mechanisms through which congress can affect net interest payments g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g6g142g139g157g561 federal debt is composed of debt issued by the treasury treasury securities and debt securities issued by other federal agencies agency securities at the end of fy2008 total federal securities amounted to 100 trillion of which only 231 billion less than 03 were agency securities federal debt is held either by the public that is private investors or in government accounts currently about 42 of federal debt is held in various government accounts for example the two social security trust funds currently hold about 24 trillion in treasury securities the rest of the federal debt is held by the public foreign and domestic including individuals pension funds banks and other investors figure 1 shows the level of total federal debt and debt held by the public since 1962 as percentage of gross domestic product gdp both measures of debt fell as proportion of gdp between 1962 and the mid1970s beginning in 1981 total federal debt began to climb as tax cuts increases in defense spending and recession increased budget deficits total debt continued growing relative to gdp until the mid1990s as budget deficits gave way to budget surpluses after 1997 and as the economy expanded federal debt fell as percentage of gdp the mild recession and the tax cuts in 2001 moved the federal budget back into deficit and federal debt consequently increased between 1962 and 1982 total federal debt and debt held by the public followed roughly parallel trends after the mid1980s however trends in total federal debt and debt held by the public began to diverge this was mainly due to changes in the social security program enacted in 1983 1 for more information on discretionary spending see crs report

transfer of funds or real resources from the government to the public the lower line in figure 2 shows the evolution of net interest payments since 1962 for the most part net interest payments followed the same basic trend as gross interest payments however the gap between gross and net interest payments widened after the mid1980s5 as with gross interest payments net interest payments 4 in essence the interest payments are used to purchase mo re treasury securities while not representing real resources available for current spending the government will eventually have to find real resources by raising taxes or reducing spending for the redemption of these securities under current law 5 the widening of this gap is due in part to the increases in the social security trust fund resulting from the 1983 amendments to the social security act these amendments led to increasing revenues to the social security program and reduced the growth in benefits

net interest payments are projected to fall dramatically in 2009 due to very low interest rates large budget deficits in 2009 and 2010 however will lead to rising net interest payments for the next

are 1 the interest rate or yield on us treasury securities and 2 the level of debt held by the public figure 3 shows the evolution of net interest payments debt held by the public and the interest rate since 1967 the interest rate is the yield on fiveyear constant maturity us treasury bonds both net interest payments and debt held by the public are expressed as percentage of gdp and are indexed so that the value in 1967 is equal to one 8 net interest payments increased rapidly beginning in 1977 at about the same time that interest rates increased dramatically see figure 3 net interest payments continued to increase after interest rates fell in the early 1980s because of the increase in debt held by the public the increase in debt held by the public was due to the large budget deficits in the first years of the reagan administration and counteracted the effect of falling interest rates on net interest payments as both interest rates and debt held by the public fell after 1997 net interest payments fell as proportion of federal outlays the government can to some extent control the effective interest rate paid on its debt by varying the maturity of its securities the federal government issues both shortterm and longterm debt the yield on treasury securities varies with the maturity of the securities typically shortterm securities have lower yield than longerterm securities and the yield curve therefore is upward sloping 9 occasionally the yield curve will invert with longerterm securities having lower yield than shortterm securities but this happens neither often nor for extended periods 6 cbo projects that the deficit will be almost 1200 billion in 2009 and 703 billion in 2010 see cbo budget and economic outlook january 2009 7 see cbo the longterm budget outlook december 2005 8 the index is created by dividing the value in each year by the value in 1967 this is done so that both series fit on the same graph 9 the yield curve is the relationship of the yield on securities and the maturity of those securities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22354g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157

source omb nd federal reser ve board primary goal of debt management is to obtain the lowest borrowing cost over time10 over the past 30 years the mean maturity of marketable treasury securities held by private investors has varied between about three years and six years since 2000 the range has narrowed to between five and six years however this apparent stability masks changes in the types of securities issued in 2001 for example the treasury stopped issuing 30year bonds 11 although shorter term treasury securities tend to have lower yields than longerterm securities they also are more volatile consequently the financing costs of shortterm securities can change dramatically over fairly short periods this volatility and uncertainty complicate efforts to obtain the lowest borrowing costs over time congressional actions affecting the budget deficit will affect federal debt which in turn affects future net interest payments budget deficits and federal debt can also affect the interest rates on treasury securities12 increasing federal debt will increase the supply of treasury securities this will tend to push down the price and increase the yield of these securities13 recent studies have estimated that increasing debt held by the public by one percent of gdp will increase future 10 see crs report rl34682 federal debt management concepts options and policies 19452008 by james m bickley 11 treasury began issuing 30year bonds again in february 2006 12 the strength of the economy inflation expectations and the actions of the federal reserve board also have an important effect on interest rates 13 there is an inverse relationship between the price of bond and the yield of the bond
