establish epa as full member of the cabinet and doing so would be consistent with observations ofstategovernmentsshedeclared16 enhanced international relations enhancing the international presence of the united states seems to be the prime reason mentioned in arguing for depar tment reflecting the global nature of environmental issues epa is increasingly i nvolved in international negotiations over environmental matters that are increasin gly global in nature proponents argue that because the head of epa is not at the secretarial or ministerial level us interests are not represented as well as theycould be analysis in june 2001 of the placement of environmental officials within 198 governments indicates that with onlynine exceptions all the governments place their environmental responsibilitie s at the ministerial level17of course the responsibilities of the various ministries vary widely with many of these ministries having responsibilities in addition to environmental ones some include agriculture natural resource management tourism or other responsibilities reflecting the priorities of the individual nations arguing in favor of department forme r administrator browner
