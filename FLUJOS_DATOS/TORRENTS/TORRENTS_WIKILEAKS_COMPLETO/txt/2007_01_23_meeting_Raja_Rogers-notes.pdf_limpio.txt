domain of the raja of atlanta january 23 2007 in attendance greeting charlie it is snowing in oregon raja rogers another significant snow in fairfield since 1978 i saw maybe 5 or 6 inches max tonight we need to check and see how everybody is doing then report what is happening in vlodrop then tidbits consciousnessbased education lexington 1 two schools submitted jeff murphy we submitted two requests to the david lynch foundation deadline today the first is smaller school that involve s teen mothers going through the school system and bringing their children it is operated by the county but the teachers are provided by the school district the second school is small school about 17 miles from lexington we have had several meetings with the principal all favorable letters of intent signed by both schools are required in our submittal for funding 2 deadline raja rogers tell about this deadline jeff received email for competition for small amount of funding available after january 23 cut off date chris said not to pressure schools as they are expecting additional funds soon but did have funds now so we were able to make it in for that competition b tampa school of 2000 ray we had meeting with public high schools steering committee which voted unanimously to begin program principal has approval from board of education carol the principal has approval from board and superintendent they are very excited about this program ray gave them the letter of intent they may have their lawyer look at it even though they know it is not legally binding document they are really interested in the whole school which includes 2000 students they didnt know logistically if they could do the whole school or if it would have to be done in stages next step is to have faculty meeting with the entire staff the possibility has been spreading casually by word of mouth and in december when they notifie d the faculty every faculty member that they let know and every at risk student that they let know wanted to do it then the ap advanced placement students pitched fit as they are going off to college and are stressed too and they wanted to do it we feel it is strong endorsement across the board ray and i are making flow charts of how many teachers we feel we need and where they can do it initially we have financial 2 considerations flowers etc we are going ahead like this is going to happen and will happen soon c percentage of city in the lexington area if the school of 211 learns it will be 23 of the city population d number of teachers required for tampa area school would need 50 men and 50 ladies for 2000 students at nataki as we had to fit into the school day one teacher could teach 8 or 9 day if i read the guidelines correctly that we teach off the school premises we would be teaching saturday or sunday and the initiation day could be longer we could start earlier and end later our program would be delayed the schedule could be 8 in the morning to 6 or 630 at night if you think that is plan that is doable we could bring the group and do course on saturday initiate 10 studen ts and start another course next day and initiate another 10 with checking meeting at night monday tuesday wednesday there could be several meetings during the day it would be much lighter three days after then you would have the same thing done for travel eating expenses would be very compact then local teachers could do the two week followup meeting and checking throughout year or bring them for another weekend for mantra check these are high school students i would assume they are going to remember their mantras it would be like an adult initiation off site instruction jane this is an important point for the public schools instruction is done at facility outside the school i have asked mark piper what response we should give if the school principal asks why we cant teach at the school i will let you know carol because the principal of the nataki school was meditator and it was not public school the instruction was at the school the principal did not want to hide away in some hotel f scheduling instruction carol we could teach until midnight raja rogers find out from the schools that have had the program how many they have done in day i regularly taught 15 day starting at 800with 15 minute snack i scheduled for 45 minutes each i had one to bring anybody out or anything like that if whole school wanted to start quickly that might be done too i and rajeshwari lindsey and rajeshwari candace went to estonia to city of 25000 people we taught 308 people in one day so maharishi might okay those technique s also he does that different ways but if we cant get enough teachers we might have few specially trained teachers as we were where you could teach large number 50 or 60 day easily and pushing 120 day in which case i had to have 2 rooms with 2 puja tables i had to move right along answer is if school did want to start all at once that we could do it quickly we would have to bring it to maharishis attention and he would give us the proper guidance 3 g david lynch foundation for tampa raja rogers have you been in touch with the lynch foundation for tampa carol i have talked to chris busch and he told about the deadline i really feel this project is rolling ray is an ideal person to work with he is so organized and has been so active for 30 years dream to work with he puts so many things together in such order we also feel support of nature is strong for this project and it has been from the start chris is aware of this and they are getting lot more funds they just put the paper work in they are excited about it we told the board thursday night that the foundation tends to favor large project they felt greedy in putting in the whole school i said that unlike some foundations this foundation favors large project because they see large commitment from staff and students that they want it chris said this is true but they want any sized project raja rogers i will talk to chris and dr hagelin who is on the board of the foundation now that i know this and it is becoming very solid having the experience this is the experience of many many lifetimes teaching in what was then the ussr estonia and latvia the physic conditions were quite tough but it was something that shines brighter than anything except being with maharishi on raja training it is an unbelievable experience you realize you have karma with all these people and huge karmic weight is being lifted off of you when you do something like this if it is one or two peopl when you are initiating it is wonderful if it is 1000s it is indescribable basically just go for it now i know it is at this point i will be the squeaky wheel so this is fabulous news everyone on the call should think if this starts to manifest more and more that all of us should go and help and do this it is the opportunity of many many lifetimes it is tremendous blessing i cant say enough about it that was1990 and i still talk about those 4 months in estonia it was an evolutionary life transforming experience you get up in morning and do little bit of program and the whole day is your program by the end of long day you have initiated 15 or 20 or if those other directions are given out you initiate 100 people day even when we had slow days 30 or 40 people day it is such an incredible experience 50 or 60 is ideal 100 is overload on the physiology but well worth it this is wonderful reflection of the time and i have to congratula tampa and lexington because you are doing it with your consciousness and your confidence you are like lasers i always feel when ray gets onto something it is going to happen and jeff everyone on the call jeff has the tremendous support of nature living in vastu and ray has many years of experience as savvy business person he is well organized we will push it like anything think we can do it and we will do it h keep it private jane we are very excited about the news please remember to keep what we have heard private protect our schools we never know what response we may get from the community others who have not had the careful introduction may not understand the program and cause trouble jeff even the names of the cities should not be used raja rogers maharishi said there is great power in secrecy 4 jeff one of the principals said it leaked out that she was trying to set aside quiet time she said she was not being secretive but strategic when they found out that quiet time was going to be devoted to the transcendental meditation technique they said there are other things they can do during that time when they realized specifically that it was for the transce ndental meditation technique she said i have to go at it differently addendum to the minutes the practice of the transcendental meditation technique during quiet time is voluntary the students may choose another activity offered by the school jane the principal reminded of importance of being secretive about what steps we have made so far raja rogers we will get maharishis guidance it may be we move very quickly and do not give the negativity time to build up i am sure we are going to get input from maharishi maharishi is focused on natio nal leaders over there national leaders we are finding maharishi very focused on the national leaders i have been busy supplying the group with data for setting up clinics and spas i have been talking with raja peter maharishi has everybody focused with lots of work and getting things done quickly the 16 hour courses are coming out spa clinics education lot of different areas and getting materials for the national leaders maharishi is not connecting to the experience group one of the national leaders is going back to estonia so that is in transit right now that is what is happening over there it is very very exciting the course is still wonderf ul here we just had lunch with bill and joan rist and they were commenting on how pervasive transcendence is here in this whole area of maharishi vedic city and fairfield we are ordering 20 more houses for the pandits we have infra structure and as soon as they get here we will set houses the pandits will move to the new pandit campus in the 2nd week of february at latest and that will open up more room for pandits to come from india campus at mum has reached its maximum capacity with pandits and cooks gainesville schools alcine small thing about school in gainesville top meditating law professor i just spoke with his area is race relations and diversity he would be happy to serve as personal reference to approa ch high school it sounds like we are approaching large public schools so i thought we should go ahead raja rogers it is always important to have high ranking people present tampa raja rogers one other thought on tampa you said you would present to the whole school carol they will have faculty meeting to present to teachers what their concern was was that when we are talkin g about how many teachers the foundation likes the figure of 1 teacher to 10 students to be meditating in house in addition they thought they would like other teachers so some of the teachers 5 could facilitate the guidance i said it doesnt come out to 1 to 10 they would like more teachers some who could contact parent s or if in the future there was research project they would like few teacher s to supervise that so governors could focus on teaching we talked about inhouse teachers they wanted to present to the teachers they have never told about program we have distributed the dvd to some we distributed materials before our meeting it was during the holidays so lot of them didnt look at materia ls there are 30 or 40 students already who said they were on board but the principal wanted to make presentation to finalize it raja rogers how well can these teachers do presentation ray the only presentation they will make is that it is not religion or lifestyle change in the school of 2000 there are only 100 teachers my feeling is that every teacher would have opportunity to learn carol it is not an introductory lecture but brief what do you think of this idea everybody who has heard about it has jumped on it principal wanted an informal short meeting letting people know jane will you be present ray the principal is so strong he hasnt invited us i dont think there is much we have to do schools work from inside out they have 30 to 40 on board already and steering committee gave unanimous approval raja rogers now we will have to keep our attention on it from subtle level minister in support of our programs alcine do we have minister who will say it is not in conflict with religion raja rogers we have ministers who come to raj who are good speakers next meeting we will meet again next tuesday if we dont meet i will let you know i feel lot of news will be coming out at that time i will push this with chris busch and dr hagelin and let them know we are raring to go jai guru dev
