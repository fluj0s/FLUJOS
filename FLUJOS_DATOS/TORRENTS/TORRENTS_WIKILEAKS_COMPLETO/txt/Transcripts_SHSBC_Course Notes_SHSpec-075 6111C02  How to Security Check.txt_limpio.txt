6111c02 shspec75 how to security check the answer to why the bank beefs up when nongoalsterminals are run is this when you run the terminal which is not the goals terminal his attention is too bound up in his own terminal and goal to asis the collapsing mass so the mass the auditor pushes in on the pc connected to the new terminal doesnt get asised the pc doesnt have enough attention units to asis anything except the goals terminal so the bank beefs up similarly your emeter starts up the ta rises to the degree that the pc is not asising what you are throwing in on him the worst thing about emeters is tr0 tr0 goes out and the meter doesnt work an emeter is deadly weapon you can slaughter pc if the emeter is not used correctly you do this by missing instant reads if in addition you took up latent reads and let the pc get off other peoples overts the session itself would be an overt and the pc would feel worse afterwards more dangerous mistake is missing an instant read and leaving the question live which can often result in the pc nattering criticizing you and the organization etc very funny if you miss the question he doubts you your ability the tech etc when you clean it up by pulling the withhold the natter stops latent read has comm lag of 05 sec or more you could sec check person into high ta by making sure all the ruds were out so his attention would be dispersed audit what the pc is stuck in when pcs attention is too bound up in one area the pc cannot asis anything else so the ta goes high and sticks its not that the tas going high should be utterly avoided but the ta goes high because more is being thrown in on the pc than the pc can handle or asis if during run the pc hits an engram he may not be able to asis it if you start directing his attention to all the details etc and start running the engram so just acknowledge it and carry on with the goals or terminals run you were doing the auditor can push mass circuits pictures etc in on the pc and can move his track more easily than the pc hard though it may be for auditors to recognize this so your interrogation of the pc can pin his attention on the track its ok to be curious enough to find out what he is looking at or doing but not to start running it of course you can move him out of it by asking for earlier or later incidents the reactive mind is always keyed to otherdeterminism and never to selfdeterminism so the auditor can always move it around high ta is often cured by getting off withhold even small one getting off any withhold will make the ta go down data on sec checking by dynamics the trouble with the sec check is usually that the auditor is working from his own viewpoint and not from the pcs thetan is not natively member of any culture thetans have come down the track accumulating various mores and civilizations and group ideas some have come down the track without finding out that groups exist theyve collected various things but their mores register on the dynamics rather than relative to groups make sure you sec check what the pc considers an overt even if to you it seems trivial people are different men are so busy being ordinary that they dont recognize that every one of them is slightly somewhere extraordinary this professional ordinariness is great repressor it notises the differences unless you can reestablish difference you cant reestablish differentiation the easy way out the easy solution is to say that its all the same they are all alike all bad so now im warned and safe if miserable thats such stupid reasoning that its wonder countries go down the drain of all people are equal but some people are more equal than others perhaps thetans were all equal at the beginning of the track then became unequal and masked it with pretended equality details on problems intensives and sec check procedures it is interesting that you can sec check out of existence every outrudiment the room ptps the auditor arc breaks just get the prior confusion rudiment cant hang up unless theres an unknown and an unknown cant exist unless theres withhold here we have class of things that all go together unknowingness forgettingness stupidity and withholds they are like r and c in the arc triangle they go up and down together you are not likely to get factual answer to the question have you ever made someone guilty of something the thing that is wrong with the pc is that he has never successfully made anybody guilty and he is still trying the basis of his aberration is the effort to made someone guilty not the accomplished fact you should ask have you ever attempted to make anybody guilty of _______ the only reason anyone has victimish motivatorish attitude is in an effort to make someone guilty it may have even been successful effort but the person making the effort doesnt know about it it is debatable point whether you should ever take an unkind thought as an overt sometimes it does seem to be the only available overt and the person does feel friendlier and better for having gotten it off but there appears to be evidence that person with body of unkind thoughts against someone or something has an actual overt which is being withheld the unkind thoughts are evidently just evidence that overts exist so if you dont get the overts you are leaving them with unflat sec check questions critical thoughts dont aberrate people but the pc may not be able to reach the underlying overt so if he cant make note so that you can return to it
