with polish fm radoslaw sikorskis november 4 comments to the center for strategic and international studies in washington in particular they noted sikorskis request for us forces on the ground in poland to protect against russian aggression and his characterization that the recent zapad2009 exercises were directed against poland some russian officials were quick to point out that sikorskis comments undermined not only improved polish relations ref and b but harmed russianus and russiannato relations as well 2 sbu while the russian mfa has not yet issued formal statement fm sergey lavrov told the press that he did not believe that sikorski had actually made the remarks lavrov commented however that if proved true it throws into deep astonishment because we had talked in detailed manner about the problems that needed to be addressed in the context of european security russian permanent representative to nato dmitry rogozin called sikorskis remarks absurd and uturn in polish policy toward russia and its engagement with nato and europe duma international relations committee chair konstantin kosachev told the press that sikorskis statements directly contradicted the improvement in russiaus and russianato relations 3 snf unfortunately the polish government had seeded some of this russian response through their sponsorship of and statements in support of the eus eastern partnership initiative ref c and show of support to georgia during the 2008 russiageorgia war further the polish mfa has established bureau of european security which polish diplomats jokingly refer to as the office of threats from the east according to xxxxxxxxxxxx diplomat xxxxxxxxxxxx protect who was recruited to work in this bureau while serving in moscow the russian mfa threw this new moniker back at him during meeting xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed to us that the only way the mfa could have known about the reference was to have been listening in on his phone conversations with warsaw while he was interviewing for the job 4 c comment the gor will take some time to digest sikorskis comments and evaluate whether or not to alter the current positive trend in bilateral relations russia has many levers including delaying the approval of pending gas deal ref d sikorski has given antiwestern elements in russia ammunition against improved russian relations with nato and even with the us
