program termination liability the total amount is about 500 million below the request 185 billion in procurement and 12 billion in rd the conference agreement also prohibits award of an initial lowrate production contract unless certain testing is successfully completed aside from the f22 major issues in the fy2000 defense debate included whether to approve new round of military base closures how much to provide for military pay and benefits whether to impose constraints on funding for us military operations in kosovo how to fund theater missile defense programs and how to respond to security lapses at department of energy doe weapons labs the conference agreement on the defense authorization bill does not approve new round of military base closures it provides somewhat larger increases in pay and benefits than the administration had requested including 48 pay raise in 2000 and increased retirement benefits though it does not include senatepassed provision to expand montgomery gi bill benefits although congress approved supplemental fy1999 appropriations for kosovo operations the administrations policy remains controversial the house removed provision from the defense authorization bill prohibiting funds to be used for future operations in kosovo but only after the administration agreed to seek supplemental appropriations to cover costs of peacekeeping mission in fy2000 earlier in the year both houses approved bills calling for deployment of nationwide missile defense but funding for theater missile defense programs was matter of dispute the authorization conference agreement establishes an independent organization within doe to oversee security and the president objected to these provisions even as he signed the bill into law finally the level of defense spending was resolved only at the very end of the appropriations process the senatepassed appropriations bill used about 49 billion of funds provided in the kosovo supplemental appropriations bill as an offset for defense increases and provided net total of 2647 billion 14 billion above the request the house bill provided 2687 billion in new budget authority 54 billion above

background congress provides funding for national defense programs in several annual appropriati ons measures the largest of which is the defense appropriations bill congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill which authorizes programs funded in all of the regular appropriations measures the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almost precisely the same level of detail as the defenserelated appropriations and congressional debate about major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related this report tracks congressional action on both measures the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the department of defense dod including pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities weapons procurement and research and development and for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department of defense though the bill also provides 1 relatively small unclassified amounts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management 2 classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by other agencies as well as by dod and 3 very small amounts for some other agencies five other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs2 the military cons truction appropriations bill which finances construction of military facilities and construction and operation of military family housing all administered by dod the energy and water development appropriations bill which funds atomic energy defense activities administered by the department of energy the vahudindependent agencies appropriations bill which finances civil defense activities administered by the federal emergency management agency and activities of the selective service system the commercejusti cestate appropriations bill which funds national securityrelated activities of the fbi and the transportation appropriations bill which funds some defenserelated activities of the coast guard the administrations fy2000 budget includes 2808 billion for the national defense budget function of which 2629 billion is requested in the defense appropriations bill status congressional action on defenserelated legislation began very early this year on february 24 the

270292 billion in budget authority and 26173 billion in outlays to the defense subcommittee total consistent with the amounts allocated to the national defense budget function in the budget resolution these allocations were subsequently reduced however in order to allocate somewhat more money to nondefense appropriations bills on may 25 the senate appropriations committee approved its initial allocations providing 265193 billion in budget authority and 253104 billion in outlays for the defense subcommittee these allocations too were later reduced allocations announced on september 15

congressional budget office in new budget authority for national defense in fy2000 the department of defense dod projects modest growth in defense spending in following years compared to longterm defense department projections last year the proposal represented significant increase in funding as the administration calculates it the plan reflects an increase of 126 billion in budget authority for defense programs in fy2000 and total increase of 112 billion over the sixyear fy20002005 period the main issue in congress was how to fit defense increases within overall federal budget constraints on april 15 both the house and the senate approved conference agreement on the fy2000 congressional budget resolution compared to the administration request the resolution provided an increase of 83 billion in budget authority for national defense the conference agreement on the defense authorization bill provides 2888 billion in budget authority at the budget resolution level the house and senate versions of the defense appropriations bill however did not quite reach the budget resolution level and the senate version was considerably lower than the house the senatepassed appropriations bill used about 49 billion of funds provided in the kosovo supplemental appropriations bill as an offset for defense increases and provided total of 2647 billion 14 billion above the request notehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs5 the defense appropriations bills are about 20 billion below the amount in the authorization bills because they do not include military construction and department of energy defenserelated activities the housepassed bill in contrast provided 2687 billion in new budget authority for the defense department and other agencies the amount available to dod and other agencies in the house bill was 54 billion above the request and 40 billion above the senate level the appropriations conference agreement reported on october 8 provides 2678 billion 1 billion below the house level and 45 billion above the request of the total 72 billion is provided as emergency appropriations which will raise the cap on total fy2000 discretionary funding by that amount in addition 26 billion of the total is considered to be offset by receipts from auctioning parts of the electromagnetic spectrum table 2 provides an overview of funding in each of the major defense bills for programs included in the defense appropriations measures in addition to debate about the level of defense spending several other issues arose early in the session including how much to increase military pay and benefits whether to require deployment of nationwide missile defense and whether to approve military operations against yugoslavia and how much money to provide for kosovorelated operations as action on annual defense authorization and appropriations bills progressed several other issues came onto the agenda including the following whether to approve one or more additional rounds of military base closures neither the house nor the senate versions of the defense authorization bill approve new base closures whether to limit peacekeeping operations in kosovo and haiti while operations against yugoslavia have been funded through the end of fy1999 future costs have not been addressed the house armed services committee hasc version of the authorization included controversial measure to prohibit use funds authorized in the bill for operations in kosovo but that provision was removed in floor vote after the white house said that it would seek supplemental appropriations to support peacekeeping mission the house also voted to end the us peacekeeping mission in haiti and the authorization conference agreement includes that provision how to structure theater missile defense tmd programs the authorization conference agreement rejects an administration plan to combine future funding for highaltitude theater missile defense programs the navy theater

to the administration request are for programs identified in unfunded priorities lists from each of the services the senate appropriations bill however also added funds for four f15 aircraft the house appropriations committee rejected the administration request for 19 billion for f22 fighter aircraft procurement and allocated the money to several areas including additional f15 and f16 aircraft procureme nt the appropriations conference agreement however restored most of the f22 funding how to address perceived shortfalls in military readiness the administrations proposed pay and benefits increases were designed to strengthen readiness by improving personnel recruitment and retention congress added to the pay and benefits increases and also added money for operation and maintenance om accounts most directly contributing to shortterm readiness the kosovo supplemental appropriations bill added about 31 billion for om and the fy2000 authorization conference agreement sets aside 16 billion in additional funds the appropriations conference agreement however adds just 11 billion for om and then reduces the total by 15 billion to offset amounts in the kosovo supplemental appropriations bill more farreaching issue is whether improved pay and benefits and added om funds get at the root causes of perceived problems whether to restructure the cooperative threat reduction program with states of the former soviet union the housepassed defense authorization bill reduced requested funding for chemical weapons demilitarization and increased funds for some nuclear weapons projects the authorization and appropriations conference agreements follow suit strategic nuclear force levels the sasc version of the authorization included provision allowing reduction in the number of deployed trident submarine from 14 to 18 but the bill also continued prohibition on reductions of other systems until russia ratifies the start ii treaty the senate rejected floor amendment by senator kerrey to repeal the restriction the authorization conference agreemen t includes compromise that may allow reductions in trident submarine deployment how to coordinate defenses against terrorism and other emerging threats sasc established new account in the authorization bill to coordinate funding to cope with terrorism and other emerging threats and increased funding the

4although the projected rate of growth in defense spending is modest the plan represents an end to the decline in military funding that has been underway since the mid1980s the turnaround under administration projections does not begin until fy2001 but this is mainly an artifact of the way the administration has proposed financing military construction projects in fy2000 see below for discussion the projected growth in spending is particularly substantial in weapons procurement under the administration plan purchases of new weapons will climb from 49 billion in fy1999 to 75 billion in fy2005 the longterm decline in funding for weapons acquisition has been particular focus of congressional concern for some time so the upturn in procurement is noteworthy table a3 in the appendix shows the administrations longterm plan broken down by appropriations title officials have broken down the 112 billion sixyear increase into three components 35 billion for improvements in pay and benefits for military personnel including acrossthe board pay raises of 44 in fy2000 and 39 per year thereafter pay table reform to provide higher raises in the upper grades changes in retirement benefits and increased bonuses and special pay 49 billion in operation and maintenance accounts of which about 10 billion is to cover higher pay raises for civilian defense department employees 29 billion for weapons modernization and facilities repair and replacement when the budget was being prepared dod officials say the chiefs of the military services requested about 148 billion in increased funding over the sixyear period the 112 billion addition they say includes all that the chiefs requested for personnel and readiness and about half of the amounts requested for weapons acquisition and facilities financing the administration plan the overarching budget issue for fy2000 has been how to cope with rather stringent limits on total discretionary spending while permitting an increase of some magnitude in defense expenditures under the budget enforcement act of 1997 part of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 total budget authority for discretionary programs was limited to 537 billion in fy2000 according to cbos initial estimates this year this amount is substantially below the fy1999 level though how much below depends on how the fy1999 baseline is defined3 any increase in the defense budget will further reduce funds available for nondefense discretionary spending the administration however wanted to increase both defense and nondefense discretionary spending while technically adhering to the budget limits the administrations answer was 1 to propose total discretionary budget authority and outlays considerably above the caps established in the 1997 budget agreement by applying savings in mandatory programs and increased revenues as offsets to increases in the discretionary part of the budget and 2 to use various accounting measures within the fy2000 defense budget to offset increases table 4 taken directly fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs10 dod briefing material shows how the administration has explained its proposed financing

negative amounts of mandatory funds questions have been raised about each of the offsets including inflation savings of the 112 billion increase that the administration proposed through fy2005 261 billion was offset by projected inflation savings savings of 38 billion were assumed in fy2000 the key issue is whether estimated increases in purchasing power are accurate defense officials have said that almost all of the projected savings are due to lower inflation in 1998 which established lower base for price trends in the future outyear inflation projections are only about 110th of 1 percent lower than last year perennial question is whether decisionmakers will agree to add money to the defense budget in the future if inflation accelerates split funding for fy2000 military construction projects the defense departments fy2000 military constructionfamily housing budget plan included 85 billion worth of projects but the administration requested only 54 billion in appropriations the remaining 31 billion was requested as advance appropriations to be scored as new budget authority in fy2001 the request to provide split funding for fy2000 projects was not change in policy but onetime exercise done only because of budget rules the intent was to reduce requested budget authority in fy2000 when caps on discretionary funding would remain in place and restore the funding in fy2001 when presumably the caps will be adjusted upward rescissions of prior year funds the administration proposed applying 165 billion of rescissions of prior year defense funds to offset the fy2000 total while it is quite common for the appropri ations committees to make such rescissions the amount is relatively large moreover congressional committees usually identify such savings toward the end of the budget processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs11 4 cbo reestimates of the administrations defense budget typically involve minor differences in counting budget authority levels and larger differences in outlaysand use them to offset unexpected costs or to pay for congressional initiatives the administration did not identify specific rescissions but this has been common practice in recent years rather than propose cuts that might aggravate some legislators the clinton administration has preferred to negotiate rescissions with congressional committees congressional action on the defense budget in congress the debate over the level of defense spending was intertwine d with the broader debate about the overall federal budget members of the congressional defense committees with considerable support from other legislators called for substantial increases to the military budget in addition to the increases the administration proposed they were also however critical of the accounting mechanisms that the administration employed to squeeze additional defense spending under the discretionary spending caps meanwhile congress rejected an increase in the discretionary caps and dismissed out of hand the offsets to increased discretionary spending that the administration proposed concurrently there was debate about the use of emergen cy supplemental appropriations for kosovo as mechanism to increase funding for defense readiness the result was rather complicated series of steps in which funds apparently added to the defense budget in one stage of the congressional process were eroded in following stages only to be restored in the final appropriations moreover at the end of the process appropriators took number of steps to reduce projected outlays in fy2000 in order to help meet overall spending targets here is brief overview of the process the congressional budget resolution for fy2000 hconres 68 approved by both chambers on april 15 provided 80 billion more in budget authority and 25 billion more in outlays for national defense in fy2000 than the administrations request using administration not cbo scoring of the request over the five year fy20002004 period the resolution projected 279 billion more in budget authority and 53 billion more in outlays for national defense than the administration table 5 shows the congressional plan compared to the administration estimate and to the congressional budget office reestimate of the cost of the administration projection4 two points stand out first projected increases in defense spending in the later years of the fiveyear period are not as large as in fy2000 and second there appears to be substantial mismatch in all years between increases in budget authority and projected increases in defense outlays the mismatch is especially severe according to cbo estimates none of the congressional defense committees agreed to the proposed 31 billion in split funding for military construction and neither sasc nor the senate nor the house appropriations committees accepted the proposed 165 billion in offsetting rescission s the final military construction appropriations bill does not agree to the split funding and most of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs12 rescissions in the final appropriations bill were of amounts earlier provided in the kosovo supplemental at least 31 billion of the 8 billion increase in defense funding therefore went simply to restore funds for financing mechanisms that congress rejected table 5 congressional budget resolution compared to

committee s conference report on the fy2000 concurrent budget resolution hrept 106 91 department of defense congress found its own ways of adding money to defense in spite of the fy2000 discretionary spending caps first by providing extra funds in the emergency supplemental appropriation s bill for kosovo hr 1141 and second by using projected revenues from auctioning parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as an offset for defense increases in all the kosovo funding bill provided 149 billion in supplemental appropriations and made 20 billion in offsetting rescissions of the supplemental funding about 11 billion was for the department of defense including funds for central america disaster assistance and disaster repairs at us facilities which is 53 billion more than the administration requested much of the added money was for programs that normally would be financed in regular fy2000 defense and military construction appropriations bills including 1838 billion for increased pay and benefits and 31 billion for military readinessrelated accounts and for munitions purchases most of the added amounts were in fastspending accounts ie accounts in which almost all new budget authority is actually expended as outlays in the first year available as result the added funds in hr 1141 helped to ease the apparent mismatch between budget authority and outlays in the budget resolution the house senate and conference versionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs13 of the defense appropriations bill all included 26 billion in assumed revenues from electromagnetic spectrum sales as defense offset some of the extra 5 billion for defense in the kosovo bill however was tapped in the fy2000 appropriations process as an offset to defense funding increases the senatepassed version of the fy2000 defense appropriations bill s 1122 included increases in various defense programs consistent with the budget resolution and the defense authorization bills but then used 1838 billion provided in the kosovo bill for personnel and 31 billion in the kosovo bill for readiness and munitions as offsets for the increases see table 2 above the net effect was that the senate used added emergency defense appropriations provided in the kosovo bill to provide most of the increase in fy2000 defense spending without counting against the caps on fy2000 discretionary spending thus freeing up more money for nondefense discretionary programs on june 8 the house leadership announced plans to take similar approach and the allocation of funds to the defense subcommittee was subsequently reduced the initial allocation approved in may provided 2703 billion and the bill as reported by the full committee on july 16 provides 2661 billion 42 billion lower part of the difference however was made up by counting anticipated receipts from radio spectrum sales of 26 billion as an offset to defense appropriations so the amount available to dod and other agencies in the house bill totaled 2687 billion the final conference agreement provided 2678 billion 1 billion less than the house and 44 billion more than the administration requested in the longer term projected increases in defense spending in the budget resolution will partly be taken up by the growing impact in future years of pay and benefits increases that congress added to the administration request in the final stages of the budget process congress took number of steps to limit estimated total defense outlays in fy2000 in order to help keep the overall budget within limits these steps include 1 instructing cbo to use omb scoring in estimating the outlay impact of defense appropriations which will reduce estimated outlays in fy2000 by about 105 billion 2 declaring 72 billion of budget authority with an outlay impact of about 55 billion according to cbo as emergency appropriations which will raise caps on total discretionary spending by those amounts and 3 requiring dod to delay progress payments to contractors which will reduce fy2000 outlays by an estimated 12 billion also assumed revenues of 26 billion from radio frequency spectrum sales reduce projected outlays by an equal amount and the 1838 billion in emergency appropriations for pay and benefits provided in the kosovo supplemental will raise the discretionary spending caps increased military pay and benefits as noted earlier the administration proposed package of pay and benefit improvements for military personnel estimated to cost about 35 billion over the next six years compared to earlier administration plans the package included 1 pay raises of 44 in fy2000 and 39 per year thereafter 2 pay table reform to reward promotions more than longevity 3 repeal of the redux retirement planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs14 5 see testimony of

personnel both the army and the navy suffered recruiting shortfalls in 1998 and all of the services have fallen somewhat short of retention goals recently in the past military pay raises like pay raises for civilian federal personnel have been pegged to ½ below the employment cost index eci measure of overall compensation trends in the economy as result military pay is now about 13 below the level it would have reached if pay raises since 1982 had equaled the eci some refer to this as the military pay gap though it is simply measure of trends since 1982 independent comparisons of military pay scales with the civilian economy generally have not confirmed shortfall of that magnitude the administrations proposed pay raises are 01 above the eci in fy2000 and at the projected eci in the future on february 24 the senate passed s 4 bill entitled the soldiers sailors airmens and marines bill of right act of 1999 that would have provided substantially larger pay and benefits package than the administration has proposed the bill would implement the administration proposals and in addition 1 provide 48 pay raise in fy2000 and peg raises to ½ above eci thereafter 2 allow personnel to choose 30000 bonus instead of shifting out of the redux retirement plan 3 provide subsistence allowance of 180 per month to personnel eligible for food stamps 4 make uniformed personnel eligible for the thrift savings plan now available to civilian federal employees and 4 significantly increase montgomery gi bill educational benefits according to congressional budget office estimates s 4 would cost about 9 billion more over the fy20002005 period than the administration plan5 while the senate voted overwhelmingly for s 4 the house didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs15 5 continued billion over five years and the cost of s 4 as 23 billion compared to baseline that assumed raises equal to the ecinot act on military pay and benefits bill as freestanding measure and instead pay and benefits improvements were considered as part of the fy2000 defense authorization bill authorization and appropriations action house and senate versions of the defense authorization bill both included larger pay and benefits increases than the administration requested the sasc version of the bill included all of the provisions of s 4 except for gi bill benefits in action on the floor the senate approved an amendment by senator cleland to approve the expansion of gi bill benefits as provided in s 4 pay and benefit provisions in the hasc version of the authorization were identical to those in the sasc bill with some exceptions 1 hasc provided for future raises equal to the eci rather than ½ higher and 2 hasc did not approve providing the thrift savings plan to uniformed personnel but instead required dod study of the proposal and 3 hasc did not include the 180 per month subsistence allowance on the floor however the house approved an amendment by rep buyer the chair of the hasc military personnel subcommit tee to provide the same thrift savings plan benefits as the senate the conference agreement on the authorization bill reflects compromise between the house and the senate as in the senate proposal it provides for higher than eci pay raises in the future but it does not expand gi bill benefits and it does not provide higher subsistence allowance pay and benefits increases are legislative matters to be considered in the defense authorization bill not in appropriations measures though the amount of money provided for military personnel in the appropriations bill is directly affected by any changes the kosovo supplemental appropriations bill hr 1141 provided 1838 billion for fy2000 pay and benefits increases enough to cover the administration estimate of the costs of the administrations 44 pay raise pay table reform and retirement reform later the conference agreement on the regular fy2000 defense appropriations bill provided sufficient funding for the larger congressional pay and benefits packages ballistic missile defense the administrations fy200020 05 longterm defense plan included several important initiatives on missile defense policy including 1 decision to provide total of 105 billion an increase of 66 billion over the fy19992005 period to fully fund preparations to deploy national missile defense nmd system beginning as early as 20032005 2 decision to accelerate the navy theater wide ntw system to allow it to compete with the theater high altitude area defense thaad system for the upper tier theater missile defense tmd role for deployment as early as 2007 and 3 decision to restructure the medium extended air defense system meads to limit costs in announcing these decisions on january 20 secretary of defense cohen acknowledged that the threat of longrange missile attack on us territory appeared to be materializing sooner than earlier intelligence assessments had estimated in particular secretary cohen cited north koreas test last year of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs16 multistage missile as evidence of the danger and he endorsed the findings of the rumsfeld commission which reported in august 1998 that rogue states could threaten the united states directly with longrange missiles within the next five years and without much advanced warning the change in the administrations threat assessment was ultimately reflected in its decision not to oppose an amended version of s 257 bill sponsored by senators cochran and inouye that calls for deploying nationwide missile defense as soon as technologically possible last year the administration opposed an essentially identical bill and the senate twice narrowly rejected cloture motions to bring it to vote this year the administration relented after amendments were added including statement that the united states seeks continued negotiated reductions in russian nuclear forces and provision that the secretary of defense must determine that the system will be operationally effective the senate passed the bill by vote of 973 on march 17 on march 18 by vote of 317105 the house passed hr 4 bill stating simply that it is us policy to deploy nationwide defense on may 18 the senate took up hr 4 and substituted the text of s 257 on may 20 by vote of 34517 the house approved the senate version the bill was sent to the president on july 12 and signed into law pl 10638 on july 22 although the administration longer opposes these measures officials insist that policy remains what it was to decide by mid2000 whether to deploy system and if decision to deploy is made to pursue deployment as the technology permits officials had said that deployment could begin as early as three years after decision is made to go ahead ie by 2003 but it now appears more likely that deployment could begin in 2005 at the earliest moreover the administration still argues that the 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty remains critically important to us security senior officials have said that they will endeavor to negotiate changes in the treaty with russia to permit deployment of nationwide defense many member s of congress however oppose continued adherence to the abm treaty there also continues to be some debate in congress about missile defense technology some legislators support heritage foundation proposal to deploy seabased nationwide defense defense officials have said that such system would be too costly also seabased system would clearly be incompatible with continued adherence even to an amended version of the abm treaty authorization and appropriations action though national missile defense remains matter of some contention theater missile defense tmd programs were the main focus of debate in action on fy2000 defense funding bills the senatepassed authorization bill included legislative provision that rejected the administration plan to combine the navy theater wide and thaad programs in the future requiring instead that the programs remain separately funded the authorization conference agreement accepts the senate language the authorizat ion conference agreement also adds funds for patriot pac3 procurement and rd as in the senate version of the bill the senate authorizatio n also added funds for the related spacebased infrared system high sbirshigh while the house bill transferred most funding for sbirs high from the air force to the ballistic missile defense organization these steps reflected congressional displeasure with air force plans to slow the sbirs development program the authorization conference agreement adds funds forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs17 sbirshigh but does not end air force management the appropriations conference agreement provides the same amount for sbirs but moves sbirs low funding from the demonstration and validation account to engineering and manufacturing development the senate authorization also mandated specific tests of the airborne

bill eliminated meads funding but the appropriations conference agreement restores funds table 7 provides detailed list of missile defense programs requested funding and congressional action military action in yugoslavia and forces in haiti during the week of may 17 both the house and the senate approved hr 1141 bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations against yugoslavia through the end of the fiscal year on september 30 dod officials have said that the amounts provided in the bill will be sufficient to cover the costs of the 78 days of the air campaign plus peacekeeping costs through september 30 though little will be left over to finance costs of peacekeeping operations in fy2000 in briefing for congressional appropriations committees on september 9 dod officials provided an estimate that costs of us participation in the peacekeeping mission will total 2042 billion in fy2000 some of these costs they said can be covered by left over funding for the air campaign operations in the persian gulf and reduced level of operations in bosnia leaving 178 billion to be financed by supplemental appropriations the white house has not yet submitted formal request to congress for these funds authorization and appropriations action funding for operations against yugoslavia was major issue in house action on the fy2000 defense authorization bill the hasc version of the bill included controversial provision that would have prohibited the use of any funds in the bill for operations in yugoslavia and that would direct the administrati on to request supplemental funds if operations continue into fy2000 there was extensive debate about this provision during the hasc markup of the bill and opponents said they would offer floor amendment to delete the provision subsequently the white house sent letter to the house speaker explicitly threatening to veto the measure if it included the provision the house rules committee then ordered the provision removed in the version of the bill to be considered on the floor several members opposed this decision however and their opposition was one factor in the leaderships decision to withdraw the proposed rule on may 27 subsequently the authorization was brought to the floor with revised rule that did not excise the kosovo funding provision on june 10 however by vote of 270 to 155 the house approved an amendment by rep skelton to remove the provision but only after the white house agreed to seek additional supplemental funding for peacekeeping operations in kosovohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs18

has not imposed restrictions on administration policy in kosovo though request for supplemental appropriations to pay for the peacekeeping mission in fy2000 has not yet been submitted and it could become focus of debate the us troop presence in haiti was also an issue in the house on june 9 the house approve d an amendment to the authorization bill by rep goss prohibiting the continuous deployment of us forces in haiti after december 31 1999 the authorization conference agreement includes prohibition on such deployments after may 31 2000 the administration had strongly objected to this provision but has now announced plans to withdraw forces from haiti base closures this year the defense department once again urged congress to approve two more rounds of military base closures one in 2001 and the second in 2005 officials argue that cuts in the defense infrastructure have lagged far behind cuts in the size of the force and that funding for major weapons programs in the future depends on improving efficiency over the next few years for the past two years congress has rejected additional base closure rounds in part opponents have complained that the white house politicized the base closure process in 1995 when it acted to keep aircraft maintenance facilities in texas and california open as privately run operations after the base closure commission had recommended their closure authorization and appropriations action neither the hasc nor the sasc version of the authorization approved additional base closures sasc narrowly rejected an amendment in the committee markup by senators levin and mccain to establish one more round in 2001 and the full senate rejected their amendment on may 26 by vote of 6040 the matter was not an issue in the authorization conference major weapons programs and military service unfunded priorities lists the house appropriations committee version of the defense appropriations bill eliminated 19 billion requested to procure six f22 fighter aircraft though it approved 12 billion to continue f22 development the committee report provided an extensive rationale for procurement pause in the f22 program that the air force has been financing the f22 while suffering from severe and worsening shortfalls in many other areas that the f22 has been experiencing technical problems that f22 affordability is questionable that costs have not been controlled and that future cost growth is likely that the united states has an overwhe lming numerical advantage in advanced fighters without the f22 and that there are many alternativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs20 6 the lists are reprinted in inside the pentagon march 4 1999 pp 1 1223to the f22 particulary upgrades of the current generation f15 in lieu of f22 procurement the committee proposed increased funding for air force personnel recruitment and retention for aircraft spare parts for upgrades of number of aircraft programs and for procuring 8 f15e aircraft 5 additional f16s and 8 kc130j cargo aircraft for the marine corps in statements to the press and in the full committee markup of the defense bill subcommittee leaders expressed hope that the f22 decision will open farreaching discussion of longterm air force requirements and priorities for its part the air force vigorously defended of the f22 arguing that even some currently available fighters in the world are more capable than the f15 that some future aircraft will be more capable still and that temporary delay in f22 procurement would increase program costs by 6 billion if suppliers were forced to shut down and restart production later in house appropriations committee markup rep kingston offered and then withdrew an amendment to restore f22 procurement funds and on the house floor rep barr offered and then withdrew similar amendment f22 production was the major issue in conference with the senate debate over other weapons issues this year has been relatively muted in response to request from the house armed services committee each of the military service chiefs prepared list of priority programs that are not funded in the administrations fy2000 request and fy20002005 plan the unfunded priorities amounted to 87 billion in fy2000 and 45 billion over the fy20002005 period6 this total is somewhat higher than the 36 billion in unfunded requests that senior civilian dod officials acknowledged reflecting changes since the budget review was completed in recent years congress has used similar lists from the services as guide in allocating additions to the administration defense request of the 87 billion total for fy2000 about 39 billion is for weapons procurement and rd including about 760 million for the air force 12 billion for the army 960 million for the navy and 940 million for the marine corps authorization and appropriations action the conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill provides total of 2522 billion for the f22 program including 1222 billion for rd 1 billion for acquisition of aircraft and 300 million in advance fy2001 appropriations for program termination liability the 1 billion for aircraft acquisition was provided in transfer account and up to 277 million of the total may be used for advance procurement of components of aircraft to be fully funded next year the total amount provided for the f22 is about 500 million below the request 185 billion in procurement and 12 billion in rd the conference agreement also prohibits award of an initial lowrate production contract unless certain testing is successfully completed aside from the f22 debate all of the defense bills added some funds for weapons procurement and rd see table 2 above for breakdown of committee action by title and

hac bill added funds for 8 kc130s the appropriations conference report provides funds for 1 kc 130j for the marine corps and 1 ec130j for the air force the senate authorization bill provided 375 million and the house authorization 15 million for advance procurement of new lhd class amphibious ship while the house appropriations bill provided funds and the senate bill 500 million the authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide the 375 million this ship lhd8 is included in the navys longterm shipbuilding plan for purchase in fy2005 the senate approach which congress has used in the past is to provide about 25 of the cost initially and the remainder next year this will accelerate procurement and according to proponents could lower the cost of the ship now estimated at about 175 billion by about 200 million other major congressional additions include 1 funds for additional uh60 blackhawk helicopters for the army 2 funds for additional v22 tilt rotor aircraft for the marine corps and 3 funds for advance procurement for additional e8 jstars radar aircraft significantly neither the house nor the senate version of the defense authorization endorsed additional funds for f15 aircraft procurement but the senate approved an amendment to the defense appropriations bill by senator bond to allocate 220 million to purchase 4 f 15es and the hac bill provided 440 million for 8 f15s the authorization conference agreement does not include any funding but the appropriations conference provides 300 million for 5 aircraft initially this became an issue because boeing has announced plans to shut down the production line in st louis unless additional orders for the aircraft appear either from foreign governments or from the air force in one of the few ongoing debates over major weapons programs other than the f22 senator feingold offered two amendments to the defense authorization bill on the fa18 ef program one to ensure compliance with contract specifications prior to the start of fullrate production was approved by voice vote on may 27 second amendment to place cost cap on the program was rejected by vote of 8711 on may 27 one other issue concerns procurement of precisionguided munitions like the tomahawk cruise missile and the joint direct attack munition jdam that were used extensively in operations against yugoslavia the house authorization added 300 million to restart tomahawk production 110 million for additional joint standoff weapon jsow procurement and 114 million for additional jdams the authorization conference however rejected resumption of tomahawk production electing as the administration has proposed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs22 upgrade older missiles while waiting for production of new cheaper replacement called the tactical tomahawk to begin the conference agreement also adds 50 million for jdam procurement but none for jsow funding to rebuild munitions stocks was however provided in the kosovo supplemental appropriations bill final major weaponsrelated issue this year concerned funding for multiyear procurement of major weapons programs multiyear procurement permits the services to make contracts with industry guaranteeing future purchases in return for lower prices since such guarantees assume future funding standing law requires that they be approved in advance in authorization and appropriations bills this year the house appropriations committee refused to approve any new multiyear procurement on the grounds that longterm service funding plans are too unsettled the defense department vigorously protested and the matter was an issue in the appropriations conference in the end the appropriations conference agreement approves most of the multiyear procurement programs that were requested but it puts restrictions on multiyear procurement in the m 1a2 tank upgrade program military readiness perceived shortfalls in levels of military readiness have been major impetus to administration and congressi onal support for higher levels of defense spending secretary of defense cohen and all of the members of the joint chiefs of staff have acknowledged some readiness problems including shortfalls in meeting recruiting targets problems in retaining skilled personnel shortages of spare parts training munitions and some other equipment and in general strains caused by the ongoing postcold war pace of military operations much debate remains however about the extent of the problems and the adequacy of administration and congressional efforts to address them one rationale for adding unrequested funding for pay and benefits and for military readiness to the kosovo supplemental bill hr 1141 was to provide encouragement to troops and to bolster readiness accounts beyond amounts likely to be available within constraints on discretionary spending in the 1997 budget agreement authorization and appropriations action in addition to some 225 billion in the kosovo supplemental for readinessrelated budget accounts both the hasc and the sasc authorization bills added more funds hasc provided 28 billion and sasc 12 billion more for operation and maintenanc om accounts than was requested the conference agreement adds about 16 billion the senate appropriations committee however approved an increase of just 626 million in the fy2000 appropriations bill and the total was to be reduced by amounts provided earlier in the kosovo supplemental appropriations bill in contrast the hac bill provided 24 billion more than requested for om and did not propose an offset the appropriations conference agreement provides 11 billion more for om than was requested but uses about 15 billion of funds in the kosovo supplemental as an offset to the total the main readinessrelated issue this year has been whether higher pay and benefits will adequately improve recruitment and retention considerable debate continues about the state of readiness and the likelihood that increased pay and benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs23 7 general accounting office weapons of mass destruction effort to reduce russian arsenals may cost more achieve less than planned report number nsiad9976 apr 13 1999and added operating funds will solve underlying problems neither the house nor the senate has systematically addressed factors that have led to relatively high operational tempo in parts of the military force unresolved issues include whether and how to limit the number of overseas operations forward presence requirements and the organizational ability of each of the services to respond to postcold war deployments cooperative threat reduction the administration requested 4755 million for the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program which provides assistance to states of the former soviet union in safeguarding nuclear materials dismantlin g missiles and other weapons and in other demilitarization measures although the basic goals of the program have been widely supported there have in the past been disputes about the size of the program the pace of funding obligations and particular projects to be funded in general the house has been more critical of the program than the senate authorization and appropriations action sasc approved the administration ctr request without change though it trimmed funds for two related programs in the department of energy cutting the initiative for proliferation prevention from 30 million to 25 million and the nuclear cities initiative from 30 million to 15 million hasc reduced ctr funding for chemical weapons demilitarization assistance dramatically providing 246 million 1058 million below the request the ctr chemical weapons program hasc said should not be directed at the expensive task of destroying weapons stocks but instead should support russian efforts to ensure stockpile security this mandate was based in large part on general accounting office evaluation of the ctr program7 hasc also proposed language making into permanent law various restrictions on the program that have been inserted in annual bills including prohibitions on the use of funds for peacekeeping housing environmental restoration defense conversion or job retraining hac followed the house authorization with one exception it proposed adding 12 million for biological weapons proliferation prevention the authorization conference agreement follows the house approach on chemical weapons demilitarization cuts doe programs as in the senate bill and makes restrictions on the program permanent the appropriations conference agreement provides 4605 million for ctr 15 million below the request and the authorization but it does not provide any policy guidance except for general provision that prohibits expenditure of funds for housing programs strategic nuclear force levels in defense authorization bills since fy1996 congress has included prohibition on the reduction of strategic nuclear delivery systems to levels below those established by the start i treaty until russia ratifies the start ii agreement while there hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs24 been some sentiment in the defense department for making further force reductions the cost of maintaining start i force levels has been relatively modest so there has been little opposition to the congressional mandate this year however the navy has requested permission to plan for reduction from 18 to 14 trident ballistic missile submarines in order to avoid costs of refueling overhaul of the oldest vessels authorization and appropriations action the sasc bill included provision allowing reduction in the number of deployed trident submarines from 18 to 14 but the senate rejected floor amendment by senator kerrey to repeal all restrictions on reductions in strategic forces the hasc bill included provision that would permanently codify limits on the retirement of strategic systems unless start ii is approved but would allow the president some flexibility to reduce total force levels the president would be allowed to restructure forces provided the total force includes at least 98 of the 6000 warheads allowed by start i the authorization agreement follows the house language with an amendment that will allow the administration to reduce trident submarine levels provided the president makes certain certifications emerging threats in recent years more and more attention has been focused on new threats to us security and especially on challenges that may directly endanger the us homeland earlier this year the senate armed services committee established new subcommittee on emerging threats and capabilities to focus on new challenges to us security authorization and appropriations action sasc established new budget account in the operation and maintenance title for combating terrorism the purpose of the account is to consolidate funding for counterterrorism programs and increase their visibility sasc provided 1954 billion for the account adding about 120 million to amounts requeste d in various other parts of the budget hac provided 50 million extra for counterterrorism programs in general provision the authorization conference agreement does not establish separate account for counterterrorism activities social issues social issues such as abortion gays in the military and the role of women in the armed forces have frequently been matters of debate in defense funding bills in recent years last year gender integrated training was major issue this year congressionally mandated commission recommended that each of the military services retain the authority to determine the level at which gender integrated training be carried out and the report appears to have quelled debate authorization and appropriations action hasc approved measure to permit abortions at military hospitals for women who are victims of rape or incest an amendment during the markup however required that women must previously have filed sexual abuse charges to make such claim current law permits the use of appropriated funds for abortions only if the life of the woman is in dangerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs25 on may 26 the senate rejected by 5149 an amendment by senators murray and snowe to repeal the current law that prohibits us military health care facilities overseas from providing abortions for us military personnel at private expense on june 9 the house rejected similar amendment by representative meek the authorization conference agreement does not include the house provision leaving the existing prohibition on abortions intact china policy and department of energy reorganization last year congress included several measures in the defense authorization bill to limit technology transfers to china including provision transferring responsibility for reviewing licenses for satellite exports from the commerce department to the state department policy toward china continues to be matter of great concern in congress especially in view of recent evidence of chinese spying at nuclear weapons labs the house select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns chaired by rep cox released its report publicly on may 25 the committee recommended several measures to tighten restrictions on technology exports to china authoriza tion and appropriations action the hasc bill included limits on militarytomilitary contacts with china and established center for the study of chinese military affairs at the national defense university the sasc bill included measures to tighten security at department of energy labs several significant amendments were proposed to the authorization bills in both the house and the senate in the wake of the cox committee report on may 27 the senate approved lott amendment to increase monitoring of the export of advanced satellite technology to require annual reports about chinese military capabilities against taiwan and to further strengthen security and counterintelligence at department of energy facilities the house added several amendments including coxdicks amendment codifying into law recent administration initiatives to improve doe security and counterintelligence programs the house also approved delay amendment limiting the substance of uschina militarytomilitary contacts the house rejected ryun amendment that would have imposed twoyear moratorium on the doe foreign visitors programs significantly rep spence did not offer an amendment that the administration strongly opposed to transfer responsibility over nuclear weapons programs from the department of energy to the department of defense later on july 21 the senate approved an amendment to the intelligence authorization bill hr 1555 offered by senator kyl to establish an independent organizati on within the department of energy to oversee security the defense authorization conference agreement includes revised provision establishing an organization within the department called the national nuclear security administration to oversee security and counterintelligence on september 15 by vote of 139281 the house rejected motion to recommit the conference agreement with instructions to remove this provision secretary of energy richardson had strongly objected to this measure but after the house and senate approved the conference agreement by large margins he withdrew his objections clearing the way for the president to sign the bill into law in signing the bill however the president announced that he was designated the secretary of energy to act as the head ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30205crs26 the new agency most recently however secretary richardson has promised that the administration will nominat separate director of the nssa the authorization conference agreement also includes measures limiting militaryto military contacts
