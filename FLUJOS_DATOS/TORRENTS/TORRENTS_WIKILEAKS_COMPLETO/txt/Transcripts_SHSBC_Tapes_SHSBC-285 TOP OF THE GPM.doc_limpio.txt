top of the gpm lecture given on 16 april 1963 how are you how are you well this is the what the 16th of april ad 13 saint hill special briefing course well today i could talk to you about lot of things i could talk to you about quite few things talk to you about goals talk to you about gpms talk to you about the basics of auditing but id rather talk to you at the moment on the subject of the gpm 1 frankly have been somewhat holding you back from getting too enthusiastic going down the bank because you omit the tops of some of these goals and the results can be quite catastrophic and believe it or not i didnt know what the top of goal was exactly like even after doing dozen gpmsi still couldnt guarantee what the pattern of the top of gpm was now i finally managed to get this squared up now ive been restraining some of your enthusiasm for going down into bank and knocking bank together out of any old thing and then going on and finding the next goal and then going on and finding the next goal and then going on and finding the next goal and running part of that bank and then going on and finding the next one this perhaps is forgivable from the standpoint of research i myself have had to do it thats particular reason you should or your pc should now some of the banks that we get in here and weve seen some actual banks of one kind or another some of these banks are the most incredible hotchpotchs and potpourris which i think you have ever seen they are absolutely incredible in the whole bank there are nothing but few locks and numerous pieces of other gpms this is quite interesting we just had one in here from california that was enough to fry your hair now this applies very much to goals finding and you know i wouldnt i just wouldnt let pc have the goal to create the goal to do to be to have to be cause to cause any such goal i just wouldnt let the pc have it it appeared on the list i wouldnt touch it id just go right over the top of it and go somewhere else that sounds strange doesnt it well let tell you after id had ten banks very thoroughly run lot of items still in them and so forth the goal to create got onto list and the auditor started to drill the goal to create and the whole bank started to beef up and listen id had ten banks runtenand the goal to create appears somewhere at about bank fifteen well in other words with that many banks run i still couldnt even stand to have the goal to create be drilled you know to be tiger drilled why well in actual fact these goals are quite ancient and the earlier you get on the track the more force and velocity there is in the energy and enthusiasm with which thetan mocked these things up and you get recurrence of that when you go back too early on the track well let tell you something the goal to create is two hundred and sixteen trillion thats the beginnings of it and that goal is multitrillion year goal and youre going to take some pc that cant even sit still in an auditing chair and youre going to find this goal on him and youre going to run it haha i think i dont know where the goal to be is but i think its before that now naturally the wickedest goal in the bank is the goal to create but you are going to take the goal to be the goal to create the goal to cause the goal to be cause and you are going to run this on somebody thathahaha youre not youre not going to make it why not its too early too early you could probably steer him through it one way or the other and you might even come out the other end with live pc might be if you were lucky and its all straightened up but you get goals in here of one kind or another andim just giving that business about the big goals on the pcs list the pcs just being enthusiastic and ambitious his goal is probably not to breathe in mouses nostrils and youre going to run on him the goal to create haha thats silly you see i mean its beyond the reality of the pc dont you see now goal tends to present itself by its context most of the goals found as the first goal found are designed to be found lets take one the goal to know of course presents itself like that why because you want to know somebodys goal so he says all right its the goal to know you get the idea its pretty early goal not unrunnable but pretty early lets take another example lets take the goal not to be detected well you say how does this present itself well because its got someone who wants to be detected or something like that in its top oppterms which the pc is dramatizing so they give you this goal not to be detected because the pc wants to be detected the goal to find of course is natural the goal to know the truth is another natural these goalsdo you understand what im saying to youthey tend to present themselves because of their significance now goals behave in significant ways but the running of goal has to do with significance only to the degree of getting the right items not whether pc cognites or not we dont care whether he cognites all we want to see is that meter rocket reading and thats all we want to see and the amount of recovery the pc will make is simply the number of banks and the amount of charge which we remove from the case the pcs confront goes up in direct ratio to the amount of charge removed from the case and his confront does not go updoes not definitely not go upon the amount of confronting he does of the bank this is athis is peculiarity about the gpm in other words you couldnt familiarize somebody with the bankits entirely proposition of charge well this becomes quote quite important to us it tells us that the pc is going to be as able as we find gpms and run them out not as able as they are significant do you understand that we have two pcs one is to have goal to be good the other has goal to be bad man well all right we run those out we get an equal recovery as far as the actual status of the case and the ability of the case is concerned which is comparable in other words one gpm equals one so many ergs of recovery dont you see now the fact that one has different experiential track than the other has nothing really to do with auditing this fellow has an experiential track which hasnever has anything to do with business all down the track he has nothing to do with business well of course hes going to wind up with an experiential track which to some degree omits business but at the same time has experience with business because its direct opposite you spend half your time in gpm doing the opposite to the goal so the significance of the goal is not of very great importance now the significance of the goal however means something to the auditor it means that goal which is so worded is more likely to present itself than goal that isnt so worded all right let give you an example if pc had the goal to present this goal to the auditor that is the goal which the pc would give to the auditor and the auditor would find on the pc well in lesser degree this is true all the way down the line so that mediocre goals or quasiquasi goals are rather difficult to find because they dont dramatize their own presentation do you understand that to that degree significance is important now significance is also important in wording up the gpm thats very significant because the right items in gpm are worded certain way and wrong items arent now you get gpm and somebody has allegedly had found on him to create this is his first goal see oh ah anybody see it read i doubt it if anybody saw it read it read for moment and the pc quietly expired but they went ahead and found some items well now they found the item steam locomotive lady astronomy pigsties and one we saw this morning had the marvelous thing ofthe goal to create i think had in it or some such goalthe goal had in it the name of the auditor i know we had itthe auditor had the same name two hundred and sixteen trillion years ago see its ridiculous in other words he didnt find any part of the goal to create they found the goal to create but didnt find any part of the goal to create now do you see what happens when you go too far backtrack with one of these goals well it isnt enough to abandon some pcs goal that is rocket reading just to say well thats too far backtrack the thing to do is to have confidence that you can plow the pc through anything providing it rocket reads but plowing him through that much backtrack well it just wouldnt happen it just wouldnt happen youd never get him into it youd find whole lot of lock items of one kind or another unless you piloted him very directly now i am not saying that you should abandon the pcs goal that is rocket reading because it is too early track but im saying that the pcs goal run is going to give you great deal of difficulty most of these whole statement goals which are brave and upstanding like to confront you know thats great goal thats nice goal thats way back on the track and the goal you are looking for in actual fact is lot more modern pc isnt as full of vinegar in modern time hes got reservations as to how much power he has hell have goal something like to get along all right or to get along or goal to get out or goal to quit or goal not to quit unless i have to you understand or goal like to make it somehow to not be sad ooh you know i mean these are interesting goals or there may be some minor goals the pc knows he can do which is to reforest earth or something or thats pretty the goal that im talking about isthe later it is on the track the more significance it is going to have that doesnt naturally hold true because the escape goals the not confront goalsnot the goal to be free thats probably pretty earlybut the escape goal like to never go to school see something like that such goal as that is more likely to be in present time and such goal as to confront to do to be to have to create to cause to be cause goals of that character are very early track in other words the whole simple thought is backtrack and the more complicated nonconfront forms are present timeish you got the idea present time could contain goal such as to be man you see all right thats finite goal on this pc the goal presents itself to cause and the auditor drills this goal to cause and can never get the thing to go out it wont go out and it wont rocket read and it wont do this and it wont do that well it cant be run dont you see but to be man that can be run that is runnable and because it is runnable the individual is able to get through it all right so much for that now the later goal is on the track the more the pc was likely to dramatize it and the most important goal to the pc is the one which includes present time and the top of that goal may not be there fully because it may not be fully developed he may not have lived all the way through that goal yet but nevertheless what top that goal has will be the hidden standard will be the chronic present time problems of the pc you see that thats as far as the whole track is concerned in other words the pc is much more likely to dramatize recent goal than an ancient goal you got that all right now that looks at the whole gpms see all of them now the later an item is in gpm the later an item is in gpm the more likely it is to be dramatized and the less reality the pc has on it and that is also true of the whole track the pc has less reality on modern goal than an early goal pc has less reality on the top of gpm than its middle now you asknow this has great deal to do with runningyou ask pc you say oh give an item in your gpm you see its to decide you see its to decide and he gives you maybe in other words its not not decide and its not to decide hell give you the crossover area pcs tend to give you the middle of the gpm and left to their own devices more likely give you the middle of the track they dramatize however the material latest in the gpm and the material latest on the track well now thatsthis is all data this is actually vital data it isnt the type of data which you think you can get along without because you cant now mary sue did the rather fantastic i dont know how many auditing hours she put in over easter but she did the rather fantastic thing of running fifty gpm bank in seven and half hours which is the average time of an ri every nine minutes which includes all breaks arguments administration upsets everything one every nine minutes sevenanda halfhour sprint which encompassed the whole of one gpm now i dont know the gpms have less in it they probablysome of them may have less items in itin themthan this particular gpm but there were at least fifty items in this gpm and the reason there were at least fifty items in it isi know we didnt miss many because missing one was something like being blasted out of the chair the second you missed an item why the whole world sort of went nyaah and the corners of the room went out of plumb and got sick at my stomach and so forth this body did not like it at all any one of these items in this gpm was the equivalent charge to bank later on the trackthan whole gpm later on the track this thing is crusher im speaking from experience im speaking of the goal to create and we ran it out last night in sevenandahalfhour sprint rather fantastic why did i have to do this well we actually took the goal to be cause to cause and the goal to create to get early enough on the track to get the plot and form of the gpm why well the laterthe later items are terribly obscured awfully nailed down and awfully hard to get at they do not reveal themselves easily and we had run all the way back down i think to create is about the fifteenth gpm ive run we havent prepchecked these things we havent cleaned up all the items in them but this one we did clean up well in order to get the pattern of the gpm well weve been struggling along in that direction and ive been trying very hard to get it and suddenly it came to view why the top of the gpm is missing and the top of the gpm is missing for this excellent reason i dont know if you can see this or not the top items of the gpm the first fourteen itemsthat is to say the first twelve items down from the top of gpm i said fourteen because i know the next two but the first twelve items are simply positivenegative in other words weve got one here which is noun you see and thats the noun and over here we have noun now if pc dramatizesyou see this is yourthis is your oppterm and this is your term now if the pc dramatizes the top of the bank more easily than the bottom of the bank hahahaha what happened to the top of the gpm this gets very interesting what happened to it well noun overlaid noun top oppterm was noun you see lets say it was to scream you see so this is scream or screams now this would be screams the top terminal is just screams simple as that well with these two collapsed on each other every time the pc looks at screams he says its not screams you see he says you see screams well its screams so there arent any screams now the next one is is the goal with an ing form followed by same see so thats screaming and every time the pc would look at it this top being collapsed term and oppterm the terminal of course is screaming so every time he looks at screaming well he sees immediately then that thereits you know itstheres screaming you see its not there and thats true of the first twelve items of the top of gpm every one of them is cancelled out by the fact that its direct negative youve got the top five oppterms and they are all followed by negatives and they go the next one here goes ers and its ers and the next one is horribly enough ingness ingness and this is ingness and then it is ishness and then ishness and then finally ivity and i thinkof course i havent compared this to the top rungs as far as the upper goals are concernedbut i think there is whole constant because this is in das master plan that you chumps laid down i dont know what the hell is the matter with you people what did youwhat did you do that for you know thats silly anyhow heres thisheres this puzzle the next one down from that on the oppterm side is beings who goal or people who goal depending on what part of the track you are on you know if you are on the early track there arent any people you might have been back there sometime you might have noticed there are people and of course on this side why of course its being who never goals or later on the track someone who never goals well anyhow whats all this positivenegative proposition well its just gradient scale of how the goal increases now of course thesei might have these one or two of these turned around but what you are looking at here is the is the first real look at one of these gpm tops and the idiocy here of course is this negative all on the terminal side the firsti said five thats not correct one two three four five six the first six terminals from the top and the first six oppterms from the top exactly compare except the terminals have in front of them or not now you get beingness form goal like to beto be slap happy and you then get the ing of course is being slap happy and this of course is not being slap happy over here im talking about the second from the top the top and then the next one to it this goal ing means of course being slap happy and the negative version is not being slap happy now some of you unfortunate people who have cooked up goal which is to skate on the empire state embankment unless the police catch up with nevertheless have all these goal forms as far as i can find out and how you squeeze all that into single goal form i dont know but heresheres the weird one about this thing weve got to be slap happy you see well how do you get it into an er form what are the ers well oddly enough the bank wasnt laid in in english i dont know if that ever occurred to you or not but you havent been speaking english very long and what you are doing is approximating in english just thetan thought concept which exists without semantics so much for hayakawa and korzybski semantics isnt the endall of everything its just what semantic sits on the thought concept because thetan can hold this thought concept and of course these thought concepts are not expressed in english and you get such thing as being slap happers or some such thing being slap happers and you get slap happingness being slap happingness and you get slap happyishness and you get slap happyivity that sounds like gobbledygook but youre going to be the most amazed person in the world when you find it start rocket reading on your pc oh ho he says whats this whats this whats this well its because he didnt live the bank in english he didnt live it in any language and that you could get it into english at all is fabulous now this ishness is quite interesting its different thanwell lets take lets take create see we have creating creators creatingness thats all perfectly happy and we also have creativity well this one in here whats this ishness well actually you have creatishness it means the tendency the tendency toward creatingness and that all matches up in english to the actual thought concepts that are in it which i think is quite amusing but anyway theres the top of the gpm and of course each one of those things has suitable negative and to skate on the empire state building so the police wont catch oh brother youve got job on your hands how do you make that into noun well its not skating upon the top of the empire state building so the police wont catch its probably skated or its probably well it will be something on the thing that says the nounal form of skate to skate you see and maybe thats skut but whatever it is you take to bring all of my money home to my mother you see this noun form becomes brought all my money home to my mother see some such expression but it is what it is and it will not be paycheck you understand see it wont be different word itll be brought all of my money home to my mother you see itll be that sort of thing it might even be brought home money you see but whatever it is it is what it is and fits under that noun form now right across from it of course is not it you see brought money home to my mother something of that sort and that will express this concept now of course its very easy bringing money home to my mother and not bringing money home to my mother bringers of money home to my mother and bringers of money home to my mother bringingness of money home to my mother bring or not or not bringing home bringingness home to my mother bringingness money home to my mother bringishness money home to my mother not bringishness home money home to my mother and bringivity and you say oh that isnt english youre right youre right you didnt lay these banks in in english i think its quite amusing and of course the joke is on the poor pc who has such goal as his first goal and the poor auditor who finds the goal knowing he had better find the goal not to be or something like this but find the goal to be good sweet little fairy who makes children happy haha well of course you just keep working on the verb form of it till it fits in now its got to rocket read and the odd part of it is youll find it does rocket read now there is school of thought of what is ron doing entering my bank this way well id say youve got an awfulyouve got an awful slow reaction if you have that school of thought but what have i been doing for thirteen years thats just bum you just noticed what do you think of somebody that just noticed hes being processed after thirteen years anyhow the thing is what it is it isnt what i say it is and youll find out that your pc will stay very comfortable will feel very good and everything is fine if you run the whole gpm with nonsense about it and you get the whole gpm and the pc will feel very strange indeed if you dont run the whole gpm and if you can catch pc with late goal and run the whole thing or even if the goalwhatever the goal he gave you catch the early goal and struggle with it if you have to and you run the whole thing and you get it beginning with the top oppterm and go right on through without bypassing single item work it right on down to the bottom of the gpm do your ri oppose list at the bottom of the gpm to get rid of that goal as an ri do all that prepcheck it up youll check it upcheck its items make sure nothings ticking just everything in it prepcheck it up youre going to feel marvelous youre going to feel marvelous but if you leave the top there find bunch of items that belong to another bank and get the goal discharged somehow and get down to the bottom of it and try to prepcheck this muck that wont prepcheck so then you go and find the next goal and do the same thing with it and find the next goal and do the same thing with it and find the same goal and do the same thing with it and the next goal and do the same thing with it youre going to have an awful uncomfortable pc now your pc is going to be uncomfortable enough with goal entered and couple of bypassed items in it how do you think your pcs going to feel with four or five or six or eight unfinished gpms well hes going to feel pretty grim therefore it is very very important for you to know the anatomy of gpm because let let you in on something here do you know that nobody listing straight in gpm including has hit the top they hit the middle beautifully but they never hit the top they never hit the top they just never put it on the list thats remarkable when you come to think about it well thats because its too late on the track now the things will fire if you present them to the pc so you get thing called directive listing whichin which you direct the pcs attention to what you want for what particular spot on the thing now this goes contrary to what we have done formerly but its not evaluative because youre not saying your item is you say give the noun form of your goal and the pc doesnt give it to you he gives something else well keep taking down what he gives you keep telling him the noun form what is the noun form of roaring and the pc says oh roar thats the verb form oh its also the noun form isnt it roar yeah well ill put that on the list roar okay it rocket reads thats it you are away test the thing and so forth and you say now give the negative form of that and he says negative roars and you say and he said well not roaring the negative form you know like roar he says well all right if you want to put it that way roar you say that rocket reads he says it does well what do you know about that you know they protest sometimes for moment or two what are you doing entering my bank how do you know what ive been doing all this time its about time we found out what hes been doing all this time anyhow you steer himsteer him into your proper forms for these and youll find they will fire promptly and properly in sequence now in keeping with this here is very good news early on the track where they are hardest to run there are items in the bank items in the bank none which do not contain the goal as part of the wording got that there are none so if this holds true on up the track and forward into present time then you wont get any more goals whereby you have to be lady oppterm 49 steam locomotive terminal astronomy see to be lady well its just lady or whatever it is i dont know what lady is in its noun form youll have to figure that out some day its not gentlewoman and there it is you say the thing sits there and then it goes down the line imperfect being lady activeactive lady being you get this kind of thing its got be lady be lady in one form or another its people who are ladies its someone its someone who would never be lady you got the idea its lady lady being lady be lady ladying so forth its just being lady imperfect ladies and so forth and it doesnt even get down to tarts its just the hopelessness of being lady is low oppterm dont you see its just lady lady lady lady lady you get you get the pcs item and it doesnt have the goal expressed in it one way or the other if the whole bank follows the basic pattern of the very early big beefy banks why then wed say it appeared in each one now we cant guarantee this is the truth in all of the later banks because we might get variation but i have found this to be the case that you can pick off lots of locks that will rr and apparently disappear when you actually have left sitting right there the key item lets takelets take the item of being tiger all right weve got this item and its got lock on it and its imitating large animals and you get imitating large animals and by george it borrows the rocket read from being tiger and rocket reads and you can oppose it and then you promptly get lost and you dont know where you are going in other words this gives us very very set and patterned action on gpm now theres little bit better news theres little bit more news about this and its good news is the lower oppterms the very low oppterms repeat the very high terminals so that you again get noun and nouning or goaling and so forth in two or three items down there along the line and the only thing that doesnt really contain the goal expressed in the item on whole gpm is the last couple of oppterms the early oppterms and of course they savor of the earlier goal and you probably will find in the last one or two oppterms that you get different phraseology entirely but that makes it awful easy to pilot one of these things you can ride one of these things right on down and its all done by the drill you test them you test the question and you find out if the item is still reading and you go ahead you dont test for terminal or oppterm because its pretty obvious if youre doing it this way and you make sure that it rrs and you carry on and with this pattern i began to suspect something and can now tell you as an absolute leadpipe cinch now look this does not apply to source list source list has to be tiger drilled but if you have to tiger drill an item or put the big mid ruds in on an item to get it to fire that is not the item you want now thats revolutionary isnt it in the first place i havent been putting in anything on items for long time but it suddenly occurred to that youre all drilling items to get them to fire you get it on list and then you drill it to fire if youve got to drill it to fire its not it because you can make almost any item on list fire how do you like that you could tiger drill anything that rred on listing and you could make it fire again momentarily well you mustnt drill these items there is where you are taking up all of your time its all in the senseless drill i couldnt figure out what you were doing but now i know what you were doing youre drilling items and you mustnt drill items you just mustnt do it because if it didnt fire it isnt it well now lets take this goal here to scream and you put down 49 scream well hell thats out of the blue the pc is saying aw scream whats this scream whats this noun form of the goal so forth you say it couple of times itll rr oh you might touch it up take the suppress off because they just suppressed it take the protest off because they just protested it something like that you know its there oh its forgivable youve got to make it fire but if you say all right give the negative form who or what would oppose scream or screams who or what would oppose screams and the pc puts down everything under the sun moon and stars and youre going to have to tiger drill something to make it rr its just screams if you get screams on the list bang thats going to fire youre going to see it fire youre going to say it it fires thats it thats all there is to it bang there is null the list and go on down and null the list and get on the mid ruds all right lets get on some mid ruds lets see we can waste another ten hours of auditing lets get in the mid ruds on all of the items in the bank and so forth and see if we can get the mid ruds in on the pc so we see the pc is biting his fingernails lets get the pc in on biting fingernails mid ruds biting fingernails eeee beinsstuhuh what the hells the matter with you you havent got the item thats why now look as you go down the bank this is going to serve you in very good stead because its number one test im not just making fun of you youre knucklehead and ibut i love you anyhow if you cant get something to go on the list pshhhew which when read back goes psshhhew see if you cant get that thing going pow you havent got the item most marvelous test in the world you get the item without drilling if you can get the item without drilling its the item now this has its limitations because you can get other items without drilling you are down in the middle of the bank the pc can give you fifteen dozen locks all of which fire none of which belong there you get the center item and however it fires but the pc does this trick you list for while and the pc isnt satisfied with the final result you call it it fires pc says oh that couldnt be it it turns on mass and it does this and that and the other thing and youll notice thatyou dont depend on the pcs telling youyour tone arm is up here at four and half and when you give him the item and you read it back to him not when he finally accepts it particularly if its the right item you get blowdown it comes right down that tone arm that tone arm doesnt come down you go on listing for while only guide his listing and get him to put the thing on the list straight soon as youve got the thing on there straight once more the thing will fire but the old one wont fire now you learn to work around with this fact that they fire without td and you will be clearing people but as long as you put in tiger drill buttons on items to get them to fire as long as you null lists to get them to fire youre going to wind up with the wrong item just because something fires when you call it does not make it the right item but if you have to tiger drill it to get it to fire it is pretty much of cinch to be wrong item now the only thing about this is is once in while about one item in fifty the pc has been sitting there chewing on it one way or the other and has been refusing it lets say well we found it in bank one and it turns up again in bank three and the pc has been chewing on it in bank one well you suddenly remember weve had this item on several lists before and its always been refused and we see it on this list again yes it could be that it is suppressed enough so that it wont fire but dont be deluded dont dont be deluded by this because the chances are even if you do get it to fire its still wrong for the spot youre trying to put it in its one of these things that an item does fire bang when you read it back to the pc it is not guarantee that you have to tiger drill it to get it to fire it is practically guarantee that it is not the item and theres where all of your clearing time on 3m is going theres where its all going you are just not getting the items on the list well the reasons why you werent getting the items on the list of course have to do with the fact you didnt have the top form of the gpm now on actual listing tests and on great many pcs and great deal of experience of this with this i can tell you that the pcs bank is too heavily charged at the beginning of the case for the pcs confront to be capable of giving you the item thats it ithes just too charged up theres nothing wrong with telling him what the item is or running bunch of test items in on him you know is it bringing the truth bringing truth you know write them down on the list ask him if you can put this one down on the list and that one well eventually work out some where it doesnt upset the pc particularly and youll eventually get something to fire and there it is now when you get away from the top the pcs confront comes up because the bank isnt as jammed in the middle but you now know that youve got to have items with the goal in them expressed in them if all banks follow the track of the original banks on the track all of this is very interesting information it is all quite usable in auditing i have been actively slowing down your going into too many gpms and jumping over and so forth until i was sure that we had something that looked like the top of the gpm this is another good try at this this is not guarantee that the goal to be selfappointed archangel in the christian science churchwhich is very late on the trackthis is not guarantee that it will have all of these tops but look if youve got all these tops you can test for them and if they dont fire they dont fire and then in the next goal that you get down to why youve sure got all these tops again and you can test those things out my money is on the fact that they will continue to fire all the way down because its gradient scale on the oppterm side its gradient scale from the extreme accomplishment of the goal down to the nonexistence of the goal and on the terminal side it comes from the nonexistence of the goal increases down to the goal itself and this looks to like very good rendition of this now there may be some other common points about this and ill be studying them and so forth but knowing now what this dozen at the top here are if there are any more items or patterns around in there that might get missed it wont be very serious so you can go ahead and plunge on with this im quite intrigued with the fact that the gpm is this pattern im quite intrigued and i was very intrigued to find out that in the goal to create that the pattern was very fixed and that the pattern was extremely patterned and that made very suspicious because when did thetan learn how to do this if two hundred and sixteen trillion years ago he was obeying the perfect pattern well id say there were few goals before this and i expect sooner or later to run into the beginning of track with some such goal as to know how to put gpm together but anyway there is as far as weve gotten on this pattern now tests for the top terminal for the top oppterm rather tests for the top oppterm have been very successful and weve made some good progress on that the top oppterms we got we didnt get any higher on those we already had been testing than bringers or people whopeople who goal or something like that but we did get the er form which was still two from the top we want the noun form itself i dont mean to muddy you up on that because all this will be published and these things will be rewritten before i rewrite them however im going to check lot of later banks and get the information exactly fitted together and it will be released at that time but this is good enough to use and i think that its very interesting that we had one pc who came in to see today and he had goal and he told he told that hethat nothing was doing him any good and he had goal to be good and i said well it doesnt do youit does you good is that right and he said thats sure right and i said well then its good isnt it and he said aw thats so true and all of sudden hei said well thats your top terminal isnt it and he said yeah i guess it is and he stopped saying any more about it now thats mean thing to do to you but i thought it was just too good of course somebody with goal to be successful has got top terminalis success and hes dramatizing it like crazy so if you are beating your brains out as an auditor wondering whats the matter with this guy well its just success you see and the guy had goal to find and youd just be beating your brains out because youve got finds and if you had goal to know youd probably have knowledge up here and the pcs going to hit that awful strong because thats him only one other little datum i might give you is the goal fires much better with the pc in terminal than an oppterm isnt that interesting then you get back on the track later i think thats fascinating the pc definitely comes up the terminal side and definitely faces all the way the oppterm side just going into it slightly well thats some more data on the gpm and now that weve got it pretty well taped and weve got it pretty well figured out so that you can get through itactually you could get through it before without losing your skullbut now that you can get through it now that you can get through it those in the x unit will find its perfectly safe now to find your goals perfectly safe and so youve got till friday because its awful hard to run gpm without the goal and if you havent got your goal by friday well well have to put you into the and then put you into running gpms without the goal it ruins the case you know to do that so dont put us up to that dont make us guilty of that terrible overt go ahead and find the goals before friday okay thank you very much good night
