over spray eradication efforts in southern colombia the following discussion of the controversy over spray eradication ie fumigation of illegal coca crops in southern colombia was prepared in response to the controversy over this effort in southern colombia this short synopsis of available information on the effects of fumigation of coca crops in colo mbia is only meant to provide summary of various claims it is not judgment on their validity in its ussupported coca eradication pr ogram the government of colombia sprays coca crops from aircraft with mixture of the herbicide glyphosate manufactured by the us company mons anto and marketed as roundup and two additives or adjuvants15 according to the state department in its report of january 23 2001 submitted to congress cons istent with the provisions of the statement of managers accompanying title iii chapter 2 of the emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 106246 which provided funding for plan colombia the environmental protection agency epa has found that the use of glyphosate as labeled for use in the us is acceptable provided that the regulatory controls required by the epa the labele d instructions are followed the state department also claims that the ingredients in the two additives cosmo flux 411f surfactant and cosmoind an antifoaming additive16 both produced in colombia are on an epa list of accepta ble chemicals for use on food crops when the label instructions are followed this report states an epa review of adequate scientific studies shows that when prope rly used glyphosate will not cause adverse effects in humans and does not cause risk s of concern for birth defects mutagenic effects neurotoxic effects reproductive problems or cancer it does however state that splashes of gly phosate can cause transient irritation to skin and eyesalthough at the same vel of irritation as baby shampoo according to one cited study for its conclusion that there are grounds to suggest concern for human health from the spray mixture used in colombia the state department cited recent study published in regulatory toxicology and pharmacology17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31016crs29 17 continued of the international society of regulatory toxicology and pharmacology 18 one websites httpwwwfarmsourcecom discussion of the use of roundup accessed through the monsanto website httpwwwmonsantoc om notes that roundup should only be applied from aircraft when th potential for drift to adjacent sensitive areas eg residential areas bodies of water known habitat for threatened or endangered species

desirable ve getation or crops ie normally some 100 continuedsince spraying began in december 2000 in colombias putumayo province where it is now indefinitely suspended however there have been many allegations that the spray mixture has caused extens ive harm to humans other crops and livestock the ill health effects on thousa nds of children and adults most commonly reported in the areas of putumayo fumigation include fever eye and gastrointestinal irritation and skin and bronc hial irritation and infecti ons there have also been allegations of increased incidence of brain damage in children in these areas since fumigation was started in addition critics claim many crops other than coca have been sprayed depriving peasants of food crops and other sources of income and livestock reportedly have suffered ill effects including hair loss in cattle from moderate exposure abortion among pregna nt cows possibly due one source notes from stampedes caused by the noise of ove rhead helicopters and the death of fowl from spraying or drinking contaminated wa ter the effects on livestock and fowl are taken from the counterfact sheet of february 9 2001 prepared by acción andina which is nongovernmental organization and posted online at httpusfumigationorgliteraturef actsheetscontradosaaipsrapal20f act20sheet20englishhtm supporters of aerial fumigation however state that negative health and envi ronmental effects can be ttributed to drug producers themselves whom they claim also use roundup to s uppress weeds around coca bushes and who pollute colo mbian rivers with chemicals used in processing and refining coca into cocaine in their drug labs some us officials assert that many of the complaints come from those with an interest in continuing coca production especi ally as aerial spraying of coca crops has taken place for many years in other areas of colombia without the outcry that the spraying in putumayo has produced however according to washington post article of january 7 2001 about the sprayi ng in putumayo until recently spraying focused almost entirely on remote indus trialsized coca and poppy plantationsnow the planes are targeting more populous far ming areas where coca is often grown side by side with corn yucca pineapple nd livestock often it shares plot next to the farmers tinroofed shack aerial attack killing more than coca by scott wilson regarding crop damage the post reporter stated that his inspection of fields in the area suggested that food crops have been hit at leas t as hard as coca critics have attributed food crop damage to the sideby side plantings of legal and illegal crops in putumayo but also charge that spray planes fly higher than normal for crop dusting operations elsewhere in order to avoid ground fire and under unacceptable wind conditions thus leadin g to the dispersion of spray beyond intended targets18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31016crs30 18 continued feet but 500 feet if the wind is blowing

of transnational institute tni and elsa nivia of rapalmira posted at httpwwwusfumigationorgsome analysts however have noted that complaints of ill effects to humans and animals may not be entirely inconsistent with state department assertions of safety under controlled circumstances as the health and envir onmental effects could vary depending on the exact formulation of the spray mix the manner of its application and the conditions under whic h it was used some critic s have argued that roundup is not being applied in manner consistent with us usages and with the manufacturers recommendations and that not all issues related to ingredients used in the mixture applied in colombia have been explored the world wildlife fund in an october 30 2000 statement comments on glyphosate states th at existing studies may not be adequate to assess the impacts resulting from plan colombias actual use of glyphosate aerial app lications product formulation frequency and rate of pplication etc especially given the soils topography climatic conditio ns temperature rainfall etc plant and animal species found in colombia available online from the wwf at httpwwwciponlineorgcolombia103001htm in february 9 2001 statement calling for the end of aerial eradication representatives of th ree nongovernment organizations claimed that there is evidence that herbicide concentrations much higher than ones recommended are being applied in colombia and that there are toxicological studies regarding the effects of mixing the cosmoflux4111f surfactant with pesticides19 the statement also noted that roundup ultra which opponents say is the actual variety of roundup being used in colombia although the state department report cited above does not refer to either trade name contains other ingredient s besides glyphosate and the two adjuvants the world wildlife fund in the october 2000 statement cited above found that studies on the effects of roundup focus on the pesticide active ingredient alone not the combination of inert ingredients actually applied thereby giving an incomplete assessment of the toxic threat and asserted that the inert ingredients mixed with the roundup to increase its effectiveness can be as or more toxic to humans wildlife and foodwebs than the pesticide itself the monsanto website states that the new ingredients in roundup ultra ar on an epa approved list 4b but the specific new ingredients are not named an analysis by agronomist elsa nivia identified as associated with the nongovernmental red acción plaguicidas alternativas américa latina rapal pancolombia pesticide actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31016crs31 network claims that the aerial fumigation of illegal crops in colombia with roundup is very different from the recommended agricultural use in the united states citing the concentration as 26 times greater than that recommended with negative effects intensified by the use of cosmoflux 411f even though the authors of the report cited by the state department had found glyphosate and roundup to be at most mildly toxic ms nivias conclusion from their discussion of the effects of accidental and occupational exposures to higher concentrati ons and of the doses that proved lethal in people attempting suicide is that higher than recommended concentrations or applications c ould help to explain the severe ill effects reported
