meeting with centcom commander general petraeus egyptian general intelligence service egis chief omar soliman shared his views on iraq iran and ongoing efforts on palestinian reconciliation snf on iraq soliman assessed that arab leaders were taking new position on supporting iraqi prime minister maliki following the iranian elections and described egypts plans to increase cooperation with the iraqi government snf soliman believed that the iranian elections and hezbollahs electoral defeat in lebanon presented good opportunity to reduce iranian regional interference including by improving syrias relations with the arab world snf on palestinian reconciliation soliman was pessimistic that an agreement would be reached but promised that egypt would not give up and would continue efforts to undermine hamas including by preventing money and guns from entering gaza iraq extending an arab hand 2 snf soliman said arab countries were looking for ways to support prime minister maliki during this crucial time for iraq general petraeus thanked egypt for supporting the iraqi government including by nominating new ambassador to iraq ref and encouraging other arab countries to hold out hand in friendship on president mubaraks instructions soliman explained egypt plans to increase cooperation with iraq on wide variety of political security and economic issues 3 snf soliman assessed that arab leaders were taking new position on iraq following the iranian presidential elections he believed that iranian leaders would change their attitude towards neighboring countries and supporting terrorism abroad and would focus instead on domestic issues iran cannot afford to challenge the international community now soliman opined the challenge soliman explained was to bring iraq back to the arab world and foster support for maliki according to soliman president mubarak told king abdullah of saudi arabia not to search for another man but should instead accept maliki as iraqs leader and support him iran elections present opportunity for arabs 4 snf soliman stressed that egypt suffers from iranian interference through its hezbollah and hamas proxies and its support for egyptian groups like jamaatt alislamiyya and the muslim brotherhood egypt will confront the iranian threat he continued by closely monitoring iranian agents in hamas the muslim brotherhood and any egyptian cells improving relations between syria and the arab world would also undermine irans regional influence soliman noted little change in syrias attitude on engaging with the arab world adding that king abdullah of saudi arabia shared this view and planned to visit damascus soon to help change syrias attitude 5 snf soliman anticipated that hezbollahs recent defeat in the lebanese parliamentary elections would force the group to remain quiet for sometime as they rebuild domestic support and counter the perception that hezbollah is tool of outsiders with iran itself focusing on domestic issues he continued it was good time to make changes in lebanon and reduce irans influence egypt will support saad hariri government and the lebanese army soliman emphasized 6 snf soliman said that iran heeded egypts warning against meddling in domestic affairs ref b and supporting groups like the muslim brotherhood he received very positive message from irans intelligence chief indicating that iran would not interfere in egypt egypt planned to remain quiet inside iran for the time being but would continue to recruit agents who will do what we ask if iran insists on interfering in egypt we hope iran will stop cairo 00001349 002 of 003 supporting hamas the muslim brotherhood and other cells within egypt soliman said but if not we are ready soliman said iranian president ahmadinejad wanted to attend the nonaligned movement nam conference in egypt july 1116 if he did attend president mubarak would meet with him and clearly explain that iranian interference in arab issues was unacceptable we are ready for good relations with iran soliman noted but only if iran ceased interfering and supporting terrorists in the region 7 snf because of domestic problems soliman believed that iran would seek better relations with the arab world and suspend its nuclear program for period of time to avoid war he also anticipated iran would try to strike more of balance between supporting its hezbollah and hamas tools and trying to build better relations with the arabs soliman expressed concern that iranian influence in iraq would spread after the redeployment of us troops out of iraqi cities and the eventual drawdown general petraeus noted that 130000 us troops remain and that the drawdown would be gradual he expressed confidence that iranian influence could be contained if arab countries moved aggressively to support iraq palestinian reconciliation israel 8 snf soliman explained that egypts three primary objectives with the palestinians were to maintain calm in gaza undermine hamas and build popular support for palestinian president mahmoud abbas on gaza soliman said egypt worked closely with israel to coordinate humanitarian assistance shipments and was encouraging the israelis to allow more assistance into gaza soliman said he was still seeking tahdiya calm agreement between hamas and israel but noted that israels lack of gaza strategy and desire to keep hamas under pressure made any agreement difficult on undermining hamas soliman said egypt has stopped money and arms from entering gaza hamas feels they are losing their capabilities soliman said as they are unable to rearm using the tunneling network under the egyptgaza border the pressure especially from egypts success at dismantling hamas funding mechanism may render hamas more flexible than before 9 snf palestinians must believe that abbas is capable of securing palestinian state soliman stressed he noted recent positive developments in the west bank including improvements in the palestinian security forces and the lifting of some israeli roadblocks to facilitate commerce and movement he expressed concern however that continued settlement activity israeli prime minister netanyahus recent radical speech and insufficient economic development in palestinian areas were undermining the chances for resuming peace negotiations soliman added that president mubarak may invite nentanyahu and abbas to cairo if efforts to restart negotiations became blocked 10 snf soliman briefed general petraeus on his efforts to facilitate palestinian reconciliation reconciliation remains elusive he noted as neither hamas nor fatah really want an agreement the palestinian factions were currently in cairo he said for discussions on releasing detainees talks were at an impasse however as hamas had suspended reconciliation talks until abbas released all hamas detainees in the west bank which soliman said abbas would never accept soliman also doubted that reconciliation agreement would be reached by july 7 as egypt previously announced and anticipated that talks would be suspended for onetwo months despite the challenge and frustrations soliman promised that egypt would not give up on palestinian reconciliation it is hard he continued but i am always optimistic i consider myself patient man but i am loosing patience syria yemen afpak 11 snf soliman hoped syria would improve its relationship with the arab world and the us and stop serving as irans lifeline in the region he also stressed that syria must cooperate with iraq to improve border security and stem the flow of foreign fighters soliman also called on syria to drop its insistence that the israelipalestinian conflict must be solved before syria will reach an agreement with israel on the golan heights 12 snf soliman expressed concern over instability in cairo 00001349 003 of 003 yemen and said egypt was trying to help president saleh including by providing information on iranian and qatari support to the alhouthi insurgents general petraeus noted us efforts to improve yemens capacity to combat extremists on pakistan general petraeus said he was encouraged by the pakistani militarys operations in the swat valley and northwest frontier province including their focus on holding and rebuilding effected areas soliman credited the pakistani government for doing better job of convincing people that extremists pose real threat to pakistani national security on afghanistan general petraeus stressed the importance of arresting the downward spiral of violence and improving governance after the september 20 national elections 13 u general petraeus cleared this cable scobey
