of us military perso nnel ranging at peak from about two thou sand lebanon in 19821984 to over 500000 against iraq in 1991 vietnam in 19611973 and lasted from few months to over decade more than one reason was cited for most interventions these reasons included the need t reverse aggression the need to maintain regional stability and the protection of us citizens of economic interests and of human rights the restoration of constitutional order or the rule of law and enforcing political or peace settlements are among the other considerations rwanda was undertaken only to provide relief to millions f refugees in the midst of civil war congress has authorized only two of th deployments iraq and vietnam and the latter authorization was subsequently disputed gress authorized the last 18 months of the 19821984 deployment to lebanon only panama was unilateral us action for the others the united states sought allies the u n security council authorized the four interventions occurring

varying interpretations haiti rwanda an d bosniathe numbers of us militar personnel killed as result of hostilities ranged from none thus far in bosnia to 59000 vietnam among the lessons learned from these interventions relevant to the curren t situation in kosovo those involv ing the effective use of force seem most pertinent at this time most ex post facto assessments of individual interventions point to the use of overwhelming force as major factor in successful operations and the lack f adequate force as major factor contributing to mixed results for failures thi s conclusi on leads some analysts to argue that the united states should avoi d operations where limitations are put on the use of force as in the current case f kosovo nevertheless some nalysts who compare interventions suggest that there are ways to make the threat and use of force more credible and more effective and thus enhance the possibilities of success in limited force interventions other crs reports are use

interventions for wide range of purposes since world war ii and with mixed degrees of success and failure these interventions have involved numbers of us military personnel ranging t peak from about 2000 lebanon in 19821984 to over 500000 against iraq i n 1991 vietnam in 19611973 the duration of us deployments has ranged from months to years the numbers of us military personnel killed as result f hostilities ranged from none thus far after over six years in bosnia to some 59000 over 12 years of involvement in vietnam congress has authorized only two of the deployments iraq and vietnam and the latter authorization was subsequently disputed gress authorized the last 18 months of the 19821984 deployment to lebanon the stated purposes and the us interests involved in these operations varied all but one were undertaken for more than one reason iraq had the most clearcut primary purpose to reverse iraqs invasion of kuwait and inv olved the strongest us interests stability in region vital to us economic wellbeing protection of us citizens was stated as reason for intervention in two cases panama an d grenada the need to maintain r egional stability was cited or viewed as reason for

subject to varying interpretations haiti rwanda and bosnia lessons learned all military interventions are accompanied by debate and analysis of the reasons for their success or lack thereof the lessons learned or predominant perceptions of the results of each operation usually color the thinking and planning for the next operation most military thinkers caution that each intervention is unique and th lessons learned from each operation while useful in general sense may not b applicable or appropriate for every case of intervention in addition predominan t perceptions may be based on misperceptions leading to the wrong lessons an d perceptions that are not considered politically appropriate may not be raised to th level of lesson still the follo wing generalizations can be made about the widely agreed upon lessons learned and other perceptions regarding the individua l interventions cited in this paper successful interventions were ones in which the united states was willing to use the force required for the situation from the outset for all interventions perceived as failures the amount of force deployed and exercised fel l considerably short of the force needed in retrosp ect in addition sometimes this force was applied gradually or incrementally giving an appearance f hesitatio n or reluctance to its use this applies to both conventiona l operations where the go was to win by inflicting military defeat as well as to instances where the intention was to use limited force the limited force operations include interventions where the objective was to force parties t negotiat their differences as well as peacekeeping and peace enforcemen t operatio ns where it was to ensure or enforce an agreed upon peac settlement other factors also influence the decision to constrain the use f4 force including most notably geostrategic and geopolitical concerns an d perceptions about the depth of public support and differences of opinio n among the united states and its allies judgments concerning the amount of force necessary were considerably easier to reach in cases where the objective was to defeat an opposing armed forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs4 telephone co nversation with william j durch senior associate of the henry l stimson5 continuedjudgments concerning the amou nt of force needed to present credible threat to back diplomatic efforts to achieve negotiated solution to problem and to create an environment conducive to nego tiated solution often erred on the conservative side mission creep ie the perception that the intervening forces once committed get assigned ever greater military tasks appear t result from failure to anticipate the amount of military effort that would be required or an unwillin gness to commit sufficient forces and resources at the outset even if the need had been anticipated or unanticipated developments to which the military forces had to react successful interventions were largely either undertaken to restore the statu s quo which had been disrupted by an event eg iraqs invasion of kuwait or were conducted on behalf of an existing and longstanding constitutiona l order with broad public support eg to restore the constitutional order and the perceived winners of the elections in panama even successfu l interventions can require substantial sustained assistanc for reconstruction and for fortifying institutions whose integrity has bee n compromised by the usurper regime unsuccessful interventions attempted to establish new order r support re latively recently adopted new order which did not have cultural or institutional basis or perceived legitimacy to sustain it and where th intervening force s left before such conditions were attained eg somalia and lebanon and where there was debate over whether such conditions were in our power to foster through intervention eg vietnam coalitions can offer great benefits such as conferring internationa l legitimacy on an operation but they can also complicate its planning an d implementation apart from the military problems f coordinating the activities of military personnel of several nations coalition nations often have different interests at stake in an intervention leading to di fferent perceptions of the risks and benefits of various modes of intervention these differences ma undermine the operation par ticularly if participating parties are viewed by the opponent as pursuing distinct objectives or if disagreements arise about th appropriate use of force often how ever the united states has option but to work with coalition as it needs access to bases and resources that only coalition can provide the leadership that many urge the united states to demonstrate is one means of managing coalition to make its militar operations more effective greater knowledge and prior evaluation of local conditions is essential t improving the chances of succ ess and may mitigate the force needed to attain desired results by enabling diplomats and intervention for ces to better deal with situation although rarely cited as major problem in the literature n individual operations the lack of knowledge and appreciation of th complexity of local social and political conditions is mentioned by som analysts as s ignificantly contributing to the united states inability to manage some operations particularly lebanon and somalia 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs5 continued5 center may 13 1999 also see william j durch ed peacekeeping america n politics and

the henry l stimson center and the overseas development co uncil wwwstimsonorgusfpsome situations may not be winnable with limited force because th opponent has much greater interest in the outcome than the intervenin g parties and thus is willing to sustain greater costs and to cede only in the face of crushing defeat once committed to an interve ntion in such circumstances the intervening party is faced with hobsons choice to bear much highe r costs than originally anticipated or to withdraw while some analysts argue that withdrawal can be desirable option if an intervening party fails to reach stated limited goals others find that withdrawal in one situation with n accompanying perception of defeat can make the threat of or the actual use of force less persuasive in future instances 6 considerations for applying the lessons successful interventions by definition all had adequate force to accomplish the mission from the start unsuccessful or failed interventions suffered from n unwillingness for variety of reasons either to commit or to use sufficient force or from underestimations of the amount of force that would be required according to many analyses in conventional warfare the standard has long been to us overwhelming or in more recent term inology decisive force in lebanon in the 1980s and in the postcold war period the us military and other militaries hav been deployed in limited numbers and for limited purposes that fall short of tha t standard this line of analysis suggests that policymakers must be prepared t commit fairly substantial force and to incur risks when undertaking any operation where some degree of resistance is possibility otherwise interventions wil l inevitably become quagmires where forces will be forced to deal with missio n creep ie ratchet up the degree of force necessary often too little too late or t withdraw httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs6 see jakobsen op cit and alexander l george and william simons the limits f7 coercive diplomacy 2 edition boulder co westview press 1994nd for greater discussion of this subject see defining moment op cit and interventions8 op cit nevertheless as the united states began to contemplate greater use f limited force in peace operations in the early 1990s some analysts argued that the need for commitmen t of substantial force for even limited war or military operations presents policymakers with desirable all or nothing options us experiences in lebanon somalia and bosnia when taken as lessons for future operations seem to reinforce this policy d ilemma some analysts judge however the more important factor may be the correct application of force to such analysts quagmires an d mission creep can be attributed in some circumstances as much to the lack f knowledge about and the skill to deal diplomatically with situation as to an initial reluctance or failure to commit appropriate force these analysts suggest two areas in particular where the united states and other nations can improve their ability to use force effectively one is by enhancing th diplomatic efforts that guide the use of force the other is by making the threat f force and the limited use of force more credible diplomatic efforts may be enhanced in various ways as mentioned in th previous section some analysts believe that greater knowledge of situation i s necessary not only to avoi d committing too little force to an intervention but also to improve diplomatic efforts greater knowledge could enable policymakers an d diplomats to set more precise and realistic goals for negotiations it also might help in one area where some analysts find that limited force operations have bee n diplomati cally weakthe use of incentives some argue that the study of pas t operations with the intention of development of better doctrine on using th combination of force and diplomacy more effectively may provide the basis for more successful limited force operations in the future7 making the threat of force and the use of limited force more credible might also improve an interventions chances of success the use of limited military force to add muscle to diplomatic effort appears most likely to succeed if the opponent i s convinced that he f aces force capable of inflicting costs that outweigh the benefits of resisting defying or breaking negotiated settlement the result of thes operations has led many to conclude that the standard must apply to the potentia l commit ment of forces to an operation even if those forces are not actuall deployed for united states pol icymakers and those of most other democracies as well making more credible the threat of force and the use of force in limited force situations presents several challenges the first is how to rally and sustain publi c8 support when decision has been made to commit force as public support is on important factor in how cre dible threat appears to opponents in the united states citizens are willing to bear the costs and casualties of military operation shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs7 see eric v larson casualties and consensus the historical role of casualties i n9 domestic

is often weak and difficult to sustain fo r interventions where vital interests are not perceived t be at stake particularly if there are casual ties these include operations undertaken on behalf of such intangible and unmeasurable interests as regional stability the defense of human rights where the public will weigh the liv of american military personnel against the lives of foreign civilians or even the protection or encouragement of democracy which man policymakers and analysts across the political spectrum sider an important national security interest unless greater national consensus develops on the desirabilit y10 of defending such interests policymakers must be willing to bear fair degree f political risk and exercise considerable leadership to rally public support or t compensate for the lack of it in order to make significant sustainable and credible commitment second challenge is improving the ability of coalitions either ad hoc or under international organizations to work more effectively as thirdnation support i s viewed as one element for the cr edible use of force the conclusion of few analysts is that in cases where significant force is to be exercised successful outcome will depend on one or few major powers of coalition taking leading role an d exhibiting willingness to assume most of the risks this implies that once th e11 united states commits to an operation it must often commit to leading if not leadership role in such situation s however it must be assured in advance that other members of th coalition would be willing to continue to provide needed assistance such as access to territory from which to stage operations as the level of force used is increased finally us policymakers may have to continuously reexamine the goals they set for the use of force all analysts cite need to define clear military and political objectives at the outset of an operation still as some analysts have observed the introduction of military force ca n change the circumstances on the ground and create new situations thus some analysts argue policymakers must remain flexible i n adjusting objectives as the situation changes or as it is better understood implications for congress concerning kosovo as of midmay 1999 the yugoslav governments co ntinuing perhaps seeming indifference to the ffects of sustained air strikes has led to differences of opinion on the correct course for us policy on t he one hand some policymakers and analysts conclude that the united states could force the yugoslav government to agre ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs8 through negotiations to an acceptable kosovo settlement including the return f refugees if greater fo rce were credibly threatened or applied in particular the use of ground troops this analysis is backed by observations from past interventions particul arly iraq where analysts observe that air power alone would not hav achieved the objectives although nato used air power only in bosnia som analysts argue that the bosnian and croat action on the ground against serb forces provided the necessary supplement to make air power effective on the other hand some analysts believe that the united states should t commit such subs tantial force to an area of limited us interests and argue that the united states should seek to exit as quickly as possible one form of exit would be withdrawal however precipitous withdrawal which would be interpreted as defeat would reinforce the perception that the united states is unwilling to use its substantial power in pursuit of its goals it could also contribute to perception that the united states is unwilling or unable to exercise leadership arguably such n exit would perpet uate vicious cycle where opponents feel increasingly confident in challenging the united states requiring that the united states use greater force in the future to make its threats and uses of mo re credible it may also have implications for the willingness of nato countries and countries in other areas to participate i n intervention coa litions with the united states in the future and even for the survival of nato as meaningful institution second exit strategy could be to develop c ontainment policy which would isolate the yugoslav government and take steps to guard against the creation f further instabilities in the balkans from the presence of re fugees although this might save the costs of continuing and perhaps escalated us and nato military action containment policy would also imply substantial costs to provide for refugees and perhaps for longterm nato military presence in the region third app roach would be to make diplomatic efforts to deal with the kosovo situation more effectively including the refinement of objectives current effort s center on the formation of u nified international front with an emphasis on russias role as an inte rmediary with belgrade some analysts argue that the united states lack of knowledge about the political situation in yugoslavia regarding kosovo i s reminiscent of the us lack of knowledge in lebanon and somalia and argue tha t greater awareness and appr eciation of the political dynamics in yugoslavia is needed to formulate realistic objectives for set tlement efforts to improve diplomacy would not necessarily alleviate the need to mount and maintain credible threat or escalate the use of force in the long run however even in the event of negotiate d settlement which allowed for the return of refugees s ome analysts argue that it would be necessary to maintain high level of force in and around kosovo to protec t returneeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs9 table 1 comparative data auspices us period of us congress us purposesinterests

operation and from those who believed the united states should withdraw because the south vietnamese regime did not enjoy the popular support to prevail bot h seemed borne out by the outcome three lessons subsequently became part of the canon of us use of military force embodied in such statements as the weinberger doctrine the first was that12 us forces should act with decisive or overwhelming force in conventiona l warfare against the appropriate targets ie the source of the conflict or in thi s case north vietnam limits on the use of force and its incr emental escalation should be avoided the second was that the united states should not commit forces t conflicts where the objectives are not credible to the us public and finally it was widely held that congress should debate and approve us involvement in majo r military conflict from military perspective us forces won the battles they fought in south vietnam and could have prevailed militarily against north vietnam if the united states had demonstrated the political will to operate without time and force constraints in order to achieve military victory two other conclusions also became part of man analysts criteria in judging the advisabili ty of us intervention one was that the united states should not engage in military action on behalf of political forces that do not enjoy widespread support among their own people the vietnam war also led to the questioning of the utility of us technological superiority particularly of air power if the us and its allies were not also willing to confront opposition forces on the

perception changed among some policymake rs because of the problems created by the growing number of haitia n refugees on september 18 1994 president clinton reported to congress th objectives of the us deployment under section 8147 c of the do d appropriat ions act for fy1994 pl 103139 the goals were to restore th legitimate democratically elected authorities create secure climate in whic h democratic processes could operate dismantle the old instruments of repression and help create new institutions or replace corrupt ones most importantly the police force and the judicial system they also included confiscating and registerin g weapons provid ing security during june 25 1995 parliamentary elections restoring and providing public services and constructing roads and sanitation facilities n september 21 1994 the presiden t reported that the deployment would be increased consistent with the war powers resolution the president did not seek prio r congressiona l authorization for the haiti deployment and congress could not agree on adopting binding prior authorization requirement assessments f the outcome lessons were learned from both the attempted 1993 and successful 1994 military actions the harlan county fiasco where us power was demonstrably thwarted b hostile crowds demonstrated to many analysts the dangers of fielding inadequate forces to deal with potentially hostile situations it also illustrated the dampening effects of potential negative public opinion n policymake rs resolve when us interests are not high the incident occurre d shortly after us soldiers were killed in somalia the successful restoration f aristide the following year through the threat of credible military force afte r incentives and sanctions had failed demonstrated for some analysts that threats f force may of ten be necessary to back diplomacy some also argue that th involvement of the oas and the conferred legitimacy on the operation tha t made it possible to muster domestic and international support haitis continuing political problems have led to co nflicting interpretations of the ultimate value of the intervent ion although unmih ended in june 1996 the united nations has fielded followup civilian missions to deal with haitis continuin g institutional problems it is currently assisting the police force there hoping to foster stability the u nited states has maintained us military presence of few hundred troops mostly through shortterm training missions but in march 1999 th commande r of the us southern command urged that presence end because of the risk to those troops from political instability haitis failure despite ample international assistance to cement democrati c procedures and institutions and to improve it s economy more than five years after the us military intervention leads to varying i nterpretations of its value some analysts feel that the intervention affirmed that the united states was willing to take risks to promote democracy in the hemisphere giving more hop that democracy will one day take hold than if the intervention had never taken place to others haiti merel demonstr ates the futility of spending resources to promote democracy in countrie s with little democratic tradition or culture httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs25 for more information on the current situation in bosnia on presidential and

muslims and croats and in december 1992 to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia to protect it from the spread f fighting elsewhere the united states contributed relatively few troops t unprof or over 38000 military personnel participated of which the unite d states contributed under 1000 to serve in macedonia and croatia the initial mandate to implement peacekeeping plan was contained i n

protect six safe areas in bosnia herzegovina and to support unprofor in the performance of it s mandate nato planes downed four bosnian serb planes violating the nofly zone in february 1994 and

specifically author ized us military deployments in the area congress has also considered but not passed various measures to block funding or deployments the house and senate however have separately passed various measures dealin g with troop deployments to the balkans assessments of the outcome the lengthy international involvement in bosnia has led to an evolving series of lessons learned from the various componen t operations the early years of the bosnia situation from the deployment f unprof or in 1992 through the early airstrikes in 1994 were widely viewed s failures virtually all analysts agree that unprofor s assigned missions from the delivery of humanitarian relief by all necessary means to the protection of saf havens greatly exceeded the resources committed particularly the use of force at least for defensive purposes if not for outright enforcement unprofor s credibility and the credibility of the entire effort was quickly undermined b contributors unwillingness to provide and use sufficient force to accomplish thos missions accord ing to many analysts although there is agreement on the level of force that would have been desirable the norm of peacekeeping operation s that peacekeeping forces should be impartial also one of the lessons learned i n lebanon during the 1980s was viewed in retrospect as an inappropriate postur when various parties were still engaged in conflict in violation of security counci l resolutions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30184crs27 this was not universally shared perception two analysts from the london school f21 economics and poli tics studying the problems in operations in the former yugoslavia prior to 1994 argued that the regional organization should normally act as the agent of the always within mandate approved in the security council but subject to closer and mor direct contro l as the scale of military intervention moves from that appropriate to traditional peaceke eping toward enforcement enforcement should

the air power of coalition of major powers were highly pr oblematic determined by the lack of coherence on objectives the lack of coordination in its efforts and the perception that although costs were to be shared some participants were at greate r risks than others among us analysts this led to th widespread perception that the united nations was unable to led opera tions which required significant use of force and that such operations should be delegated to regional organizations or ad ho c coalitions for many analysts the mismatch of resources and application f21 insuffic ient force only prolonged the intervention and made impossible th achievement of desirable outcome success in achieving the dayton peace accord in december 1995 is usuall credited to decisions to bring outside credible force to bear on the bosnian serbs and their yugoslavian allies from the international community came the creation of the british rapid reaction force in june 199 5 and french pressures for nato airstrikes in july and august of that year for some analysts this british and french leadership and political will to use sufficient force provided the crucial pressure that mad possible the diplomatic success at dayton in addition local forces opposed ser b military gains with the croats ousting the serbs from krajina in mid1995 and the bosnian croats taking an offensive against the serbs in bosniaherzegovina in 1995 before the airstrikes the bosnian cro ats and the government forces gained territory in septemb er 1995 through the direct intervention of the croatian army in bosnia which altered the military balance all of these ontheground operations wer viewed as putting pressure on serbian forces the ultimate value of us and international intervention in bosnia and th dayton accords is matter of debate however some analysts view the threeyear nato presence as accomplishing little pointing out tha t bosnians have not been able to implement many p rovisions of the dayton agreement and that bosnia shows few signs of becoming viable country others believe that more positive result may22 have been possible if credible force had been committ ed much earlier in
