documentations and inputs from professor zhaomei zeng on the selection of the 84 42pairs of urbanrural stations used in the 1990 grl and 1990 nature papers prepared by weichyung wang sunyalbany 2222008 background because the station history for 49 out of the 84 42pairs of urbanrural stations used in the 1990 grl and 1990 nature papers were not included in the 1991 doe data report charge of fabrication andor misrepresentation was raised about the statement of few if any changesin location made in the two papers in 14 february 2008 the inquiry committee expressed need for documentations and inputs from the respondents coauthornecessary to allow for any clear determination on the charge actions after receiving the inquiry committee report on 18 february 2008 i immediately communicated with professor zhaomei zeng the coauthor of both 1990 grl paper and 1991 doe data report who made the statement currently although retired from the institute of atmospheric physics iapchinese academy of sciences she continues conducting research at iap inputs professor zeng sent description in chinese of the criteria for station selection with table marked with the status of station moves for each station of the 84stations her input is attached below as an appendix key points are noted here out of the 4000 stations 60 and 205 station networks were selected based on the station history considering the following factors data length number of site moves data gaps spatial representation etc while the station history was included in the 1991 doe report for the 60 station network they were not included in the 205station network published in 1993 doe report which professor zeng is also coauthor due partly to its not being requirement under the uschina agreement and partly to the huge effort coupled with inadequate resources manpower and hardware to digitize them the 84stations are subset of the 60 and 205stations datasets with 35stations from the 60 station dataset and 49stations from the 205station dataset note that while the station history of the 35stations was used by professor zeng in compiling the number of station moves in the table included in the appendix the 49stations most rural stations are based on her recollection together with checking against the presentday station location simply because the original station history manuscripts archived at iap and her detailed notes were longer available due to several office moves over the almost 19years time span below is summary using professor zengs inputs for easy apprehension of station moves 195483 of stations total 35stations of stations total 49stations 8 17 1 15 13 2 8 11 3 3 0 4 1 0 longer remember 8 conclusions from the inputs provided by professor zeng it is quite clear that she 1 had access to the station history when compiling the 60 and 205stations datasets and 2 used the criteria of few if any changes inlocation to select the 84stations used in the 1990 grl and 1990 nature papers the charge of fabrication andor misrepresentation is false other relevant notes on 18 february 2008 professor jones lead author of the 1990 nature paper sent manuscript urbanization effects in largescale temperature records with an emphasis on china which was recently submitted to j geophysical research for publication in the paper the most relevant finding is that comparing the 42rural station data used in the 1990 grl and nature papers with those adjusted for homogeneity of 728station network yield very much the same results implying that the station moves if any really did not matter when representative set of stations here 42stations was used appendix description of the background on preparation of the 60 and 205stations datasets and the numbers of moves within 19541983

尽可能无变化和小变化或少变化的资料连续性好缺测记录少并适当考虑台站空间分布的均匀性等原则来挑选的致于 205站台站史当初收集资料时也有记录因人力经费设备不足 只有一台计算机要输入数据未能输入计算机中工作量巨大后因本人去美国工作的前 后大气所和我在的研究室都经过多次搬迁当年手抄记录早已当废纸销毁了原始资料也因本 研究所资料库多次搬迁和长期无人使用以及管理资料的人员早已退休多年而无法再查找因此 上述 49个乡村站的站史信息仅仅是我个人当年在做此工作时印象比较深的一些台站的记忆 可能不准确对 这些站我已无印象不过我与目前国家气象局整理的 7000多个气象台站的 地理位置作了比较这 49个站仅部分站的观测高度稍有变化 15米个别站的纬度或经度有 001度的差异外并无大的改变 中国科学院大气物理所 曾昭美 二00八年二月二十一日
