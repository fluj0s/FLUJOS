division summary the liability of selfinsured employer in state court for group health plan related actions is generally preempted by erisa however an employer who acts as the administrator of the health plan can be liable for breach of fiduciary duty under erisa1 some federal courts have also found selfinsured em ployers liable under theories of vicarious liability and direct negligence2 the extent to which employers can be found liable in any of these situations varies depe nding on the employers level of participation in the administration of the plan and the plans decision making process regarding claims for benefits in the various patient protection bills introduced in the 106th and 107th congress attempted to address the issue of employer liability by limiting liability to

injury or wrongful death managed care organizations could be subject to liability for benefit determinations in addition employers who selfadminister group health plans could also be subject to liability several of the bills that we re introduced included provisions that attemp ted to shield employers from liability or limit employer lia bility under certain circumstances four approaches to employer liability are discussed in this report designated decision maker in the 106th congress both hr 5628 and nate amendment 3694 included provisions for the appointment of designa ted decision maker fo r purposes of liability in suits against group health plan5 the designated decision maker approach to liability was also used in the norwood ame ndment to hr 2563 as passed by the house during the 107th congress6 under these provisions the designated decision maker would have been liable to the participant or benefici ary for economic and noneconomic damages in connection with breach of duty of care or failure to act which was the proximate cause of injury to or the wrongfu l death of the partic ipant or beneficiary7 presumably these provisions were intended to designate particular person or entity that would have been named in suit brought against the plan and would have been held liable for any damages that were awarded under the various provi sions the designated decision maker was defined as plan sponsor health insurance issuer or any other person who could carry out the responsibilitie s set forth in the plan carry out the requirements of the legislation and meet ot her applicable requirements including any financial obligation for liability8 if the employer simply provided health insurance coverage as benefit of employment and did not admin ister the plan the plans designated decision maker would have been held liable and the employer would have been shielded from liability however if the employer selfinsured and selfadministered the health insurance plan provided for its employees the employer would have been responsible for appointing the designated decision maker and the designated decision maker likely would have been an employ ee of the employerplan administrator httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20868crs3 9 27 am jur 2d employment relationship 459 1999 10 27 am jur 2d employment relationship 492 1999 11 hr 526 107th cong sec 302 12 id 13 id 14 idin cases where the designated decision maker is an employee of the employerplan administrator it appears that the employer may be liable for the damages resulting from the designated decision makers breach or failure to act in general an employer can be held vicariously liable for the tortious act of an employee under the theory of respondeat superior if at the time of the tortious act the employee was acting within the scope of employment9 in addition the employer may be responsible for paying damages incurred as result of the employees tortious act10 these principles would likely apply in the case of health plan that is selfinsured and is being selfadministered by the employer who appoints designated decision maker the designated deci sion maker acting within the scope of employment as an employee of th employerplan administrator would be held liable for personal injury or wrongful death resulting from the breach or failure to act but the employerplan administrator could apparently be held vicariously liable and thus could be required to pay damages direct participation hr 526 in troduced in the 107th congress did not authorize cause of action against an employer or other plan sponsor maintaining the plan or against an employee of such an employer or sponsor acting w ithin the scope of employment unless the employer or other plan sponsor directly pa rticipated in the decision of the plan upon consideration of claim for be nefits or upon review of deni of claim for benefits or directly participated in the failure to exercise ordinary care in the performance of duty under the terms and conditions of the plan11 direct participati on was defined as the actual making of such decision or the actual ex ercise of control in making such decision or in the conduct constituting the failure12 direct participation was to be cons trued so as to exclude any form of decisionmaking or other conduct that is merely collateral or precedent to the decision or failure13 specifically the bill excluded from direct participation any participation in the selection of the group health plan or health insurance coverage involved any engagement by the employer or other plan sponsor in any costbenefit analysis undertaken in connection with the selec tion of or continue d maintenance of the plan or coverage involved any participation in the proce ss of creating continuing modifying or terminating the plan or any benefit under the plan if such process was not substantially focused solely on the particular situation that is the subject of the cause of action and any participation in the design of any benefit under the plan including the amount of copayment and limits connect ed with such benefit14 under hr 526 an employer would have been shielded from liability unless it directly participated in the decision or failure as defined above an employer who simplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20868crs4 15 hr 2990 106th cong sec 1302a 16 idprovided insurance as benefit to its empl oyees likely would not have been involved in such decisions in case in which an empl oyer selfinsured and selfadministered the health plan the extent to which the employer participated in the decision making process would likely vary according to the size of the plan and how the employer chose to administer the plan if the employer was dir ectly involved in the decision making process regarding the denial or failure that is th subject of the cause of action the employer would have been subject to liability for that decision if the employer was not directly involved and decisions were ma by benefits administrat or the employer likely would have been shielded from liability unless the employer had exercised control in the decisionmaking process however if the bene fits administrator was an employee of the employerplan administrator the principles of vicarious liability as discussed above would likely apply and the employer coul d have been require d to pay damages discretionary authority hr 2990 passed by the house in the 106th congress did not authorize cause of action against group health plan or an employ er or other plan sponsor maintaining the plan or against an employee or such plan employer or sponsor acting within the scope of employment unless the ac tion was based upon the exerci by the plan employer or sponsor of discretionary au thority to make decision on claim for benefits covered under the plan or health insurance coverage in the case at issue nd the exercise of such authority resulted in persona l injury or wrongful death15 discretionary authority was not defined in the legislation however certain activities were not to be construed as an exercise of discretionary authority the exerci of discretionary w ould not have included the decision to include or exclude from the plan any specific benefit any decision to provide extracontractual bene fits or any decision not to consider the provision of benefit while internal or exte rnal review is being conducted16 under hr 2990 an employer would have been shielded from liability unless it exercised discretionary authority with regard to decision on claim for benefits covered under the plan or health insurance coverage in the case at issue an employer who simply provides insurance as benefit to its empl oyees would not likely be involved in such decisions however an employer who sel fadministers benefit plan may exercise discretionary authority if such discreti onary authority was ex ercised and resulted in personal injury or wrongful death the employer would be subject to liability hybrid approach s 1052 as passed by the senate in the 107th congress used hybrid of the direct participation and designate d decision maker approaches to provide employers with greater protection against liability in both fede ral and state causes of action additionally group health plans that are selfinsured and selfadministered by an employer as well as multiemployer plans that are selfinsured and selfadministered would not have been heldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20868crs5 17 s 1052 as passed sec 402 18 id direct participation is fined as it is in hr 526 liable under the federal cause of action for the performance of or the failure to perform any nonmedically reviewable duty under the plan17 as introduced s 1052 included the direct pa rticipation language similar to that in hr 526 this language was retained in s 1052 as passed and added by an amendment introduced by senator snowe samdt 834 were designated decision maker provisions similar to those in the norwood amendment to hr 2563 as passed by the house during the 107th congress under s 1052 as passed and hr 2563 as introduced cause of action would not have arisen against an employer or plan s ponsor unless there was di rect participation by the employer or plan sponsor in the decision of the plan upon consideration of claim for benefits or upon review of nial of claim for benefits18 notwithstanding the direct participation of an employer or plan spons or in any case in which there was deemed to be designated decision maker all liability of the employer or plan sponsor would have been transferred to and assu med by the designated decisi on maker thus the employer or plan sponsor could have co mpletely shielded itself from lia bility even if it had directly participated in the decision making process by naming designated decision maker the snowe amendment to s 1052 also added language shielding plans that are self insured and selfadministered by an employer and multiemployer plans that are self insured and selfadministere d from liability under the federa l cause of action hr 2563 as introduced included this provision as well
