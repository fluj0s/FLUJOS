reconnaissance or combat or combination of both patrols will vary in size from as little as three personnel up to company in strength patrolling is carried out by day and by night in all types of operations 2 new weapons and equipment continually improve the commanders ability to obtain information and inflict damage on the enemy the patrol remains equa lly effective because it is limited only by the ingenuity with which it is employed and the skill and aggressiveness of its members aim 3 the aim of this publication is to provide guidance for the planning and conduct of patrols scope 4 all aspects of patrol planni ng preparation and conduct will be discussed in this publication the rifle platoon is the basis from which the patrolling drills are presented when discussing reconnaissance patrols the rifle section is the basic manoeuvre element the drills and procedures are designed to form standardised platform from which development can occur the principles of patrolling are the same for all operations of war bgl392004fp001 1patrolling the aims of patrolling 5 to gain and maintain the initiative if patrols dominate the ground in the area of opposing defended localities the enemy loses the initiative and is contained largely within his own positi ons successful patrol programme gives freedom of action in the area raises the morale of troops and enhances security patrol should not be deployed unless absolutely necessary 6 to gain information this may be related to one of the following the enemy strength location disposition identification state of defences habits early warning of his intentions b the ground going for vehicles and infantry obstacles ford and ice recces bridge classification and map corrections 7 to deny information to enemy patrols this may include information on disposition strength intention state of defence and b approaches to position and obstacles 8 to harass the enemy the aim is to maintain pressure on the enemy deny him rest and lower his morale 9 to provide security patrols may be used to ensure the area im mediately outside friendly localities is clear of enemy and that there has been unsuspected build up close to the position b to check that minefields wire or warning devices have not been tampered with c to maintain contact with flanking units and sub units bgl392004fp001 2introduction d to cover the gaps between units installations and controlled areas and to prevent the enemy from infiltrating and forming up for an attack to give early warning of enemy approach and to deny penetration and f to give flank protection especially during mobile operations 10 to provide protection patrols may escort specialist and reconnaissance parties such as the engineers confirming sites for river crossing and b be used in conjunction with larger security force ie provide protection of assault positions attack positions or to protect partie s with special duties ie wiring mine laying or obstacle preparation patrol training 11 the aim of patrol training is to teach and practice the basic principles and skills of patrolling and b to develop and maintain the patrolling spirit 12 patrolling can be learned only through practical applicatio n in the form of an exercise training must be conducted in daylight and darkness in all kinds of weather and over varied terrain classroom instruction and cloth model exercise s are valuable aids in teaching patrolling but are not substitutes for actual time in the field 13 realistic scenarios will enhance patrol training and spark enthusiasm among the participants the employment of an enemy force will further enhance realism as well as introduce force on force concept bgl392004fp001 3patrolling the patrolling spirit 14 in order to develop the proper patrolling spirit particular attention must be paid to maintaining enthusiasm nd cheerfulness especially under difficult conditions b determination to complete the task c development of individual initiative and self reliance d comradeship and teamwork and maintaining high personal standard of weapons handling and fieldcraft 15 patrolman must be highly skilled and welltrained infantryman he must be able to move quickly across any type of country independent of roads b be prepared to fight by day or by night equally well and c be capable of working as member of small group or as an individual formulation of patrol policy 16 the formulation of patrol policy and the initial organising of patrols commence at unit level the operations officer ops intelligence officer io and reco nnaissance platoon commander plan and recommend missions for patrols from these recommendations and from the direction provided by higher headquarters hq the patrol plan for unit is developed this plan may extend over period of several days or weeks 17 the amount of direction given by unit hq will vary during the defence more elaborate arrangements may be necessary such as bgl392004fp001 4introduction the issuing of patrol task table see annex for an example the patrol task table is usually issued daily by the unit hqs intellige nce staff however it may have been initiated at much higher level t he patrol task table lists specific details on each patrol and is format ted as follows patrol serial number b unit to provide patrol c type of patrol d time out estimated time of return f time by which the information is required by the headquarters issuing the patrol task table g task h route and i remarks including any sp ecial instructions for the patrol 18 carefully coordinated and wellplanned patrol programme will ensure that planning is thorough and realistic in relation to timings b briefing is thorough c adequate time is allowed for preparation and rehearsal d training and equipment are of high standard every opportunity is taken to destroy andor observe the enemy and f information gained is accurately recorded studied and quickly distributed bgl392004fp001 5patrolling section 2

patrolling b selection of patrol commanders c formulation of patrol missions d issuing of the patrol order coordination f control measures g support h supervision and i debriefing 20 staff duties the detailed organization of patrols in unit or formation will be more efficiently controlled if it can be made the responsibility of one particular individual he is responsible for the following although the planning and briefing may often be done personally by the commander maintaining record of all patrols and patrol reports b maintaining patrol situation map including the following details 1 all information obtained from patrols 2 patrol routes and bgl392004fp001 6introduction 3 exact locations of nefieldsobstacles and forward troops c ensuring that the task is clear to the unit or patrol commander d ensuring that the briefing officer is in possession of all information and the latest maps air photographs overlays traces etc ensuring that the size routes and timings of patrols are varied so as not to alert the enemy 21 unit action the commanding officer co cannot personally accomplish all patrolling responsibilities many functions related to the patrolling effort are delegated to staff officers and subordinate commanders selection of patrol commanders the co of the unit or the company commander of the subunit providing the patrol will select the patrol commander he must ensure rotation of duty and avoid excessive use of selected few officers or noncommissioned members ncms b formulation of patrol missions 1 the ops io or reconnaissance platoon commander plan and recommend missions for patrols the co must then approve 2 only one primary mission is assigned to patrol alternate and secondary missions may be assigned 3 the mission must be clearly stated thoroughly understood and within the capabilities of the patrol bgl392004fp001 7patrolling c issuing of the patrol order 1 the patrol commander is issued an order in the form of mission briefing that provides all instructions information and guidance needed to plan prepare for and accomplish the patrol 2 the mission briefings are sometimes issued by the co but are usually issued by the ops 3 the io gives an intelligence briefing as part of or in addition to the mission brief and 4 any delegated individual may give information to the patrol commander on matters related to specific areas or tasks d coordination 1 coordination is conducted by unit hq personnel and by the patrol commander the three general areas of coordination are between the patrol unit hq and hq of other units b patrol unit hq and the patrol commander and c the patrol commander and units or personnel immediately affected by or involved in the patrols operation 2 coordination in these general areas frequently overlaps to ensure it is continuous complete and properly accomplished this is particularly true of bgl392004fp001 8introduction longrange patrols since the dispatching units areas may overlap those of other units control measures the co is limited in controlling patrol and influencing its actions after it has departed the following are control measures which may be included in the mission briefing 1 time of departure may be stated in general terms such as departure after last light or departure before st light specific time may be given to prevent congestion in an area reduce the possibility of contact between patrols and provide absolute control 2 time of return is usually stated in general terms but may be specific information secured by reconnaissance patrol may loose its value if it is not received by certain time or future operations may hinge on the results of fighting patrol similarly patrol may be required to accomplish its mission at or within certain time for example it may be required to destroy communications centre at or by certa in time in order to assist planned attack when the commander places time restrictions on patrol he must provide for the possibility that despite its best efforts the patrol will not be able to accomplish the mission and comply with time restrictions normally accomplishment of the mission has first priority but determination of priority is the cos responsibility when he places time restrictions on patrol he must state which has priorityaccomplishment of the mission or return of the patrol meeting time limitations bgl392004fp001 9patrolling 3 checkpoints are designated locations on the ground over or near which patrol must pass normally report is made upon reaching the vicinity of checkpoint and thus the co is kept informed of the patrols location 4 general routes may be defined through checkpoints the exact route is seldom prescribed except in route reconnaissance or when very close control of movement is desired 5 the communications plan outlines reports to be made and methods of transmission radio is usually the best means but line may be suitable in some situations when the distance is short the type of radio used is determined by the distance the patrol will travel the availability of radios and the method of movement foot or vehicle simple prearranged codes and codewords are used to reduce transmission time and decrease the possibility of compromising the mission b pyrotechnics may also be used but they increase the possibility of detection and c prearranged code words or pyrotechnics may be used to indicate departure of friendly areas arrival at checkpoints accomplishment of the mission or other desired information bgl392004fp001 10introduction f support 1 the ops arranges with the fire support coordination centrefscc for effective supporting fire 2 the quartermaster qm provides equipment not readily available to the patrol and 3 the ops arranges for specially qualified personnel such as scouts tracking teams demolition specialists and pathfinders g supervision commanders and staff officers actively supervise all phases of patrol planning and preparation giving patrols the necessary support and resources required to complete the mission h debriefing 1 all patrols are debriefed on their return by the co ops or io the format is the standard north atlantic treaty organization nato patrol report form shown at annex b 2 debriefing techniques vary one effective method is for the patrol commander to give narrative account of the patrol from departure to return each patrolman then contributes any additional information the individual conducting the debrief asks questions to secure desired information 3 whatever the debriefing technique used all patrolmen must have the opportunity to offer information bgl392004fp001 11patrolling conclusion 22 successful patrolling depends on the following simplicity the mission plan and organization for the patrol must be as simple as possible complex plans increase the risk of failure b preparation 1 planning must be detailed and realistic in relation to timings 2 briefings must be clear and thorough and 3 adequate time must be allowed for preparation rehearsal and rest if the patrol will operate over an extended period participants should be relieved of their duties at least eight hours prior to departure c conduct 1 the patrol must be commanded and led confidently and aggressively and 2 every opportunity must be taken to destroy the enemy as long as the mission is not jeopardized d staff action 1 tasks must be well coordinated and planned in detail to avoid needless patrolling 2 warning orders must be passed quickly and 3 information gained must be accurately recorded studied and quickly distributed bgl392004fp001 12patrolling chapter 2 types and tasks of patrols section 1 general types of patrols 1 patrols are classified as be ing reconnaissance fighting or standing these patrols differ in size equipment carried and most importantly in the actions carried out on the objective reconnaisance patrols collect or confirm information about the enemy or terrain these patrols are classified as point route or area b fighting patrols provide security harass destroy or capture enemy personnel equipment and installations fighting patrols are classified as primarily raids or ambushes c standing patrols combine tasks from both reconnaissance and fighting patrols they provide early warning of enemy movement prevent infiltration and cover gaps and dead ground 2 standing patrol may be required to delay the enemy therefore its conduct will be disc ussed under the heading fighting patrols in chapter six 3 pathfinder patrols are organized along the same lines as fighting patrol and are conducted when there is requirement to establish drop zones dzs landing zones lzs or beachheads they are normally inserted well behi nd enemy lines and provide vital detailed intelligence of the objective area as well as guide incoming troops from the point of insertion to the objective area pathfinder patrols require unique skill set and will be discussed in their own publication bgl392004fp001 13patrolling patrol tasks 4 patrols with reconnaissance tasks obtain information by conducting point reconnaissance or surveillance of point target or small area b area reconnaissance or surveillance of an extended target or area c route reconnaissance which is type of area reconnaissance where specific points along designated route are reconnoitred 5 patrols that remain in location while the remainder of the force departs the area are referred to as stay behind patrols stay behind patrol is refinement of reconnaissance patrol and does not refer to the primary mission or task of patrol stay behind patrols are organized and equipped as the mission dictates but are usually small section size or less they commence their mission from static location conducting surveillance from an observation post op stay behind patrols depart their assigned areas by whatever means available usually by foot 6 fighting patrols aid the combat effort by conducting variety of tasks raids to destroy or capture personnel or equipment destroy installations or liberate personnel b ambushes of enemy patrols carrying parties wire repair teams convoys and foot columns c establishing or maintaining contact or both with friendly or enemy forces d providing security by preventing or detecting infiltration and preventing surprise and ambush providing protection for technical specialists by preventing enemy from interfering with their task f destroying vehicles in defensive position or leaguer bgl392004fp001 14types and tasks of patrols section 2 use of scouts general 7 force is responsible for its own protection this can often be achieved by the use of suitable formations if the enemy has been located and the ground in front is clear when the position of the enemy is unknown and the ground cannot be observed scouts should be sent forward it may often be necessary to employ scouts on an exposed flank to guard against surprise scouts should not be employed in such way that they mask supporting fire 8 how scouts work scouts work in pairs they move forward by bounds from one objective to another by the caterpillar or leapfrog method when the objective for the next bound has been selected one of the pair chooses his route to it and moves forward rapidly while the other observes when the first scout reaches his objective he signals the other to come forward this having been done the process is repeated the reasons for this procedure are 1 the second scout is able to cover the advance of the lead scout with fire and help him to withdraw if he is surprised by the enemy and 2 if the lead scout gets into difficulties the other can inform the patrol commander in time for him to take the necessary action b the aim of scout is to see without being seen he should use his weapon only in selfdefence or in the defence of others c bounds should be routes which provide good view ahead and are suitable for signalling back to the patrol the distance scout moves depends on the nature of the ground short distance in open bgl392004fp001 15patrolling country is useless unless the scouts are able to see more than the patrol commander patrol commanders must maintain strict control over the movements of their scouts should they wish to give new orders they must signal to their scouts to halt and then move up to them scouts must be thoroughly briefed on the patrol route and posses the ability to navigate effectively under all conditions d scouts may often locate gaps in the enemys obstacle belt thus enabling the patrol to infiltrate in small numbers without detection at night each scout should be equipped with night vision devices it must be noted that where scouts possess this equipment they must be thoroughly briefed on their speed of movement this is done so that contact between them and the patrol commander is not lost f scouts must have adequate communications and must be prepared to use hand signals in the event of communications failure or radio silence signals for day and night movement must be rehearsed prior to the advance bgl392004fp001 16patrolling chapter 3 preparing for patrol section 1 briefing of the patrol commander aim 1 patrol commanders ptl comds are formally briefed using standardised format which ensures that they receive all available information as quickly as possi ble the overall aim is the accomplishment of the mission with as little expenditure of resources as possible location 2 the patrol comd may be briefed at any one of number of locations it is preferable that th is occurs at an observation post op where the ground over which the ptl will move can be seen briefi ngs can also occur at company or batta lion headquarters hqs or for unique task at brigade hqs attendance 3 depending on the nature of the ptl and the location of the briefing the following personnel may attend briefing at company hqs or op 1 ptl comd 2 company comd and 3 forward observation

have sufficient time to do this however through careful planning concurrent activity following ptl battle procedure and by using the experience of the ptl 2ic importa nt details will not be forgotten 12 the ptl comd must listen car efully when receiving orders writing down only critical information rather then trying to write down every spoken word after orders questions must be asked on points

other task the main headings are listed below and will be expanded upon with subheadings pertaining to ptlling only they are as follows step 1 receive warning order b step 2 conduct quick map study c step 3 prepare quick time estimate d step 4 issue the initial warning order step 5 receive orders f step 6 conduct mission analysis preliminary planning to include 1 organization 2 routes general 3 selection of patrolmen weapons and eqpt and 4 initial coordination g step 7 conduct detailed map study h step 8 prepare detailed time estimate i step 9 issue detailed warning order j step 10 prepare recce and coordination plan k step 11 conduct recce and coordination l step 12 complete detailed plan bgl392004fp001 22preparing for patrol m step 13 prepare and issue ptl orders n step 14 coordinate and supervise ptl preparation to include 1 inspections and rehearsals 2 forced rest time permitting 3 final coordination and 4 final briefing and inspection step 15 supervise deployment and conduct the mission receive warning order 14 the ptl comd will receive onl limited information at this time usually only enough to start basic planning up to the time he goes to orders when receiving wa rning order if u are in doubt ask questions quick map study 15 quick map study is conducted to ensure the ptl comd knows where he is going to receive orders and where the basic area of operations will be this initial look at the map may prompt the ptl comd towards specific coordination later in battle procedure the p tl 2ic will also need to be informed of any timings so he can commence with battle procedure quick time estimate 16 quick time estimate is essential it is required to ensure th ptl comd is not late for orders and assists the ptl 2ic in the commencement of eqpt preparation timings at this stage are limited bgl392004fp001 23patrolling issue initial warning order 17 the ptl needs time to prepare the initial warning order initiates this process an initial warning order must be issued p rior to the ptl comd departing for orders it should include the following brief statement of enemy and friendly situations b brief statement of mission c the time and location of orders group move beforedegree of notice to move timing for orders may be given asnot before d special administration instructions and in general the organization and delegation of specific tasks to individuals note detailed information as to wh at each patrolman will carry and the exact ptl organization will probably not be available prior to the issuing of the detailed warning order however certain eqpt requirements and administrative details will be known the in itial warning order is intended to prompt subordinates to commence working towards bigger tasks and to start concurrent activity short time appreciation can also be included up to the issuing of the detailed warning order receive orders 18 the receiving of orders is by far one of the most important steps in the ptl battle procedure process if sufficient information is not obtained during the mission briefing the ptl comd could plan incorrectly the more informa tion extracted from the mission briefing the better the ptls chances of success bgl392004fp001 24preparing for patrol conduct mission analysis preliminary planning 19 preliminary planning is an essential step in the battle procedure process it enables the ptl 2ic and element comds to start their own planning and concurrent activities 20 in preliminary planning there are three basic areas that must be covered organization routes general and the selection of patrolmen weapons and eqpt 21 organization selection is usually restricted to the ptl comds section or platoon when possible maintain section aslt group and fire team configuration this helps to maintain integrity and ensures smooth transition from the previous task 22 routes at this time in the planning sequence routes should be general only the primary and alternate altn route areas must be looked at but most bearings and distances should not be selected til the detailed planning stage 23 selection of patrolmen weapons and eqpt personnel only the best personnel should be selected for the ptl if possible do not hesitate to replace men who may interfere with the mission personnel chosen for ptl should be 1 in good shape fit and healthy 2 in possession of the patrolling spirit 3 well trained dependable and reliable 4 have good vision and hearing 5 be capable of working on their own initiative and 6 avoid personnel with coughs or colds and night blindness bgl392004fp001 25patrolling b weapons selection the weapons taken on ptl should be determined by the mission only in rare cases is the bulk and weight of weapons and ammunition decisive factor in their selection or rejection weapons carried will vary with the type of ptl 1 fighting ptls must be capable of producing maximum fire power on short notice therefore automatic weapons should be used as much as possible the c6 machine gun and c9 light machine gun lmg are useful to fighting ptl particularly if firebase is to be established or if the ptl is to be conducted in daylight b the firepower of the c7 and c8 make them suitable as weapons for ptls however there should be at least one c9 lmg in every recce ptl c fragmentation and smoke grenades are extremely effective in ptl work the use of grenades during ptl must be rehearsed and closely controlled by the ptl comd d if required antitank weapons must also be considered 2 recce ptls carry w eapons primarily for their own protection special weapons are employed only as required like the fighting ptl at least one c9 lmg should be carried if it necessary to carry large amounts of ammunition employing the c6 machine gun would be advantageous bgl392004fp001 26preparing for patrol c eqpt selection there are five general reason for which eqpt may be chosen some eqpt is used for more than one purpose or in more than one area 1 in the obj area this is the eqpt with which the task is to be accomplished and is the most important consideration it includes such items as ammunition demolitions plastic handcuffs blindfolds for prisoners first aid kits binoculars night vision eqpt radios plgr gps glowsticks and flashlights 2 route this eqpt assists the ptl in reaching the obj it includes such items as maps binoculars night vision eqpt compasses plgrgps asltrecce boats life preservers rope bridging eqpt ammunition flashlights and wire cutters 3 control radios pen flares pyrotechnics whistles radars night vision eqpt thermal devices glowsticks and luminous tape these items assist in control enroute and during action at the obj 4 water and food each patrolman carries minimum of one canteen on longer ptls more water must be carried if the ptl expects to be operatin g over an extended time frame rations also need to be carried each patrolman should always carry at least one ration in case of an emergency 5 routine eqpt this is the eqpt normally carried by all ptls or which is common to all patrolmen it includes the uniform to be worn fighting order and individual eqpt normally every patrol man carries his rain gearponcho and at least one extra pair of socks even in warm weather gloves are carried bgl392004fp001 27patrolling 24 the eqpt selection process is very important nothing must be overlooked however the ptl comd must ensure he does not carry eqpt that will not be used all eqpt worn or carried by ptl must be secured to the person carrying it to prevent rattling catching on brush or loss the following eqpt will be useful to any type of ptl and should always be carried map b compass and plgrgps c watch d binoculars night vision devices f flashlight g wire cutters h notebook and pencil i hessian or other sacking material j mine tape k prisoner of war pw kit and l first aid kit 25 clothing must be comfortable and permit ease of movement footwear must be selected to give protection in rugged terrain but it must also be silent rubber soled boots are preferable to running shoes as they are more durable and offer more protection gymnasium type shoes do not have sufficient sp or protection for the ankles or feet head gear with luminous tape should be worn luminous tape can also be applied to individual items of eqpt such as fighting order and rucksacks key personnel should wear distinctive luminous markings for ease of identification bgl392004fp001 28preparing for patrol 26 each patrolman should carry only the eqpt necessary to accomplish his task eqpt redi stribution for large amounts of ammunition for crew served weapons will be specified in the detaile d warning order maps and airsatellite photos must remain unmarked the signaller sig will be located close to the ptl comd and carrie s special items such as codes and frequencies all personnel must be aware of the location of mission esse ntial items within the ptl in addition to personal weapons and eqpt other items will usually be required soft stretchers to assi st in casualty evacuation b spare batteries and hand sets for the radio quantities of unique ammunition such as explosives may be required for special tasks c medical supplies will be carried and spread throughout the ptl key personal will have morphine or applicable medication and each patrolman will carry his own shell dressings additional medical supplies may be required for ptls of long duration on platoon or company size fighting ptl medical assistant will carry additional medical supplies d rations will usually fall into two categories firstly rations carried on the man in his web gear that can be obtained on short notice secondly packed which will be in the rucksack these will be used only when the ptl is stopped for long periods all rations will normally of the individual meal packet imp type meals requiring little preparation are preferred as open flame will not be used at night and is strictly controlled during daylight hours 27 listed below is

warning order 28 the selection and distribution of eqpt for fighting ptl is more complex and must be planned in greater detail as ptl comd of fighting ptl it is good idea to have the ptl 2ic and element comds aid in the eqpt selectiondistribution process 29 conclusion the success of ptl and the ease with which the task is carried out may well depend upon the eqpt carried and its distribution for these reasons distribution must be thoroughly planned detailed map study 30 the ptl comd must conduct thorough map study of the terrain over which the ptl will operate ensuring he checks the map marginal data datum if the map is old features may have changed especially manmade features terra in in the vicinity of the obj will effect the deployment of security secur the manner in which recce is conducted or the direction of raid or ambush terrain route t the obj also influences the size eqpt and organization of the ptl ie boats and boat crews or ropes for cr ossing streams the terrain also influences movement formations 31 when conducting detailed map recce the ptl comd should study the terrain with the following points in mind cover and concealment b fields of fire c fields of observation d avenues of approach and withdrawal key terrain features bgl392004fp001 31patrolling f enemy locations and likely positions g dead ground h danger areas i natural obstacles and j places ambushes may be met or laid detailed time estimate 32 detailed time estimate ensures that routine is establish ed routine will ensure that adequate time is spent preparing for the ptl that details are overlooked that tasks are completed efficiently and that the ptl receives adequate rest the routine for the ptl will include timings for issuing of ammunition and eqpt b feeding c inspection and testing of weapons and eqpt d briefings and orders day and night rehearsals f rest and g final inspection and briefing 33 normally the detailed time estimate starts with the time of debriefing and works backwards to th receipt of the mission briefing timings prior to this would have been covered in the quick time estimate the detailed time estimate is planned around specified times such as time of departure time the mission must be accomplished and the time of re turn the sequence of battle procedure and the time allotte d to accomplish tasks will vary according to the mission figure 31

this ensures that the 2ic is familiar with the ground and the basic plan th ird patrolman should be taken for secur 37 planned recce will accomplish much more than one conducted haphazardly in preparation for your recce determine what you intend on observing from where and with whom establish an order or sequence by which your r ecce will be conducted in planning the ptl comd must consider the following all available information about the situation this includes maps air photos and reports from previous ptls b the mission of the ptl c what to look for in order that the aim will be achieved d the time available this determines how detailed the recce will be 38 the ptl comd should conduct all possible coordination before leaving the place where orders were received conduct recce

after the operation order or mission briefing the ptl comd should check with other ptl comds who will be operating in the same area if the ptl comd is not aware of any other units operating in his area he should check with the io during the operations coordination to be certain the io can help arrange this coordination if necessary ptl comds should exchange the following information with the

of understanding and familiarity with the overall plan some general points are day and night rehearsals must be conducted if possible use terrain similar to that over which the ptl will operate all actions should be rehearsed if bgl392004fp001 79patrolling time is limited rehearse the most critical phase action at the obj b the ptl should be ta lked through each phase describing the actions and having each element perform their assigned tasks when the ptl comd is satisfied that everything is understood the next step is to execute runthrough using only the sigs and comds used during the mission rehearsals are to continue until the ptl is thoroughly familiar with the operation rehearsals should be conducted using the weapons and eqpt that will be taken on the ptl the following should be practised 1 formations and order of march 2 individual positions in each of the formations 3 method of changing formations 4 action on crossing obstacles 5 action to be taken on encountering the

rest 59 final briefing and inspection just prior to departure final briefing and inspection is conducted this time must be used to conduct brief backs and confirm missi on specific details faults from the initial inspection must be corrected well in advance of t he final inspection this time is also used to acquire night vision prior to movement supervise deployment and conduct the mission 60 the entire battle procedure process will culminate during thi s portion of the mission it is without doubt the most important step as the action at obj phase will now be conducted part of this process also includes the ptl debrief it is critical that the ent ire ptl be canvassed for information when preparing for debriefing conclusion 61 ptl battle procedure is without question one of the most important aspects of ptl whether the ptl comd has one hour or 48 hours for battle procedure preparation must be conducted in the most efficient manner possible having well rehearsed realistic standing operating procedures sops that everyone is familiar with reduces wastage of time and increases effici ency comds at all levels must endeavour to develop standardised ptl drills while maintaining platoonsectionaslt group and fire team integrity bgl392004fp001 81patrolling chapter 4 conduct of patrols section 1 movement general 1 without detailed knowledg of patrolling drills it is difficult to make the most of battle procedure this chapter outl ines the tactics techniques and procedures that can be used during the conduct of patrol ptl 2 see annex c for ptl tips formations and order of march 3 the mission of ptl and the resources allotted for that mission are in part determined by what action must be taken on the objective obj the formations and the order of march used throughout the ptl will be dictated by the ptl commander comd and are adjusted as the situation dictates 4 the dismounted platoon and section formations which are discussed and illustrated in bgl392001fp001 infantry section and platoon in battle are adaptable to ptl of any size each formation has certain advantages and may be varied to fit any terrain or situation in some circumstan ces control may be sacrificed for dispersion or speed for greater stealth and security secur specific ptl formations are designated in chapters five and six 5 factors that influence ptl organization and movement formations are as follows enemy contact understand possible enemy ambushcounter ambush drills what course of action will you take if your ptl encounters enemy bgl392004fp001 83patrolling b the enemy situation where and in what strength is the enemy located could the ptl be ambushed c employment at obj consistent with other considerations organize so employment at the obj is quick and efficient d can the ptl be better controlled in one formation than another the size of the ptl is an important consideration tactical integrity if possible maintain platoon section assault aslt group and fire team integrity inevitably some reorganization will occur f terrain how will the terrain affect the rate of movement is it wooded or open terrain are there roads or streams to cross how will secur be effected g speed of movement when must the ptl reach the obj when must it return if circumstances permit heavy weapons and equipment eqpt are placed near the front so that they set the pace h stealth can the ptl move quietly does the formation force the flanks to move through noisy underbrush which is most importantstealth or speed i secur from which direction is contact with the enemy most likely to come does the ptl have all around secur assign ar eas of responsibility to elements and teams will speed or stealth provide the best secur j dispersion could the entire ptl be hit by one burst of fire can the ptl be easily controlled k visibility is visibility good or poor will it affect bgl392004fp001 84conduct of patrols l weather how will the weather affect movement visibility and the enemy

fdl 7 coordination coord the commander comd coords with friendly units in whose areas the ptl will operate in some instances he makes all arrangemen ts for departure and return normally the ptl comd will have to contact one or more positions near or through which the ptl will pass and coordinate its movement through these areas positions wh ere coord may be necessary are company or platoon command posts cps observation posts ops and the last position through which the ptl will pass reconnaissance recce must be planned and executed carefully as any unusual activity may alert the enemy to an upcoming event 8 selection when selecting an area to depart or reenter the forward edge of the battle area feb the ptl comd should look for forward defended locality fdl as close as possible to his area f operation with the least amount of enemy activity at times it may be advantageous to move further knowing that the crossing of the fdl will be without enemy intervention 9 secur when approaching fdls all movement must be carried out cautiously until the ptl has been identified the ptl shoul d be met by guide and taken to the assembly area in some instances the assembly area and initial rendezvous irv will be the same location the guide will take the ptl comd and signallerrunne r if reqr to the appropriate headquarters hq for final coord 10 final coord the ptl comd must now

information on the enemy ground and known obstacles he will ensure that subsequent relief is aware of the ptls activity the duties of the guide for departure and reentry must be confirmed prior to the completion of final coord upon completion the guide takes the ptl hqs back to the assembly area 11 action on departure after confirmatory orders the guide leads the ptl up to the irv in the irv the ptl comd must ensure the guide is aware of his duties and that local secur is in place with this accomplished the guide l eads the ptl up to and through the gap the guide will usually remain on the enemy side the ptl will pass through the gap to predesignated rendezvous rv on the enemy side or it will continue on leg one of its route throughout this process the guide remains in location and does not leave until the predesignated time figure 41 12 enemy contact on departure of the fdl action on enemy contact drills must be confirmed during final coord these drills must be well rehearsed straightforward and realistic dynami c drills requiring excessive amounts of precision and lateral movement will be difficult to execute within minefield or wire obstacle excessive movement may mask friendly covering fire ptls should make the best use of smoke grenades and speed comds at all levels must ensure that their personnel are aware of the following drills prior to entering the gap the

are not surprised by the returning ptl and begin firing and b the returning ptl will not become entangled with or confused with an enemy ptl and attract fire 2 action at 1000 metres the ptl comd halts the ptl and contacts his headquarters hq by radio giving the appropriate codeword advising them that the ptl is 1 000 metres from the fdl and proceeding depending on the tactical situation in the immediate vicinity of the fdl the ptl may be instructed to hold in location move to different area or to proceed in the hqs then alert all troops in the fdl and advise them that friendly ptl is in the

pacers check the distance from point to point at least two pacers are used and the average taken of their counts for an approximation of the distance travelled pacers are separated so one will not influence the others count each man on the ptl must know how many of his normal paces equa l 100 metres over many different types of terrain pacers must be able to do this by day or night ove r an extended period while carrying various types and weights of eqpt 20 the route is divided into legs with each leg starting at point which can be rec ognised on the ground the pacers must start their counts again at the beginning of each leg this makes the count easier to keep and provides periodic checks on the accuracy of the pacers figure 43 21 the counts of all pacers must be sent forward at the ptl comds request so that the ptls position can be determined at any time 22 navigation is discussed in annex d bgl392004fp001 93patrolling departure point800 m to stream on bearing of 0010

patrolman if required the ptl is normally halted for rest periods navigation checks listening halts at rvs or when crossing obstacles 24 there are two types of halts long halts long halt is halt that is going to be longer than five minutes bgl392004fp001 94conduct of patrols b short halts short halt is halt that is going to be 5 minutes or less 25 if possible the ptl comd shoul d ensure that he

him and states threed sectplatoon that man will tap the man to his front and state four once the ptl comd is tapped and given number he will take that number and add the number of the patrolmen to his front the total number should eq ual the size of the entire ptl if it is incorrect he will halt the ptl and have the ptl 2ic move to the front counting and identifying each man as he comes forward 29 moving after short haltplatoon size ptl the ptl comd will signal advance b same drill as for long halt twentyeight c the ptl 2ic should be up front counting the ptl as it passes if this is not possi

sectiondetachment size ptls sectiondetachment size ptls will conduct all action after halts in the same manner as platoon size ptl s the ptl 2ic may not have to count from the front on smaller detachment size ptls note it is essential that all patrolmen pass hand sigs to the best of their ability when patrolman passes given hand signal it is the responsibility of that patrolman to ensure that the given hand signal is recei ved and understood by the patrolman to whom he is issuing it to the patrolman receiving the hand signal shou ld acknowledge the receipt of the hand signal by giving thumbs up acknowledgement when patrolman stands up to move he must ensure that the patrolman behind him is moving approximately every three steps for the first 20 paces he should look behind him to ensure that the remainder of the ptl is following if he is not being followed he must stop the ptl at once rendezvous 31 an rv is place where ptl can assemble and reorganize it should provide cover and concealment be defensible for short time be easily recognised and known to all patrolmen all rvs are termed ntative rvs until they are reached found to be suitable and designated b when an rv is designated you must ensure the information is passed back to all patrolmen 32 there are three types of rvs irv point within friendly lines where the ptl can gather if it comes under contact as it leaves the gapobstacle belt the irv must be coord with the comd in whose area it lies bgl392004fp001 99patrolling b rvs route rvs between friendly areas and the obj c orv rv near the obj where the ptl can gather for final preparations prior to and after actions at the obj this may include eqpt redistribution leaders recce confirmatory orders or reassembly of elements after the mission is accomplished it should remain secured usually by secur team or nonessential hq personnel 33 when selecting rvs the ptl comd should consider the following likely locations for rvs during the ptl comds map recce are to be selected and designated as tentative rvs in the ptl comds orders they may prove unsuitable and must be confirmed and announced when reached b tentative irv and tentative orv will always be selected c additional rvs are selected route as the ptl reaches suitable locations d when danger area is reached that cannot be bypassed such as trail or stream there must be rv on both the near and far sides if good locations are not available the rv will be chosen in relation to the danger area for example the ptl comd will say rv 50 metres this side of the trail or rv 50 metres beyond the stream 1 those who reconnoitre the danger area must also check beyond it for suitable rv and 2 if the crossing of the danger area is interrupted or if portion of the ptl becomes separated all patrolmen proceed to the appropriate rv as directed preferably on the far side bgl392004fp001 100conduct of patrols 34 the use of rvs should be as follows the irv and rvs route are selected to prevent complete failure of the ptl if it is unavoidably dispersed b the orv helps the ptl to reassemble after tasks have been carried out on the obj c if dispersed within the friendly lines patrolmen assemble at the irv or assembly area d if dispersed between friendly lines and the first rv route patrolmen move to the irv or to the first rv route the ptl comd must state the rv to be used during orders the decision must be based on the careful consideration of the following circumstances 1 return to the irv may be extremely difficult due to mines wire or the enemy situation 2 forward movement to the first rv route may also be difficult impractical or impossible the point selected may be mined or occupied by the enemy the cause of dispersal such as enemy contact may prevent forward movement without maps and compasses patrolmen may not be able to locate the point if dispersed between rvs ptls have the option of moving forward to the next rv or back to the last this decision must be detailed in orders and is based on careful consideration of all circumstances ptls should endeavour to remain together at all times 35 actions when rv is designated rv drills must be well rehearsed and understood by the entire ptl the drill should be as follows bgl392004fp001 101patrolling platoon size ptl 1 the ptl comd sigs halt rv route 2 the ptl executes shortlong halt and closes up 3 the ptl 2ic moves forward to the ptl comd 4 the ptl comd sends the nav forward to inform the lead secur of the rvs location 5 the ptl comd advises the 2ic of exactly where the rv is he then sigs the ptl to stand up and move off the ptl 2ic points out the rv to each patrolman of the ptl as they pass his location 6 as each patrolman passes the rv location they will pick out recognisable feature they will also look back to see what the rv will look like from the direction they will be approaching if they have to use it 7 once all patrolmen have passed the rv the 2ic will assume his normal position in the ptl and send up the count to the ptl comd b sectiondetachment size ptl 1 the ptl comd sigs r v route to the ptl patrolman to his rear he will then point to the exact location of the rv 2 as they reach the rv location each patrolman will pass this signal to the man behind in the exact same manner 3 as each patrolman passes the rv location they will pick out recognisable feature they will also look back to see what the bgl392004fp001 102conduct of patrols rv will look like from the direction they will be approaching if they have to use it 36 actions when rv is used the ptl must continue as long as there is reasonable chance to accom plish the mission if the ptl is required to use designated rv route the fol must be considered note there will be occasions durin g platoon movement when halt for rv is not practical in these situations the same basic drill as for sectiondetachment will be used the ptl can wait until specified number or percentage of patrolmen have arrived and then proceed under the senior man present this plan could be used for recce ptl where one or two patrolmen may be able to accomplish the mission b the ptl can wait for specified period after which the senior man present will determine the actions to be taken based on personnel and eqpt available this may be the option when minimum number of men or certain items of eqpt or both are essential to the accomplishment of the mission danger areaslinear an d prepared obstacles 37 danger area is any place wh ere the ptl is vulnerable to enemy fire or observation when making map study or conducting forward recce the ptl comd must id entify all danger areas the ptl will encounter along its intended route 38 there are 3 classifications of danger areas open areas b linear obstacles roadtracks streamscreeks and fence lines bgl392004fp001 103patrolling c prepared obstacles such as 1 low wire 2 concertina wire 3 minefields and 4 tank ditches 39 the ptl comd can in way predict where all danger areas will be located along ptl route by doing proper map study and using all available intelligence resources he should be able to com pile an accurate list of open areas lin ear and prepared obstacles intelligence briefings air and satellite photos are all useful information tools to assist in this process 40 action at open areas and linear obstacles platoon size ptl 1 point

secur halt on the far side can be conducted to confirm personnel if the ptl comd desires bgl392004fp001 112conduct of patrols 41 action at prepared obstacles all manmade obstacles should be avoided and crossing attempted unless it is absolutely necessary prepared obstacles are likely to be under intense enemy observation and covered by fire such obstacles will always be treated as danger area drill the fol drills apply concertina two men must crawl under the wire and lift it to allow point secur to move through and conduct the secur sweep b minefield the aim of action on mines is to prevent further casualties from occurring when ptl has already entered minefield note the above drills are not the only way to cross open areas or linear obstacles variations can be applied as long as sectur is maintained note it is not drill for mine clearance 1 once the ptl sustains casualty from mineordiscovers they are in minefield 2 the entire ptl must fr eeze at this stage one must move 3

suitable crossing site up or down the obstacle always deploy near side secur if cutting is unavoidable 1 the lead secur will cut the wire one man holding both ends while the other cuts using sandbag to muffle the sound if only one person cut the line near post or picket while holding the other side to prevent spring back 2 this process will continue until the entire ptl is through the wire if the obstacle does not have great deal of depth point secur may clear completely through to the far side before the remainder of the ptl follows note avoid touching or lifting mines if possible minefields should be treated as linear obs tacles under contact ptls must try to extract themselves while following their entry route note hedges and other types of fences can be formidable and will take timeand hard work to negotiate ptl comds should try to find locationwhere crossing would be easier or avoid the obstacle all together avoid obvious crossing points and move as quickly as possible bgl392004fp001 114conduct of patrols action if separated or lost 42 patrolmen must keep looking back and forward to ensure that the man to the rear is not dropping back and the man in front is not going too fast if all patrolmen pay attention and stop the ptl when necessary one should become lost or separated however after contact it may be difficult to recove r everyone especially when the enemy is close by 43 action if separated if the ptl becomes separated the senior patrolman must immediately take charge and try to estb contact wit h the remainder of the ptl the fol drill applies to separated indivi dual patrolman or ptl split into smaller groups wait on the ptl route in location for 15 minutes b move to the last known rv and wait for predetermined period of time that will be given in orders c if still contact with the ptl move back to the next known rv carry on in this fashion until you reach your own lines or the ptl base 44 action if lost once patrolman is lost it is very important that they do not panic if they cannot find the last rv they must first orient themselves to find their location once this is accomplis hed the lost patrolman has two courses of action depending on how close they are to the obj close to obj they should move to an obvious prominent feature which should be predesignated in orders from here they should try and reach either the orv dissemination point or if possible planned return route rv plans must be detailed on how personnel will be recovered if they do not link up with the ptl by certain time b close to friendly lines the lost patrolman should move on general bearing towards friendly lines the patrolman can either wait near the reentry location and try to linkup with his ptl or attempt to bgl392004fp001 115patrolling reenter friendly lines emergency reentry drills must be coord and known by all patrolmen signalling with coded ir device is one example of an emergency reentry signal note any sporadic movement around the obj or near the orv may compromise the ptl careful consideration and realistic contingencies must be developed to ensure lost patrolmen are recovered safely if the lost patrolman is recovered it is extremely important that every effort is made to contact the ptl so thatthey dont waste time waiting at rvs extraction procedures 45 there are numerous methods for the extraction of ptls from their area of operation helicopter boat ship truck and partisans can all be utilised these methods should be covered in great detail in the ptl annexes the ptl comd must also estb an emergency extraction procedure if the mission has to be aborted it should be simple and easy to understand plan that all patrolmen can utilise themse lves without difficulty it must be well thought out and coord prior to departure part of this procedure is to designate an ee rv an ee rv has the same characteristics as other rvs and is located within ptls area of operation action at orv 46 the occupation of the orv is extremely important due to its close proximity to the obj any compromise in secur could jeopardize the entire mission the action taken for the occupation of an orv should be as follows platoon size ptl 1 the ptl comd will halt the ptl 100200 m from the tentative orv the ptl comd will bgl392004fp001 116conduct of patrols then give the signal long halt the ptl will close up and the 2ic will move forward 2 once the ptl comd has confirmed his location he will inform the ptl that this is the secur halt prior to the orv 3 after the ptl comd issues the 2ic contingency plan he will take the point secur nav and sig and move to the tentative orv to determine its suitability 4 point secur will carry out box search clearing the orv positioning themselves at the six and twelve oclock the ptl comd will issue them contingency plan prior to departing 5 the ptl comd will then move back to the secur halt with the nav and sig ensuring the point secur has communications with the ptlif possible 6 the recce party should be challenged upon its return the ptl comd will pick up the remainder of the ptl and move them to the orv location 7 once at the orv location the soldier at six oclock will direct and count all patrolmen as they pass the ptl will then move into an all round defence 8 patrolmen will move to their appropriate position and cease all movement 10 minute listening halt will be conducted 9 after the listening halt all element comds will report to the ptl comd for confirmatory orders bgl392004fp001 117patrolling figure 47 types of allround defensive positions note either formation may be used the sp element must be at or close to the twelve oclock position if contact is made it is likely to come from twelve oclock thus firebase is already established note there are four types of all r ound defensive positions that are acceptable for platoon size p tl they are the circle box triangle and long halt cigar the duration of the listening halt is at the discretion of the ptl comd figure 44 47 b sectiondetachment size ptlsoccupation by force 1 the ptl comd will halt his ptl 100200 m from the tentative orv location 2 once the ptl comd has confirmed his location he

the bgl392004fp001 118conduct of patrols ptl will adopt fire positions and wait 10 minutes action at the obj 48 action at the obj is the most important phase of the ptl when issued in orders it must be covered in great detail so that every patrolman knows exactly what to do when to do it and what actions are to occur in all situations terrain models sketches pictures and photos are excellent tools to assist comds when issuing this segment of their orders plans must be easy to understand and realistic see chapter 5 and chapter 6 for detailed descriptions of these actions note ptl comds can modify the above drill to incorporate secur sweep if they desire remember smaller ptls are more vulnerable when patrolmen are separated from each other platoon size ptls may also find the occupation of the orv by force advantageous using the triangle drill for both orvs and ptl bases reduces confusion by cutting down on the number of drills platoon must know if the triangle is going to be used for the orv two secur teams will be required to mark and secure it the drill is exactly the same as the occupation of ptl base 47 action at the orv must be covered in great detail in ptl orders it must be thoroughly rehearsed both by day and by night until the action can be carried out flawlessly by the ptl section 2 contact general 49 contact during ptl must be avoided at all times whether it is with the enemy civilians or ot her friendly ptls drills must be rehearsed so that all patrolmen know what to do when under contact bgl392004fp001 119patrolling casualties must be expected planned for and simulated when conducting rehearsals rehearsals must be done in terrain that mirrors the ptl route and under the same conditions for both day and night movement with the same eqpt load contact drill rehearsals without rucksacks are of little use if the entire ptl is executed carrying rucksacks action on enemy contact 50 there are two types of enemy contact chance contact this is accidental contact with the enemy unintentional by both sides recce ptl should break contact immediately fighting ptl may be authorized to select targets of opportunity this will be made clear to the ptl comd in the orders he receives for ease of rehearsals and chance contact will be broken into the following 1 close contacts within grenade throwing range includes we see them first and visual at the same time 2 far contacts beyond grenade throwing range includes we see or hear them first and visual at the same time b ambush an ambush is surprise attack from concealed position upon an unsuspecting moving or temporarily halted enemy by force lying in wait counterambush drills are sential for ease of rehearsals and ambushes will be broken into the following 1 close ambush within grenade throwing range 2 far ambush beyond grenade throwing range bgl392004fp001 120conduct of patrols 51 chance contactcloseplatoon size ptl this drill is used when platoon size ptl becomes aware of the enemy with li ttle notice or when each force becomes aware of the other at the same time the contact is at such cl ose range that deployment into an ambush is not feasible the drill should be as follows the soldiers nearest or contacting the enemy returns fire and takes cover yelling contactfront left right or rear b the ptl immediately takes cover those who positively identify enemy return fire c if the enemy stands fast the ptl comd can 1 swiftly move the platoon into an aslt formation and aslt through using fire and movement or 2 break contact using rehearsed drills d regardless of break co ntact or aslt

offensive action that sectiondetachment size ptl is capable of i s quite limited the sectiondetachment has real offensive option and should whenever possible avoid contact it is vitally important th

chance contactfarplatoon size ptl this drill is designed to deal with situation in which patrolman without being seen or heard sees or hears an enemy ptl approaching this situation provides an opportunity for the establishment of hasty ambush it can be laid quickly and without confusion by employing the following drill the patrolman who has detected the enemy gives the haltfreeze enemy dist

at the very least the patrol will have the advantage of surprise and will be able to break contact as in the case of detachment or assume the offence as in the case of platoon after contact is broken the patrol must rv quickly on the patrol comds order to prepare for an enemy follow up 55 ambush likely form of contact is an ambush the ambush will vary from hasty to well planned deliberate action on the part of the enemy if executed properly it will take the patrol by surprise this initial disadvantage can immediately be turned into an advantage through the execution of wellrehearsed drills regardless of the size of the ptl counter ambush drills will not change what will change is the action taken by the ptl comd as to when and where to attack or break contact recce ptls will generally always break contact it will be the decision of the ptl comd as to what action the ptl will take the ptl comd must plan and be ready for all contacts that could be encountered when an ambush is

be done using existing trails roads or other define d features this is particularly evident when patrolling in urban ttings where roads are bordered by houses on both sides the drill is as follows upon contact from the front the ptl takes cover and those that can engage the enemy do so b the ptl continues to gage the enemy as the ptl comd gives the signal and direction of the peelback c immediately following this signal the patrolman who is second in the order of march ensures he is covering the point man with effective fire d on the rehearsed signal the point man turns inward into the middle of the ptl and moves as quickly as possible to the rear of the ptl here he adopts fire position on the same side as he occupied earlier or behind available cover in succession each patrolman executes the same drill this process is continued until the ptl has moved clear of effective enemy fire f at the first available opportunity the ptl rvs and assesses the situation figure 412 57 ptls of all sizes may encounter situations when the only effective solution is to charge th rough an unexpected enemy contact these situations must be discussed and rehearsed during ptl battle procedure bgl392004fp001 127patrolling note this drill can also be used if ambushed from the rear the difference being that the ptl will peel forward smaller ptls will find this highly effective counter ambush drill larger ptls can employ this drill but only in specific terrain areas with experienced wellrehearsed patrolmen smoke grenades high volumes of effective controlled fire and the use

missions on short notice by voice and other audible means 71 verbal orders are an effective tool when trying to enhance they should be delivered only as loudly as required there is need to shout except in an emergenc at night information can be passed quickly and quietly by using the element comds or by relaying it from patrolman to patrolman the ptl 2ic is an excellent asset when passing

identification different combinations can be used for recognition of key personnel care must be taken to cover these when near the enemy the luminous marks on the compass may be used for simple sigs over short distances the use of glowsticks must be controlled as they emit strong light for an extended length of time 76 light recognition sigs are highly effective measure during night movement the

the patrolman initiating gives three short and b the reply would be one shorttwo long note ptls should stick to one colour or type of flashlight filter the use of multicoloured signal combinations adds confusion and is difficult to coordinate with other ptls light discipline must be maintained when using this type f recognition signal all patrolmen must understand what course of action will be taken if the wrong signal is issued or received patrolmen assist in 77 the ptl 2ic usually moves at or near the rear of the ptl and prevents patrolmen from separating he is alert for sigs and orders and ensures that other patrolmen receive and comply with them when the ptl halts he contacts the ptl comd for instructions 78 other subordinate comds move with and maintain over their elements and teams they must be alert for sigs and orders and ensure their patrolman receive and comply with them bgl392004fp001 141patrolling 79 all patrolmen assist in by staying alert at all times and by passing on all hand sigs and orders accounting for patrolmen 80 an important aspect of is the accounting for personnel knowing all patrolmen are present all patrolmen must be accounted for after crossing danger areas after enemy contact and after halts 81 when moving in single file the last man sends up the count by tapping the man in front of him and saying one in low voice or whisper the second man taps the man in front of him and says two this continues until the count reaches the ptl co md the men behind him plus himself and the men he knows to be ahead should equal the total of the ptl in large ptls or when moving in formation other than single file subordin ate comds can check their own patrolmen and report to the 2ic or ptl comd as required b the ptl 2ic will automatically send up to count after crossing danger areas obstacles after enemy contacts and after halts c each man must ensure that the man he taps receives and passes on the count d on some occas ions the ptl 2ic will confirm the count from the front as the ptl passes and then send up the count is good from the rear as he falls into the order of march ie after halts five point contingency plan 82 these are short briefi ngs that are used every time someone leaves the ptl in this briefing the ptl comd issues the fo l what are you going to do bgl392004fp001 142conduct of patrols b who is going by

come under contact move up to us on the same bearing confirm what ive just said 84 the five point contingency plan must be used every time any part of the ptl separates from the main body for an extended length of time it ensures that subordinate comds have the proper direction in order to carry on with the mission thus aiding greatly in it should be noted that this is not given in orders but on the ground just prior to each taskingseparation five point contingency plans are not designed to be long drawn out briefings brevity is important bgl392004fp001 143patrolling section 4 security general 85 organization for movement provides certain amount of secur however additional steps must be taken day ptls use the following techniques 1 disperse the ptl consistent with visibility and terrain 2 deploy secur where possible assigning them areas of responsibility to the front flanks and rear 3 when moving along high ground be careful not to silhouette the ptl 4 avoid exposed areas and take advantage of available cover and concealment 5 maintain an even pace avoid rushing or runningsudden movements attract attention and 6 avoid known or suspected enemy locations and builtup areas b night ptls use the same techniques as for day ptl modifying them as required 1 keep men closer together than you would for day ptl 2 enforce noiselight discipline sounds carry farther at night and bgl392004fp001 144conduct of patrols 3 reduce speed of movement so that there is possibility of the ptl becoming separated c avoiding ambush proper secur and recce is vital to guard against ambush be alert and suspicious of all areas certain areas are more suitable for an ambush than othersroads and trails narrow gullies and builtup areas use caution when approaching these areas and ensure you employ secur conduct secur halts often and avoid routes used by other ptls d halts the ptl should be halted occasionally to check eqpt location to observe and listen for enemy activity 1 when the signal to haltfreeze is given every man haltsfreezes in place maintains absolute quiet looks toward their arc and listens all patrolmen must move off the trail onethree paces to allow the comds2ic to move freely if concealment is scarce the men go down on one knee or to the prone position observation is not as good from the prone position and the larger body area in contact with the ground makes silence more difficult to maintain 2 the ptl may be halted briefly to send message drink rest check direction or to conduct recce an area that provides cover and favours defence should be selected check must be made to ensure everyone moves out when the ptl continues at night each man is responsible for notifying the man behind him thus ensuring everyone moves together secur to the front this is provided by point secur which may consist of one ma n in small recce ptl or secur team in platoon ptl companysized ptl may use section bgl392004fp001 145patrolling 1 point secur must move well ahead of the ptlas far ahead as visibility and terrain permit in the jungle or on completely dark night this may be only few metres on the other hand good visibility and open terrain may allow the point to be 100 metres or more ahead of the ptl 2 point secur maintains direction by using their compass and by maintaining visual contact with the ptl looking back often 3 point secur moves ahead of the ptl following the correct bearing screening the area over which the ptl will pass 4 point secur tasks are physically demanding and require good fieldcraft and navigational skills use of radios and passwords 86 use radios sparingly the depression of the transmission button is sometimes sufficient to relay certain information when transmitting cup the hands over the handset speaking only as loud as required always have the radio volume adjusted so as not to compromise ptl secur with poor noise discipline the sig or sigs must change the radio frequency and destroy ceois if capture is imminent frequencies codes and passwords must never fall into enemy hands 87 there are three types of passwords used on ptls nato ptl number and running password these passwords aid in the secur of ptl by not allowing infiltration nato password this is used behind the feba and is of the normal nato type groups of bigrams with codeword to change from primary to alt ie challenge ttanswer ii b ptl number this is used forward of the feba and is an odd number usually between three and nine bgl392004fp001 146conduct of patrols the number is broken down into two parts one part for the challenge and one part for the reply with the total equalling the ptl number ie ptl number is nine therefore the challenge is five and the reply is fourequalling nine c running password this is used when crossing the fdl or after contact when patrolmen are moving into an rv and wish to be identified quickly it consists of two words repeated aggressively as the patrolman approaches friendly personnel ie pie face the words must be easy to understand and are given in sequence by each individual patrolman rather than in two parts by two patrolmen infiltration into enemy area 88 there may be times when the disposition of enemy forces prevents ptl from entering an ar ea together however pairs or small groups may be able to sneak through unnoticed if this is the case the ptl can split up as it leaves friendly lines or at predesignated point small groups infiltrate at varying tim each using different route after slipping into the enemy area the groups assemble at predetermined rv the rv must be free of enemy provide concealment and be easily recognis ed an alternate altn rv is selected in case the primary cannot be used if all patrolmen have not reached the rv within reasonable period the senior man takes charge and reacts as per the contingency issued in orders 89 the same procedure is followed when returning to friendly lines the ptl splits up moves by teams and reassembles near or within friendly lines 90 ptl may return by infiltra tion even though this method was not used to enter the enemy area this may be the case when there has been change in the tactical situa tion or after contact infiltration breaks up the tactical integrity of ptl and is used only when ot her methods of return are impractical bgl392004fp001 147patrolling section 5 debrief debrief and ptl reports 91 ptls must endeavour to record all occurrences throughout the entire duration of the mission ma p corrections enemy contacts ac sightings and details about the obj may be vital to the success of subsequent missions 92 ptl reports are vital step in the debrief process the entire ptl must understand the mission and the importance of obtaining timely and accurate information all patrolmen should be debriefed by their element comds and in turn the ptl comd one element may have vital information that others have missed ptl comds may choose to prepare the debrief form with the entire ptl present regardless of the method all patrolmen must be given the opportunity to participate in the debrief process ptl comds mu st enforce the positive effects that will result from the gathering of up to date information

most reliable means for obtaining this information mission and procedures missions 2 the mission of recce ptl as ks one or more questions for example about the enemy does the enemy occupy certain piece of terrain what is their strength how are they equipped what is their routine b about the terrain how deep are the streams are the banks too steep for armoured vehicles what is the condition of the bridge at certain point how suitable are th routes of approach 3 the questions the mission asks are answered by successful ptl types of recce 4 there are three types of recce bgl392004fp001 149patrolling point recce the comd may require information about specific location or small area usually known position or activity the ptl secures this information by reconnoitring the location or by maintaining surveillance over it b area recce the comd may require information about an extended area or may desire information on certain locations within an area the ptl secures this information by reconnoitring the area by maintaining surveillance over it or by conducting series of point reconnaissa nce tasks on series of locations within the area c route recce this type of ptl is conducted as

ptl fights only to accomplish its mission or to protect itself and only as last resort the ptl comd must detail during orders the situations in whi ch the ptl may engage the enemy actions at the obj 8 it must be noted that the fo llowing sequences are to be used as guides only fine details will be dictated by the tactical s ituation number and experience of available personnel and the time

inflict damage on the enemy b to provide security secur for unit c to establish andor maintain contact with friendly and enemy forces and d to deny vital ground to the enemy missions 2 fighting ptls perform variety of tasks some of the more common are listed below raid to destroy or capture personnel or equipment destroy installations or liberate personnel b secur to detect infiltration by the enemy destroy infiltrators and protect against surprise and ambush c establish andor maintain contact with friendly or enemy forces d ambush enemy ptls carrying parties foot columns and vehicle

personnel carriers or selfpropelled guns section 2 organization ptl composition 3 fighting ptls are usually of platoon size but may vary commensurate with the mission the exact composition and organization will be at the discretion of the ptl commander comd ptl comds should endeavour to maintain the integrity of their platoons as the command structure is alr eady in place fighting ptl will contain four basic elements ptl headquarters hqs hqs should consist of the ptl comd signaller ptl 2ic and any attachments that may accompany the p tl the ptl comd may wish to utilise navigator or navigation team if so they belong to hq if the ptl does not have the personnel to maintain navigation team throughout the entire mission patrolmen from the assault aslt element can be tasked to fill

than one task examples of the teams needed are 1 wire cutting teams 2 prisoner of war pwsearch teams 3 demolition teams and 4 aid and litter casualty teams d sp element the sp element is organised according to the mission and must have the necessary firepower to complete its assigned task during fighting ptl the platoon weapons detachment will belong to the sp element rather than platoon hq crew served weapons teams must have enough personnel to operate their weapons effectively 4 ptl comds should strive to maintain the fourelement concept when organising their ptlhq secur sp and aslt ptl comds must rely on past experience and input from the ptl 2ic and element comds when solving organizational problems one of the rifle sections w ill be given the secur element task while the other two cover off the asl t and sp elements 5 members of the secur element must possess good fieldcraft and navigation skills on occasion they will be required to mov independently of the ptl and must have the ability to make deci sive decisions which could effect the outcome of the mission one member of each twoman secur team will be designated as the team leader 6 the aslt element will usually be the largest element of the ptl and therefore requires the amalgamation of the second and third rifle sections by assigning each rifle s ection with an aslt group task and by detaching one fire team from each section to the sp element the ptl comd maintains section integrity while enhancing the sp elemen t the second and third section comds maintain command over their own sections less the detached fire teams bgl392004fp001 175patrolling 7 during movement to and from the obj the sp element will be commanded by the weapons detachment comd or by one of the three section comds assigned as the sp element comd the two rifle teams detached from the rifle sections give the sp element the additional firepower needed to effectively ppress the obj and to provide local secur for itself extra ammunition w ill be carried by the remainder of the ptl and redistributed at the orv 8 historically during the actio n at the obj phase of the ptl the ptl 2ic controls the sp element ptl comds may find it advantageous to have the ptl 2ic accompany them on the aslt leaving command of the sp element to the sp comd acting as depth the ptl 2ic combined with secur followup the aslt this option places the ptl 2ic in better position to assume control if the ptl comd becomes casualty 9 each ptl has unique set of requirements which will driv the employment of key personnel throughout the mission ptl comds have the final say on how their particular ptl will be organised equipment 10 fighting ptls carry the same basic type of equipment as reconnaissance recce ptl but in far greater numbers with additional emphasis being placed on the requi rements of the sp element depending on the mission and the disposition of the enemy at the obj fighting ptl should carry high proportion of machine guns and anti tank weapons the c6 c9 and eryx are capable of filling these roles careful consideration must be given towards the amount of ammunition carried so as not to overburden the ptl this is of particular importance when carrying large amounts of antitank ammunition communication 11 ptls must have the ability to communicate with themselve s higher hqs and with supporting units success of the mission may depend on the ability to call for indirect fire or medical evacuati on ptl comds must have lost communication procedures particularly during action at the obj bgl392004fp001

secure information confuse the enemy or destroy his installations it ends with planned withdraw at the completion of the assigned mission bgl392004fp001 180fighting patrol planning considerations 13 raid is normally deliberate in nature but can also be hasty it follows the same guidelines as other forms of attack except for the following differences there is always planned withdrawal from the obj the plan includes signal to withdraw well planned routes to release ptorv elements to cover the withdrawal and assist in breaking contact usually the secur elem ent sometimes the sp element and way to evacuate casualties pws and captured equipment from the obj b the raiding unit must be large enough to provide secur elements to isolate the obj from reinforcement or withdrawal the secur elements are the first to be placed and the last to withdraw c raids are normally conducted by platoon to battalion size units organised as per fighting ptl actions at the obj 14 the general sequence of events for both raids and ambushes are similar with the layout of pers onal and the action during the aslt being in most cases mission specific plans should be kept as simple as possible to avoid confusion it is also important to note that because of the violence of action that raid or ambush will produce friendly personnel must be kept well out of the kill zone the dang er area of weapons and the effects of their detonation must always be considered when siting personnel the general sequence for the conduct of raid using triangle orv is as follows the ptl halts near the orv closes up and the ptl 2ic moves forward the ptl comd issues the ptl 2ic five point pt contingency plan and then departs with the orv recce party to confirm and secure the orv the orv recce party consists of and bgl392004fp001

allowing enough time for it to rejoin the aslt element prior to the aslt j at the given time with contingency plan the elements depart for their positions normally the sp element will depart first the aslt element must be ready for immediate aslt if the sp element comes under contact k with all elements in place the signal for the sp element to open fire is given the sp element engages targets as detailed in orders until the signal to switch or cease fire is issued l under the ptl comd the aslt element commences its attack breaking into fire and movement when necessary the aslt element pushes

purpose of the vp is to maintain eyes on the obj while the remainder of the ptl manoeuvres into position ptl comds may opt to leave the vp in place until the sp element is in position this ensures the obj remains under observation at all times locating the vp in the same general area as the aslt element will reduce movement around the obj the vp is usually manned by secur bgl392004fp001 184fighting patrol 15 secur element throughout the action at the obj phase the secur element plays vital role it must move by teams independent of sp into assigned positions once there teams mus t remain undetected providing early warning while blocking all avenues of approach into the obj area other specific points are as the asltsp elements move into position the secur teams inform the ptl comd of all enemy activity on and around the obj b once the aslt has begun the secur teams prevent the enemy from entering or escaping from the obj area and c the secur teams cover the withdrawal of the asltsp elements to the rel porv withdrawing themselves upon order or upon prearranged signal 16 aslt element the aslt element must be ready for an immediate attack if the sp element is compromised it is lead by the ptl comd but is controlled throughout the mission by the aslt comd individual team comds control their respective teams making it easier for the ptl comd to supervise the entire aslt

from other ptls in that once they have occupied their position they are bgl392004fp001 186fighting patrol not free to manoeuvre in the performance of their task unless ordered typical tasks for standing ptls are to observe and listen on likely enemy approaches b to cover dead ground both in front of and between defended localities c to cover minefields and obstacles which cannot be covered by the main position and d in mobile defence prevent infiltration into unoccupied hides or battle positions 19 like other ptls standing ptls try to move into position undetected until withdrawal or compromise standing ptls are small usually more than section size they must have adequate communications and be able to call for supporting fire 20 although standing ptls are deliberate in nature ptl comds should issue fragmentary frag orders and rely more on rehearsals to prepare for this type of mission long drawn out ptl orders should be avoided organization 21 the rifle section is the foundation of standing ptl maintaining fire team and aslt group integrity enhances control by reducing last minute reorganization of personnel and equipment without this added burden secti on comds

clearance ptls general 24 clearance ptls are also used in conjunction with defensive operation they are unique from standing ptls in that they are covered by direct fire sp and remain under almost continuous observation throughout the execution of their task typical tasks for clearance ptls are bgl392004fp001 190fighting patrol to check the condition of obstacles and b to look for signs of

required to halt for an extended period in an area not protected by friendly forces ptl base must be occupied while in the ptl base all movement is kept to minimu m and noise and light discipline is strictly enforced 2 after orders the ptl commander comd issues ptl base annex in this annex the ptl comd explains in detail the occupation and operation of the ptl base the ptl comds plan must include primary and alternate ptl base locationbased on map reconnaissance recce the primar location will be confirmed by actual ground recce before its occupied by the ptl typical situations that require the establishment of ptl base are when there is requirement to cease all movement during daylight hours to avoid detection b need to rest and reorganize after extended movement c requirement for reorganization after ptl has infiltrated the enemy in small groups used in conjunction with rvlinkup and d requirement to provide base of operations from which further ptls can be launched 3 the plan for ptl base must include both passive and active security secur measures passive secur considerations 1 avoid builtup areas bgl392004fp001 193patrolling 2 avoid open woods and clearings 3 avoid known or suspected enemy locations 4 avoid all roads and trails 5 avoid ridgelines and topographic crests 6 select an area away from human habitation 7 select terrain considered as having little tactical value 8 select steep terrain ravines or other such areas that would impede foot movement 9 select areas offering dense vegetation preferably bushes and trees that spread out close to the ground 10 select terrain suitable for radio communications and 11 select an area close enough to water for resupply b active secur considerations 1 establishment of an observation post oplistening post lp system covering all likely avenues of approach into the area 2 establishment of radio communication net with the oplps to provide early warning of enemy approach 3 selection of an alternate ptl base if the original ptl base is compromised or found unsuitable bgl392004fp001 194patrol base 4 plan for withdraw in the event of compromise 5 establishment of an alert plan with certain per cent of

place with minimal movement section 2 establishment occupation of ptl base 4 ptl base is normally planned off map but could be established with an onthespot decision it is occupied for the minimum time necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it was established it will normally be occupied for more than 24 hours and will never be used twice 5 the size of the area physically occupied by ptl base will be governed by the terrain and the size of the ptl ptl bases should spread out during daylight hours and closein during periods of poor light or darkness natural cover must be used when possible prior to first light ptl bases must expand back to daylight configuration 6 detachment detsection sect size occupation at detsect level will be by force this procedure is similar to ccupying

occupied for more then 24 hours at each location during this ptls are extremely vulnerable as the enemy threat can come from any direction to remain undetected strict maintenance of noise light and movement discipline must be enforced some basic points are as follows personal weapons must remain within arms reach b all movement done outside the base is done in pairs if possible c besides ops only one point of entry and exit is used this point is camouflaged and secured when in use d movement both inside and outside the ptl base is minimised civilians who discover the location of the ptl base are detained until the base is moved or until they can be evacuated to higher hq in accordance with iaw the situation precautions are taken to ensure they learn as little as possible about the ptl its operations and future plans if necessary they are secured blindfolded and their ears covered f one hour hr standto is observed morning and evening 30 min before and 30 min after first light and 30 min before and 30 min after last light this ensures that all patrolme n are accustomed to the changing light conditions are dressed properly equipped and ready to move g elaborate firing positions are not constructed only in unique situations will the digging of shell scrapes be reqr h use natural cover where possible bgl392004fp001 204patrol base i early warning devices such as trip flares may be placed on avenues of approach and in areas which cannot be covered by fire the value of these devices must be weighed against the fact that their discovery automatically compromises the ptl base j ptl base orders must be issued this includes plans for defence and evacuation the entire ptl must be familiar with these plans and the signals for their implementation ptl base orders 10 the majority of confirmato ry ptl base orders will have already been issued during the ptl ba annex rehearsals are critical part of this process as they reduce the time it takes to complete d rills especially at night ptl base confirmatory orders are not designed to be lengthy and with practice most drills will become standard op erating procedures sops prior to issuin g orders the ptl comd must confirm the ptls present location 11 alternate ptl base this location is confirmed by map recce only its location may change from the ptl base annex depending on wher exactly the current ptl base is occupied the ptl comd must give its location by gridmust use map b bearing to that location or rv c distance and d terrain feature note ptl comds may detail an rv which will be occupied first rather than moving directly to the alternate ptl base this allows the ptl to gather and reorganize so that the alternate ptl base can be sectured and occupi ed using sop drills this also ensures the new location is free of enemy and is suitable for occupation occupying an rv first will also draw the enemy away from the new ptl base if the withdrawing ptl is followed bgl392004fp001 205patrolling 12 alert plan the alert plan deals with the passage of information standto procedures and the open fire policy of great est concern is how the ops are going to alert the ptl base and how information will be passed within the base itself points to remem ber are radios are an excellent means but must be carefully controlled b field phones with wire can be used however the added bulk and weight and the time required to lay and pick up the line are disadvantages wire is easily detected c tug or pull lines may also be used for signalling they are quiet and reduce radio and phone traffic however are difficult to lay retrieve and are easily detected d runners will be used within the ptl base and can be utilised as an alternate means if radio communication goes down between the ops and the base itself note the alert plan must also incorp orate what actions are to be taken if the ops are unable to communicate with the ptl base due to the close proximity of the enemy this also applies to night routine wher lps are located within the ptl base itself for what ever means of communication chosen there must always be an alternate radios must not be relied upon as the sole means of communication 13 evacuation plan the evacuation plan provides all details regarding the defence and if required the evacuation of the ptl base both under and out of contact it must be thoroughly rehearsed and take into consideration that the ops may initiate the evacuat ion with chance contact during ev acuation all signs of occupation should be concealed in particular any telltale marks regarding the siz of the ptl and the duration of occupation areas in which orders took bgl392004fp001 206patrol base place must be closely scrutinised and all natural vegetation returned to its normal position extreme cau tion should be exercised when leaving the ptl base as you are vulnerable to ambush the ptl 2ic is responsible to ensure the area is clean evacuating the base out of contact prior to any evacuation the entire p tl base is placed on 100 standto the ops will now be told to return bringing with them all th eir gear once everyone returns to the base and has occupied their original positions two drills may occur 1 everyone remains in their current position in the triangle formation and upon order the ptl moves off past the ptl 2ic secur leading in the direction of movement 2 personnel remain stationary until their turn to move comes up the ptl 2ic counts everyone out or 3 one element at time pivots from either the four or eight oclock position closes up and forms single file facing outward 4 hq remains in the centre in allround defence 5 the element on the bottom of the triangle usually secur forms single file using hq as guide and closes up 6 the 2ic positions himself near secur and on the ptl comds signal dispatches secur and counts the ptl as it passes figure 76 b evacuating the base after compromiseunder contact enemy contact will be initiated from either the op locations or if the enemy pass by the ops then the ptl base itself in all cases the ptl bgl392004fp001 207patrolling comd must be immediately notified and the remainder of the ptl placed on 100 standto from the information the ptl comd receives he will decide whether to remain in location or move if the ops initiate the contact 1 the op sends contact report back to the base the other ops automatically acknowledge from this the ptl comd decides whether to remain in location or move 2 if moving the other ops are told to pack up and return immediately to the ptl base the remainder of the ptl should now be packed and waiting in fire positions 3 if the enemy gets too close to the op the op comd will engage with the claymores defensive weapons systems small arms and smoke without further delay they break contact using fire and movement if necessary and return to the ptl base 4 the entire ptl should now be in the ptl base packed and at 100 standto 5 the ptl will now leave the ptl base using one of the methods as above 4a c if the ptl base itself comes under contact the following drill takes place all personnel on the side of the contact immediately engage the enemy the ptl comd will then shift the sp element to the side under contact this will automatically form firebase d if the ptl comd wants to break contact he will move the remainder of the ptl using fire and movement to position just off to the flank where they can cover the firebase figure 77 bgl392004fp001 208patrol base 1 with effective fire coming from the covering force the firebase will now withdraw using fire and movement 2 this process will continue until enemy contact is broken the ptl rvs and consolidates under the ptl comds direction figure 78 or 3 if the ptl comd wishes to put in an aslt after forming the firebase he manoeuvres the remainder of the ptl off to the flank into an aslt position from here hasty attack is carried out 4 after the aslt the ptl rvs and consolidates figure 79 note there will be occasions when the ops will be unable to return to the ptl base once contact has been initiated the alert and evacuation plans mu st include these type of scenarios before engaging the enemy ptl comds must consider what effect their weapons fire will have on the ops the simplest contingency may be to have the ops remain under cover and make their way to the rvaltn ptl base as soon as possible the entire ptl must be aware of the location and status of any ops or personnel that are outside the ptl base bgl392004fp001 209patrolling the direction of movement can be on any bearing there is

around the base as well as noise and light discipline an importa nt aspect of secur is oplps oplps are established immediately after occupation and should be far enough from the perimeter to provide sufficient early warning in additio n to being issued ptl base annex and confirmatory orders in the ptl base ops must know the following fol information bgl392004fp001 213patrolling arcs and

the same direction for set time this ensures 360 degree coverage but does not guarantee the manning of the c6 or c9s bgl392004fp001 214patrol base b observe from the points only manning the c6s and c9s this method disrupts the layout and creates excess movement as personnel change shifts however it ensures that key weapons are manned 17 when sufficient personnel are available ops day are manned by at least two individuals so that they can remain alert and maintain an extended shift at leas t two preferably three individuals always man lps night so they too can alternate and remain alert without backandforth movement 18 weapons weapons and eqpt are cleaned and maintained as needed but only on order sp we apons such as c6s are cleaned first during their cleaning the remainder of the ptl remains at 100 standto next comes the c9s which are cleaned one at time concurrently within each element during their cleaning the remainder of the ptl also remains at 100 standto finally c78s are cleaned concurrently by elementf ire team while all other weapons remain at 100 standto 19 timings must be issued for the cleaning of each type of weapon these timings come from rehearsals and with practice will allow for the entire platoon to have all their weapons cleaned wit hin 30 minutes eg c6 10 mins c 9s five mins each grouptotal 10 minutes c7s five mins each grouptotal 10 minutes prior to the dispatch of ops their weapons should be cleaned cleaning weapon s at night should be avoided on the occasions when weapons require detailed cleaning timingssecur must be adjusted 20 water water ptls collect water for the entire ptl as required the same water source is never used for an extended period usually more than twice ptls should make every effort to gather water prior to occupying the ptl base smaller ptls that leave the pt l base should pick up water prior to their return carrying method must be readily available to carry all the ptls canteens ie laundry bags ops must receive water prior to thei r placement this usually means redistribution within the ptl 21 hygiene this priority of work must also be strictly controlled with timings and should be rehearsed thoroughly changing socks should be done one boot at time wet gear should only be laid out to dry on order other key points are bgl392004fp001 215patrolling in daylight cat holes outside the perimeter are used

portion of the meal being eaten at the time is to be removed from the pack once that portion is finished it is placed back in the p ack prior to the next piece coming out 23 rest rest and sleep are permitted only after all other priorities of work have been accomplished rest periods are staggered so that proper secur is maintained consistent with work and secur requirements each patrolman is

often the occasion will arise when smaller ptls will be sen t out for numerous reasons for example to pickup resupply or gather water the following is guideline for leaving and returning to the pt l base leaving ptls will normally depart from the six oclock position they will take with them all their gear which can be hidden along their route for later retrieval any gear left in the ptl base will have to be carried if the ptl base has to move quickly b returning the need for maintaining alertness when returning to ptl base must be stressed returning through rv first prior to approaching the

the ground should be relatively flat however some degree of slope is acceptable bgl392004fp001 222airmobile operations slope criteria changes from helicopter to helicopter and must be coordinated prior to the mission size the landing point should have minimum diameter of 102 feet 31 metres to allow for the rotor clearance of the helicopter while manoeuvring for landing and takeoff this area must be obstruction free f winter operations ops loose blowing snow can become hazard and shou ld be packed down if possible packing also helps reveal obstacles figure 83 8 landing points can be

safe and efficient operation of the twelve man aslt boat it must be prepared properly the following procedure must be followed undo the carrying case and remove the boat b unfold the boat and lay it flat with the floor down c remove the protective valve cap d ensure that the valve stem is in the closed position by turning it counter clockwise one quarter turn remove two footbellows and four hoses from storage pouches f insert two hose ends secu rely into the outlet valves on both footbellows bgl392004fp001 245patrolling g insert two hoses per footbellows into the chambers beside each other and commence pumping with slow even strokes until the increased back pressure in the footbellows makes pumping difficult one person operates each pump h follow the inflation sequence i after inflating all chambers remove the low pressure hose from the footbellows using both footbellows topup all chambers until the overpressure valve releases air and the chamber is fully inflated j remove the paddles from stowage bag 15 deflation procedures deflation procedures are the reverse of the inflation procedure with the addition of certain steps required to clean the boat prior to storage remove all personal eqpt and any loose objects from the boat b remove the boat from the water and rinse with fresh water while carefully removing sand and other debris that may have become lodged between the floor and buoyancy tubes deflating the floor section should release most of this matter c to deflate the floor remove the protective valve cap and turn the red valve stem clockwise while pushing lightly downward this will lock the valve in the open position allowing air to escape d allow the boat to dry by standing upright against wall or other solid object deflate the main buoyancy chambers and knee rails as detailed in subparagraph c the foot bellows may be used to assist deflation by inserting one end of the inflation hose into the deflate side of the foot bellows and the other end into the valve on the bgl392004fp001 246amphibious patrolling chamber to be deflated by stepping on the foot bellows and removing ones foot the spring action of the bellows will pull air out of the deflating chamber f once the boat has been deflated fold and repack 16 inspection procedure prior to all amphibious movement boats should be inspected and prepared properly the procedure is as follows look for obvious punctures tears and loose seams b check that all valves ar present that they move freely and are corrosion and grime free c check that lubricants have not just collected salt and grime and now block the valves d inspect all lines check for abraded ar eas on the boats skin f inspect for brokensepar ated carrying handles and d rings and g for final check the boat should be inflated and stand for period of time to check for slow leaks 17 storage and maintenance all boats must be stored properly if long term serviceability is expected some basic points are the boat should be stored in cool dry place out of direct sunlight b avoid excessive handling which might cause chafing c do not store near furnace steam pipes or boiler etc bgl392004fp001 247patrolling d do not store near oil or oil contaminated areas keep free from oil grease and solvents do not use packing hooks or fork lifts to move or stack boats f avoid protruding nails or any other sharp objects g inflation and deflation valves must be kept lubricated with either brea k free wd 40 or vaseline to prevent rusting and corrosion h do not leave fully inflated boats for long periods of time in the sun for seams may burst i wash the boat with fresh water after use in salt or muddy water j after the boat is dry it should be coated with talcum or baby powder and then repacked section 3 boat preparation small boat rigging 18 general proper rigging of the aslt boat or twofour man recce boat is essential improper ri gging will only lead to delays and could lead to friendly casualties 19 twofour man recce boat after the craft has been inspected lashing line is attached diagonally from the front carrying handle to either the left or right re ar carrying handle onequarter inch nylon rope should be used and care must be taken not to pull this line too tight or the carrying handles will snap one capsizing line s hould be attached to either the left or right front carrying handle an anchor line should also be attached to the front carrying handle both the capsizing line and anchor line should be stowed in the same manner as the twelve man aslt boat bgl392004fp001 248amphibious patrolling 20 twelve man aslt boat after the craft has been inspected an eqpt security line from bow to stern must be attached nine millimetre nylon rope should be used and it should be loose enough to allow for easy hook up of eqpt all eqpt is lashed and secured to this line this will ensure that eqpt is lost if the boat capsizes three capsizing lines one on the stern bow and in the centre all on the same side are attached to the carrying ndles these lines are coiled then tucked directly inside the boat between the side and the floor safe ty lines are secured to both sides from bow to stern and fed loosely through the carrying handles finally the anchor line is checked then coiled and tucked in the same manner as the capsizing lines at t his time the aslt boat is prep ared and ready for use figure 93 rigging lines of twelve man aslt boat 21 personal and mission essential eqpt all eqpt must be lashed to the boats to aid in its rec overy if the boat capsizes sinks or is swamped to properly secure personal weapons and eqpt each bgl392004fp001 249patrolling individual will require minimum of two snaplinks the following procedures apply personal weapons weapons must be secured so that if enemy contact is established they can be employed quickly and effectively b if the boat capsizes weapons will not be lost quick and very effective method of securing the c7c8c9 is to tie three foot piece of cord to the lower sling swivel with bowline and then to the patrolmans fighting order or to the boat itself c rucksacks all personal eqpt inside rucksacks should be placed inside wa terproof bags prior to being placed in the rucksack all rucksacks will be attached to the eqpt secur ity line with sash cord and snaplink tied off on each end with bowline d mission essential eqpt any mission essential piece of eqpt or item of ammunition that can be effected by water must be placed inside waterproof bags all radios and radio handsets will be waterproofed by being wrapped and taped in waterproof bags so that they remain operational fighting order and life preservers all personnel will wear life preserver at all times while in the asltrecce boat there are exceptions to this rule fighting order can be worn either underneath or on top of the life preserver with the waist buckle undone the situation will determine how eqpt is stored during boat movement section 4 crew disposition crew organization and duties 22 general each boat crew must be organised in standardized manner all personnel must understand their duties and bgl392004fp001 250amphibious patrolling be familiar with the duties of key individuals within the boat ultimately the ptl configuration the situation and the quantity and type of boat will determine how the boat crew is organised tactica l cross loading of key personnel must always be considered especial ly when two or more boats are being employed concurre ntly specific duties are as follows coxswain the coxswain is responsible for all boat movement he is to ensure that the boat is properly prepared and that all eqpt is securely stored he is also responsible for all pers onnel in his craft if motor is used he will be responsible for its operation b ptl comd the ptl comd is ov erall responsible for the ptl during movement and upon arrival at the disembarkation point he is also responsible for communications comms an d that contact

boat movement there is always the chance of boat capsizing unexpectedly there may be times when boat will be capsized intentionally ie when the boat is full of water due to rough seas or heavy rainfall if the boat capsizes it is important to hav well rehearsed thorough plan here is one method that can be used 27 large or small boats once capsized all patrolmen will move to one side of the boat usually the up current si two or three patrolmen will get up on top of the boat from the rear they will then grab the capsize lines and move to the opposite side of the boat from where the lines are attached the three patrolmen will then lean b ack placing their feet on the edge of th boat and using their weight flip the boat over note patrolmen may assist by staying in the water and using their paddles to push on one side of the boat one patrolman may be designated to hang onto the safety line on the opposite side of the boat in order to be thrown into the boat when it is righted embarking and disembarking 28 embarking and disembarking is another drill that must be well thought out and rehearsed embarking while at sea will normal ly depend on the method that is being used to insert the ptl and must be coord and rehearsed with the supporting unit if embarking is to be done on land one suggested method is the boat is carried to the waters edge if required local security is provided by the forward securairobserver all personal eqpt is now loaded in the boat and secured the ptl takes up positions along the outside of the boat the last two patrolman holding onto the back capsize lines to maintain control bgl392004fp001 254amphibious patrolling b on the coxswains order the crew start to push the boat out into the water just until the bow is in the water the forward securairobserver patrolman moves through the centre of the boat to the bow and secures his weapon forward movement of the boat will now continue once the ptl reach knee water height they peel off outwards to the back of the boat once the boat is fully in the water the ptl gets in from the rear with the front personnel loading first once all paddlers are in the navigator ptl comd and finally the coxswain board the boat c on the coxswains order the last two crew who are holding the capsize lines push off and get in the crew must have their life jackets on before they board the boat also the paddles must be pre loaded once in the boat crew members secure their weapons if not alr eady accomplished grab paddle and listen for the coxswains orders d if embarkation is from pier or bank personnel positioned to the outside edge of the boat must load first disembarkation must be done quickly and smoothly as the ptl will normally be in enemy territory upon landing the forward securairobserver and the first two paddlers dismount with their weapons local secur is provided by the applicable patrolman while the remaining two patrolmen secure the bow of the boat on order the ptl leaves the boat f if the landing point is flat for good distance local secur can deploy in the imme diate area as the boat is taken to cover local secur should move with it once under cover the boat will be unloaded all paddles and life jackets will be placed inside boat prior to the boat being camouflaged bgl392004fp001 255patrolling navigation 29 river characteristics like any other type of movement navigation on the water is vitally important if possible experienced personnel should be employed as navigators and boat comds deta iled route planning and thorough knowledge of the area are essential river navigation and route planning are easier if the ptl knows the characteristics of river figure 97 river terminology 30 crossing wide river move on bearing keeping in mind the river current and the wind di rection both of these factors will either push you towards or away from your obj you must consider these factors in your selection of disembarkation point if the boat is going

general general 1 patrolling within an urban environment is conducted under the auspices of reconnaissance recce fighting and st anding patrols ptls the basic principles of each type of ptl remain the same however due to the nature of urban operations there are special considerations that must be taken into account 2 patrolling in an urban environment is influenced by the following factors limited observation limited observation reduces surveillance and target acquisition observation is further restricted by dust and smoke which results from the employment of various weapons the effectiveness of surveillance and observation devices may be greatly reduced b reduced fields of fire this makes the use of shortrange weapons esp ecially automatic small arms and explosives predominant mutual support sp is difficult to achieve and requires all movement to be covered by direct fire c cover and protection available concealment and fire positions are virtually unlimited however this tends to favour the defender debris and obstacles will limit movement and influence ptl formations d restricted space this greatly negates the effectiveness of sp and indirect fire weapons as well as that of armoured vehicles restricted space due to street layout and rubble canalizes movement and increases vulnerability especially from above bgl392004fp001 259patrolling navigation the use of existing street mapsplans tourist maps underground mapsplans and local knowledge will greatly enhance movement through an urban area introduction and characteristics 3 urban areas are extremely comp lex the layout of buildings street systems underground rail nd sewer systems all combine to hinder military functions by its very nature combat in urban areas favours the defender gaining local knowledge and accurate topographical information is vital the effects an urban environment has on operations and inturn patrolling are command control and communications c at unit battalion bn and company level c will be extremely difficult to maintain forces will be split into small units with limited physical contact between them command and control difficulties will be amplified due to the limiting effect an urban environment will have on communications systems it is inevitable that fighting will devolve into small independent actions mission command at all levels will be the key factor in success control measures will be essential to maintain coordination and alternative communication methods must be incorporated 3 3 b tactics tactics within the urban environment will be affected by number of factors civilians fire and destruction further to these factors three levels of built up area known as the three dimensions are prevalent ground underground and above ground further explanation is as follows 1 three dimensions urban operations should fully exploit all three levels of the urban environment ground includes structures bridges and street systems these can offer concealment however movement may become restricted bgl392004fp001 260urban patrolling underground includes cellars subway and sewer systems these will enhance mobility and protection above ground includes roof tops and apartment complexes these offer good fire and observation platforms as well as alternative movement methods 2 factors civilian population civilians cannot be ignored and can be positive influence on operations there may be need to continue certain aspects of civilian infrastructure medical fire and water services local knowledge can greatly assist the commander comd 3 fire fire precautions and fire fighting plans must be consid ered even if the enemy is not employing fireproducing weapons 4 destruction the rubble of destroyedpartially destroyed buildings will restrictcanalize move ment and provides cover and concealment for the defender c night operations generally speaking both attacker and defender will utilise darkness to rest conduct resupply cons olidate and evacuate conventional fullscale night offensive operations will be far too chaotic to be effectively controlled it can be expected that losses suffered as result of large troop movements will be great darkness provides excellent cover for ptls observation posts ops and snipers d nuclear biological chemical defence nbcd persistent chemical agent strikes for the use of neutralizing defended positions would render these positions impractical for future detailed clearance rubble and underground areas would remain contaminated for longer periods this is also true of nonpersistent agents that pool remaining toxic for bgl392004fp001 261patrolling greater lengths of time operations in nuclear chemical and biological nbc environment must be well planned out to include relief in place the debilitating effect of conducting urban operations in mopp 3 can greatly degrade the level of patrolling and logistics the combat service support css chain will be under immense pressure ammunition especially grenades and demolitions and defensive stores will be consumed at an increased rate and re supply will be hindered by the conditions heavy casualties must be expected and evacuation will be extremely difficult section 2 organization and procedures general 4 knowledge of underground facilities is of great importance to both the attacker and defender in rger cities subterranean features include sunken garages underground passages subway lines utility tunnels sewers and storm drains to exploit these passageways and facilities detailed maps plans and local knowledge are required 5 subterranean passages provid covered and concealed routes into and through builtup areas they can be utilised to infiltrate small ptls behind enemy lines for the defender they offer ready made lines of communication and covered routes for reinforcements or counter attacks in order to be ffective thorough recce must be conducted ptl techniques and procedures 6 composition during urban operations recce ptls should be kept at section size ptl size shou ld only be increased for extremely large subterranean features the basic organization and equipment eqpt should remain th same as any other recce ptl the size of the recce and security secur elements ma need to be altered slightly to bgl392004fp001 262urban patrolling facilitate specific tasks additional items of eqpt may need to be carried the exact order of march and eqpt distribution must be left to the discretion of the ptl comd 7 all patrolmen entering the sewer system should carry sketch if available to include magnetic north bearings distances and manhole locations 8 should the enemy be suspected of employing chemical weapons appropriate precautions must be taken the ptl must protect itself by donning nbcd clothing and by carrying sufficient chemical detection and immediate decontamination eqpt as general rule respirators will always be carried 9 in addition to chemical agents noxious gases from decomposing sewage especially methane gas can pose threat and are not detected by nbcd detection systems or completely filte red by the respirator the ptl comd must be constantly alert to any effect these hazards may have on the ptl all personnel must remain aware of the shortest route to the surface for fresh air 10 flashlights are valuable tool and can be either handheld or mounted to the weapon light discipline must be maintained gloves are necessity as they protect the hands and assist in gripping wet objects chalk or spray paint should be carried and used to mark the route or specific points of concern safety rope of sufficient length will assist in negotiating difficult areas or aid in retrieving person nel who have fallen off the main route chicken wire can be placed over boot soles to assist in traction entry and movement 11 during initial preparation ptl battle procedure should not be deviated from however revision to movement and enemy contact drills will require special attention all ptl drills unique to urban operations must be thoroughly rehearsed 12 once the ptl has been organised and properly briefed it moves to the entrance of the tunnel which is usually manhole the following procedure will serve as basis from which other drills ca n be developed bgl392004fp001 263patrolling under cover from the remainder of the ptl one team opens the manhole cover wait 10 minutes to allow for the gases to dissipate before entering b on the ptl comds order designated patrolman enters the system safety line must be secured to this individual in case he succumbs to noxious gases he will remain in location for five minutes to ensure the air is breathable and that other hazards are present c under cover the remainder of the ptl enters the system leaving two personnel on top these two individuals will maintain communication with higher and act as secur d the lead team moves approximately 10 metres ahead of the remainder of the ptl the ptl should maintain three metres between patrolman and eight metres between teams if fast moving water is encountered or the sewer contains slippery sections or obstacles the intervals should be increased to prevent chain effect should patrolman fall or slip the ptl comd must note th axis of advance and pace at each turn rear secur marks the route with chalk or paint this will assist in navigation and allows reinforcements to locate the ptl quickly f when manhole to the surface is encountered the ptl may wish to attempt an opening this will assist in determining the ptls exact location this procedure must be coordinated in the planning process as an unexpected opening of manhole may lead to friendly casualties g communication line can be laid in order to establish series of tapin points concealment techniques must be employed to deny the enemy use of the line bgl392004fp001 264urban patrolling h upon return the ptl comd conducts ptl debrief and submits ptl report 13 subterranean navigation must be rehearsed and will require constant pacing by the ptl the use of the same route for the return leg of the mission may be unavoidable manhole covers are extremely heavy and may require special tools in order to dislodge them it is unlikely that without lifting device the cover will be readil moved lifting from the inside may be extremely difficult lifting procedures must be rehearsed and will have an effect on the contingency plans ptl comd establishes in relation to navigation casualty evacuati on enemy contact drills and resupply factors affecting subterranean patrolling 14 weapons systems the confined space of tunnels and sewers amplifies the sounds of weapons fire to dangerous level the overpressure from the detonation of grenades and mines can have detrimental effect on friendly personnel ruptured eardrums hearing and vision loss both temporary and longterm as well as contusions and lacerations from flying debris ca n all result from an explosion also toxic gases may be ignited by the blast of various weapons small arms should be the primary weapons system if demolitions are to be employed friendly personnel should be outside the tunnel system or out of the danger area head protection is must while ear protection is highly recommended 15 psychological factors combat operations within subterranean passages may reduce confidence cause fear and inc rease feelings of isolation isolation is further amplified by the tight confines of the tunnel system patrolmen should be made aware of the stressful environment created by darkness and restricted manoeuvre space during urban op erations ptl comds must endeavour to replace any patrolmen that have deep seeded phobia of confined spaces the entire ptl may be compromised if one individual becomes incapacitated bgl392004fp001 265patrolling movement and entry techniques 16 when moving from rural to urban areas patrolling remains basically unchanged detailed procedures on movement will be covered in detail in other publications bgl392004fp001 266patrolling chapter 11 dismounted observation posts section 1 general general 1 during any operation information must be gathered on continuous basis to meet this demand observation posts ops must be established ops can be either mounted mechanized or dismounted the focus of this chapter will be on dismounted ops dismounted ops offer the following advantages 1 greater flexibility for positioning 2 less chance of detection 3 easier to conceal and 4 increases the probability of an undetected withdrawal b disadvantages 1 resource personnel heavy and 2 amount of equipment eqpt weight definitions 2 an op is fixed location from which an area is observed ops are usually manned by patrols ptls of section size or less t he ptl should be organised in the same manner as reconnaissance recce ptl recce and security secur elements section integrity should be maintained when possible two or more patrolmen will be on each observation shift so that observation is continuous during bgl392004fp001 267patrolling periods of darkness poor visibility or increased enemy activity the number of personnel on each shift must be increased once observation has commenced it must remain continuous regardless of weather or light conditions 3 hide is selected area behind an op in which rest feeding and care of eqpt occurs 4 contact point is an area behind the op hide where contact with friendly personnel is established movement to the op hide will be initiated from the contact point it is also the area where resupp ly is conducted types and tasks of ops 5 depending on the tactical situation an op may be either hasty or deliberate 6 hasty op established in haste for less than 30 minutes b immediate notice to move c may have limited area of observation d speedy withdrawal and possibility of moving to deliberate op 7 deliberate op established for more than 30 minutes b used in most screening operations c lower risk of detectioneasy concealment d increases the chance of an undetected withdrawal and bgl392004fp001 268dismounted observation posts greater variety of positions 8 the two primary op tasks are observation arc normally assigned in open country where it may be po ssible to observe enemy activity from any direction b observation target normally assigned in close country or where the enemy movement is reduced by an obstacle such as bridge road building or dense wood etc op requirements 9 in order for an op to be effective it should command the best possible view of the assigned arcs b have at least one good alternate position that covers the same arcs of responsibility c provide concealment from enemy ground and air observation d provide good double banked communications have good fields of fire and be simple to defend f provide protection from

the 2ic and his secur return to the hide the ptl comd and the obse rver remain in the op op routine continues as per rehearsals conduct and routine 31 the routine commences when observation on the target area or specific point is initiated this occurs as early as the initial recce the static nature of ops make them vulnerable to even small dismounted force thus strict adherence to disciplined op routine will reduce the possibility of detection and compromise 32 when conducting op routine the following must be kept in mind cautious movement at all times b the approaches must be concealed and the track plan maintained c the op must be camouflaged camouflage must be changed as required d the shifts must overlap comply with the day and night duty roster two personnel on by day minimum

surrounding terrain remain unchanged camouflage must blend with the natural environment ther are many factors to consider in op construction bgl392004fp001 278dismounted observation posts concealed approach all the work of constructing the op will be completely useless if the enemy sees the ptl entering the area keep the following in mind 1 utilise concealed appr oaches into the area 2 personnel must be able to enter and exist the op undetected 3 movement around the position must be kept to minimum and track discipline must be maintained 4 in builtup areas safe relatively isolated approaches are required the ptl must secure its eqpt while conducting house to house search for suitable location b trench when building the op first construct shallow trenchshellscape excavated material must be carried away in sandbags or ponchos and hidden soil may be disposed of in ploughed fields under tree trunks spread around bushes or carried off some distance from the site and camouflaged digging is not always required c overhead cover the roof may be constructed from many types of material large branches sandbags or ponchos sufficient layer of camouflage must cover the roof d openings the opening must be constructed in such manner as to cover the assigned arcs the opening must be camouflaged so that it blends in with the surrounding area this in cludes the entranceexits screens any light reflecting into the opening from the rear will illuminate the inside of the op and could give away the position cover the entranceexit and block all openings bgl392004fp001 279patrolling f comfort the space inside the op should remain as comfortable as possible effectiveness is reduced if the ptl is incapable of resting without unnecessary discomfort g material ops may be constructed from stone bricks wood vegetation turf or snow and ice construction material must blend with the surrounding terrain and made to look as if the ground was never disturbed more often than not ops are positioned close to the enemy extensive construction may be difficult to achieve overhead protectionwaterproof entrance exitcamouflaged opening raised with stick the exact dimensions are at the

introduction 1 when conducted properly patrol ptl training is extremely interesting as well as challenging it should be taught progressive ly so as not to overload the trainee with too much information training must be conducted in all types of weather by day and by night under normal as well as difficult conditions 2 training programme should commence with series of small basic ptls which grow in size and complexity as the missions progress each ptl will offer an opportunity to practise not only the art of patrolling but also the personal and collective tactical ski lls previously taught to the individual the number of these skills wi ll increase with the size and complexity of the ptl illustration of progression order of ptl task size related subjects 1 reconnaissance recce ptl point detachment or section navigation personal camouflage formations signals intelligence movement techniques and leadership 2 recce ptl arearoute section as above with

and casualties 5 fighting ptl ambushraid company as above with the addition of control problems large obstacle crossing extended ptl base operations air support and counter attack walkthrough 3 before commencing with the ptls it is prudent to conduct walkthrough this serves to illustrate standard operating procedures sops and will allow soldiers to be open participants with the freedom to ask questions the walkthrough will cover all points from the initial warning order mission briefing rehearsals action at the objective obj and finally the debriefing for fighting ptl walkthrough the entire platoon can be utilised while for recce ptl only few patrolmen are required the whole procedure can be conducted in the field or in garrison setting 4 the instructor can serve as the ptl comd or can delegate someone to fill this role while the walkthrough takes place collective review of the battle procedure pro cess and all ptl drills prior to the bgl392004fp001 286patrol training walkthrough will ensure everyone has thorough understanding of the basics the instructor must be prepared to receive questions as well as to explain and demonstrate the actions of the ptl 5 the battle procedure sequence must be followed deviation from this sequence may occur however it must be discussed so as not to give the participants the wrong impression participants should attend the mission briefing and thus should be able to view and hear the actions taking place the mission briefing is to be conducted at properly organised headquarters hqs or in location where the best use of available resources can be made 6 in like manner the remainder of the walkthrough is conducted the instruct orcommander comd must deliver thorough orders and conduct complete inspections and rehearsals the use of enemy force will serve to clarify counter ambush and general ptl action drills section 2 checklist general 7 the following checklists can be used as guide by an instructor who is teachingassessi ng ptl training or by someone designated as ptl comd each ptl situation will have specific needs and for these supplementary check list should be prepared this may be include lists of special equipment b

be made the route memorised and terrain features selected for orientation b the use of difficult terrain must be considered when route planning however movement around difficult terrain may save time in the long run c alternate routes must be planned for but may be difficult to plot until they are actually needed enemy contacts unforeseen obstacles and danger areas may make it difficult to move onto an alternate route flexibility and always knowing the location of the patrol greatly assists in alternate route planning d patrolmen should carry two canteens on long patrols use of grenades and the grenade launcher must be controlled f reconnaissance patrols should carry at least one automatic weapon g employing weapons requiring different types of ammunition should be avoided when possible h all weapons must be cleaned checked and test fired before departure weapons should not be cleaned after test firing all patrolmen should carry individual weapon cleaning kits i gloves should be carried to protect the hands bgl392004fp001 353patrolling j elementsteams must have sufficient equipment to work independently of each ot her ie night vision goggles nvgs binos radios k utility sheets can be used to make litters construct rafts conceal lights and act as shelters l every patrolman should carry an extra pair of socks m length of rope can be used for binding prisoners or crossing obstacles n electrical tape can be used to secure rifle swivels slings and other items that may rattle camouflage the back of the neck behind the ears and the backs of the hands p sharp knife should be carried q security can be achieved by assigning every patrolman an area of responsibility r at least two pacers should be detailed and the average of their individual counts should be used s maps must be correctly folded so that they can be easily handled during navigational checks maps must not be marked t compasses should be preset before departing elementsteams should have at least one each u when conducting coordination follow the applicable coordinationannex checklist v if possible element comman ders should be taken on prepatrol reconnaissance w all signals must be easy to use prearranged and rehearsed bgl392004fp001 354annex c x adequate time for the patrol to obtain their night vision must be planned for 1530 minutes visual aids should be used when issuing orders ground models and diagrams are recommended z the patrol should be inspected carefully and shortfalls corrected before rehearsals and before departure patrolmen should be questioned to check their knowledge and understanding of the plan aa all human habitation should be avoided ab utilise ridgelines for movement in mountainous terrain the skyline should be avoided ac garrotte can be used for killing sentry or capturing prisoner an insulated wire should be used if the prisoner is to be captured ad luminous tape worn on the back of the bush cap greatly aids in control during movement on dark nights the tape should be covered when close to the objective ae communications must be checked before departure af night vision devices should be utilised when possible ag binoculars can increase visibility at night ah it is too late to consider planning and preparation when the patrol has crossed friendly lines 2 during the patrol the count should be sent up automatically after each halt or passage of danger area b navigation should be checked frequently the patrol commander is ultimately responsible bgl392004fp001 355patrolling c weapons are always carried at the ready the patrol must be capable of returning fire instantly d enemy wire should be cut only when necessary reconnaissance should be made first take advantage of noises such as wind vehicles planes or battle sounds f reduce movement on roads and trails unless absolutely necessary g avoid moving across the enemys front h during periods of darkness and over very short distances the compass can be used for signalling piece of luminous tape can also be used i when crossing obstacles adequate security must be maintained and movement should be silent and quick to avoid detection crossing should be attempted at curve or other areas where direct enemy observation is minimal j seriously wounded patrolmen require constant attention and must remain at rendezvous until the patrol returns walking wounded can stay with the patrol when the enemy is near wounded should be removed from the immediate area before applying longterm first aid k if possible enemy positions or obstacles should be bypassed by offsetting l the patrols location must be known at all times relatively slight error can result in missed objective m security must not be jeopardised by letting ear flaps toques or hoods interfere w ith hearing the effects of weather frostbite must be considered bgl392004fp001 356annex c n talking must be kept to minimum arm and hand signals should be used when possible when enemy positions are being recced security for the reconnaissance elemen t must be maintained p trash must never be buried it is always carried out q patrol number should be used forward of friendly positions r at halts and during movement all round security must be maintained s when patrolmen are having difficulty staying awake minimise prolonged halts and have them adopt kneeling rather then prone fire positions t stars can be used to aid in navigation frequent checks are required when us ing stars the patrols location should always be confirmed by mapcompass andor plgr gps u artillery or mortar marking rounds can be utilised as navigational aids v smoking must never be permitted during periods of darkness w expedient navigation methods such as using the sunstarsvegetation must be known to all patrolmen x communicators must

landmarks and reference points 2 dead ground 3 concealed routes and covered approaches and 4 alternate and return routes d identify all possible routes and study them in detail until you have decided on the best primaryalternate routes there and back the selection of the best route will depend on variety of factors such as tactical situation nature of the task time available ground and visibility divide the route into legs leg should be as long as manageable it may be as short as 100 metres and will vary in accordance with 1 the tactical situation 2 visibility 3 terrain and 4 vegetation bgl392004fp001 360annex d f legs of route should commence at prominent natural features the navigator must be able to 1 determine exact distance travelled 2 determine correct position and 3 correct lateral error 3 calculating and compiling navigational data once the basic route is planned all of the data must be compiled to ass ist in this process navigators must understand how to aim off and how to comp ile route card 4 aiming off offset aiming off is technique which enables you to locate an objective quickly and with confidence b aiming off will assist you in arriving at point which is close to your objective but offset by predetermined amount and c aiming off is particularly useful technique when the objective is discretely located on or near indiscernible feature 5 reasons for aiming off navigationtechnical reason it saves you having to determine which side of the objective you are on b tactical reason it ensures that you approach the objective from the desired direction 6 source of error the following factors or sources of error make the use of the offset technique virtually essential human error 1 tendency to shift right or left and bgl392004fp001 361patrolling 2 tendency to misjudge distance b compass error 50 mil inherent compass error c lay of the land difficult or severe terrain d local magnetic fluctuations caused by high terrain or subterranean wires wrist watches helmets local magnetic variations etc should such fluctuations be observed the patrols position must be immediately verified 7 compilation of route card route card should be used for several reasons it provides consolid ated sheet upon which all navigational data is readily available b it is easy to follow during periods of reduced visibility c it is easy to destroy if capture is imminent d subordinates can continue with the plan should the commander become casualty 8 the following data will be entered on route card leg the sequential leg number b from the grid reference of
