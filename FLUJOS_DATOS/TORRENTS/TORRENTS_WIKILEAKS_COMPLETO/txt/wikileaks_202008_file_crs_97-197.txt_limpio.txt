administrator speth has indicated that the drop in contributions to the core budget has affected the programs directed at the very poorest countries us contributions to undp the us contributions to

the 113 million fy1995 contribution in fy1997 the administration asked for 787 million for undp still considerably below the fy1995 contribution pl 104208 included language protecting the undp request level crs3 increasing contributions from other donors have partly offset the smaller us funding levels if contributions to the 1996 budget from other donor countries remain the same the us contribution of 787 million will place it in 6th place in calendar 1997 after in millions of us japan 105 denmark 105 netherlands 103 germany 94 and norway 79 issues for the 105th congress coordinating development assistance critics have long argued that undps programs are scattered throughout recipient countries and lack focus in addition the independent governance of agencies makes coordination difficult and agencies often run similar or overlapping programs undp has also been given increased responsibilities to coordinate environmental protection programs and disaster response activities in recent years secretarygeneral boutrosghali focused on strengthening the coordinating role of undp in his effort to streamline the economic and social programs february 1996 letter from us ambassador to the united nations albright to the chairman of the working group on strengthening the system proposed consolidating all the technicaldevelopment assistance functions into fewer agencies under undp umbrella of funds and programs undp administrator speth also proposed reorganization which would bring all the development and humanitarian assistance programs under new deputy secretary general absorbing undp some us critics argue that reducing contributions to undp and other development entities has encouraged these consolidation measures the department of state argues that reduced contributions undermine the work of administrator speth and threaten his reforms evolving undp role some in congress object to role in development and would limit activities to specific activities such as humanitarian assistance the majority of undp members however support strong development role development experts express concern at the growing percent of development aid devoted to emergency relief currently over 40 of assistance is directed to people in humanitarian emergencies according to undp in all but eight countries the undp resident representative coordinates the humanitarian assistance the agency is also working to improve the ability of the resident representative to provide leadership and coordination in the transition from the emergency assistance phase to the resumption of development programs undp has established special fund to provide quick response to countries where civil crises are building or where reconstruction and rehabilitation resources are urgently needed undp is also increasingly involved in programs to strengthen democratic governance agency reform under administrator speth the undp executive board has agreed to establish goal driven budget and to streamline the organization in response to falling income and rising needs according to undp between 1992 and the end of the 1997 administrative costs will be reduced 106 million in real terms or 12 and the number of core staff positions will be reduced by 600 31 at headquarters and 15 overall undp has begun independent auditing of country offices forthcoming gao report on agencies including undp is expected to confirm the staff reductions crs4 according to undp the program reform effort which began in 1995 provides greater country incentives for the design of more focused activities programs will be approved on the basis of their likely impact on the recipient countries as well as on the countrys poverty level these changes begun by administrator speth will not be presented and discussed by undp members until spring 1997 it is unclear whether they will be acceptable to the many undp members who prefer that aid be given to countries on per capita basis us influence having an american as undp administrator and making large contribution have ensured strong us influence over the organization the state department argues that influence over the direction and program content of undp quarantees that broad us foreign policy interests are supported by undp programs nevertheless some members argue that undp programs can undermine us policy at june 5 1996 senate hearing members criticized undp cooperation with the authoritarian regime in burma coming at time when us policy calls for minimal association with the regime ambassador madeleine albright defended undp actions as the minimum necessary to ensure aid reached the poorest people in the country private organization also criticized undp administrator speth for suggesting global taxes to pay for development programs charge speth denies pl 104208 the 1996 omnibus appropriation act prohibits any such tax historically other donors have questioned the tradition of having an american as undp administrator and they are expected to raise the issue this year when mr speths term expires european press reports indicate that there are currently two european candidates one danish and one dutch who are being suggested as successors to mr speth value of undp new york headquarters supporters argue that the large us contribution has kept undp in new york since 1994 the german government has an open offer to pay the costs of moving undp to germany both as way for it to play more active role in the united nations and to fill the empty office buildings in bonn on may 2 1996 majority of the members of the new york congressional delegation wrote to house foreign operations subcommittee chairman sonny callahan expressing support for the organization citing the critical need to preserve american leadership in the agency and keep undp in new york according to the congressional letter 1995 undp expenditures in the new york area alone were about 120 million including salaries more than twice the fy1996 us contribution of 52 million the undp estimates that it spent over 230 million in the united states in 1995 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97197
