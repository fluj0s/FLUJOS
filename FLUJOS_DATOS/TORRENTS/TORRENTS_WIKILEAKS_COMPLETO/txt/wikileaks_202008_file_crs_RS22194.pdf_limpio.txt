development of the federa l enterprise architecture fea in the mid1980s john zachman business planning consultant who worked for ibm at the time developed the zachman framework which was designed to serve as blueprint or an architecture to facilitate the integration of it systems2 the enterprise for which an architecture is created refers to either single organization or mission area that transcends more than one organizational boundary eg financ ial management homeland security3 since the development of the zachman fr amework various parts of the federal government have attempted to work with eas for example the clingercohen act passed in 1996 tasked agency chief inform ation officers cios with among other responsibilities developing maintaining nd facilitating the imple mentation of sound and integrated information technology architecture for the executive agency4 t h clingercohen act defined informa tion technology architecture as an integrated framework for evolving or maintaining existing information technology and acquiring new information technology to achieve the agencys strategic goals and information resources management goals5 in september 1999 the federal cio council issued its fea framework which was described as conceptual model that begi ns to define docum ented and coordinatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22194crs3 6 chief information

of the fea itself17 the brm is based on functional view of government operations rather than an organizational vi ew this orientation reflects the business focused nature of enterprise architectur it management the service component reference model srm in turn is intended to identify applications and components that independent of their business function can provide foundati on of technologies

potential to serve as critical it management tool for achieving greater efficiencies and breaking dow n the socalled stove pipes that separate individual departments and agencies the omb has described the fea as playing central role to ultimately transform the fe deral government into citizencentered resultsoriented and marketbased organization as set forth in the presidents management agenda pma20 the feas emphasis on veloping interoperable standards facilitating information sharing and increasing crossagency collaboration the fea is also expected to play significant role in the future development of federal government initiatives in attempting to develop second genera tion of egovernment projects omb has expressed an interest in moving beyond the somewhat limited nature of the crossagency collaboration of some of the first generation quicksilver projects21 toward initiatives that have truly governmentwide character to that end in spring 2004 after reviewin g data collected from agencies for the development of the fea and formulatin g the annual federal budget omb identified five major collaborative initiatives that represent core business functions common to many departments and agencies these fi ve socalled lines of business lob initiatives include financial management human resources management grants management case management and federal health
