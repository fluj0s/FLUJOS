idea currently contains statutory provisi ons requiring that parental consent be obtained prior to providing special educati on or related services to child with disability4 however the statute does not specifically address the issue of what responsibilities the lea has when child has been receiving special education services and parent wishes to revoke consent for such services previously ed had interpreted the statute and regulations to prohibit the unilateral withdrawal of child from special education in most circumstances5 the proposed changes to the regulations w ould reverse this inte rpretation to allow parents to unilaterally withdraw their child from the receipt of special education services and would not allow lea to use mediation or due process proce dures to override parents decision to refuse to consent to further services6 under the proposed regulations the lea would not be considered in violati on of the fape requirement if the child was not provided with special education or related services because of the parents revocation of consent in addition the proposed regulati ons would specifically provide that if the parents revoke consent the lea is not requi red to amend the childs records to remove references to the childs receipt of special education services ed described the rationale for these proposed changes as continua tion of the parents right to consent just as under section 614a1diiii pare nts have the authority to consent to the initial provision of special education and rela ted services we believe that parents also should have the authority to revoke that consent thereby ending the provision of special education and related services to th eir child this change is also consistent with the ideas emphasis on the role of pare nts in protecting their childs rights and the departments goal of enhancing parent involvement and choice in their childs education7 the proposed regulations differ from the current regulations regarding consent to initial services although the current regu lations like the proposed regulations require parental consent to services and prohibit the use of media tion and due process procedures to force that consent the current regulations on consent to initial services require public agency to make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent8 there is such requirement in the proposed regu lations regarding revocation of consenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22885crs3 9 20 usc 1403 1405 10 proposed 34 cfr 300177 73 f ed reg 27699 may 13 2008 part b of idea is the core of the act

recipients of assistance under idea must make positive efforts to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities in programs assi sted under part b of idea10 representation by nonattorn eys in due process hearings one of the most controversial changes in the proposed regulations is the provision relating to lay advocates currently idea pr ovides that any party to hearing under part b of idea has the right to be accompanie d and advised by couns and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities11 however neither the act nor current regulations addresses the issue of whether individuals with special knowledge but who are not attorneys may represent parties at due process hearings in 1981 letter from theodore sky acting general counsel of the department of education to the honorab frank b brouillet the department had previously interpreted section 615h of the act and implementing regulations as allowing both attorneys and nonattorneys to perform the same functions at due process hearings12 in 2000 decision by the laware supreme court in in the matter of arons13 held that lay advocate who represented families of children with disabilities in due process hearings had engaged in the unauthorized pr actice of law 2006 survey found that ten states like delaware prohibit lay advocates from representing parents twelve states permit lay advocates twenty one states have official policy and eight states leave the matter to the hearing officer14 this survey also noted shortage of readily affordable attorneysto represent parents and that the availability of specializ ed lay advocates has not been nearly sufficient to close the gap15 the issue regarding representation by lay advocates had prompted attempts to add st atutory language authorizing lay advocateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22885crs4 16 hrept 108779 at 218 note 227 the use of advocates was made more problematic by the

usc 1416b2ciii during the last idea reauthor ization culminating in pl 108446 but language in the house bill hr 1350 108th cong was deleted in conference16 the proposed regulations would change th previous interpretation by ed which allowed the use of lay advocates at due pro cess hearings the proposal would allow the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the pr oblems of children with disabilities but would add an exception stating that whether parent s have the right to be represented by non attorneys at due process hearings is determined under state law17 the department stated that this proposed change is consistent with eds general view regarding state flexibility where idea is silent in addition ed noted that this change would not prevent parents from representing themselves regarding th eir own idea claims as allowed under winkelman v parma city school district18 school officials and parents groups have both predicted activity in the states if the proposed rule becomes final19 the issue may come up at the federal level again when cong ress begins the reauthorization process for idea20

identified23 section 616b2ciii of idea requires state to report annually to the public on the performance of each lea and to make the states performance plan available through public means including

addition although idea requires the posting of the states pe rformance plan it does not specify whether other materials such as the annual report on each lea must also be made available the proposed regulations would require the st ates performance plan the states annual performance report apr and the states nnual reports on the performance of each lea to be made availabl through public means26 section 616e7 of idea requires states that have received determination from the secretary that the state needs intervention to make such information available to the public however the statute does not specify when this information is to be made available the proposed regulations woul d clarify the circumstances under which public notice is required27 by requiring public notice whenever state receives notice that the secretary is proposing to take or is taking an enforcement action28 the allocation of funds to leas that are not serving any children with disabilities29 idea currently contains statutory provisions requiring states to distribute idea part b funds not reserved for state activities to local education agen cies leas including public charter schools th at operate as leas30 states first allocat base amount to each lea based on its fy1999 grant amount then 85 of the remainder is allocated based on public and private school enrollment within the lea compared to all such enrollment in the state and 15 of the remainder is ba sed on the number of children living in poverty compared to the number in all leas the department of educations ed ffice of inspector general oig found that neither that statute nor the idea regulati ons addresses whether state is required to allocate funds to charter school in its first year of operation if th school has students with disabilities enrolled31 the proposed regulations w ould clarify that states are required to allocate some funds to leas in cluding public charter schools that operate ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22885crs6 32 this requirement would be effective with f unds that become available on the first july 1 following the effective date of the re gulations proposed 34 cfr

making the base payment adjustment is the same as that required in current regulations 34 cfr 300705b2i for any new lea 37 proposed 34 cfr 300705c 73 f ed reg 27700 may 13 2008leas even if an lea is not serving any children with disabilities32 the proposed regulations imply that such leas would r eceive base grant of zero and some funds based on enrollment and poverty the rationale for this propos ed rule is that allocating funds to all leas would ensure that leas ve part b funds available if they are needed to conduct child find activities i identifying and evaluating children in need of special education or to serve children with disab ilities who subsequently enroll or are identified during the year33 the oig also found that neither the stat ute nor the idea regulations addresses whether charter school lea that received ba payment of zero in its first year of operation because it was serving children w ith disabilities and s ubsequently provided special education to children with disabilities is entitled to base payment in subsequent years if it does enroll students with disabilities34 the proposed regulations would require that base payment adjustme nt be made for these leas including public charter school that operates as an lea for th fiscal year after the first annual child count in which the lea reports that it is serving any children with disabilities35 the state would be required to divide the base allocation for the leas th at would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the new lea among the new lea and affected leas based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities currently provided special education by each of the leas36 finally the proposed regulations would modify the procedures fo r the reallocation of lea funds37
