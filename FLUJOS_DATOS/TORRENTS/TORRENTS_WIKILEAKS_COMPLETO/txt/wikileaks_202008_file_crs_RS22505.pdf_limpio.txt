order code rs22505 updated march 7 2007 voter identification and citizenship requirements overview and issues kevin j coleman analyst in american national government government and finance division eric fischer senior specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division summary the help america vote act of 2002 hava pl 107252 requires that certain voters who had registered by mail present form of identification from list specified in the act states vary greatly in what identification they require voters to present ranging from nothing beyond the federal requi rement to photographic identification for all voters the adequacy of the current fede ral requirement has been controversial and several bills were introduced in the 109th and previous congresse s both to broaden and restrict that requirement hr 4844 hyde which was passed by the house on september 20 2006 would have required voter s to present photo identification with proof of citizenship when voting in federal elections proponents for implementing ch additional federal requi rements assert that they are necessary to prevent vote fraud althoug h statistics on the occurrence or impact of such fraud have not been compiled at either the state or federal level there are however reported instances of noncitiz ens voting in elections regularly1 objections to such requirements focus on the problems they might create for some classes of otherwise eligible voters pa rticularly in the absence of strong evidence linking non citizen voting to vote fraud and on the l ongstanding practi ce of limiting federal involvement in the administrati on of elections by states this report which will not be updated presents background information on id entification requirements for voting and discusses potential be nefits and disadvantages of the provisions in hr 4844 the identification requirement in hava app lies only to firsttime registrants who register by mail if the voter has not previous ly voted in federal election in the state or in local election jurisdiction in cases where the state does not have computerizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22505crs2 2 see 303 b hava also requires that effective january 2006 all states have such computerized statewide voter registration system see 303a however not all states were compliant by that deadline 3 states that do not require voters to present identification may use other means of verification such as asking voters to state their home addre ss and date of birth or requiring signature that would be compared with one on file statewide voter registration system2 such voters must present one of the following forms of identification current and valid photo id entification or copy if voting by mail or copy of current utility bill bank statement government check paycheck or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter hava also requires that mailin voter registration form s contain check box for the registrant to certify that he or she is us citizen the act does not prevent states from establishing more stringent identification requirements following the passage of hava states enacted laws to implement the hava identification requirements and in some cases more stringent requirements some states have additional requi rements for voters to present form of identification beyond those in hava3 other states also require voters to present form of identification from the list in hava or from more extended list still others require all voters to present photo identification in all cases voters w ho cannot present identif ication are permitted to cast provisional ballot in addition to hr 4844 see below veral bills were introduced in the 109th congress that took opposite approaches to the question of voter identification hconres 247 lewisga and sconres 53 obama expressed the sense of congress that national photo identificati on requirements for voters should be rejected and that

discussion of the history of noncitizen voting may be f ound at httpwwwgothamgazettecomarticlefeaturecommentary20030825202503 11 nearly half the states already have an identif ication requirement and all the states require that voter must be citizen 12 the report can be found at h ttp wwwamericane duiacfer2006 election7 was overturned by the us supreme court on october 20 20068 in ohio us district judge issued mporary restraining order on october 26 2006 with respect to the states new voter identification law9 until the 20th century not all states required voters to be citizens nd small number of calities per mit noncitizen voting in local elections10 potential arguments in favor among the potential arguments in favor of requiring photo identification and proof of citizenship for voting are the following it would establish uniform national standard for voting eligibility with respect to photo identification and proof of c itizenship liminating the potential for confusion from the cu rrent statebystate approach11 it would prevent noncitizens from be ing able to register to vote unintentionally thereby preventing any noncitizen from casting ballot right reserved for citizens only it would prevent intentional regi stration by noncitizens and eliminate that form of vote fraud either on the part of individuals or on larger scale it would implement major recommendation of the national commission on federal election re form commonly known as the carterbaker commission that called for states to require voters to provide photo identification in order to vote12 it would bring voting in line with other transactions that require photo identification such as cashing check or boarding plane or as proof of age or identity for certain types of purchaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22505crs5 13 304 14 statebystate summary of identification laws may be found at h ttp wwwelection lineorg defaultaspxtabid364potential arguments against among the potential arguments against photo identification and pr oof of citizenship requirements for voting are the following it is arguably unnecessary because federal law already prohibits non citizens from voting in national elections 18 usc 611 or from providing false information about citizenship when registering 18 usc 911 and carries penalties of fine imprisonment for year or both hr 4844 went well beyond the identif ication requirement in the help america vote act which established minimum election administration requirements and specifically noted that nothing in this title shall be construed to prevent state from tablishing election technology and administration requirements that are more strict than the requirements established under this title13 with respect to photo identification and citizenship many states have done exactly that 24 established stricter identification requirements than hava and the remaining states implemented the basic hava requi rements for identification14 the bill did not indicate what types of proof of citizenship would be acceptable so it is hard to determine precisely what its impact would be on voters the bill would have placed an add itional burden on potential voters who must provide documentation at the time both of registration and of voting in the us the burden of registration falls to the individual to begin with in contrast to othe r democracies where the government compiles the list of eligible voter s and where turnout tends to be considerably higher than in the united states for some voters particularly the elderly the poor and some minorities obtaining the proper government documentation to prove citizenship could be difficult and timeconsumin g if the person did not have such documents in hand requiring proof of citizenship would mean that newly registered voters would have to meet an additional re quirement to be eligible to vote compared with those who were already registered raising the question of different standards for diffe rent classes of voters t he newly registered vs the already registered the registration process would be delayed until potential voter could obtain the necessary proof of c itizenship and photo identificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22505crs6 presumably from different government entities before registering to vote with third entity and could create additional burdens for voters the bill did not require that phot identification cards should be provided free of charge to all voter s as recommended by the carter baker commission and as num ber of states have done latest action the house administration committee orde red to be reported hr 4844 with an amendment in the nature of substitute on september 14 2006 the house approved hr 4844 on 228196 vote on september 20 2006 on november 13 2006 the bill was referred to the senate committee on rules and administration further action occurred
