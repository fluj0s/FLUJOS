auditing and assessment lecture given on 3 march 1964 thank you whats the date audience the 3rd of march the 3rd of march ad 14 saint hill special briefing course well im glad to see you looking so well im glad to see you looking so well and you do too you know ive seen some creaks disappear here since the last time i looked at you well i got my complete line plot last night thanks to my auditor complete goals plot from one to fortytwothe lot yeah thats much more to the pointthe auditor on this casewhat shes had to suffer what shes had to suffer through and its very interesting that until you get goals plot done properly the amount of faith and confidence that you can put in goal until its been completely plotted is so slight as to be negligible on actual gpms and the wild abandon with which weve been running wrong goals is really marvelous great you know great the materialsthis lecture is not connected with or concerned with r6 only slightly impinges on it its at lower levels but it is interesting that the most complete body of knowledge today is at class vi that is complete codified completely buttoned up squared around all auditing skills everything necessary to put it together exists there at that level and this is not was not an accidental or momentary achievement the truth of the matter is it required thousands and thousands of hours of auditing required fantastic amounts of puttogether and lookup and squarearound and so on and it is quite happy thing to look at and see that that material is all squared around oddly enough it happens to be all codified it happens to be all on tape or in notes or so forth all for study and so on and fromwell actually class iiclass ii looks very thin and spotty with you know with great deal of additional bits and pieces and nothing lined up too straight and so forth but the information is all there at class ii dont you see but its not really in concise tight assembly and so on but class vi is quite in addition to that we have all of the instructors and saint hill staff personnel are just finishing up their class vi course so we even have trained instructors along this line of course we dont dare say at this moment that we have trained instructors because they get their examination thursday night but anyway the information at class vi is the most codified piece of stuff that anybody ever wanted to look at and that is quite comforting in scientology because were quite used to having it all in fragments dont you know and its released here there and this or that and its an hcob that also contains methods of snapping your fingers you know and then theres another bit of vital information that comes out in 1958 at the same time its accompanied by how to assess for the rock andyou know it has scattered and spattered about so you have to root and dig for it well that isnt true at class vi and its good thing it isnt because this is precision skill to end all precision skills now the lecture im about to give you delivers into your hands some additional information concerning your more basic auditing now this is of course also applicable to class vi but is the very stuff of which life is made at classes iii and iv and frankly i dont see how anybody could do anything at class iv without this data now i want toi want to give youso thatsthe tapethe classifiable level of the tape of course is class iv that imdata im giving you right now but its also classes v and vi now you are accustomed to regarding assessment as something that you use to find something to audit thats the basicbeen the basic purpose of assessment for many many years and then more latterly to find the cause or source of an arc breakassessment assessment is an activity which is totally independent of auditing and as you move up in the classes from iv on youll find that assessment commingles with auditing because class vi is just practically nothing but solid assessment dont you see with auditing thrown in we bring about the primary cause of bad auditing or bad arc breaks from just one thing is the inability of the auditor to differentiate between assessment and auditing and failing to shift his gears or schizophrenically do both at the same time the way you do both at the same time is when the pc originates in the middle of an assessment youre going down the sheet and the pc originates well now you actually never do them both at the same time but you must learn to lay aside the assessment for that instant handle the auditing situation competently and then resume the assessment and when you realize that all this may take place in shorter space of time than twenty seconds you realize that the auditor has to have terribly good ability to differentiate between the two and to shift between the two activities the two activities dont really mix they are entirely different things and let give you some reason why the assessment is addressed to the pcs bank it is not addressed to the pc now when auditing intervenes during an assessment then something has been addressed to the pc inadvertently something has gone to the pc but its not that its an accident or anything youve bit something in assessing so therefore the pc has been reminded of something and so originates well now this is the pc talking the assessment is addressed to the bank and the pc says something this is perfectly all right this happens constantly in auditing well what does the auditor do well actually he lays aside his assessment at that moment not with the physical actions of picking up the paper and putting it over alongside him but with the mental realization that that is in effect what he is doing handles the origin competently understands the origin doesnt doesntthis is one performance which is utterly deadly auditor is so busy assessing that he hasnt got any time to understand what the pc is saying see so he simply acknowledges hoping that it wont be noticed you see he just gets rid of this auditing action and then tries to go back to his assessment and of course he cant and the session will lock up right there it locks up if only to the degree that the meter ceases to be as responsive you might not notice it you see it might not be glass shattering arc break the pc might not even feel upset about his auditor its just that it ceases to be so responsive your assessment now doesnt run so well and all bad assessment where the meter isnt operating properly comes about because the auditor cant shift his gears between assessing and auditing rapidly enough and handle both of them competently each in its turn do you follow i by the way am addressing this lecture to you with great deal of hope and Ã©lan i gave you lecture on the comm cycle in auditing few weeks ago and i was alsolearned something because i had the lecturethose two lectures replayed to you and youyou immediately made tremendous use out of this and great deal of upgrade occurred and so forth and i was very pleased it gave nice win and i was very happy with you about that so im not talking to you today as though the information will be 50 percent wasted i have confidence that you will use it intelligently it was nice win now i was amazed at the number of auditor reports which showed up exact accurate use of that information i gave you about that comm cycle ive lectured about it before but its never been picked up and used so therefore i was able to put it into communication form which was understandable and usable well this is another one of these and you also heard talk week ago about assessment and so forth and i actually just gave you bunch of hot bricks i just took them right out of the furnace and put them into your bare hands theres lot of definitions in that last lecture i gave youratatattatatattatatattat its practically whole subject like chemistry all in that short space of time well im giving you some of the fruits of that information right now in talking to you about shifting gears between assessing and auditing now theres many an auditor thinks assessing is completely impossible he gets of this opinion he takes an old prehav scale and hes going to find the prehav levelwhich by the way are mostly items out of actual gpms or locks theyre on but he gets to going down this thing you know and all of sudden theres his meter and his metersseems to be completely motionless nothing happening on the meter the needle was sort of swinging about and all of sudden it isnt doing so well so he thinks hes hit something in the assessment thats his first mistake he thinks the pc must have hung up someplace he thinks lot of things but that needle is longer free so he goes back over the list to hit what he had previously been going over and getting little ticks on and he finds out that most of them are scrubbed and he cant get much of them back except some other one that hadnt read before or something now gives bigger tick and he just sort of goes into despair about the whole thing and just hands up any level and of course its usually the one thats most protested by the pc then he audits this on the pc and wonders why he doesnt get any gain you see well now thats failure of assessment what ive given you there obviously isnt it its an assessment failure but actually actually its an auditing failure its an auditing failure the auditing which got put aside shouldnt have been that thoroughly put aside and the pcs origin the auditors inadvertent question of the pc see like well is it all right with you if i now assess this list you see thats an auditing question man thats not an assessment question and the pc says hmmmmmmm and the auditor sayssee and heall right you see pocketabock and backityback and boobityboop and soopasoop whats he doing right now hes got an incomplete auditing cycle the pc didnt know if it was all right to assess the list or not really didnt know quite what the auditors going to do and maybe had his attention on some cycle of action that the pc thought was incomplete see so hes given the pcnow you understand theres two targets here one is the bank one is the pc so he starts the assessment by addressing the pc look at how elementary nonsensical this can get you see and then doesnt permit the cycle of action to take place you see in other words hes going to assess so he starts an auditing action and then he doesnt complete the auditing action and keeps assessing well now that in itself all by itself is enough to thoroughly defeat an assessment of such delicate nature as old r2 prehav scales or something like that thats quite adequate see is it all right with you if im just giving you the reduction ad absurdum of it you see this is it all right with you if i assess this list now see bucketybow boppity bow bungitybing bockatabok now wait minute he said something to the pc didnt he well the pc has heard this as livingwe wont say breathing being because there the pc could be tootoo far gone to breathe or actually you could be assessing somebody who was up high enough so they didnt have to but this pc is an analytically responsive character see when hes asked do birds fly then he expects to answer do birds fly furthermore he is not probably very well indoctrinated as pc and so thinks all assessment questions are addressed to him personally too and has an anxiety but you wont find that enters into it very much providing you keep your auditing cycle going but having asked the pc this question if you dont complete that cycle of action then you tend to channel the remaining assessment to the pc do you see this so the pc now feels honorbound to answer whether or not communication and so forth is the level so the pc sits there and says well it really shouldnt be communication i dont think its that well i dont think its this and so on why is he going into this well he could be going into this for many reasonsbutinanxiety about questions and so forth hes not well insession or something but remember part of this and what keyed him into going into this was the fact that the auditor asked him question and then didnt complete the auditing cycle and so threw the whole assessment on to an auditing line pc is still trying to sit here saying well is it all right for him to go with the the pc didnt get chance to say you know well i dont know i feel sort of dopey and groggy will that have any effect on the assessment see only the pc doesnt say it so well look at the mechanics involved here the pc has an incomplete auditing cycle may have had an answeris therefore put on withhold and this is what youre going to assess through now this gives you some idea of how sharp an auditors got to be to differentiate between auditing and assessment you complete one particularly the auditing cycleand you complete the other theyre both action cycles and they both have to be completed now let give you the reverse look at this thing it looks kind of idiotic when you start looking at it but youd be surprised how easy it is to slip into this one i mean what im talking to you about in general itshow easy it is not to differentiate between these two things well after all youve got pc sitting in front of you and youre just there arent you youre doing this for his case and naturally he has his opinions and weve got all kinds of rationale you see to go through with this that breaks down what should be very very sharp view of this were auditing or were assessing see were eitheror you see thats all were not auditing and assessing so the pcthe pc sits there in state of batterbatter yackle yackle to himself comments on everything because hes already on withhold to the auditor now theres many pc when he sees an auditor assess goes on to an immediate detached withhold state of mind well how did he get there thats what you should ask yourself did he just get there automatically he has to be put there by disobeying certain little tenets that are the ideal operation see perfectly all right to say to pcoh yes you shouldis it all right now if we assess this list perfectly all right but for gods sakes look you got an auditing cycle going youve asked the pc an auditing question now the pc has to say it is or isnt all right and he jolly well must have answered that question to his satisfaction see its all just the standard auditing cycleanswers the question to his satisfaction and says to the auditor yes or whatever it is you see and the auditor must acknowledge that and if present time problem or something pops up with regard to this the auditor certainly had jolly well better handle it see this is just all auditing see going on here the auditor had better oh youve got little headache now when did the headache turn on well it did all right fine yes uhhm all right all right howre you doing now all right thank you thank you very much now is it all right if i assess this list and the pc says yeah its all right if you assess the list and the auditor says okay thank you and without further ado turns over to this assessing operation backatyback bop boop tadadap pow pow pow pow pow bang bang bang bang and youd just be utterly fascinated the needle stays loose and when you hit the right item why it goes klablang and all is well and the pcall of sudden youve got the right item and you ask the pc something about is that it you know well now now watch this one see he says is that your item you know or something like that see well now thats just tossed off as an idle patter or piece of courtesy step or something isnt it it hasnt any any real bearing its part of the assessment isnt it oh its not you started brandnew auditing cycle and when you say is that your item you have asked an auditing question and you jolly well better get it completely carried out into its auditing cycle or the next thing you know it wont be the pcs item nothing will repeat on the meter the pcs in bunch of withhold he doesnt cognite on anything and this is where you throw most of your cognitions see thats how they get thrown in the ashcan thats how pcs feel they arent cogniting well and that sort of thing well the auditing question is asked is that your item you see some such thing and the pc of course is going to take little while to answer that completely aside from the fact that you shouldnt be talking while the ta is moving completely aside from that mechanical bit thats thrown in sideways pcs item sponduliks hmm sponduliks hmm sponduliks oh yeah yeah when i waswhen i was umpteen uhi uhyeah andyeah yeah yeah thats why i left isabelle see yes thats right and now now now beware auditor is that an answer to your auditing question it jolly well isnt thats halfway point now the pc will either get around to eventually telling you thisyouve just handed the pc heavy bomb right in his paws you see it takes him while to get through the circuitry see well look youre looking for something thats got his mind all circuitried why why be so surprised why be so surprised that it takes him long time to answer this auditing question youve just put him into the middle of the complete rat race and hes supposed to see his way through this in split second so you can get on assessing or something see hes not going to you dumped him into the middle of the whirlpool see you just said sponduliks is that your item see sponduliks oh oh rrr rrr rr rrrr rrmmmm grate grate grind grind the wheels crashing you know gears grinding and so forth oh yes cognition see well thats why i left isabelle see yeah yeah yeah now watch it auditor that pc hasnt answered that auditing question pcs saying yeah yeah yeah yeah hes just saying yeah thats how he left yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah has lot to do with military training at uh yeah yeah haha yeah yeah yeah that damn sergeant he used to come out there on the parade ground all the time hed keep saying sponduliks you know wonder heyheyhey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah thats my item but maybe he forgets to tell you and after while he just sits back withif youve done proper assessment and everything is in and rolling like mad and your good indicator inhe sits back with grin on his face and so forth and thats the end of that see and he hasnt said thats his item you know and the auditor now would have an uncompletean incomplete cycle of action unless he got the question answered the auditor shouldnt say i will now repeat the auditing question i dont think that would quite be in order since it would now invalidate all his cognitions so hed say well sponduliks is that your item then oh yeah oh yeah hell i thought you understood that yeah of course its my item yeah yeah thats my item yes sir you see the tone arm start going some more see you say all right sponduliks thats your item now the pc hasnt been asked anything has he hes not given command to do anything so you can say sponduliks thats your item without expecting anything else to happen because nothing else will happen hell just sit there youll get great big surge of the needle and that will be that but you seenow ive just given you an example herethat failure to differentiate between the assessment and the auditing messes up the meter messes up the session and makes the assessment all but impossible they are two different distinct operations and theres very funny thing about it assessment must never interrupt the auditing cycle but the auditing cycle may at any time interrupt assessment so therefore the auditing cycle is the senior operation now that sounds very funny if we say its senior operation obviously you spend more time on that than you do on anything else listen the whole of ta action obtained at class vi is obtained quantitatively its the number of items you get in the unit of time that gives you the ta its quantitative you find one item per session and you will get oddly enough very little more than the ta action resident in one item if you want ten times that why you find ten times the number of items this is just arithmetically arrivable at its justthats it so therefore the auditing cycle is senior to it because it can wreck the assessment not that it necessarily occupies more time assessment can also wreck an auditing cycle pc is saying say you know ive just had an inkling here that that goal youre listing for on the list or i think my service facsimile is in actual fact and so on and so on oh yeah oh yeah okay sponduliks padadada padododo po dododo padididididudu waf woo what the hells happened to the meter whats the matter ive got dirty needle here pc must have missed withhold you have missed withhold you think something before the session that uh yes you been up to something between sessions i dont know about maybe its listing bypass or maybe l4 hell you just mixed up assessing and auditing and put your meter out of operation now this will come closer home to you when i tell you that if there were two electrical lines leading out to two different objects and you took those two lines and crossed them you would get sparks and that you have two lines going out to two different destinations pc and bank and when you cross them you get sparks very jammy type sparks now auditor is so expert that he will never get these things mixed up but lets look at some of the obvious faults that you can get into with this now when youre assessing you customarily use or might use is see lets take service facsimile list is this list complete now all of this actually should be threshed out threshed out it has not appeared too much on the research horizon because one can get away with saying is it but you know theres notheres nobody home in bank there can be appearances of people being there you can get all kinds of wild things if you want to mess up pc good go into conversationthrough the meterwith one of the nine entities of the body youll get some of the weirdest responses you can give every sign of having animate intelligent beings the first one of them that emerged and that was used and so forth is the file clerk the old file clerk you make an impingement on the bankask question and make an impingementand youll get some interesting responses i remember some publisherlady in charge of publications of vast magnitude and i was talking to her one day about dianetics something of the sort and she said well what do you mean people arent in present time see and i said well theyre very often stuck other places and so forth oh yes and i said all right when i snap my fingers an age will flash you see when i snap my fingers an age will flash see and i said what age occurred to you at that moment she says four all right where were you when you were four years old turns out you know the house burned down and how did you know that and you must be very magical indeed well of course you just got the part of the time track that the person was most glued up in and so on and by making an impingement on the bank why you got response but remember the response did not really come about from theasking question of little man that sits in box behind wicket now i myself at this particular stage of the gameand i may shift this for various reasonsdo ask assessment questions as questions ive noticed that this bothers the pc more than assertions but its easier to do and i have never considered it vital bit of stuff but if you said instead of is it four is it five is it sixsomething of this character you see is the list complete you would say the list is complete the list is incomplete in other words you would make your assessment statements and your questions otherwise it all depends on how much control youve got as an auditor and what the pc understands but i noticed that i occasionally do run into crossand you will toorun into cross between the pc thinks hes been addressed when actually youve addressed the bank now you wont get any reaction from the bank if the pc is intervening so the more you can do to keep the pc from intervening without putting the pc on bunch of withholdsone of the cute ways to do it is the pc well trained then says i am not going to interfere with the auditor or stick my oar in during the assessment and then of course you have dead meter for the complete assessment pcs are very helpful very often helpful you say has something been decided or protested has something been decided that read what did you decide well that i was just going to sit here and let you address the bank all you wanted to and i wasnt going to say word or interfere all right fine now you do the assessment and of course you get the reactions so the pc can get between you and the bank in other words he can actually throw in an overwhelming postulate or decision of some kind or another that just holds the bank down flat and you cant address the bank therefore the pc has to sit there with the rudiments in and without bunch of cooperative cooperative assistances before you can get any assessment done so lets just put it this way if the pc is in good communication oddly enough it works this way itll sound the reverse unless you inspect it carefullyif the pc is in good communication with the auditor you can then address the bank very easily that doesnt sound quite right when you look at it the first time you say well yeah be sitting there jabbering away talking away yapping away cogniting away knocking the having an awful time here keeping my tone arm on its proper position and my needle on set the pc keeps cogniting all the time you know and he keeps knocking it out so if youre in good communication with the pc you can be in good communication with the bank so the way to put yourself in good communication with the bank is to put yourself in good communication with the pc so therefore your auditing cycle must be in your session rudiments must be in good condition before you do an assessment and during the assessment any communication with the pc that occurs must be completed as an auditing cycle this is pretty esoteric actually it is pretty esoteric but it is this important that you wont be able to assess at all unless you have some inkling of it now the auditors who can assess and get away with it very easilythe auditors who get away with it very easily and assess well simply are auditors who dont have too much trouble staying in communication with the pc so if you had an auditor who was in relatively poor communication with the pc then he wouldnt assess well see but you wouldnt have to understand this for that to work but youve left piece of stuff on accidental so day arrives when youre not in good communication with the pc on that day and you cant assess now what happens well the assessment is up the spout so you decide that there is something wrong with the case or something has gone wrong and you hastily repair bunch of things that dont need repairing instead of repairing the communication cycle you start repairing the work you have done with assessing now this can be serious enough at r4 it is utterly catastrophic at r6 you throw away the last four goals you found and throw away half dozen other items and get oh everything in reverse and so forth well whats wrong why cant you assess well it happens to be session situation it was your list 1 type situation in the first place it wasnt really an arc break it was just gradual mounting up of the pc finding it was impossible to communicate to the auditor and the impossibility of communicating to the auditor finally wound up to locked up meter now youll find bypassed charge theres always bypassed charge to find you could search any case out and find bypassed charge i could take anybody at random just on the one evidence that he was in body and find bypassed charge so you can go through this kind of idiocy you can spend twelve hours or more on meter locating bankr6 you see r4 list 2 3 bypassed charge seeyou could just find it and find it keep plotting it and then butbut try to clear this question and this is one for the book this because this is very interesting question on an emeter youve said well weve really found the service facsimile which belonged to uncle oscar all right thats fine theres nice fall on that oh its true you did you found the service facsimile that belonged to uncle oscar thats right and you say thats fine the pc isnt feeling much better but you got good read and so forth now after youve done this operationi dont advise this this would break your heart by the way if you did this as routine auditing action this is researchthis is gimmickthing that just demonstrates something to you you ask on the meter have i misassigned the charge have i misassigned the charge meters are very good at picking up this kind of thing see and youll get nice smooth fall yes it says that youve misassigned the charge go back in and try to arrange some more of the service facsimile was on the lefthand side and really it was in the session of october flumph and the earlier incident wasreally concerned the fact that we had two jumwims in juxtaposition and now now you know youve got it see now you know youve got it youve straightened out the pc now youve got it all set and youve gotten good reads on the meter and the pc seems to be feeling better now ask the question have i misassigned the bypassed charge and youll get yourself as good read as before and you can frankly keep this up hour after hour after houralways finding bypassed charge not making the pc feel any better at all whats the meter mean what actually is the source of that fall its that youve misassigned the charge on the basis that youre assigning it to the pcs bank not to the session when youve got session bypassed charge and you try to cure it by finding deepseated bank bypassed charges then this question have i misassigned the bypassed charge will read perpetually until you get its very funny i mean ive seen it read for twelve hours reads beautifully doesnt wear out at all you can even suppress it and then you find some more bypassed charge thats become unsuppressed by that time have i misassigned the bypassed charge you talk about heartbreaking proposition man youve sweated your head off see youve found that the ruddyrods were on the wrong side of the wumpagumps you know and you found out that its really because the person was eighteen months old not three years old when this happened and you have found out its because his past life wasnt really spent in afghanistan oh now weve cleared it up see the pc doesnt feel any better but weve cleared it up see have i misassigned the bypassed chargefall honest it just goes on and on and on and then getat the end of this run really clean it up have we misassigned the bypassed charge by saying it was something in the pcs case when it was really something that happened in the session and your bypassed charge read will vanish at that moment interesting isnt it dont think im downgrading the bypassed charge ive seen some mighty explosive bypassed charges practically blow the plugs out of the pcs ears blow his eardrums out like bullets yes those bypassed charges are very important but in the presence of session arc break that bypassed charge can be assigned to the pcs bank and you can always find something to assign it to and it wont clear up and the pc doesnt feel any better and the auditor out of professional pride or something never thinks to ask is it session arc break see so that your arc break assessments really should begin with is it session arc break is it an r6 arc break or is it an r4 arc break you see do preassess and actually its as crude of what list do i use to find the bypassed charge on see its as crude as that because you can just mess up the whole perimeter tear up nearly all of your work let us say youve been looking for service facsimiles or something like this and youve got it all set you could tear up all that work invalidate it all suppress it all throw it all away wear yourself out because the pcs getting better and so forth and then find out its because you began cycle of action in session see and you asked the pc some question and you didnt accept the pcs answer and the pc has been parked there ever since present time always appears to be more important than the past the finger that you smash with the hammer now is much more important to you infinitely more important to youthan the whole civilization which you lost hundred trillion years ago well similarly painful as it is to get two gpms wrong side to messed up as it is to catch some service facsimile for instance at r4 that the pc wots not ofyou said well dedicated elephant you see thats dedicated elephant or ambrosious toenails something you see and thats your service facsimile and pc says i guess it is and so on so on yeah and you go on from this and you dont get anyplace and the pc hasnt ever accepted it as his item see you didnt getit wasnt that it was or wasnt his item is the point im making it was the fact that he never had chance to say it was or wasnt and you go back and you look this over and you find out thats wrong item see and you just tear up the ground see trying to straighten that all out you see as having been the wrong item and so forth hasnt anything to do with whether its the wrong item or the right item you see its the fact that an auditing cycle began there and he never got chance to say it was or wasnt his item and actually arc broke at that point do you see therefore you got to be pretty slippy as an auditor to shift your gears from the auditing cycle over into an assessment and shift your gears from assessment back to auditing again and know which one youre doing its very very wise auditor that knows what hes doing but there is substitute for it now 99 percent of your assessment trouble is not assessment trouble at all its auditing cycle trouble anybody can sit there and read off list and read meter but nobody can sit there and read off list and find an item on an inoperative meter sitting across the table from an inoperative preclear that happens to be impossible therefore you say the obvious thing to do well you just better train auditors up to assess better we will clear up their diction we will put into the course diction so that auditors can diction better see so that they throw their rs in the right place you see and after you got all through their assessment wouldnt be any better at all you see you can just beat your head against wall trying to straighten up the ability of the auditor to assess whats wrong with him the reason he cant assess is he throws his comm cycle out you see similarly just like you can wrap yourself around telegraph pole trying to find the r6 bypassed charge when its session bypassed charge similarly you could do all sorts of things to improve your assessment when that isnt whats wrong with the session now there can be things that you see now what fouls up all this and the reason i have to differentiate from this point of viewwhat gets all this different lookis the assessment errors can themselves be so catastrophic so productive of gore on the auditing room floorbent cans dented meters ill put you one in by the way sideways never have steelheavy steelauditing electrode just never use them never use them refuse to use them at r6 and so forth refuse to use them as pc refuse to use them as an auditor you want something light something light i have seen an auditing can go thirtyfive feet in nontrajectory course id never have anything that if it hit in the face would do any damage as an auditor thats the first method of studying the handling of arc breaks thats the first step the first step is not how to handle an auditing cycle ive really seen them go up in smoke man pc cant help it so assessment can produce some of the most flaming arc breaks that it totally obscures the fact that there might be another source of arc breaks you see one isone is viewing the spectacular whos going over here and look at this flower bed with these pink flowers in it you see when theres skyrockets going up in the air going bang you see but unfortunately that little pink flower bed over along the side there is very often the reason why youve got so many rockets going up in the air you made misassessment because the pc was out of communication in the first place but that isnt the sole reason for it now withnow let make this plain to you with the comm cycle in perfectly with the auditor and pc in the very best of rapport with all going along swimmingly the good indicators can go out faster than stopwatch could measure it everything can go out and go down the drain on bad assessment ill give you an idea the pc sitting there and the auditors calling off skwumperjacks and piddleboofs and so forth and hes going on down the list and he gets down to the bottom of the list and nothings read so he says to the pc please continue the list what batterboof would cuppawup and the pc gives him few more and maybe the auditors got his head down looking at the piece of paper and so doesnt watch the firstyou cant have your eye on the pc all the timedoesnt see the first dawning crashes of whats happening here and your first intimation is the rising strident tone of the pc talking about something you werent talking about moment or two ago you see you might even have as your first warning two cans flying through the air see or being thrown down or something of the sort because the pc can be took quick its particularly true on goals goals of course have many times the power of items but items man ive seen an item drive pc straight up over the crest and into sad effect in less time than i could possibly catch up the reins anyplace you know the reins are just dragging along the road and youre just trying to pick them up pick them up pick them up and you just cant get them picked up well theres two sources of the arc break the most violent of them of course is you bypassed the pcs item on the list youve just gone down past skutterwups and marked it out and this doesnt catch up until you ask the pc to continue the list well thats purely bypassed charge in the bank that wasnt anything else going wrong youll find now the auditing cycle goes wrong youll find everything goes wrong assessment becomes impossible and usually the only thing the pc will sit still for is some kind of an assessment on the bypassed charge the pc will usually sit still for that youre very foolish to argue with pc or do anything with pc but try to locate the bypassed charge in an arc break you must not audit during an arc break you must know that too i mean its absolutely deadly to audit during an arc break you mustnt address remarks to the pc you mustnt ask the pc anything you mustnt ask the pc for his considerations of anything you just must not thats all auditing well what do you think this arc breaks well take pistol and blow your brains out man well what have been your considerations in this session with oh what the hell strychnine is quicker yeah i see from your faces that you didnt realize in that last one i meant exactly what i saidthat you never never never audit in the presence of an arc break and i meant just that you never ask the pc single question nor do you acknowledge anything the pc says you dont do you see its one of these all propositions see you do not audit during an arc break what is auditing auditing is the process of asking question that the pc can answer you see just the standard definitionyou just must not audit during an arc break now somebody sooner or later is going to take that that you mustnt assess either thats all you do you assess if youre so confused you dont know which end youre standing onand thats very easy because i frankly have sat dropjawed looking at the meter trying to figure out what happened because there didnt seem to be any obvious source for an arc break here see what i mean but nothing that we had been doing would have provoked this particular arc break trying rapidly to go through my skull trying to find out if i have filed away any bits and pieces of missing good indicators or something in the session that something dropped someplace something has gone something has gone awry something has happened here and so forth and i tell you you look awful silly sitting at meter with your jaw dropped and it doesnt promote the pcs morale at all to have silent auditor sitting in front of him so if you find yourself confused you use the one thing that will give you control of the situation you take break that requires answer doesnt even require the pc to take break he doesnt even have to follow your orders he very often doesnt he just sits in the chair and fumes and if you find youre not immediately and smoothly and gracefully going into gear here and shuffling the right assessment downits all assessment from here on its not to the pc any part of it is this session arc break is this r6 arc break bypassed charge from r6 bypassed charge from the session thats all metered stuff you dont care what the pc says yes it was i told you while ago goddamn it i told you that you didnt acknowledge that communic thats all had nothing to donothing to do with anything nothing to do with it at all youre just going to get in trouble with that so you leave it alone long experience has taught that you cannot communicate with somebody who is out of communication you find yourself in any kind of state of mind or any kind of guesswork is going on here whereby you immediatelydont directly and immediately reach for the sheet and start your arc break assessment in spite of any action taking place that flaming arc break is going on and the only thing you can do is assess and all you do is assess and you do not audit and if you find yourself in condition of confusion as an auditor as to what you should do or what its all about or burning under the collar because of all the mean vicious things this pc is saying or anything else your response of course is just take break and go walk in the room or go out in the hall and dont keep talking to the pc dont stay near the pc see see youre just going to aggravate that arc break and just go out and figure out what the hell went on and all of sudden in your state of shockbecause the auditor very often gets into state of shock about something like this it happens quick hes all inhes interiorized into what hes doing the next thing you know hes looking at an arc break what happened oh well let see now i was doing list and i asked the pc to extend the list yes yes thats what was going on now lets see and then there was arc break before this last list there was arc break before the last list must be this list all right now theres only three things can be wrong with list its from wrong source i have bypassed the item on the list or the list is incomplete and any one of the three will produce an arc break all right thats probable thats probable what it is all right sail back on into the session you can tell the pc something you can inform the pc say im going to do this assessment nownot may i do this assessment now thats an auditing question see im going to do this assessment now all right pick up the cans all right are we listing from wrong source have i bypassed your item on the list is the list incomplete none of the three of them read take break dont stay in there arguing with that pc man youre just put its about as safe an action as pouring kerosene on fire to get it out see and you say oh i better do full assessment session arc break r6 arcsession arc break i dont remember anything happening you know to yourself all right heres the session and so on and soandso and so andso and soandso and soandso and soandso an earlier reality has beenan earlier break in reality has been restimulated the bypassed charge here is an earlier break in reality has been restimulated thats easy to see oh yes that session last tuesday recognize at that point that communication and auditing is now possible dont keep pushing at it say all right okay feel better now yeah i feel all right now im sorry i yelled at you so loud and so forth all right good now ive got to ask one more question is there anything wrong with this list were doing theres nothing wrong with the list at all go on null the list find the pcs item on it and thats it youre left stonied by these things sometimes the most obvious thing staring you in the face eventually youll find out there was reason for it at the end of the session something like that he may sayor month later you might possibly remember offhandthat the item that you were listing for was the same item that he had arc broken on two weeks before you see or there that item was on the list the wrong item that hed been given as wrong item two weeks beforethat had caused an arc break two weeks beforehad reappeared on the list you were nulling and you had just recalled the item which restimulated the earlier arc break and break of reality dont you see and he momentarily thought of telling you that is the same item but then didnt want to interrupt you and instead just went into complete arc breakjust went out of control just that fast see see theyre very very tortuous and complicated these things thats the way you handle them thats the way you handle these things handling of arc breaks has to do with assessment the meter wont read during an arc break on anything except what is causing the arc break it is fortunate that meter will read on that because the meter is shut off during an arc break on all fronts except the thing which is causing the arc break and the meter will read on that fortunately otherwise youve got dead meter during an arc break because the pc wont take any communication from you hes protecting his bank from you hes doing everything under gods green earth there and you dont get through you wont get anything through on your meter but oddly enough the reason for the arc break is sitting right on top and it will read then if the arc break isnt totally cured and youve found some bypassed charge for the arc break then youd better suspect first that there is another source of arc breaktheres another bypassed charge here and that it very well may be session break is sitting on top of the other break see youve found bank case break you see and then youve found aeverything didnt go all wonderful at once then youd better suspect either youve found the wrong ease charge or its session charge or something youve not selected out the thing right in the first place you will find when you get very experienced on this that there is always reason and that you can always keep going till youll find it but lot of times early on you will simply despair of this you will say ah well i couldnt figure out reason on it cant get the meter to read on anything i just saw an auditor doing this the other night and all of sudden is there an incomplete auditing cycle in this session the meter all practically came apart at its pins from being totally dead still needle see bzzzz were in action indicated its the bypassed charge that was the end of the arc break the auditor doesnt ever in doing an arc break assessment doesnt ever audit even to this extent is that the arc break what are you doing youre doing r2h r2h is not arc break assessment r2h is process which uses the auditing cycle to assist in the location of bypassed charge and its all done by auditing cycle there are two ways of doing r2h one is with auditing cycle only you use list but you ask the pc is it this is it that is it the other thing and the other one is you just do straight piece of assessment youll find the most successful of theseif r2h were being done in the hands of the relatively unskilled auditorthe most successful is to keep the communication cycle in all the time and do assessment of any kind whatsoever with r2h dont assess with it say all right on that upset you had with norma there do you think that was breakdown in affinity and the pc says well yeah it could have been i dont think so well all right was it breakdown in reality i dont think so was it breakdown in communication well i dont know i dont know well well all right was it caused by an earlier breakdown in affinity see youre asking the same questions you see you eventually get down you find out it was an earlier breakdown of communication had been restimulated pc oh he remembers this he tells you all about it and the arc breaks gone thats not assessment thats process now you could do r2h with an assessment you could sit back and you could go putterputterpow wadadada affinity reality communication earlier affinity or earlier communication well that reads all right ive got here something that reads and you start throwing in your auditing cycle again but youre asking the auditor to shift his gears from assessment over and youll find out that theyre not too successful at it early on see best thing to do is just stay in communication with the pc and do just auditing cycle because thats the one that can go out the easiest so stay with it so r2h has nothing to do with this but youdin an arc break in real honesttogod arc break where youre working onenot working past arc breaks as you are in r2h you never audit right thats never man thats spelled never and its capital n capital capital v capital capital r it is underscored and then underscored under the whole thing you have the wavy line that means italics you dont audit dont audit during an arc break youll find that your trouble in handling arc breaks inevitably and invariable is because you are trying to audit during the presence of an arc break and you just must not do it if you do it very much youll drive the pc into sad effect pretty grim the pc is still trying to make this point something has gone wrong the pc is still trying to get control of himself hes stillhe cant answer up sensibly he feels that life is going bzing and he feels himself disintegrating you know and now youre giving the additional burden of having to handle communication and so forth and he will it doesnt matter whether hes talking or not talking hes not in communication thats for sure and youll find out that hell go right by the boards just as slick and neat as you can be if you talk to him on an auditing cycle or try to tell him anything or try to reason anything with him or try to get anything out of him or make any sense out of what hes saying and so forth it can only be done as an assessment after youve located and indicated the bypassed chargeyou see youve just made these two statements to the pc youve located it on the meter and you indicate it to the pc that that was the bypassed charge all right having done so youll see the arc break evaporate the arc breaks evaporate you can of course return to auditing but you never audit as long as theres an arc break in progress now if you get the precision thenthats just an example of thisif you get the precision with which you split assessment and auditing and get how they never encroach on each others borderlines youll be able to assess like blazes and youll be able to audit like blazes now everything from iv on up in the classes depends on accurate assessment everything depends on that and an auditor therefore must be able to assess accurately if he is having any trouble assessing its because he isnt differentiating between auditing and assessing and doing one and then the other even though he seems to be doing both of them at the same time i told you earlier doing both of them at the same time is joke its similarity youit looks like youre doing it both at the same time but by god dont ever do it both at the same time you assess when you assess you audit when you audit and this can become completely catastrophicill show you how important it iswhen the pc gets into an arc break and you try to audit during an assessment thats absolutely impossible youll practically destroy the pc trying to go on auditing in the teeth of an arc break therefore you have to know what is auditing and this is very good subject for drilling you take the materials within the last tape and this one and you take the subject materialbreak it down into its definitions and say what is this action what is the definition of this action what is auditing lot of auditors you just have to drive it home drive it home drive it home theyve still got reservation you see theyve still got reservation see they still feel that well just asking the pc this wouldnt be auditing you see or theyve got disagreement with it or something of the sort when as matter of fact its absolutes practicallyabout as obtainable as absolutes can get you just dont cross them auditing is auditing and whenever you enter in on any part of the auditing cycleyou ask the pc question you have started an auditing cycle now you must get an answer to the question and so forth of course it must be the kind of question that the pc can answer all of these other ramifications that had to do with the auditing cycle all build up in there if you do any part of these things then of course youre auditing its that exclamatory and assessing is straight from the auditor to the bank and the meter is simply reacting to the impingement on the bank the auditors impingement on the bank and an auditor can control the bank as matter of fact auditor can control the pcs bank much better than the pc can and he gets the impingement on the bank and hes getting the reaction on his meter now of course the think of the pc can also react on the meter and other things can react on the meter but hitassessing is simply the auditors impingement on the bank and its response on the meter so he can select out the most charged response and thats all assessing consists of now an auditor has to know these operations completely and has to really really know it not just you know say well of course auditings soandso and its just defined as brrrrr and assessing is soandso and just define itbrr you have to you have to know those so well that youre not in any disagreement with them of any kind whatsoever this is this and that is that and you can do or you can do b or you can do b and and you sometimes have to stop in order to do b but you never let assessing chop up the comm cycle of auditing but they are two precise different operations and being two precise different operations an auditor to be successful in the accomplishment of either one actually has to understand utterly now at class vi level youll find occasionally somebody starting in at this level will make the mistake of 100 percent assessment its so easy to do 100 percent assessment they just assess assess assess its all assessment see and they can get tone arm action with assessment and all of sudden why the case packs up well they dont complete their auditing cycles you see theysee theres auditing present in the session you can actually go to point of practically deleting all auditing from quote auditing session and expect it to be an auditing session and expect to get along easily and everybody to be happy about it whereas thats impossible so theres two different operations here and theyre each themselves until an auditor can differentiate themplingo plingo as precise chop bangthese are well its like drill like this you see the coach says bowwowop all right what action is that well thats soandso and so forth see thats auditing bwrwrw what action is that all right well thats an assessing action and so forth dont you get the idea so hesdivide it up so he can get himself doing these things one and then the other and not get them all balled up and youll find out it all goes smooth as glass its quite amazing that unless you have this piece of data great many auditors would have so much trouble assessing that they never find right level they never find right item they never find right goal and they simply wind up believing that it all doesnt quite work see of course they get the service facsimile and theyve had it because the service facsimile was actually protest of the pc of an incomplete auditing cycle which was begun halfway through the assessment of the list in which the auditor didnt pay any attention to the answer to and he got that as protest on the very next item he read which read beautifully and big and were auditing this big tough guy you see were auditing this big tough guy on service facsimile of knitting needles and it just doesnt quite hang together and his case doesnt make any progress and we wonder why see the only reason why is misassessment and the reason for misassessment was failure to differentiate between these two different operations okay audience okay thank you
