and counterterrorism in greece and minor issues this report will be updated if developments warrant introduction1 on february 4 2000 prime minister costas simitis called an early election for april 9 six months before his governments term was to expire on march 9 parliament reelected president costas stephano poulos and greece applied for membership in the european monetary union emu single currency zone simitis believed that the prospect of emu entry and his early support for the popular president would strengthen his panhellenic socialist movements pasok chances with voters especially contrasted with the opposition new democracys nd delayed decision to support stephanopoulos victory however was more difficult to obtain than the prime minister had anticipatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20575crs2 2 overall the market dropped approximately 30 between september 1999 and the election 3 the unemployment rate for 1999 was 117election the political spectrum in greece has narrowed on the farleft is the communist party of greece kke on the left is the coalition of the left the center left is represented by the panhellenic socialist movement pasok while the center right is held by the new democracy party nd there also are parties formed by splinters of the two main contestants the democratic social movement dikki which is somewhat to the left of pasok and the liberal party whose policies are essentially identical to nds political spring polan nationalist offshoot of nd did not compete in the election the campaign was dull by greek standards the most gripping issue involved the declining stock market2 prompting nd charges against the government for encouraging unrealistic expectations by small investors who suffered most and pasok attacks nd for manipulating the market by encouraging politically motivated selling nd argued that the governments performance in education health services job creation3 and crimefighting was deficient due to pasok neglect in its singleminded pursuit of joining the emu however nd too favors emu membership pasok responded with promises of 300000 jobs pension and wage increases and other benefits the lack of foreign policy debate compared to past elections was striking and may indicate popular consensus on foreign issues public interest appeared low but voter turnout was 75 election

1percent of the popular vote although pasok retained respectable edge in parliament due to weighted formula for allocating seats trend toward bipolarism manifest in previous elections was reinforced when dikki failed to gain the 3 of the vote required for parliamentary representation and almost missed the mark dikki represents pasoks mostly discarded socialist populist past while voters seem to prefer the centrist pragmatic modern pasok defectors from dikki split between those who returned to pasok and others who still resent the changes simitis had made in pasok and paradoxically chose nd on the other hand had so changed its views that they had become almost the same as pasoks voters agreeing with therefore might ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20575crs3 4 some politicians appear to agree former leader was pasoks candidate for mayor of athens in the last regional elections and defectors were included on pasoks parliamentary listswell vote for pasok4 of the small parties only the kke retained its hard core of true believers voters who wanted change from pasok and felt that 17 out of the last 20 years was long enough for it to have been in power chose nd the 43yearold nd leader costas karamanlis who has never served in government has moved his party toward the center nds views on many issues are similar to those of pasok although nd would reduce the role of the state in more sectors and more sharply than the ruling party and sometimes voices strident nationalism political impact simitis has been personally credited with pasoks victory and it appears to have strengthened his position within the party simitiss two main internal party challengers from 1996 longer challenge him minister of defense akis tsohatzopoulos has been loyal to the prime minister voicing discreet criticism on rare occasions former education minister yerasimos arsenis lost popularity attempting reforms in that troubled sector and is not in the new government pretenders to the leadership after simitis include tsohatzopoulos minister of foreign affairs george papandreou and minister of interior vasso papandreou and all fared well in the polls but simitis has current rivals on the other side nds strong showing and gains endorsed karamanliss leadership and style and may have strengthened his position within his party his potential challengers include dora bakoyianni daughter of former prime minister costas mitsotakis and shadow foreign and defense minister and the ambitious and popular mayor of athens dimitris avramopoulos who refused to rejoin nd for the election liberal party leader stephanos manos had formed an electoral alliance with nd but opted to remain independent in parliament in may karamanlis may have squandered some hardwon political capital and sparked party division by unilaterally purging rightist nd member mainly for insulting nd spokesman and karamanlis ally aris spiliotopoulos the fate of is uncertain pasok probably will continue to try to attract followers and the kke may do the same the kke base is as constant as its opposition to greeces membership in the eu and nato the party is likely to remain troublesome mobilizing street demonstrations and having an impact greatly disproportionate to its electoral strength it is the main voice of antiamericanism and led opposition to the nato campaign against yugoslavia and to president clintons november 1999 visit to greece government appointees and program simitis has retained his heirs apparent in their same powerful positions foreign minister papandreou defense minister tsohatzopoulos interior minister papandreou and finance minister yannos papantoniou the major cabinet change and political shock is the absence of the brilliant ambitious and outspoken former minister of

more than 2 above the three best eu inflation performers for one year see crs report rl30107 european monetary union and the united states an overview by arlene wilsonevangelos venizelos who rejected the ministry of justice because it lacks high profile regarding issues of public interest simitis brought back the equally outspoken former foreign minister theodoros pangalos who had resigned in february 1999 over the ocalan fiasco5 and became party gadfly pangalos is now culture minister simitis also placed close allies and technocrats in other posts essential to fulfilling his election promises notably the ministries of labor health education development and transport the prime minister has personally assumed responsibility for shaping up greeces lagging preparations for the 2004 olympics an issue of national honor the last simitis government6 had remarkable record of economic achievement in meeting the emu convergence criteria7 it cut inflation from double digits and reined in deficit spending the new government faces public expectations that it will address domestic agenda on health education employment and social security reform it must also work to ensure that the olympics are successful all these programs require heavy public spending at the same time however greece will be constrained by the emu criteria even after it enters the emu in january 2001 public debt is already 104 of gross domestic product and simitis promised tax cuts not rises which eliminate borrowing and taxes as sources of funds the government hopes to find resources in economic growth european union funding budget surplus and revenue from the privatization of state power telecommunications and other enterprises and banks unions socialist stalwarts and communists will likely oppose each offering simitis faced down opponents in his first term and will likely have to do so again foreign policy including relations with the united states turkey foreign minister papandreou has pursued rapprochement with turkey greeces traditional rival popular goodwill has supported this initiative in december 1999 greece chose not to oppose european union eu decision to affirm turkeys candidacy for membership greece and turkey subsequently aided each other during devastating earthquakes in summer 1999 they cooperate in the balkans and have reached agreement on nine socalled lesser subjects such as environmental cooperation maritime safety and educational exchanges business ties are flourishing in early june 2000 greece and turkey successfully participated with 10 other countries in natos dynamic mix exercise in northern greece and the aegean with turkish troops landing on greek soil for the first time however the two governments have deferred discussion of aegean sovereignty and cyprus issues at the crux of their antagonism greekshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20575crs5 8 turkish officials have not indicated willingness to make gesture some believe that turkey had made one when it stopped blaming greece for its role in the ocalan affair and observe that greece never apologized others argue that greece had choice in december 1999 but to go along with the will of the eu majority on turkeys candidacy still others remark that the rapprochement has been reciprocal noting turkish foreign minister ismail cems actions and turkeys signature on agreements alongside that of greece some turks want to reopen halki for reasons unrelated to greeces eu vote but see obstacles caused by disparate governing coalition partners and parliament 9 see crs report rs20149 kosovo greek and turkish perspectives by carol migdalovitz 10 greece turkey italy albania fyrom bulgaria romaniagenerally are troubled by what they consider turkeys obstinacy on these matters and some greek commentators are annoyed by the lack of turkish gesture to reciprocate greeces eu decision they have suggested that suitable act might be the reopening of the greek orthodox seminary on the island of halki or rescinding the casus belli8 the latter refers to turkeys 1994 decision to go to war should greece claim territorial sea of 12 nautical miles in the aegean turkey contends that an extension of greeces territorial waters from six to 12 miles would transform the aegean into greek lake greek officials themselves rarely seek turkish gesture and say that turkeys conformity to eu membership criteria and international legal standards over time will lead to the resolution of major bilateral issues it is uncertain however how long the patience of public opinion molders and the public will last balkans greece aims to play pivotal role in promoting balkan stability through economic development and democratization in 1999 the government committed 320 million for reconstruction efforts in southeast europe greek businesses are major investors in the balkan countries and the government encourages their expansion throughout the region greece has good relations with its balkan neighbors it is trying to compromise with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom in an ongoing dispute over the fyroms name which stems partly from the fact that macedonia also is the name of northern greek province the dispute has been superseded by marked advances in trade and investment since 1995 compromise accord on related issues normalized relations meanwhile athens is attempting to distance itself from the milosevic regime in belgrade and in move that is controversial at home has reached out to milosevics domestic political opponents greece has cordial ties with albania despite anxiety that the unsettled situation in kosovo could lead to greater albania9 greece insists on the inviolability of borders in the region and may be greatly concerned should trends toward the independence of kosovo or montenegro accelerate greek troops are serving in bosnia albania and in the us sector in kosovo greece is member of the southeast europe brigade seebrig sevennation regional task force10 and of the southeast european cooperation initiative seci that seeks to normalize regional trade europe the simitis government maintains that greeces expected entry into the emu next

purchase 10 more for more than 2 billion us companies are major investors in greece and bilateral trade is growing with the balance favoring the united states11 difficulties in the relationship are few but irritating us officials have repeatedly criticized greece for its failure to counter terrorism12 more antiamerican terrorist incidents occurred in greece than elsewhere in europe in 1999 most were bombings or threats against us government and private interests the revolutionary organization 17 november is believed to be the main perpetrator the us state department reported that terrorists act in greece with impunity as terrorists have been arrested convicted or sentenced and plans for modernization of counterterrorism police have not been implemented the congressionallymandated national commission on terrorism recommended that the department consider putting greece into the not fully cooperating category of countries and imposing stringent sanctions as an incentive to improve its inadequate responses to terrorism the administration said that it is not considering sanctions the greek government views the us assessment as unfair and some greeks suggest that fulfilling us demands would infringe on greek sovereignty somewhat related issue involves greeces ineligibility for the us visa waiver program13 greece does not meet requirements for machinereadability of passports and perhaps compromises us law enforcement interests because of its poor performance in counterterrorism and border controls twentynine countries including all other eu members participate in the program and some in greece question its continuing exclusion periodically greek violations of us intellectual property rights also surface as bilateral issue for its part greece seeks to have the united states play more assertive role in resolving the cyprus issue by pressuring turkey to compromise and to prevail upon the turkish cypriots to do the same greek accusations that washington values its relationship with ankara more than its ties with athens however have become less common
