engram chain running lecture given on 11 june 1963 thank you well how are you audience fine thank you good this is what audience june the 11th june 10th audience 11th eleventh i lost day all right 11 june ad 13 saint hill special briefing course now this lecture todaythis lecture todayreminds very interestingly of 42 aberdeen road and elizabeth new jersey 1949 bay head new jersey quite reminiscent because this lecture concerns engrams and i finally found out why you cant run engrams thats an awful slow take on my part theres been something wrong with the communication the communication of the matter and i finally found out youve been trying to run engrams and you never run engrams you run chains of engrams so well call this technology which im giving you engram running by chains well understanding that nobody ever successfully ran engrams any other way this is the way i ran engrams back in 1949 let tell you where it got crossed up oh i fancied this up this is very simple these days because weve got tremendous technology i can give you very closeto rote series of actions that are very easy to do let tell you where this got fancied up you got it crossed up with repetitive processing flatten the process so naturally you have to flatten the engram dont you hmmm you only have to flatten the chain you dont have to flatten the engram you flatten the chain but repetitive processing is what raised its ugly head and got you all mixed up on running engrams flatten that process the way out is the way through you know that kind of thing so you apply that to single engram youre in mess promptly for several reasons because it is only part of chain of similar incidents which in itself is only part of time track which has all sorts of incidents on it and youre essentially running time tracknot stick not chunk of something these things are all related so therefore all engrams are handled as parts of chain of similar incidents and you never handle an engram all by itself because they dont exist all by themselves ive already said its part of chain and the chain is part of time track how can you handle it all by itself its too closely related to these other two things to be so handled now if it were just one item like hunk of mud or something you could bring it in and mix it in water and precipitate it and so forth and then youd pick up another hunk of mud and handle it in some particular way and then pick up another hunk of mud and handle it in some particular way well that would be relatively easy but unfortunately the hunk of mud is chain of engrams is never single engram youve got to handle this thing as chain and part of chain now if you are skilled auditor you can pick up bypassed charge you know why the pc is arc breaking you can find it out in fast hurry pc arc breaks bang either you know what youre doingknow what just must have happenedor you can shake it out of the meter in an awful hurry and locate it and indicate it and the arc break will cease and until you have reality on being able to do this as an auditor youre going to have very upset sessions because the pc will arc break inexplicably you wont ever be able to find out why hes arc breaking youll have the trouble that we used to have in the old days where we had to have process for an arc break well it might have gotten to it and it might not have gotten to it and it was random but now we could immediately and directly locate the bypassed charge that is causing the pc to arc break now thats very very important to engram running because the bypassed charge is always the earlier incident on the engram chain and you bypass the earlier incident on the engram chain you get an arc break this is elementary my dear watson charge there by the way will be quite few bulletins out on this two have already been writtenenormous thingsand therell be another bulletin on the material im giving you today and these will be dressed up and put out into new book on the subject this lecture is the first release of this material therefore im not releasing all of this material im not telling you that in order to run an engrami can tell you this but not elaborate on it let say thatin order to run an engram youve got to know what the time track is and be able to handle the time track you should know what youre trying to handle in terms of charge what is charge now the charge of course is that electronic pingbang that hits the pc in the blonk and causes him to go bunk or blows and causes him to get better see you pays your money and you takes your chance on charge you either release the charge and the pc gets better or you encyst and stir up the charge and the pc blows his stack you get thetheres two roads by which you can travel on charge and theres middle ground there isnt any middle ground just forget the fact that you could go on and grind for eighteen years and get change on the pc the pc will either get better or get worse he wont remain the same now what do we mean by getting worse actually he might think better and feel worse you get the idea his knowledge has increased but the charge is still knocking his ead off now you can get into that situation in engram running you can lay open tremendous amount of engramengramic information he can get all kinds of informationyou never blow any charge off of it anyplace well thats because you werent looking for basic you were looking for information many an auditor falls for this because the pc wants to know how come he was on the planet yukzuk in railway conductors uniform you see what was he doing there and thats all very interesting and we can assuage his curiosity to some degree but if we go in for just assuaging the curiosity of the thingdramatizing watching tv or something like that you seewe unfortunately get into the situation where were not following down an engramic chain so here you see is another great liability in running engrams we get so absorbed in dramatis personae and that sort of thing that we actually arent running the chain of engrams at all we are simply trying to find out see get that as liability because it is liability you actually can find out all about what this pc was doing on the planet uk zukyou could find out all about it the only trouble is the basic on it was on the planet panwan which was trillion years earlier you see so engram handling is engram handling in that you want the chain of engrams which lead to the basic of that chain you want to go down that chain and get the basic of the chain why well every time you run an engram you open up little valve we have big joke around saint hill about the weather valves workmen and i are always talking about these weather valves and they get stuck open and they get stuck shut and various other things happen we have our opinions as to whos doing it we think its profumo now and so forth well if you could imagine an equally hypothetical series of valves one between each pair of engrams see so lets take basic on the chain thats engram 1 and then we get 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20a little valve between each one of these pairs see all right you run number 20 on the chain and you unwittingly open the valve from number 19 and the charge contained in number 19 restimulates and leaks to some degree into 20 so youre trying to run the charge out of 19 by running 20 the charge is coming from 19 after certaina very short period of time its all coming from 19 now well now this is very interesting because it poses this kind of condition number 20 if you continue to run it gets sticky solid meter action ceases tone arm action on running it theres nothing on it you see its just gum or its getting more and more solid and itll eventually collapse on the pc whats making it collapse well its the charge in 19 and you could run 20 endlessly without ever taking any charge off 19 but this makes 19 potential bypassed charge so the pc will arc break do you see that now you opened the valve and then didnt do anything about it so the thing to do is to find outby the way you dont have to find 19 which is quite interesting you can sometimes find 16 but let us just keep it in an orderly progression here and we find 19 now oddly enough until we found 20 we couldnt have found 19 because its as though we had big barrier across the track its all the charge there in 20 dont you see prevents us from seeing 19 and this is very funny thing we can say give us the earliest engram on this chainthis is inevitableand they give you number 20 see and the emeter only registers on 20 and 20 will register that this is the earliest incident on this line itll do this consistently you see because the track is barriered the emeter the reality nothing else can get back of 20 so youalthough youve asked for the earliest thats true of the earliest part of the incident you see you always get more first part of the incident you see you can always find few minutes earlier on an incident well similarly right on down to basic why you can always find an earlier engram see even though your meter kept saying that it was the earliest engram or even though the pc and the meter said that it was the earliest part of the engramthat nothing like this ever happened beforeas soon as we sweep some of this debris away well we find out were looking at number 19 its now the earliest see and itll continue to be the earliest till we clean it up bit and as soon as weve cleaned it up bit weve got number 18 and as soon as we cleaned 18 up we now find the absolutely regrettable first incident on this line and what do we find we find 17 and that is absolutably the first incident on this line and we get 16 you see what i mean now if you recognize some of thesetheyre terribly interesting but awfully simple idiotic points if you could take hoseif you could take piece of garden hose or something of the sort and put clamps on it see and put block of wood across it and say this is an engram number 20 you see now run this engram and then loosen up this little clamp and you will see that the water pressure which youve gotten into the hose you seeit is in each one of these balloons along in the hose sectionswill go into 20 from 19 see its just as fluidy and fundamental as that you know its like pouring beer steins back and forth into one or the other but the charge always flows late charge always goes later doesnt go earlier now its quite interesting many of these manifestations but if two things come together two pictures come together then there is bypassed charge in other words if two engrams collapse or two pictures collapseno matter what youre running in auditing this is true of all auditing by the way it isnt specialized subject you got this bypassed charge itll cause two pictures to come together for instance youre looking therea pc is looking at lamppost and all of sudden theres another lamppost standing alongside it and he knows theyre not the same picture because they have different periods of architecture and so forth and he says theres two lampposts here the first thing the auditor knows is that charge has been bypassed see thats what causes the collapse got that now thats the first thing he knows see whatever else he knows he knows that now if charge has been bypassed whats the pc going to do in the next few minutes hes going to arc break yeah sun rises sun sets bypassed charge pc arc breaks okay very inevitable so this tells you why some auditorssome auditors are capable of running smooth sessions and some auditors arehave arcbreaky sessions well its just to the degree that some auditors pick up bypassed charge and some auditors dont pick up bypassed charge see thats the difference between this arc break and arc break session all right now outofvalencenessyou know thats over thereis also problem in bypassed charge you will get this in running an engram and you shouldnt make mistake because this outofvalenceness is quite interesting the engram he is in if an earlier engram is tappedyou see hes in engram 20 and youve just clipped or tapped number 19 and its bled charge now into 20it will simply cause beefup of the mass you see and itll cause strengthening of the somatic and that sort of thing but it probably wont cause an outofvalenceness an outofvalenceness is missing earlier portion of the same engram you are working see he starts getting twopictureness hes getting two pictures that sort of thing thats probably out of 19 you understand but it also may be in 20 but for sure if he goes out of valence you havent picked up the beginning of 20 theres another five days at the start of 20 we know it was the beginning because the pc said so in 20 we know that was the start of 20 because we sent the pc to the beginning of it and he takes look at himself and he says im way out of valence here that is to say im over there well he didnt go to the beginning of it thats all theres more beginning on this engram than he has suspected and thats whatthats the charge that normally throws them out of valence but that outofvalenceness is also assisted by bleeding charge up from 19 you understand what i mean by outofvalenceness thats very simple thats very elementary just as though you were four feet over looking at your body sitting in the chair that is the position the pc is running from and you find some pcs are totally in this all up and down this lifetime they never can have any picture in which they are quote in their own valence unquote see theyre always out of valence all the way up and down the line this case by the way also falls too low on the reality scale to run engrams but this happens to any pc they flip out of valence well what happened well theres another earlier piece of this same engram is missing and the pc gets couple of pictures collapsed on one another or pictures collapsing well youve opened the valve on 19 without finding 19 actually all this sounds very complicated but actually isnt complicated youre dealing with charge and if you regard charge as water or cream or something like that it behaves in exactly the same way it flows and it always flows later charge doesnt run back down the track it runs up the track water falls charge rises about the only difference all right now lets look at this weve got pc he its his ead it gives him eadache so we run the engramnow lets take an elementary thing see were bugged see on the subject that if you get your hands on something you must flatten it see if you get your hands on an engram you must rub it out see all mixed up with flatten the process dont you see they wont recognize that this well now lets look what happens here so he it his ead so we find out wed better run this engram in which he it his ead so we roll up our sleeves and we start in eighteen hours later were still getting him walking into the cupboard and raising up too suddenly and banging his head on the door and for some reason or other the pc is getting very unhappy and the cupboard is getting more and more solid in the picture and then it gets gummier and gummier and then its collapsing and so onthe pc is pretty natterybut you say look ive got to run this incident and the pc finally goes into apathy gets too far downscale to have headache and youve cured his headache now get that approachget that approach now compare it to this approach pc has it his ead and he has eadache you say all right good good we block this incident out he walked into the pantry and hit his head on the cupboard all right fine we start him into the pantry we bring him through the moment he hit his head and for some reason or another he just skips that whole section his head comes nowhere near the cupboard but we get him afterwards holding his head now whats this all about well this means youve hit chain of engrams called it on the ead and why is that area where he cant hit his headwhy is that missing well the prior charge on being hit in the head is too great thats all thats simple so you dont try to force him through and you dont need any interesting tricks to push him through it you find that was 20 see just find 19 and block 19 out and we find out that he was working in the carpentry shop and raised up too suddenly one day and it his ead theres somatic there either see i mean its just all sort of you know thud and then we findwe just get that bang and we get thatrun him through it this is all done very formally it isnt asking any questions like straightwire see we zip him through it were moving the time trackdress parade situation see we get him there to 18 we find at 19 that theres an 18 and there18 theres 17 thats the first time he ever hit his head see was 17 and then we find 16 and then we findsee and were lucky and we actually do find all the way down the chainwe find its in this lifetime thats why we were lucky because we just started out to cure headache and by golly we find him falling out of his perambulator with dull thud see and it runs with full somatics full perceptions and we run it through and we run it through and we run it through and we run it through and we run it through and its all getting thinner and thinner and its less and less and its disappearing disappearing nothing is toughening up and with clank thats the end of that chain of being hit on the head well what happens the engram disappears we bring him back up to present time all these other headhitsyou could touch on each one of those too if you wanted to hed get the clonk from each one of them you hit him on the head all the way to present time every one of them would hit see and thats the end of this chain and thats the end of his headache see that now if we tried to approach it we are going to run the engram of him hitting his head we have made an error by saying the engram we have to say the engrams of him hitting his head now great deal can be said snarlingly and meanly and viciously and so forth about what terrible things auditors have done with running engrams but the truth of the matter is i take full responsibility on the matter ive pretty well desensitized that goal in the helatrobus implants to be responsible but i actually hadnt made an adequate communication youll find all about basics youll find all about this type of mechanics in other material on engrams but you wont find this differentiation repetitive processes ah yes flatten them always an engram the only way to flatten an engram is to flatten the chain of engrams so the communication factor is is you dont run an engram you run an engrams see youve got to run chain every time now if youve done any sec checking and had any difficulty sec checking at all its because you werent running on the basis of the earlier overt now overts will follow this and its very good training finding overts very good training but the second that we lay training restriction on it of run only overts in this lifetime we of course have inhibited the possibility of picking up the complete overt chain well this lifetime of course is the biggest lie of all persons life is quite consecutive and the first time you may find actually basic on the fact of him hitting mule over the head as his overt on the fifth dynamic and you find the basic on this thing at two hundred and eightyfive trillion well you will get then all aversion to mules tearing up the overt chain dont you see now thats not an engramic chain thats just chain of overt acts but there are overt engrams so theres two types of chains theres the motivator series and the overt series and oddly enough it doesnt matter which you run because the overtmotivator sequence is itself an installed sequence oh yes thats big swindle but everybody is obedient to this particular swindle and they behave that way below certain particular level so its operable so you can use it in processing you can relieve things and actually it is so operatable that if you dont get the overts off they dont progress in other words its sort of the overts they have committed obscure the overtmotivator sequence as an installed mechanism you wont run into this overtmotivator sequence or undo it foroh my godthats way back and way deep see thats quite fundamental in livingness there are other things like obsessive creation and that sort of thing theyre equallywell the overtmotivator sequence isnt as deeply laid in as obsessive create and that sort of thing you think youve got it time after time and theres still an earlier impulse to create you see and theyre all engramic of one kind or another they contain pain and unconsciousness and implantations and so forth but an overt chain is handled exactly the same way as motivator chain we couldnt care which were running except on motivator chain you have to keep calling for an overt of this type you see and on motivator chain you have to keep calling for whatever follows its lineidentifies it now these two seldom entwine when youre running engrams because theyre so fundamental theyre hardly governed by any laws but those of livingness they are very fundamental theyre the cause effect communication formula the arc triangle and matter energy space time and significances and perceptions which of course is part of the communication formula and thats about all there is to engrams actually theyre the most elementary uncomplicated lineup that could be theyre the most fundamental the most fundamental laws of livingness are expressed on this channel and they undo along these lines so you dont have to pay too much attention to finding the overt engram to match the motivator engram and all that sort of thing oddly enough however you can switch over from motivator line to an overt line you can switch from an overt line to motivator linedoesnt matter which but i personally would never bother to run the two at once unless the pc came up with it pc suddenly looks at you studiously and says you know ive got lot of overts against hitting people on the heads well all right fire away but youre now going down an overt chain dont you see youll get the same type of hit on the head but unfortunately youve also got to clean up the motivator chain of the same thing now what point am i making here that engram running handles the most elementary laws of livingness and thinkingness follows the most elementary rules itself and is terribly fantastically uncomplicated it is so uncomplicated that youre going to overshoot it every time youll never add anything to engram running but complication isnt that an interesting observation its awful simple if i ever show you demonstration of running engrams without giving you any reasons why and so forth youd wonder how the hell this was happening because apparently nothing was happening in the session youd say whats going on the way i used to run engramsthe way i still run them and so forthruns something like this crude date very crude date order of magnitude you know eightynine trillion something like that you know little greater than eightynine trillion thats the date see takes you how long to get that see return to this incident at eightynineplus trillion all right what are you looking at okay thank you how long is this incident minutes hours days weeks weeks good two weeks greater than two weeks less than two weeks greater than four weeks less than four weeks greater than six weeks less than six weeks five weeks five weeks all right its five weeks long very good now just move on through this to the end pc ten minutes later comes up and says all right i did whats it all about well i dont know i get something or other something or other something or other all right fine all right now is there any slightly earlier beginning on this yeah theres little bit earlier beginning on it is it day before two days before day before hour before hours before four hours before five hours before all right i want you to go about five hours earlier this time all right for the beginning of the incident move to the beginning of the incident okay all right move on through the incident five minutes later pc says im there you say all right what you got now oh its sort of thrashing machine and theres this long blue andwhite thing and it goes and so on and so forth and somewheresomewhere i must have run into machinery i must have had something to do with machinerythis kind of machinery makes dizzy just like this one just like all these dodizzy all right very good were now going to date an earlier incident in which you get dizzy with machinery all right is it greater than ninety trillion less than ninety trillion here we go all right i got ninety three trillionnot quite ninetythree trillion all right move to the beginning of the ninetythree trillion incident okay what have you got there oh im just looking at this thing thats all black all right okay how long is this incident days weeks months incident is five minutes long okay fine fine all right move through to the end of this incident okay whats it all about i dont know its machine roars thats all im scared by the roar of the thing so i dump it off cliff oh all right now thisis there any earlier moment there on the beginning of this tick how much earlier does this go oh it goes three days earlier all right thats fine thats fine all right now that threeday point now move to the beginning we now have there all right good now what are you looking at oh my god theres acres of machines theyre all over the place here theyre all over the thing here all right thank you move through this incident tell when youve reached the end i sit there and try to make as little noise as possible and pc finally comes up in the middle of it and says hahaha took the thing and busted itgrrkklike big watermelon i say okay okay continue all right go back to the beginning of this incident now go to the beginning of this incident he says you know you know i dont think this is basic on this chain oh all right good good good machines that make you dizzy you see all right thats fine machine that makes you dizzyno i guess its just machines its actually not machines that make you dizzy its machines that catch you oh all right all right lets get an earlier incident here now is this earlier incident on machines that catch you later than ninetyfive trillion earlier than ninetyfive trillion and you find out its only billion years earlier than the one you got before same procedure same action on and on and on pc comes to the next session you say all right now lets pick up thiswere going to pick up this ninetyfive trillion year incident and run it now againrun it this time pc says iwhyii dondonidoni dont know i dont get anything and so forth and so on and so on i dont get the picture that i had before and so on so on so on so you say all right okay thank you thank you now since the last time i audited you is there anything you werent willing to duplicate thank you last time i audited you is there anything you werent willing to duplicate thank you since the last time i audited you is there anything you werent willing to duplicate all right that seems clean all right return to the beginning of the ninetyfive trillion year incident hows the picture now well that pictures perfect thank you all right very good move on through to the end of this incident tell when you get there you say wheres all this hepcat stuff see wheres all thisyou know and bing and what are you looking at and well is there blue sky or pink sky there well wherewhat are you doing now what are you doing what are you looking at there wherewherehave you seen anything oh cant you see anything more than house well whats in back of the house is there anything in the basement of the house whats in the center of the planet there wheres all this it isnt there theres nothing there except just these little elementary actions pc runs like baby carriage now why wont pcs do this when they dont do it well theyre at the wrong place on the program scale i gave you but you can even take dubin case and run them early enough to get before the dub but thats asking for it so youve got your arc processes and lower than that youve got your mest universe processes youve got these various things that can straighten up pc and put him into situation because let tell you this engram running is important for this reason you arent going to make an ot without it see its that important and we now have the underpinnings that we can move any case into situation where it can run engrams now all this fancy stuff developed trying to run dubins of dubs on engrams cases that were too heavily charged to run engrams whats the common denominator of that program case scale that runs from time track down to total unawareness whats the common denominator of that thing the common denominator of that thing is duplicate its right in the middle of the old communication formula years ago i used to run into case occasionally youd run him on anyoud run him on process z on monday and it wouldnt bite on tuesday but another process would bite on tuesday and on wednesday another process would bite and on thursday another process would bite what was going on with this character well i finally understood what was going on with him the duplication was missing from the communication formula he would not duplicate it was dangerous to duplicate and that actually is the swan song of this universe that which youre unwilling to duplicate tends to go on automatic you could clean up somebodys auditing in rather rudimentary fashion of course this is like all highlevel processes its not applicable because its insufficiently fundamental to reach the reality of the pc in many cases but sometime when youve given or had rough session something like that or your pc has given or had rough session somewhere else or something like this just take crack at cleaning up the auditing on this basis since you know day before that session occurred what werehave you been unwilling to duplicate what have you been willing to duplicate what have you been unwilling to duplicate what have you been willing to duplicate and just run the process flat and youll all of sudden find all the arc breaks and everything else torn out we can show you bad demonstration of auditing very bad demonstration of auditing on the tv screen youre unwilling to duplicate that and you fumble the first five minutes of your next session you get the see thats showing the bad example get the idea unwilling to duplicate is the only thing it says see all right you get the idea that you cant duplicate mest you cant duplicate engrams you cant duplicate this action you wont duplicate that continuous state of being tree let us say or something like that this becomes very obsessive begins to wear on you and you just start refusing the idea of duplicating tree and the next thing you know there you are obsessively duplicating tree because that resistance to duplication can be caved in now persons ability to duplicate is what determines their ability to run engrams because the engram itself is duplication of the actual event and where they didnt duplicate the actual eventwhere they duplicated the actual event but then the picture theyre running is an altered copy of the picture of the actual event that is dubin so theyll run through the engram and its this way and they run through it that way all engrams develop materials all engrams develop surprising changes and all engrams have little bit of dubin in one place or another you get in the middle of this thing you wonder whats the surgeon got in his hands he cant possibly have water gun you know looks like water gun you know what on earth is it it finally turns into spoon or something else hes taking your guts out with anyhow in other words things look little bit different and particularly dangerous thingspeople dont want to duplicate dangerous things very easy on this planet to give somebody bad name you know the public in general all they got to do is start riding saw and say soandso is good soandso is good soandso is good soandso is good dont you see and everybodynobody must duplicate this person you see nobody must duplicate him they all do it obsessively after while its sure mechanism of making bogymen and then making everybody into bogymen that didnt exist in the first place you see you can think up lot of things and theres lot of philosophy connected with this duplication but just add it up to what engram running is all about series of tests need to be developed for this sort of thing of whether somebody can run engrams or not the easiest way to find out whether somebody can run engrams or not is to try to run an engram on them nowand if they cant run one why youd better uncork the arc triangle thats all but theres another way to do it you say to some person one two three nine seven what did i say and he says you said uhppopcorn uh aw skip it man of course its possibility that you didnt speak loud enough for him to hear you but if you spoke loud enough and you said one two three seven nine and he said popcorn popcorn whats popcorn got to do with it well youd better not try to run engrams on that person now the person who is totally unaware has tried to whip the mechanism of obsessively duplicating everything thats his final answer dont you see only trouble is his duplications then go on total automatic and youll find people around who have very very heavy engrams indeed they are all very heavy and they have control over them of any kind whatsoever and so forth and the engrams also are very inaccurate all life is an engram anything is an engram so forth but then the engram isnt the engram they stub their toe and they go down the street and theyve got picture of being run into by truckin full 3d utterly overwhelming gruesome now you try to run an engram of stubbing their toe it isnt there they run this engram of being hit by truck well thats great because if you run the engram of being hit by truck you unfortunately arent doing the case bit of good youre just running off copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy you see i mean you could get into that kind of nonsense now because there are such incredible things on the track anywaysuch as the helatrobus implants and all sorts of thingsthat people get auuuh tell some bud of the freudian school about these things hed become very puzzled about this whole thing as matter of fact in the second series there are some tumbler devicestubes in the second serieswhere the thetan on the pole is locked up in sort of curledup position in the middle of tube with lot of lights hitting him from one quarter or another its the perfect fetal position and thats basic on the prenatals which we used to find and those prenatals all fly to pieces if you hit this basic on the thing you see but theres so much incredible material that it would be very very dangerous to determine on pc whether or not he could run engrams by what was the fact of the case see this is very dangerous weve tried this and it doesnt work so therefore you need better test and that test would be simple duplication youd give him series of questions of one kind or another the old attitude aptitude testour old driving testis doll because that gives you too little to understand and too much to understand and so forth thats lovely test person who got very bad score on that probably couldnt run engrams you see because its duplication test thats how youd findnot by the material the person runs but by the persons ability to duplicate now another test of persons ability to duplicate is on monday did they get beautiful rocket reads on gpm and on tuesday you couldnt get the needle to squick thats an interesting condition well theyve hit something theyre unwilling to duplicate thats for sure and you could probably turn it back on thats for sure and you can probably handle it thats for sure but you also are running somebody over their heads thats for sure well what are we running over their heads were just running the arc on this case this case is too queasy to approach whole lump of experience they want to sniff around the edges of life you know you let them around the edges of life dont let them around one concrete experience of being hit on the head with cleaver see let them sniff around the edges and find out if theyre alive you know let them run this thing way off and their track will straighten out and become factual that doesnt mean that youre only using the arc processes to improve somebodys reality that isnt their only use it just happens to be very good shotgun process it works at every quarter on almost anything dont you see it cleans up all kinds of things itll clean up auditing and itll clean up track and itll do this and itll do that and it can be phrased in different ways in order to meet different levels of case and you could do all kinds of things with this processthis new arc setup that you have you can also do some interesting things with this duplication process but you do the best in this physical environment what part of this physical environment what action or motion in this physical environment can the guy safely duplicate when he finds out he can safely duplicate something youve got the cchs in nutshell thats the only thing youre trying to show him thats why the cchs have such heavy power when rightly used and such weird effect when wrongly used you make somebody feel like hes being punished for duplication you run the cchs wrong way to all right so much for all that so much for all that were talking about running engrams well who can run engrams well its somebody who can get picture of the actual event now how serious is this to you well its only serious to this degree that if the case is not being successful in running engrams you probably shouldnt be running them now that i think is the most elementary adjudication that you can possibly make but lets add to this adjudication this one running them right as long as youre running them right if the case just doesnt seem to grapple with this at all and you just dont seem to do anything about it or something of that sort well youre probably running the case too steep thats the most elementary adjudication that can be made on the subject now engram running becomes very very very important to you because the helatrobus implants are actually long chain of engrams which themselves have each one basics and they tend to grab the whole track together at one point you will only be able to run on some cases as few as six gpms before you have to start running engrams because the rr will shut off the things are getting too solid thing is getting too solid in other words charge is bleeding so lets get what determineswhat determines when to go earlier first its the auditors observation that they ought to go earlierthats always first but the second oneand this must never be violatedis the pcs recognition that there is something earlier that tells you the curtain has lifted and this you never ignore and i do mean never pc can state this in thousand different ways and it all adds up to the same thing theres something earlier pc says you know i think theres another pole trap incident ahead of this now thats very blunt isnt it all right lets just find the other pole trap incident ahead of this see simple pc says i dont think this could be the last one on the chain its too late well go earlier pc says where did i get the idea that i couldnt hold onto things go earlier youre trying to get through theseyoure trying to get from 20 to 19 and what is the last signal what is the last signalthe signal that you just must not go beyond in running number 20 or number 19 or number 18 in its turn the signal that you must not ignore is the inference that theres something earlier because if you ignore this and continue to scrub away on the one you are on you are ignoring the fact that something went down there and opened that little valve and that charge is coming up here from now on and that charge is going to make the engram that you are trying so arduously to rub out more and more solid more and more arduous less and less runnable youve got to get back here and find number 19 now the second you find number 19 the charge that was leaking up goes ffttt thats charge off dont you see but the later an engram is on the track the less charge you can bleed out of it itself now charge of course is registry of the emeter what is the registry on the emeter well its the motion of your tone arm the motion of your needle youre getting tone arm motion running these engramsif youre not getting any tone arm motion running these engrams just hope you can get back early enough to get some tone arm motion if you never get any tone arm motion on it all the way back brother youre taking charge off the line at all you are just restimulating mass and charge youre just restimulating youre not blowing anything that condition i dont think however will obtain very usually with you you willyou will get little blows of one kind or another those portions of the time track which have had the individual so much at effect that the person could not at all be cause and attended by pain and unconsciousness are called engrams and the only way an engram is ever torn up is by relieving the thing which holds it in place and the thing that holds it in place is always number 1 theres 20 engrams in chain if you cant find number 1and you can find number 1 if you go down the chainbut if you dont even try to find number 1 and then dont erase number 1 then that chain will not blow up but youll see some of the funniest concatenations of charge release you ever wanted to see when you finally put your paws on number 1 and scrub it out real good number 1 erases the rest do not now because of the complex nature of the time track there will be some portion of number 1 addressed to something else or some other subject which may in itself not erase now youve got new chain of engrams running back from number 1 well go ahead run it back dont get the idea of an absolute basic theres only one absolute basic on the time track and that is called basicbasic and its going to take you long time to find that one thatsbasicbasic is unburdened with steam shovels and gangs of coolies and working for lord knows how long the ants that were emptying that granarythats very good example fortunately if you go ahead at it in very businesslike fashion you will eventually find basicbasic the character of basicbasic is something i neednt go into at the present moment but it contains these impulses which eventually became aberration now i want to call to your attention just rapidly here some data there are two things you can do with dating you can relieve charge or just identify something now if you get total dating it goes on down to the second its how many you know trillions hundreds of billions hundreds of millions hundreds of thousands thousands hundreds days minutes seconds ago and if you get that accurately and in argument with your pc youre going to have pc there who uhwuhh he gets somatics and the thing rights itself on the time track and thats all very interesting thats that type of dating its to relieve charge you put something accurately on the time track and youll get charge off well thats fine and as an activity is quite an interesting activity in itself but remember that dating also contains identification you want to know about the incident that was eightynine trillion four hundred and fifty million years ago so you say plus or minus and youve got one that was almostalmost seeeightynine trillion four hundred and fifty millionyouve got one that was slightly more than eightynine million and four hundred and fifty billion or something like that see and you just identify it and sometimes your identification is as clumsy as that ninetytrillionyear incident of course youre only hung when theres eight in row so then you have to get into ninety trillion and you have to date these into the hundred millions or something like that sometimes you have to date them into the hundred thousands but thats differentiation mostly mostly you will be satisfied with your trillions see you say well that incident that was not quite eightynine trillion years ago thats dating thats sufficient that identified it dont you see fine nothing wrong with that now let give you this operation of blocking it out this is known as blocking out an incident and it has just exactly these steps its very precise action you identify it by date thatsyou get the approximate date of the thing see thats an identification by date you move the time track to that date but of course your dating has already moved it there you ask the pc whats there and the pc says nothing i cant see nothing pc says green cats pc says solidblack automobiles are stacked around their license plates are number 869 942 747 815 and theres dc plate over on the other side and so forth and thats there thats whats there and you say in every case regardless of what the pc saidand hear now hear mein every case you say good you understand you dont say anything else its very interesting the pc can say but its all black and i cant see thing and so forth and you say well theres reason to go on with that hes there hes there so its all black so he doesnt know what its all about well hell he didnt know what it was all about few minutes ago either funny part of it is time you run him through couple of timesive even seen pc blow grief charge through something they didnt know what it was all about cry all the way through the whole thing and come back to the beginning and begin to find what it was all about do all somesorts of weird things happening like this dont you see so it doesnt matter what they say this has tendency on that that does not influence the auditors action at that point next thing you do find its duration you know is this incident minutes hours days weeks months years find its duration block its duration out fairly accurately you know if the answer is days well just get the number of days dont you see dont go down to hours minutes seconds and split instants and galactic microseconds you know i mean this isthis wastes time find its duration move the pc through it through get the difference of to and through to get pc at point of the track you say move to and to get them to go through something you say through if you want them to go through something say through dont say go to the end of the incident because of course the pc just goes bang and hes at the end of the incident yeah all right im here at the end of the incident what do you want i can see auditors nowive already seen an auditor do this idiotic thingsaid well go to the beginning of the incident snap all right well im here what do you want all right now move to the end of the incident snap bang im here what do you want laughing thats pure idiocy see you want the pc to pick up the incident you had better move them through it and let assure you that if its forty days long i normally say move rapidly through the incident laughing i like to be able to end my sessions on schedule but you move them through to the end then establish what was there just ask the pc well what happened you know when they come to the end of the thing anytime the pc says anything while theyre going through the thing you say good and one more word continue you want them to realize that auditing effectcommand is still in effect when they get to the end of the thingyouve moved it through it onceyou say whats it all about funny thingthe pc doesnt talk to you its all right okay move them to the beginning of it move them through to the end again simple as that never move them backwards through one when they get to the end of the thing why ask them again ive seen pc go through one several times before they could tell anything about it thing wasnt beefing up at all just you know whats this its solid mystery dont be impatient in other words you dont vary this routine pc says i dont think i left im afraid id be more prone to say you left all right run through it see now if the pc keeps saying im stuck and all that sort of thing just forget the bouncers and denyers man youre just running somebody over his head and you get them out of it any way you can and revert to arc processes any time the pc is that much at effect where the auditor has got to kick him around inside the incident and do all sorts of weird things and that sort of thing youre simply running engrams on somebody who cant run engrams theres sense in my developing technology for somebody who cant run engrams for you not to run engrams with you get the difference all right now when hes told you all about it at the end your next step is simply to find out if anything is little bit earlier you know is there little because the end always remains the end you dont have to vary the end if theres anything more theyll eventually tell you but you dont care about it because the charge is always earlier you see but always suspect the beginning pc says well i just got off the train and there they were you know aw its all right buy it sounds all right and so forth but ask before you send them through again now is there any earlier beginning on this incident and so forth yeah he was shooting at them out the window for half an hour you see before he got off the train you see theres always that little little tag beginning and sometimes youre lucky and there is none but it just doesnt matter its whether it registers or not send them back to that earlier bit and tell them to move through it again now up to the moment you tell them to move through it again youve simply blocked the incident out now you know how long this incident is the second time you tell them to move through it is however quite perfectly safe and can be included in blocking out an incident but i just want you to know that it doesnt perfectly belong in blocking out an incident youve actually blocked the incident out now but to finish this incident off just move them through it again theyll pick up some more stuff thats the time theyre going to tell you theres something earlier and it doesnt much matter how many times you run them through an incident less than twice is suspect thats maybe little careless but might very wellif the thing appeared to be awful gummy and so forth and messed uponce would be plenty theres where judgment comes in more than twice well youre getting into questionable groundvery questionable ground trying to chug them into it and make them have more view of it or more picture or get more event out of it or do something else with it than they can do at that particular time nah verboten itll turn up in an earlier incident or you got business running engrams thats all there is to that now how long would you run one of these things i think if pc was terribly fascinated with the thing you know you know thats where i got shot and thats where i shot bill yes thats right and then this place idhmmmmhmmmhmmmhmmm and ive often wondered whether or not you know hmmhmm this funny hole in my ear all right thats dandy thats dandy im afraid id just go along with this as long as i was getting motion on my metergetting some motion on my meter had the thing going tick and tock and click and clock and bong and he was still running through the thing and wasnt wandering off into the fieldsim afraid id run that but i would never run it longer than you know i think weve had fight before all right hit the silk now if you do not bail out of an incident and find the earlier incident when the pc sights the earlier incident you spoil the pcs ability to move backyou blunt itand the pc will get tied up in this area of the track youre trying to run and the only reason pc gets tied up in an area of track is by insisting he stay there you insist he stay there he says oh god i want out of this well anybody who wants out of this youve justyouve just gone near it and he sees that theres whole bunch of threshing machines and theyre cleaning up the wounded with these threshing machines see and he says well ii cant have anything to do with that thatthatsthats too much for and so forth id say okay i let him bounce to present time and i run arc processes in other words i dont say oh come now im sure that you could confront that part of the threshing machines so forth but if pc started telling eh its getting awful solid around here pressure is getting heavier little harder to runi dont care if i was getting tone arm action or notim afraid my action would always be when did you spot something earlier oh well come to that it was about an hour ago yeah he spotted an earlier incident and i would realize that it was my fault as the auditor if the pc got tied up on the track that he couldnt get out of or was unable to run the chain and so forth because i would have refused to let him move earlier thats the one cardinal rule of this now there are several things ive tried to teach you here today and one of these youre running an engram chain youre never trying to run single engram the only reason you run basic is not to get rid of basic sometimes basic is i walked up and blew all of the powder out of the barrel but nothing happened see yes i walked upwell of course they lost the battle is the reason for itand i blew all the powder out of the barrel thats basic see thats just bzzbzzbzzbzzbzzzbzzbzzbzbz its gone its all the basic there was you look for basic to be the more powerful incident its never its the shorter incident its the simpler incident but on that keystonebecause the thetan never bothered to say that was important you seethese other things built up built up tougher tougher bigger bigger bigger you get that basic the rest of them will tear right up just like one of these patent sacks you knowa patent flour sackyou get the rightyou get the right string well here she goes all right now youre running chain so dont think because youve read book one or snapped your fingers over engrams you know how to run engrams learn this as brandnew skill and its skill which well call engram chain running and that is done by finding an incident we dont care how one of your best takeoff pointsthe helatrobus implants run few gpms then youre really making knots you see we dont care how we took off on this whether we had to prepare the case for this or not we got our paws on an engram and then we block it out and we get the earlier one and we block it out and we get the earlier one and we block it out we get the earlier one we block it out and eventually weve got nothing over here to block out we then decide that we have our paws on basic for this chain now as we now have basic for this chain this basic will erase okay so we proceed to erase the basic and tear up the chain theoretically if you kept wandering back some of you could make an error of winding up eventually with basicbasic seemed like you never got your hands on basic well you eventually did get your hands on basic but this apparently is the first engram on the track or something like this i would erase it and suspect that i had simply discovered basic you see when you discover basicbasic and erase it all engrams and pictures disappear on the pc so that is the clue to that now the next point is never under any circumstances prevent pc from finding the earlier incidentnever do it thats courting disastereven if you suspect the pc is telling you there is something earlier in order not to confront what he is going through because if hes trying to bail out of incidents because hes scared of them i would watch this performance just once or twice and then i would decide that i was misguided to be running engrams on this case and id prepare the case little bit more and get him back into running engrams later you understand now those are the cardinal points of running engrams and if you follow those things you actually will be able to develop one fantastic amount of case gain because youll be blowing charge all the way its the easiest running you ever did and the only mistake youre going to make with it is to depart from the little blockingout routine which i have given you here depart from the earlier routine you fail to realize youre running chainyoure not running single incidentand preventing the pc from going earlier when the pc spots something earlier or this mistake just complicating it up man you know the pc says ive got picture here of green house does it have gables blow your brains out boy youve done it youve done it youve finished it youve wrecked the work thats it youve had it you just opened your mouth once too often do you realize what happens youve pointed the pcs attention to large object and the rule of the largest object goes into effect instantly at that point and the pc will interiorize into that incident well you didnt want him interiorized into it what do you mean you didnt want him interiorized into it you didnt want that incident all swelled up fully charged 3d how can you make an incident fully charged and3d by making the pc look at it and look at it and look at it and examine it and examine it and then prevent the pc from going earlier and look at it and look at it and look at it and look at the largest objects in it and feel things in it and so on youre going to have universe built around this pc to point where youll never get him out of it got it well that isnt what youre trying to do if you were trying to discover the secret formulas of the kabob civilization and you got the pc into their formula security room by all means follow this process but make sure you dont do it with an ot because he hasnt got any pictures to swell up you actually could only do it safely with clear and clear is so close to an ot if youve got him to totality of clear you seethats dead easythat if you just made an ot out of him hed remember you understand so it becomes very difficult thing to stay simple enough about i wanted you to get this data because actually theres never been recapitulation of running engrams mostly because i never really had my fingers on why people had hard time running engrams and i find out theres miscommunication concerning it and ive given you that miscommunication which is just the fact that people said well if you have to flatten the process you have to flatten every engram you laid your hands on and i think thats where the whole thing broke down very easy to run them i wish you lots of success with it thank you audience thank you thank you
