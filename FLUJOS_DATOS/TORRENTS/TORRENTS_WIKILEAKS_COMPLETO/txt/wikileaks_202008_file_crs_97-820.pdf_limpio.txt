divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820russian conventional armed forces on the verge of collapse summary all quantitative indicators show sharp and in most cases an accelerating decline in the size of the russian armed forces si nce 1986 russian military manpower has decreased by over 70 percent tanks and other armored vehicles by twothirds and artillery combat aircraft and surface warships by onethird weapons procurement has been plummeting for over decade in some key categories such as aircraft tanks and surf ace warships procurement has virtually stopped this has led not only to decline in present inventory but implies longterm crisis of bloc obsol escence in the future russian government decisions and the budget deficit crisis have hit the ministry of defense very hard cutting defense spending drastically and transforming the defense ministry into residual claimant on scarce resources many experts believe that if these budgetary constraints continue for 23 more years they must lead either to more drastic force reductions or to military collapse military capab ilities are also in decline reportedly few if any of russias army divisions are combatready field exercise s flight training and outofarea naval deployments have been sharply reduced morale is low partly because of nonpayment of servicemens salaries draft evasion and deser tion are rising half the officers say they plan to quit the military in 1998 despite these problems the russian army can be formidable visàvis weak neighbors such as the baltic states russian forces ar dominant in the caucasus and moldova and are key factor in central asia but seem less useful visàvis ukraine the russian army however has little capability to threaten central and eastern europe and is longer dominant in east asia the yeltsin regime appears to have concluded that to the extent that it faces security threat it is more an internal than an external threat it has taken better care of internal security forces than the army the armed forces are becoming more politicized many us and russian specialists warn of military calamity implosion mutiny or coup if present trends continue as concern about the military crisis intensified in 1997 the yeltsin regime said military reform was t op priority plans were announced to further reduce the size of the army consolidate military services and command structures pay all military salary arrearages and move toward an allvolunteer fo rce that is more compact and mobile there is widespread resistance to the proposed reforms within the military and from opposition political parties calling into question whethe r and to what extent the reforms will be implemented estimates are that at the soonest it might take russia ten years to rebuild its conventional military capabilities compared to the cold war era the m ilitary threat to the west is greatly reduced while warning time is greatly increased there is danger however that russia might become embroiled in military conflict on its periphery that is beyond its now muchreduced capab ilities with potentially dire consequences for russian reform and for international

russians often refer to their armed forces simply as the army3 there was good deal of debate about wh ether the soviet union actually intended4 to launch such an attack and also about the quality of

instruments of ventional power projection created by the soviet union are in ruin sherman garnett senior associate carnegie endowment for international peace2 most people are aware that the russian army today is neither as powerful nor3 as threatening as its soviet predecessor of ten years ago but relatively few observers realize the full extent of the degradation of russian military capability especially in conventional nonnuclear forces for two generations nato lived with t he threat offensively configured numerically superior tankheavy warsaw pact armies that seemed poised to sweep westward through germany now that threat is not merely diminished it has4 disappeared alexei arbatov leadin g russian strategic analyst and deputy chairman of the defense committee of the russian state duma gives this assessment as recently as 1988 the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies held quantitative edge over nato of about 31 in the main wea pons of conventional ground and air forces

nato and the west to mobilize superior economic and technological res ources the discrepancy is even more alarming from russian perspective chillingly in the case of revived hostilities only nuclear weapons can be relied upon to negate this gaping imbalance5 it is difficult to exaggerate the significance of this reversal in what the soviets used to call the correlation of forces the russian army

ussr perceives itself to be thoroughly overmatched by the superpower united states which retains powerful allies in nato russia now sees itself faced with natos old dilemma nd has adopted an old nato strategy reliance on nuclear weapons to counterbalance in feriority in conventional forces6 indeed in the defense sector moscow has given the highest priority to maintaining its strategic nuclear forces it is in that category alone that russia has maintained rough parity with the united st ates although even in that area russias capability has eroded significantly recent crs report examined russian nuclear forces in detail the present study is complementary piece focused on7 conventional forces the role and status of the russian army has changed dramatically from that of the soviet era when the red army was kept out of politics but enjoyed preferential status in resource allocation and in prestige now those relations are reversed the army has become highly politicized but has low priority in resource allocation and has lost much of its prestige and pride there has been spate of conferen ces and reports about the russian military in the past year many are cited in this study clear consensus has emerged among specialists that consensus surprising to many nonspecialists is that russian8 conventional military cap abilities have been degraded to such an extent that the armed forces face the possib ility of collapse or implosion if present trends continue much longer many experts assert that the russian military threat now is more tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs3 this idea is developed more fully on p 3134 below9 many of these highly pessimistic russian assessments appeared in the winter and10 spring of 19961997 during the final phase of negotiations over nato enlargement this was not time when moscows interests w ould seem to have been well served by exaggerating russias military weakness one russian tactic during the nato talks was to float warnings of dire military consequen ces in the event of nato enlargement reports of russian military weakness tended to undermine that tactic former defense minister pavel grachev reportedly told president yeltsin in11 december 1994 that single regiment of russi an paratroopers could stamp out the chechen separatist movement in 2 hours yeltsin ordered in the army apparently confident that organized resistance would be quickly crushe d after 21 months of bloody fighting the russian army was actually defeated by chechen rebel forces and forced to leave chechnyarussia than from russia interestingly russian expert assessments of the russian9 military tend to be even more negative than american assessments these experts10 warn that the crisis in the russian armed forces could if unchecked destabilize russia politically undermine economic refo rm and jeopardize regional security many observers believe the yeltsin regime has the means to avert military collapse or upheaval if it acts promptly and intelligently decisive political leadership is needed since the military can not be expected to fundamentally reform itself in response to this crisis the ye ltsin regime proposed military reforms in mid 1997 that emphasize reorganization conso lidation and further downsizing these proposals f ace strong bureaucratic and political opposition it is not clear whether they will be implemented or if implemente d effective it is clear however that russia cannot sustain the huge militaryi ndustrial complex i nherited from the ussr this could be critical decision point military power was the primary basis of the soviet unions superpower status the russian government and russian political elites across the spectrum seem not to have fully adjusted to the new reality of russias diminished military capability even while acknowledging that the military is in crisis russian officials and politicians typically cling to attitudes reminiscent of the soviet era to the effect that russia was is and will be great power russia certainly was and probably will again be great power the problem is in the present yet even the thoughtful alexei arbatov cited above asserts that although russia is passing through deep and protracted crisis the end of which is far from sight at the same time russi remains great power its immense natural and human resources huge and established industrial base its military assets and the historical legacy of great power status attained during the soviet era all assure its status at much higher level than its present economic position would warrant one of the problems with such attitudes is that they perpetuate unrealistic views of the proper roles and missions of the russian armed forces that exceed actual military capabilities vivid example of such miscalculation was moscows use of military force in chechnya russian officers learned harsh lesson from this11 experience and strongly oppose using the army against separatists in the

armed forces in chechnya and was overruled by the kremlin13 political leaders imbued with the instinctive belief that russia is great power may be inclined toward imperial overreach tendency that could entangle russia in conflicts beyond its current capabilities w ith potentially dire consequences the most immediate threat is of conflict on russias periphery what moscow calls its near abroad ie the states of the form er soviet union conflict there could pose dangers both to russia and its neighbors russian military capabilities force deployments and military policies the prospects for russian political stability and continued reform and russias relations with other soviet successor states are issu that have importa nt policy implications for the united states these developments

officials often say 18 million most analysts pl ace actual troop strength at 1215 million the figure 1270000 from the military balance is near the low end of the range but the practice of padding unit

divisions plus scores of socalled independent brigades of unknown strength even allowing for the fact that fullst rength russian division has about onethird fewer men than its us counterpart these numbers confirm reports that most russian divisions are severely underm anned many are believed to exist primarily on paper19 the sharp decrease in russian armore d vehicles undercuts its traditional capability for offensive operations in europe the russian army has only onethird the number of tanks and afvapcs as the soviet army had in 1986 for decades heavy armored divisions were considered the sine quo non for offensive operations in central europe it was the prepondera nce of forwarddeployed sovietwarsaw pact tank armies with echelon after echelon of armored divisions in reserve that seemed to pose the gravest threat to nato today the united states actually has more afvapcs than russia compared to 31 soviet advantage in 1986 and nato enjoys clear superiority in th total number of armored vehicles russia has about twothirds the number of combat aircraft and artillery pieces as the soviet union had in 1986 us i nventories of these w eapons have declined by about the same amount

sovietrussian tonnage in 1986 and 1996 the russian navy has nothing comparable in firepower to us carrier battle group20 in contrast to its surface fleet and to most other elements of its armed forces russias submarine force appears to have been accorded relatively high priority this is thought to be due to the growin g importance of russia s ssbns to its overall strategic nuclear forces although the ra of submarine production has been cut back significantly the reduction was not as deep as for surface ships or most other defense items production of nuclear and diesel submarin continues and according to us naval intelligence the new nuclearpowered boats rival the best us submarines in overall capability the size of the russian submarine force has been greatly reduced but the eliminated

militarized large economy the world has ever seen by all quantitative measures the volume of arms produced and the physical and human dime nsions of the industrial apparatus used to produce them the soviet militaryindustrial establishment was unmatched but militarization was more than merely question of size it was process that affected the very nature of the system in both its political and economic dimensions29 contemporary russia with population nd gdp smaller than that of brazil cannot sustain the militaryindustrial complex that the militarized ussr created the yeltsin regime took what may have b een decisive step toward demilitarizing the economy when in 1992 the government led by acting pre mier yegor gaidar cut spending on military hardware by 80 percent that cut was never restored the militaryindustrial complex has been stru ggling to adjust to that unprecedented cutback ever since 30 the sharp reduction in defense spending is driven in part by the conviction that this step is absolutely necessary for ru ssias transition to market economy two other important factors are belie ved to figure prominently in this decision one is the kremlins assessment that whatever security threat it faces is primarily internal rather than external which would argue against large expensive army another is31 alleged to be unimaginable incompetence on the part of the government

main obstacles were official secrecy and the peculiarities of nonm oney economy there is much less secrecy now but the economy is in transition and from an accounting perspective in chaos it is difficult to quantify russian defense spending accurately on yeartoyear basis when the rubles exchange rate was crashing during the hyperinflation of the early 1990s while ruble purchasing power

calculations of recent russian defense34 spending the mod budget in us dollars at thenyear exchange rates was in1993 74 billion 1994 18 billion 1995 128 billion and 1996 151 billion the rubles especially the military rubles purchasing power parity against the dollar was much greater than the simple exchange rate would suggest that purchas ing power advantage however has decreased as market

this view the russian defense budget already seriously underfunded was effectively cut in half from 1994 to 1995 many russian and western analysts share this view historically such drastic cuts in defense spending occur rarely and then usually at the end of war but in december 1994 the russian government began war albeit an internal one in chechny yet the government did not allocate additional funds in the 1995 or 1996 budget for operations in chechnya the mod had to absorb the costs of chechnya in defense budget that had just been cut in half36 the mod slow to adjust to the giveandtake of

submitted to parliament in its 1997 budget request parliament cut the defense budget to 90 trillion rubles lastminute negotiations yielded compromise figure of 104 trillion rubles the russian ruble

in the first quarter of 1997 it got 53 percent of th amount authorized for that period then major40 shortfall in tax collection in 1997 forced the government to propose 20 percent budget sequestration

and in many cases have stopped altogether in june 1997 the russian gove rnment revised its economic forecast for the year from zero to two per cent growth to zero to minus two percent contraction mainly because of 25 percent decline in military industrial production in the first quarter of 1997 first puty premier anatoly chubais told the presidential council in june 1997 that the state of

are not uncommon some of the most skilled and ambitious workers especially among the younger generation are leaving defense industries for the private sector others find ways to suppl ement their income in the grey economy but many defense enterprises are clustered in provincial cities where there are insufficient alternative employment opport unities and russian labor for variety of reasons is notoriously immobile economic conditions far worse than those of the great depression of the 1930s in the united states are giving rise to desperation strikes and protest demonstrations hunger strikes are becoming commonplace more unusual and for moscow more arming manifestations are emerging for example in june 1997 workers at ma jor nuclear submarine repair yard near vladivostok who had

still stateowned defense enterprises with few if any defense contracts and little if any money to pay salaries what is surprising is that few if any defense enterprises have gone out of business defense industry expert shlykov identifies this as major though littleunderstood failure of russian economic reform the failure to demilitarize the economy for although defense spending and defense production ve plummeted the structural militarization of the economy thousands of defense plants design bureaux and research institutes with millions of employees remains huge presence albeit in many respects dead weight48 the unwieldy defense industrial sector received confusing and contradictory signals from the yeltsin regime in 19911992 the government under acting premier yegor gaidar encour aged privatization and conve rsion of defense industries to nonmilitary production though not much actual defense conversion occurred from 19931996 gaidars successors adopted more statist ttitudes toward defense industries lost interest in defense conversion and prohib ited privatization of major defense enterprises the state committee fo r defense industries key promoter of the defense sectors intere sts was elevated to government ministry in may 1996 under the tutelage of firs t deputy premier oleg soskovets champion of heavy industry and state subsidies then in march 1997 following yeltsins reelection and recovery from heart surgery westernoriented reformers regained the ascendancy led by first deputy premier chubais monetarist and ch ampion of banking interests soskovets was dismissed the ministry fo r defense industries was abolished and its duties transferred to th economics ministry controlled by chubais meanwhile some significant changes occu rred in the defense industries when the soviet union dissolved russia inherited 70 percent of soviet defense industries with 55 million employees since then ove r 25 million workers nearly half are believed to have ft the defense industries the state committee for defense industries promoted consolidation of defense enterprises from over 1800 in 1992 to fewer than 500 in 1997 but defense plants were closed in this reorganization49 prominent example of consolidation was the 1995 merger of the mikoyan design bureau responsible for the long line of mig fighter planes with mapo the moscow aviation production ssociation and its moscowre gion factories in 1997 mapomig acquired the progress aviation company which makes the new ka50 and ka52 attack helicopters as well as mil helicopters and antonov aircraft

not make up for the hundr eds of migs the s oviet air force used to buy each year in june 1997 it was re ported that mapomig had not paid its workers for 3 months and was unable to pay its suppliers contractors taxes or electric bills50 the plight of mapomig one of russi as flagship defense enterprises is illustrative of the underlying problem of the defens industrial sector although russian arms exports have increased in the past two years after falling sharply in 1992 1995 that cannot make up for the drastic reduction in government contracts the defense industries have been kept afloat by direct government subsidies and by bank loans largely engineered by the g overnment many russian banks including large commercial banks are now in trouble partly because of ba d loans to defense industries the ne w government dominated by chubais is more responsive to banking interests than to the metal eaters of heavy industry it may be willing to see large numbers of nonproductive defens enterprises close their doors this could have beneficial effect in reducing the structural militarization of the economy it would also gr eatly reduce the size of russias defense industrial base and would cause large so cioeconomic dislocations it is problematic however to make such prediction the yeltsin regime has often changed policies unpredictably and c ould do so again moreover leaving the defense industrial sector at the mercy of the market would be profound break not only with soviet policy but with centu ries of russian tradition communists nationalists and other statists would be strongly opposed on the other hand many in russia and the west argue that neither the russian government nor the private sector can continue to sustain the larg and unproductive defense industrial sector at anything near its present size from this perspective some substantial demilitarization of the economy may be not only desirable but inevitable the end result may be hybrid system with aspect s of private enterprise and state support although the future of russias defense industry is difficult to predict current trends and government intent seem clear the mods top priority is to provide salaries food and housing for its forces in the proposed 1997 budget sequestration those items are safeguarded the rest of the defense budget is to be cut by 37 percent from 52 to 32 trillion rubles

gorbachev period at the same time however the soviet armed forces enjoyed what was in many respects privileged place in soviet society the most important aspect of this was the extraordinary militarizati on of the soviet economy noted above the civilian sector became what economists call resi dual claimant ie its needs were met from what was left over after military requirements had been satisfied in addition soviet propaganda glorified the armed forces as an institution and the military as profession many young n may have dreaded cons cription but being military officer gave one substantial level of respect and prestige in soviet society officers could and did feel proud of their calling ordinary c itizens understood with pride that the rest of the world respected and feared the soviet army for many soviet citizens the ussrs proudest achievement was military one the defeat of nazi germany declining status the war in afghanistan 19791988 had corrosive effect on the soviet army similar in some respects to the us experience in vietnam the downgrading of the soviet armed forces began in 1985 with mikhail gorbachevs rise to power and accelerated in the late 1980s gorbachev came to believe that in order to revitalize the soviet economy it was essential to shif t substantial resources from defense to the civilian sector at least temporarily also in order to get largescale western investments credits and tec hnology transfers he believed it necessary to remove the specter of looming soviet military threat these policies led to large cuts in soviet defense spending to arms control agreements which further reduced the soviet armed forces and ultimately to the peaceful withdrawal of soviet forces from eastern europe afghanistan glasnost and gorbachevs new priorities also inevitably led to lessening of the respect and prestige of the armed forces this was intensified by the role of defense minister yazov and elements of the army in the abortive anti gorbachev coup

according to yeltsins memoirs the army hesitated to support him at the decisive moment in his confrontation with the suprem soviet in addition the end of the cold war brought87 profound change in the international environment for russia reducing the likelihood of war and the need for huge army and defense spending was dramatically constrained by russian economic reforms and budget crises many russian and western analysts have concluded that these factors convinced yeltsin and the people around him that to the extent that they face security threat it is more an internal than an external th reat hence internal security forces have been strengthened and new ones created while the regular armed forces grow weaker the defense economist shlykov among ot hers has commented on the internal security forces increasing share of th national security budget according to88 aleksandr belkin senior russian defense consultant yeltsin built up other forces interior forces border guards secur ity forces and emergency forces his praetorian guard to contain the military or in case of mutiny to suppress it89 in the words of another russian critic th is is evidence of russias transformation into police state in which every second ba yonet at the least is turned inside the country 90 the russian governments willingness to allow the army to atrophy to such an extent has led some russian and western analysts to conclude that the yeltsin regime is intentionally weakening the regular armed forces according to senior cia analyst for yeltsin the army has three main tasks to defend him to shoot his opponents and to vote for him it did each of those things once and hes not sure it would do any of them again this same analyst calls yeltsins treatment of the army malign neglect the russian fense expert belkin put it this way91 the primary political objective of yeltsins military reorganization was to deliberately weaken and incapacitate the m ilitary as potential instrument of any political rivals of the president that objective has been accomplished completely92 the idea that the yeltsin regime has deliberately weakened the army is minority view most interpretations focus

handsoff leadership style contributed to this he lacks the temperament or discipline to supervise russias governance on daytoday basis some be lieve yeltsin prefers to set up competing power centers that counterbalance one anothe r allowing him to stand above the fray as supreme arbiter less generous view is that yeltsins disengagement fosters the formation of competing power centers and clans and that he only steps in and makes decisions when situation has reach ed critical mass or gone out of control in any case the mod inevitably became player in this game scrambling to secure share of the states diminished resources yeltsins use of the army in october 1993 to crush his political opposition shelling th parliament buildin g with tank fire and the armys reluctant decision to engage in this way made the army direct participant in russias political struggle at that time many observers believed this would make yeltsin more dependent on the army increasing its influence but the opposite was the case as yeltsin turned mo re toward internal security forces the armys inability to prevent yeltsin from using the armed forces in chechnya was an indication of its political weakness the chechen campaign in turn further93 politicized and weakened the army the deputy commanderinchief of russianground forces refused to lead his troops into ba ttle in chechnya on the grounds correct

disarray in the defense sector since 1992 each new change in the security council or presidential bodies in the security sphere has engendered new wave of western warnings at the creation of new and superconcentrated centers of power over the army police and security policy it is apparent however that this regular cycle of decrees reforms and new structures is instead sure sign of the governments continued incoherence99 attitudes of officers in the past western assessments of the political attitudes of soviet or russian officers tended to be based on broad assumptions and bits of anecdotal

the increasing frequency of such warnings suggests that many specialists believe the russian military is under extreme stress and b the possibility of calamitous developments ca nnot be ruled out chaos and calamity are not particularly useful rms in trying to foresee possible future scenarios for the russian army below is discussion of some of the more frequently mentioned possible calamities coup for years there has been speculation about and rumor of possible military coup it is heightened by awarene ss of the growing anger and frustration felt by many officers over legitima grievances if the pr obability of coup depended106 primarily on serious grievances the risk would be high but there are mitigating factors the officer corps is badly sp lit on political issues the high command well aware of the disastrous effects of the fa iled august 1991 coup is likely to be leery of any such activity is belie ved to have little enthusiasm for taking responsibility for the ailing economy and fears the outbreak of civil war some observers believe that if there is any danger of an arme d coup it is more likely to come from the internal security forces than the military although the former are better provided for materially and have fewer grievances mutiny the combination of nonpayment of military salaries and alienation107 of the military from the government could lead to officerled mutinies especially in the face of highly unpopular order this situation almost aros when several senior army commanders refused to obey orders during the initial assault on chechnya the ball survey cited above and some recent events suggest the growing possibility of officers refusing to obey orders on june 24 1997 lt gen ret lev rokhlin108 chairman of the duma defense committee caused sensation with an open letter to yeltsin and all servicemen which so view as suborning mutiny rokhlin accused yeltsin and his associates of betraying the army in chechnya and

government plans to further downsize the army exhorting them to hold conferences in each unit formulate demands and send them to the president you must organize elect leaders to the pos ts of chairmen of officers assemblies and demand the fulfillment of your legal rights do not hope that someone will do this for you the guarantee of success lies in our unity in resisting the destruction of the army otherwise the army will perish109 another variant of the mutiny scenario is the possibility of individuals or small groups of servicemen turning their weapons against the government in kamikazelike acts of desperation or revenge the thr eat of mutiny may have been reduced by the governments recent fulfillment of its pled ge to pay military sa lary arrearages by september 1 1997 implosion some russian and western speci alists have begun using the term implosion in discussions of possible military collapse implicit in the notion of implosion are such phenomena as rapid unc ontrolled largescale depletion of the ranks through officers resign ations desertion nd draft evasion another scenario110 is fragmentation to the point of warlordism this notion derives from the centripetal political forces already at work in th russian federation as central author ities fail to pay feed and house the army some regi onal leaders are stepping into this void and in the process securing the allegiance of military units in their territory economic exigency has caused the mod to encourage military units to seek economic support from the governments of th regions in which they are stationed111 in the event of political confrontation between regional and central authorities this could have serious consequen ces some experts warn of the danger rising level of lawlessness within the armed forces with the breakdown of discipline ejecting more and more armed men and weapons into the society at larg some analysts assert that the implosion is already occurring that we are

servicemen115 most observers believe that central au thorities have access to enough carrots and sticks to keep the army under control the question is whether the government will use these tools effectively to forestall calamitous development skeptics point to yeltsins persistent failure to stay focuse d on an issue and to follow through others note that this is such core issue for regime security that yeltsin and his inner circle people who understand power are sure to take the steps necessary to maintain control what can russias armed forces do the preceding sections have examined

russia remains nuclear superpower there has been some erosion of readiness and capability in the nuclear forces bey ond those dictated by arms control agreements compared to us nuclear forces but

yeltsin at least before mid1997 did not provide that leadership to the contrary he nd his government gave the military good deal of autonomy in decisionma king in military affairs while cutting the defense budget drastically 127 soviet authorities traditionally stressed the importance of military doctrine and theory and soviet military leaders relied heavily on such authoritative documents for guidance in the 1990s lacking strong or clear political guidance the russian mod tried to retain as much of the soviet fo rce structure as possibl on its reduced budget this attempt to muddle through amounted to policy of more of the same only less so yeltsin and the government proclaimed military reform to be high priority as early as 1993 but this was little more than rhetoric yeltsin periodically claimed progress in military reform or that major reforms were imminent but nothing happened defense minister grachev played along with this pretense but was not the primary culprit western and russian military experts agree that absent firm128 political guidance the russian military cannot reasonably be expected to reform itself especially in the midst of seve re budget crisis

military would have to draft reform plans based on current spending levels133 neither protagonist would back down progress was made on reform yeltsin finally resolved the dispute by firing rodionov on

that there is dangerous mismatch between the russian political leaderships expansive view of their countrys vital interests and its much reduced conventi onal military capabilities in the words of foreign minister primakov t he international situation itself requires that russia be not merely historically great power but also great power right now nor should russias tem porarily limited capabilities bar it from an active world role since its policy is being carried out by means on the basis of current circumstances but on the basis of russias colossal potential analysts critical141 of this approach warn that unreconstr ucted attitudes about the ends of russian interests could lead to imperial overreac h drawing russia into conflicts beyond its military means with potentially dire consequences142 in 1992 1993 the russian army fought in moldova and georgia and is still deployed there against the will of the host governments the russian 201st mechanized infantry division is engaged in the civil war in tajikistan these conflicts denote an arc of instability along russias southern flank that poses dangers both to russia and its neighbors pavel baev former civilian mod

are diminishing facing russia with the necess ity of strategic retreat as far as military presence is concerned at the same time the political pressure in moscow to143 conduct more proactive course remains high while the postyeltsin successionfurther increases the possibility of unbalanced poorly thoughtout and incomprehensible actions 144 according to sherman garnett of the carnegie endowment

great brea tar p it drawing it deeper and deeper into mire from which it cannot extricate itself146 others such as stephen blank of th us army war college argue that russian involvement in conflic ts on its periphery is part of an imperialist design after all russia has had 400 years of em pire so that imperial policy is not surprise it would be surprising if russi were not pursuing that policy for blank this is because of russias military weakness strategic irresponsibility as during nicholas iis rule which it resembles in too many ways the government pursues ruinous strategic overextension

some argue that excep t for chechnya postsoviet russia has not done so badly on its periphery in th is view with the cooperation of certain regimes that see some russian presence as stabilizing factor moscow might be able to maintain an influential presence along the periphery using classic tactics of subversion manipulation and re latively modest military force future prospects this section examines several nearterm scenarios for the evolution of russias armed forces as well as questions of how long it might take for russia to rebuild its military and what kind of force it might behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs46 nearterm scenarios although russia has been in transition for about decade it seems clear that the transition is far from complete simultaneous revolutions in the political and socio economic systems the extent and character of the state and its spiritualideological underpinning have not run thei r course true stability may be generation or two in the future the magnitude of change on so many different axes makes prediction difficult even the shortterm scenarios 35 years suggested below are speculative the further out one tries to proj ect the greater the uncertainty present trends continue in july 1996 yeltsin was reelected to fouryear term that will expire in the year 2000 even with the simplest assumption that the political and economic tr ends of the past few years continue experts disagree on where those trend lines lead some see increasing economic stability based on the governments successful moneta rist policies others predict continued declines in production and mounting socioeconomic distress there is less op timism about the prospects for political stability whether or not yeltsin serves out his second term western and russian experts on the military however are in general agreement that if the military trend lines of the past few years were to conti nue conditions would soon become litera lly unsustainable that is what lies behind the warnings of possible military collapse mutiny implosion or coup despite these dire warnings it is also possible that the russian army will continue to muddle along relying on the seemingly inexhaustible stoicism of its servicemen variant of this scenario is that pres ent political and economic trends continue but with some military reforms perhaps ong the lines indicated in junejuly 1997 this probably would not be sufficient to reverse most of the downward military trends identified earlier in this report it would however increase the likelihood of averting an apocalyptic outcome in any case the continuation of present trends implies low level of russian conventi onal military capability relative to the west for decade or more in part because of the long leadtime needed to create large complex modern military systems economic recovery optimists believe that russia could begin to experience significant economic recovery as soon as 1998 this is not to say that the economy will have recovered in 1998 but that turning point will have been reached in which economic contraction finally gives way to growth estimates of the contraction of the russian not the soviet economy already in this d ecade range between onethird and onehalf few experts believe that sses of such magnitude can be quickly made up virtually all ag ree that little if any progress can be made unless there is substantial structural demilita rization of the economy and the defense burden is kept low this implies that even rapid economic recovery if it comes will not be accompanied early on by rapid defense build up substantial economic recovery would certainly provide the basis for rebu ilding powerful armed forces in subsequent years given russias size geographical location adjacent to central europe the balkans the middle east southwest as ia and china and history assuming economic recovery moscow is likely to reestablish itself as major military power how long that might take is discussed below among the key factors that will shapehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs47 garnett bear wedged in great tightness p 23148the character of russian military power will be whether it evolves in predominantly great russian nationalist or westernoriented context another key factor will be russian threat perception not least regarding china resurgence of authoritarianism it is quite possible that the reforms of the first phase of russias postsoviet transiti on will falter and give way to resurgence of authoritarianism most analysts believe restoration of the soviet system is unlikely and that turn toward authoritari anism would more likely take the form of nationalistpopulist or neofas cist regime such reg ime would probably seek to quickly rebuild its armed forces retaining or reconstituting as much of the old soviet force structure as possible whether it would have the means to do so however is problematic if it were overtly antiwestern it might forfeit much foreign assistance technology trade and investments needed for economic recovery if it were hos tile to marketoriented economic reform th economy would probably sink into even worse shape then that which presumably helped bring the authoritarians to power if the regime relied on ethnic russian nati onalism it would be anathema to most of the other soviet successor st ates and would find little politi cal economic or strategic cooperation there such regime would be likely to intensif the mismatch between national security ends and means discusse d above the authoritarian regime most likely to be able to rebuild the russian military would be one that combined populism na tionalism and market reforms but in the short run simultaneous economic recovery and rapid military buildup seem incompatib absent substantial economic recovery major remilitarization is probably unsustainable how long to rebuild conventional military capabilities rebuild to what level unless russia regains control of most of the former soviet union it cannot hope to recons titute anything like the military force capabilities of the mid1980s because of th vast human and material assets that moscow lost when the ussr disinteg rated one measure would be to think in terms of the time needed for russia to become military peercompetitor of the united states at present us force levels the answer to this question of course is scenariodependent given russias size immense wealth of natural resources large welleducated population history and culture it seems quite likely that russia will again be great power with formidable military might but virtually experts on the russian military predict that this could be accomplished in the next 35 years privatization has removed massive amounts of wealth property and productive forces from the hands of the state though this may be necessary but not sufficient to jump start the economy it reduces russias ability to swiftly mobilize resources for national security objectives148 optimistic assessments from moscows pe rspective such as those given by first deputy defense minister kokoshin nd general staff chief kvashnin say that russia will begin to rear m in 2005 20032005 is also the time frame often cited for completing the transition from conscript to professional army russianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs48 whos the enemy its chaos and its here to stay us news and world149 report may 12 1997 on may 16 1996 month before the presidential election yeltsin signed decree150 mandating that conscription be replaced by professional allvolunteer force by the year 2000 this may have won some votes but was ridiculed by military specialists as unachievable in that time frame arbatov the russian military in the 21 century and military reform doctrine151 st troopspress accounts cite an mod plan to turn over 5 percent of its weapons inventory annually beginning in 2005 nd ending in 2025 if largescale force modernization began in 2005 it would be many years before that process yielded large robust highly capable army much of the inve ntory of weapons built in the 1970s and 1980s would be largely useless by then and rear mament would resume from relatively low base although it may seem counterintu itive to many in the west who grew accustomed to the idea of massive soviet military threat as geopolitical given it seems that russias bestcase scenario for force reconstitution may be toward the end of the first decade of the 21st century if that is bestcase scenario the time frame for major force reconstitution could well be longer this prospect is hi ghlighted by findings of classified cia study global trends 2010 which reportedly predicts that russias economic and social woes will continue to drain resources from defense and does not foresee russia as military peercompetitor by 2010 there is objective basis for trying149 to forecast the maximum time it might take for russian conventional force reconstitution russia would not however be militarily inconsequential or powerless in the interim it presumably would remain nuclear superpower it would also retain large residual conventional forces and probably some highly effective smaller specialized units especially visàvis weak states on its periphery but that is far cry from former soviet military capabilities what sorts of armed forces will russia have among other unknowns the political cont roversy in russia over military reform makes it difficult to predict how or whether the russian armed forces will evolve in the next few years the shibboleths of russian military reform call for more compact efficient and highly mobile for ces there is broad support for shifting from conscript to professional army the latter presumably would be smaller150 force but it would also be far more expens ive the government seems to lack the economic means or the political will to fund this transition at present alexei arbatov deputy chairman of the duma defense committee has written two extensive studies recently proposing radical downsizing and restructuring of russias armed forces he argues that given russias econo mic realitie s it cannot151 possibly maintain anything like its presen t force structure inherited from the soviethttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs49 for example in order to maintain the russian army at the us level of equipment152 readiness training etc says arbatov it w ould be necessary either to reduce the force to 100000 men less than the greek army or increase the defense budget to 1000 trillion rubles twice the entire russian federal budget these are extreme alternatives he admits but they illustrate the s cale of the problem ibid p 14 arbatovs oral presentation at u s army war college april 23 1997153era nor is there any reason to do s since russia faces largescale military152 threats in the next few years arbatov wants to move very quickly to smaller professional force reducing total milita ry manpower to 112 million by 1998 and 800900000 by 2001 with 300000 ground force troops in 1520 heavy and light divisions by 2001 in his view the air and air defense forces would need 10001500 combat and transport aircraft the navy 7080 major surface warships and 4050 attack submarines some less radical plans move in simila r direction one of former defense minister rodionovs early proposals was to restructure the ground forces 61 mostly hollow divisions and scores of independent brigades into 13 fullstrength divisions the recently approved plan to abolish ground forces command would pave the way for disbanding hollow and empty divisions as noted above however political nd militarybureaucratic resistance to radical military reform is quite strong if it prevails and muddlingthrough approach is adopted either explicitly or by default ru ssia will probably try to retain its present economically unsustainable armed forces whose qualitative deterioration will continue and probably acceler ate arbatov warns that if present policies continue russia w ill maintain its large qualitatively weak army for the next 5 years when there are major military threats to russia but 1015 years from now russia will have crumbling military infrastructure at time when it may face real threats in the east the south or even the west153 gap between us and russian military capabilities it is widely acknowledged that the united states has peer competitor in conventional military power at this time furthermore the gap between us and russian conventional capabilities is widening how long this condition lasts will depend on many variables not least of all us perceptions of russian and other threats in view of the relative size and strength of the us and russian economies and high technology sectors if the unite d states has the will to do so it could maintain and widen the gap in military capability for years to come implications for us policy the most obvious implication of the terioration of ru ssian conventional military capabilities for us policy is that the traditional russian military threat is significantly reduced not just for the present but well into the next decade at leasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs50 then director of the prestigious soviet institute for the study of the usa and154 canada senior advisor to president mikhail gorbachev and father of alexei arbatov of the duma defense committee lectures by senior us military aders at the national war college 19951996155in the late 1980s georgi arbatov warn ed americans wryl that gorbachevs154 reforms were going to present the unite d states with an acute case of threat deprivation his implication was that th pentagon and us defense contractors would not appreciate this in the event the older arbatov woul d conclude that the reforms begun by gorbachev and accelerated by yeltsin succeeded too well in depriving the united states of its military threat he was at least partly right in that this has led to major changes and reductions in the us national security establishment process that many belie ve has by means r its course many past and present senior us military leaders ruefully predict massive cuts in us defense spending in coming years because of the disappearance of the threat that virtually defined us national secu rity strategy for two generations155 not only is the traditional military threat greatly reduced but the warning time associated with it is greatly increased in the worst days of the cold war nato military planners viewing the sovietwarsaw pact threat feared that they might only have few weeks of warning time in the event of an imminent attack and in the worst case of standingstart attack perhaps only days of warning time nato vs warsaw pact mobilization timetables seemed nightmarish now in view of the amount of time needed for russia to si gnificantly reconstitu its conventional military capabilities it seems that warning time for russian military threat to central or western europe can be measur ed in years probably quite few years that is tremendous luxury for military pla nners and gives the united states not only added security but much more flexibility since the united states has and is further developing interests in regions on russias periphery such as the baltic and caucasus however warning time for russian military contingencies in such regions might well be measured in months now moreover there might be very little warning time for some unconventional russi an military contingencies such as mutiny implosion or coup there are negative implications for us interests of the dramatic deterioration of russian conventional military cap ability minimal conventional military capability leads explicitly to greater russian reliance on strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence at everlower levels of conflict russian defense analysts and government officials acknowledge this as does russias 1993 m ilitary doctrine and the may 1997 national security concept defense analysts warn that this lower nuclear threshold and the terioration of russias strategic warninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs51 for example in 1995 the launch of rwegian scientific research rocket156 apparently triggered false alarm in russias early warning system causing moscow to put

control of nuclear weapons former fense minister rodionov warned obliquely of such danger when he told the pre ss in february 1997 that russia might soon reach the threshold beyond which its rockets and nuclear systems cannot be controlled158 another implication in the view of many but not all us experts is that catastrophic collapse of the russian armed forces eg in the form of implosion

his career confronting the soviet threat said recently of the rapid deterioration of the russian armed forces as an american official im not sure if i shoul d be applauding or wringing my hands159 us military intelligence expert observed that the russian military hasnt fallen off the cliff yet theyre on the edge of the cliff its very dangerous and unpredictable situation military collapse could occur with little or warning so dont be surprised if youre surprised160 one way to decrease the likelihood of be ing surprised is to increase us russian militarytomilitary cont act and cooperation programs this would give us officials more insight into conditions and attitudes in the russian army it might also provide means of exerting some positive influence on attitudes and developments within the russian arme d forces by education positive example exposure to western norms of behavior and undermining antiwe stern stereotypes and propaganda the clinton administr ation supports

nunnlugar amendment fo rmer secretary of defense william perryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs52 details of the framework agreement were explained at white house press briefing161 on july 22 1997was strong advocate of such efforts and took leading personal role in expanding contacts and cooperation with the russian armed forces those who believe that catastrophic co llapse of the russian army threatens russias democratic tr ansition regional stab ility and us national interests would like to see russias large inefficient unsustainable and unstable army move toward smaller more efficient professional force some contend that the united states should to the limited extent possible encour age russian movement in this direction one tack would be to further reassure moscow that it faces military threat from the west this would help free russia fro m the burden of maintaining powerful and expensive forces to confront nato on of the challenges for such policy however according to us analysts is how to reassure russia in the west while proceeding with nato enlargement top administration foreign policy goal some see the cfe adaptation talks aimed at adapting the 1990 treaty on conventional forces in eur ope to postcold war cond itions as one means of giving russia such reassurance the original cfe treaty set equal limits on certain types of weapons that nato and warsaw pact st ates could station in europe moscow has argued for years that cfe must be m odified because the old bloctobloc ceilings make sense after the disappearance of the warsaw pact russia has different borders and security concerns in europe than the former soviet union and the prospective entrance of former warsaw pact states into nato fundamentally alters the european security picture on july 22 1997 representatives of the united states russia and the 28 other cfe states reached framework agreement that would modify cfe by replacing the bloctobloc ceilings with national and territorial limits this satisfies basic russian demand the specific limits however were161 not set and will be the subject of further negotiations modification of the cfe treaty will require senate approval perceptions of russian military capabilities and intentions will help shape russias nati onal ceilings under the new treaty as well as the territorial limits on equipment that can be stationed in prospective new nato members poland hungary and the czech republic some obser vers are concerned that the clinton administration may seek to reward russia for agreeing to nato enlargement with favorable cfe numbers there are some in the united states who argue that as far as the russian army is concerned the worse the better th ey are skeptical about russias transition toward democracy and market economy view russian policy as hostile to many important us interests and see russias large army as at least potential threat in this view even catastrophic collapse of the russian army would further reduce the threat and would be bound to be in the us interest proponents of this view believe the united states should do nothing to imp ede the collapse of the russian armed forces us policy is concerned with russian arms sales particularly sales that are considered geostrategically destabilizin g or sales to countries that sponsor international terrorism for example the house approved an amendment to

puts added pressure on defense enterprises and the governments arms ex port agency rosvooruzhenye to maximize foreign arms sales according to kremlin official 75 percent of the revenue being received by defense industrie s comes from arms exports 163 russian arms sales fell sharply in the period 19921994 following the dissolution of the ussr and the success of us arms in the gulf war but increased significantly in 19951996 nevertheless pre mier chernomyrdin164 expressing dissatisfaction with the level of arms exports declared in august 1997 that yeltsin had just put him in charge of supervising rosvooruzhenye and that he would push to accelerate foreign arms sales besides china and iran india a165 traditional soviet customer remains majo r buyer of russian arms in addition moscow has won some important aircraft contracts recently from malaysia peru and indonesia the united states is concerne d that moscow is strongly motivated to increase potentially destabilizing arms sales to china and iran and turn to other traditional clients such as iraq libya and serbia moscow has been honoring the unimposed arms embargoes against the latter three states but it makes clear its desire to see those embargoes lifted so that it can resume normal trade relations such development would complicate us policy and might strain us relations with russia russian officials often sa that us complaints about moscows apparent eagerness to sell arms to pariah states reflect commercial competition us unwillingness to allow russia share of the market among civilized countries and some claim us desi re to see russias defense industries completely ruined another implication for us policy derives from the mismatch between deteriorating russian conve ntional military capabilities and moscows still expansive sense of geostrategic interests there is the potential for russia becoming involved militarily at some flashpoint on its pe riphery which it is unable to resolve successfully but from which it is unwilling or unable to withdraw prolonged conflict could derail democra tization and reform in russi vertical or horizontal escalation could threaten regional stability either could jeopardize important us interests washington has limited influence over russian national security decision making many believe that use of that limited influence to help moscow avoid damaging military entanglements would serve us interests this raises the delicatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97820crs54 issue of how to clearly inform moscow bout us interests in regions on russias periphery without creating the impression in moscow that washington is trying to expel or supplant russian influence in wh at it views as its own backyard some who consider russia still to be threat how ever might not necessarily regret seeing moscow bogged down in conflict on its periphery if that led to its further weakening and isolation
