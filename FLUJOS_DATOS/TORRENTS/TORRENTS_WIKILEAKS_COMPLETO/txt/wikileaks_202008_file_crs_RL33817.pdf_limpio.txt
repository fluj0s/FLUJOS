was enacted at 637 billion for fy2008 extended by continuing resolution for fy2009 at or below fy2008 levels to march 6 2009 members of congress have expressed interest in how federal funding may reflect and enable an overall strategy and priorities within it to address climate change this report summarizes federal funding and tax incentives identified as climate changerelated under the bush administration it identifies the organization of programs how funding may reflect priorities and external evaluations or recommendations for the br oad programs to the degree they are available barack obama has made directionchanging pled ges to abate us greenhouse gas emissions and to engage more aggressively internationally on climate change the change in executive leadership and the evolving congressional debate over appropriate policies to address climate change may shift priorities among climate change activities calls to expand climate change funding despite deepening budget pressures may require that programs do better job of demonstrating benefits to compete effectively with other budgetary demands this review of federal funding of climate change activities suggests that there may be opportunities to better align funding with strategic policy goals and to assure that programs are organized to accomplish those goals more efficiently fourteen federal agencies administer climate changerelated activities the packaging of mostly existing programs into climate change strategy has resulted in lack of unifying mission jointly shared across agencies to address climate change funding has largely reflected departmental missions and support for each activity rather than each activitys expected contribution to an overarching strategy the ne w obama administration is expected to provide more actionoriented leadership but will face the challenge of aligning programs resources and tax incentives into crossagency intergovernmental strategy associated legislative issues include how legislation to control greenhouse gases may affect funding and tax incentive priorities the sufficiency and alignment of federal resources to support strategy to achieve long term climate change policy goals demands for additional and predictable resources to support actions by low income countries to mitigate greenhouse gases or adapt to climate change possible legislative proposals to restructure or improve collaboration among climate change activities addressing recommendations from evaluations to the degree they exist to improve climate change programs exploring options for financing climate change programs especially if greenhouse gas emission allowances or fees are enacted by the 111 th congress and possible requirements for reporting to congress of funding

identified numerous actions aimed at closer observation and analysis mandatory pollution control financial assistance for technological change adaptation to cope with changes and host of additional policy options despite calls to expand federal funding to address climate change federal budgeting overall faces increasingly stark choices among competing fiscal demands federal funding for climate change activities was enacted at 637 billion for fy2008 adding in the effects of tax incentives the budgetary impact of climate changerelated activities totaled 773 billion for fy2008 for fy2009 funding continues at or below those levels through march 6 2009 under continuing resolution pl 110329 1 in some cases the continuing resolution may have sustained funding to many climate change programs at higher level than president bushs fy2009 request since many had been proposed to bear cuts tax incentives for renewable energy and other similar incentives were passed late in 2008 and the uncertainty may have affected the budgetary impacts of those incentives in fy2009 as the 111th congress evaluates the value of past funding and future priorities to address climate change this report provides an overview of federal funding and tax incentives in the context of presidential goals from 2001 through 2008 as well as legislative requirements for these programs with new administration the context for climate change funding will change president barack obama has outlined new set of policies including goal to return us greenhouse gas ghg emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2020 to reduce ghg emissions by 80 below 1990 by 2050 and to achieve these goals through system of emission caps and trading 2 as president elect obama stated on december 15 2008 that the effort before us will demand coordination across the government and my personal engagement as president 3 to assist with these he has designated former epa administrator carol browner to be assistant to the president for energy and climate change it remains to be seen how his goals and new leadership in the white house will translate into funding proposals and program alignment

directed us programs addressing climate change to aim at reducing scientific uncertainties 1 although appropriations for fy2009 for the depa rtment of defense dod were passed in the 110th congress it

president to address climate change across agencies and activities because most congressional scrutiny of specific funding and primary choices occurs in appropriations subcommitteesfurther altered by congressionally directed fundingthe appropriations process has not facilitated broad view of overarching climate change policy goals and priorities or consistency with goals across agencies and diverse activities enhancing an overarching vision and prioritization would require greater coordination across subcommittees or at the committee level than typically occurs 7

to better understand and address the phenomenon both the amounts and purposes of funding for climate change efforts have evolved since 1990 this report describes federal funding of climate change activities across 14 agencies most emphasis is on changes from the enacted fy2007 and fy2008 levels to president bushs fy2009 request continuing resolution pl 110329 extended the fy2008 enacted levels through march 6 2009 which is in some cases higher than the levels requested some longer historical perspective is provided where data are available as this report discusses the availability and clarity of funding information continues to impede full understanding of the federal effort and its effectiveness 9 and so the estimates provided in this report are best viewed with caution in addition the limited political agreement that has evolved around climate change in the united states has resulted in packaging of all activities as research on science or technologies or international assistance this emphasis on research may not adequately characterize the actual work and evolving prioritiesespecially if calls for greater action on ghg abatement impacts assessment and adaptation are answered by federal programs and incentives there has been an historic emphasis on climate change science within the overall us effort to address climate change concerns about climate ch ange first issued from the research community even as public concern rose some decisionmakers emphasized improving the science in order to make wise policy decisions some observers expressed concern that such emphasis on uncertainties and the need for additional scientific research were rationale not to undertake more concrete mitigative or adaptive actions to address climate change 10 nonetheless there has been longstanding consensus that continued scientific research on climate change its impacts and possible adaptation strategies is desirable funding levels for climate change increased rapidly from 1989 to 1995 but have generally declined for climate change science since then when amounts are adjusted for inflation by the mid1990s scenario analyses had made clear that effectively avoiding humaninduced climate change would require major changes in energy and other technologies in use not surprisingly another consensus emerged surrounding federal support to advance technologies that allow transition to lower greenhouse ghgem itting society without compromising economic wellbeing 11 the growing set of activities and funds to support clean technologies were packaged as second

studies program to build the capacities of developing and transition countries to assess and implement climate change policies most funding for international assistance has been through the agency for international development us aid and has generally declined since the late 1990s due variously to executive branch decisions and congressional opposition this report provides an overview of climate change funding in three major climate change program areas science technology and international assistance as well as tax provisions that may encourage reductions in greenhouse gases increasingly there are overlaps and gaps among these program areas alternative ways to categorize the funding might better serve congressional decisionmaking though limited by data this report provides preliminary analysis of the federal effortfor example by type of activity or by types of technologies supported the report also identifies several legislative issues related to federal funding for climate change

incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas ghg emissions table 1 shows an omb estimated total of 152 billion in climate changerelated tax expenditures in fy2008 and fy2007 and has projected these tax expenditures to decrease in fy2009 to 144 billion although tax incentives are not federal spending per they reduce revenues to the federal government that would otherwise accrue in that sense the loss of revenues resulting from tax incentives are often presented by omb as tax expenditures of the federal government hereafter this report refers to these as tax expenditures examples of tax expenditures related to climate change include credits for purchases of cleaner automobiles and investment in renewable electricity generation technologies table 1 does not include estimates of other tax expenditures that may aggravate climate change such as provisions that promote fossil fuel production and use 14

presents the total impact to the federal budget from fy2001 through fy2008 and the fy2009 request resulting from budget authority for the three major climate change program areas and tax expenditures though federal spending and losses of revenues are not alike this total budgetary impact illustrates the overall level of federal effort or cost to the federal government of identified climate change programs and incentives table 1 suggests that the budgetary impact of reported climate change activities has increased nearly 85 from fy2001 to the enacted fy2008 level in constant 2007 dollars of the actual 43 billion increase 26 billionmore than 60is attributable to expansion of technology research and development another 15 billion of the budgetary impact is due to tax incentives to stimulate greenhouse gas reductions which the office of management and budget projected to decline in fy2009 for scientific research funding in actual dollars increased by 01 billion from fy2001 to fy2008 enacted though this represen ts decline in funding for climate change science when accounting for inflation president bushs request for fy2009 would have brought the funding back up to the fy2001 level in real terms as discussed in box 3 however conclusions regarding the levels of funding over time can be considered only approximate because of reporting issues 14 see also crs report rl33578

organization for informal management of scientific research on climate change since 2003 it was the extension of us research effort that has been underway for several decades for fy2009 president bush requested 208 billion to support climate change science under the ccsp the fy2009 request was 216 million 12 above the fy2008 enacted budget authority of 182 billion and 255 million 14 above the fy2007 level the ccsp research was intended to help reduce uncertainties in the science as highlighted by national academies report requested by president bush in 2001 revised research strategy for the ccsp was issued in may 2008 discussed in later section and may be reflected in president obamas request for fy2010 21 the proposed ccsp funding for fy2009 would be provided to 11 federal agencies with nasa continuing to receive the largest shareabout 58with about 64 of nasas funding proposed for spacebased observations of the total request for fy2009 16 was proposed for noaa 11 for nsf and 7 for doe the history of us funding for climate change science since fy1989 is presented in figure 3 and appendix c the amounts are as reported by the ccsp which do not appear to reflect ombs adjustments to the amounts for fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 as presented in table 1 of this crs report in constant dollars ie adjusted for inflation the ccsp budget declined by 11 from fy2001 20 billion through fy2008 enacted 18 billion down 25 from the funding peak in fy1995 the fy2009 request would have brought th total back to the fy2001 funding in constant dollars although the composition of the research would be altered the tightening fiscal environment of federal discretionary budgets has resulted in shifting of funds within almost all agencies from climate change to other priorities for example nasas climaterelated budget declined by 24 from fy2000 through fy2008 enacted after adjusting for inflation but not for scope and methodological changes though an addition of 126 million 12 was proposed for spacebased observations in the fy2009 request the decline in climate changerelated funding at nasa reflects the agencys priority for space exploration as well as budget constraints imposed by cost overruns in space programs 22 in the fy2001 to fy2008 time period only the budget of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa increasedby 217while all other agencies saw their climate science budgets decline in dollars adjusted for inflation the pressure on agencies budgets has likely aggravated ongoing tension within and among agencies over funding for this crossagency objective climate change science when agencies are stretching to meet what they perceive as their core missions 21 the climate change science program office maintains we bsite with

federallysupported research has been conducted for many decades on the potential for rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to induce global climate change in 1971 panel of the national academy of sciences23 recommended that the united states increase its research into understanding the dynamics of climate and climate change to 111 million24 for the 10year period of 1970197925 all amounts in this paragraph have been adjusted for inflation to 2007 dollars after several compelling scientific conferences in the 1980s federal support for climate change research rose from these levels up to peak of funding in fy1995 of 228 billion following the fy1995 peak funds reported for climate change science generally declined through the 183 billion enacted for fy2008 figure 3 illustrates the historical funding reported by the administration in nominal dollars and adjusted for inflation in constant 2007 dollars supporting data are in appendix c table c1 the rapid growth of funding from 1989 paralleled the enactment by congress of the global change research act gcrapl 101606 which established the us global change research program us gcrp the us gcrp in many ways constituted an extension and expansion of existing science programs and had been conceived by some to exist in parallel with other research that would more directly support policy and management decisionmaking the latter program was never established and its absence is reflected in some of the tension today over the goals and balance of federally supported climate change science the ccsp states its mandate under the gcra as to improve understanding of uncertainties in climate science expand global observing systems develop sciencebased resources to support policymaking and resource management and

ccsp has been composed of the us gcrp and the climate change research initiative ccri the latter having been established by president bush in 2003 there appears to be little practical distinction between these two efforts within the ccsp appendix b describes the organization of agencies under the federal climate strategy of president bush while appendix d identifies the major climate science activities of the major agencies the ccsp has not been formalized through legislation the gcra remains the principal legal authorization and framework for us federal climate change science however there were several hearings and bills introduced in the 110th congress concerning the content and organization of the ccsp and it is likely that bills to amend or replace the gcra will be introduced in the 111th congress

described in an overall strategy the climate change science program strategic plan this plan was published in 2003 with ongoing reviews by the national academy of sciences the strategic plan was updated in may 2008 under court order29 as the revised plan was released in may 2008 its priorities were not necessarily reflected in the fy2009 request to congress the 2008 strategic plan did not substantially change the organization of the existing ccsp as described below the 2003 and 2008 ccsp strategic plans grouped research into seven elements atmospheric composition climate variability and change global water cycle land useland cover change global carbon cycle ecosystems and human contributions and responses both plans further lay out five goals which do not correspond closely with these seven research elements the proposed fy2009 funding for each goal as selfidentified by agencies and excluding satellitebased observation funding is provided below goal 1 4106 million improve knowledge of the earths past and present climate and environment including its natural variability and improve understanding of the causes of observed variability and changes 29 on august 21 2007 us district court judge ruled that the administration has unlawfully withheld action to update its global change research plan every three years and ordered that the administration publish summary of revised proposed research plan in the federal register later than march 1 2008 and that the proposed research plan itself be submitted to congress not later than 90 days thereafter the judge also ordered that the administration produce an integrated scientific assessment as required by the gcra later than may 31 2008 court order c 067062 sba filed august 21 2007 from the united states district

noted that it was first step toward new strategy by 2010 covering 2013 to 2023 public outreach towards that new strategy reportedly has begun the rrp retains the same five goals and overall structure as the 2003 strategy the rrp distills the main emerging priorities and similarities and differences from the 2003 strategy in the following four points ccsp will continue to provide the basic physical science required to understand earths past and present climate including its natural variability and to improve understanding of the causes of and uncertainties in observed variability and change at global continental regional and local scales ccsp remains committed to basic ongoing research to understand climate processes and the forcing factors that cause changes in climate and related systems ccsp will increasingly address emerging needs for research to more fully understand the impacts of climate change on unmanaged and managed ecosystems human health and infrastructure economic and other human systems ccsp will continue to generate science to support decisionmaking related to the management of risks and opportunities of climate variability and change including adaptive management and mitigation efforts with an increased emphasis on generating scientific results at regional and local scales ccsp will place greater emphasis on communicating with users and stakeholders eg state and local governments academia industry public utilities and nongovernmental organizations both to gain the benefit of their experience perspectives and input and to ensure that the results of ccsp research monitoring data and assessments are widely and easily available and accessible to potential users of this information 32 as the ccsp moves towards revision in 2010 of its strategic plan for

program and to provide recommendations for improvements multiple agencies similarly seek reviews from the nas or other external bodies eg science advisory boards and advice some common concerns about the ccsp are identified below weaknesses in leadership and budget coherence while the existing decentralized structure of the climate change science program brings some advantages most reviews of the program conclude that the ccsp lacks sufficient overarching authority to overcome agencies individual interests and to make budget consistent with crosscutting priorities 2007 national academies panel concluded for example that the separation of leadership and budget authority presents serious obstacle to progress in the ccsp 35 although number of members of congress and interest groups might be interested in strengthening central leadership of the ccsp through legislative actions there is general consensusand some active disputeabout which federal entity would be the best site in which to invest such authority options raised have included the office of science and technology policy or new entity within the executive office of the president the office of management and budget the national science foundation or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration some experts have proposed climate czar in the white house troika of leaders from existing white house councils or new freestanding entity like the us trade representative one question also raised is whether such leadership should cover only the science programs or be extended to all climate change programs possibly including the climate change technology program new initiatives that might more fully address adaptation or greenhouse gas mitigation policy analysis and international strategies some would include energy security coordination as well while at least one proposal would subsume climate change leadership under an energy czar president obamas appointment of carol browner to be his assistant for energy and climate change may fill this role though the functions and authority of the new position have not been defined lack of metrics of progress one challenge facing the ccsp is arguably lack of clearly articulated and measurable goals notwithstanding the qualitative goals cited above the goals as articulated define directional change with definable endpoints at which one could declare mission accomplished or milestones along the way such measurable objectives exist for many of the individual projects funded under the ccsp but not for the program as whole this potentially presents challenge in determining priorities and changes in them over time when existing or proposed programs cannot be evaluated against their contributions to the overall product it also exacerbates some continuing nsion between funding for fundamental knowledge 34 more information is available on noaas website httpwwwclimatenoaagovindexjsppgccsp unified_synthesisjsp 35 national research council 2007

applied research and actions to accomplish climate change policy objectives national academies panel convened at the request of the former director of the ccsp to consider how to measure progress for the program noted that the ccsp strategic plan does not contain measures of success and program objectives are written too broadly for them to be inferred36 the panel concluded that metrics could be developed and used for the ccsp but highlighted the considerable challenge and cost in identifying producing and using set of metrics to measure progress for all elements of the ccsp it also noted that while some metrics can measure shortterm impacts eg ccsp payoffs scheduled to occur within two to four years it may take decades to fully assess the substantial contributions to the global debate on climate change being made by the ccsp and its predecessor us gcrp37 with only qualitative directional goals and an absence of detailed management metrics 2008 review of the ccsp by national academies panel was forced to rely on highlevel assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the entire program based main ly on the reviewers knowledge of program results38 unclear and inconsistent repor ting of programs and funding in 2005 the government accountability office gao concluded that data and reporting limitations make determining agencies actual levels of climate change funding difficult39 gao made number of recommendations and reported in late 2006 that most had been implemented however the difficulty of the present crs analysis leads to the conclusion that while many gao recommended improvements have been helpful the fundamental problems with lack of clarity and consistency persist and confound understanding of how climate change funds have been applied and evaluation of the efficiency results and value of their use recent national academies panel charged with evaluating the progress of the ccsp concluded in 2007 that the detailed budget and management information necessary to score the process and input metrics as laid out in 2005 report on metrics for the program is not readily available even to ccsp agencies 40 this crs analysis confirms the 2007 nas conclusion imbalance between spacebased observations and other research elements the national research council published another report in 200841 evaluating priorities for flight missions and supporting activities for spacebased observations over the coming decade many of the satellite based programs reviewed by the nrc are reported under the ccsp the assessment concluded that the value of the observations could be improved by addessing the balance between space based and other research components it concluded that to provide benefits to both science and 36 the climate change science

observations collected from the land sea airas well as spaceand that observations needed to be integrated into forecast models and other tools for decisionmaking the current observation systems were noted to have major weaknesses the top priority for improvement was obtaining the needed range of continuous observations rather than implementing individual space missions the panel further concluded that strong observation systems will prove useful only if they can be effectively analyzed interpreted and applied to realize the potential offered by these missions resources must be focused in the following four areas ensuring sustained observations for operations research and monitoring obtaining complementary nonspacebased observations turning observations into knowledge and information and sustaining the knowledge and information system 42 in sum the nrc panel found that greater benefits could be gained by redressing existing imbalances in funding for satellitebased observations with other observation systems and greater analysis of the information gathered science for expanding knowledge versus practical applications an ongoing frustration from some quarters with the climate change science enterprise has been the tension between science for the quest to acquire new knowledge or for practical benefits for humankind 43 these observers conclude that the emphasis of the usgcrp has since inception been far more strongly to observe understand and predict global change than to provide useful information to policy makers44 recent critique also concluded that from execution of the program it is clear that the agencies consider their mandate to be primarily the support of basic research according to the specifics of each agency mission45 the crs analysis of the ccsp budget in the following section reinforces this authors conclusion the author continued almost all oversight or advisory committees providing input on priorities for carbon cycle science whether at the agency or national level consist exclusively of practicing scientists even congress members charged with reviewing budgets for science have been reluctant to challenge the paradigm that unfettered basic research will eventually result in societal benefit with some notable exceptions the processes that govern the prioritization selection advocacy and accountability for research stem from the internal operating norms of the scientific community and are extremely appropriate for basic curiositydriven research should the community wish to shift their research agency to one more focused on the needs of society however changes in the operating norms would be appropriate similarly 2007 study by the national research council concluded that the full potential of societal benefits from nasa products will not be realized unless users are involved directly in determining priorities designing products and evaluating benefits46 looking at the ccsp overall national academies panel

control augment input from potential users of the science and improve the overall budget decisionmaking some proposals would expand the science program to include more applied research and analysis to serve private and government needs and increase public communications and outreach while other proposals would expand such activities in separate institutional structure several bills introduced in

including report to congress on barriers to and commercial risks of technologies and plan for demonstrations to develop standards and best practices for calculating monitoring and analyzing ghg intensity to support demonstration projects and to enter into cooperative research and development agreements these activities are arguably much narrower than the scope of activities identified under president bushs cctp as described in the fy2009 budget request and others the cctp as defined by president bush is compos ed of programs administered by 11 agencies plus the executive office of the president it is coordinated by the department of energy and overseen by the interagency committee on climate change science and technology integration see appendix b the cctp objective is to accelerate the technological advances needed to facilitate the reduction and avoidance as well as capture and storage of manmade emissions of greenhouse gases ghg while the 2006 strategic plan sets many milestones for demonstrations of specific technologies there are specific targets or measures for greenhouse gas emissions or capture in the cctp strategic plan 49 the six strategic goals outlined by the cctp ar to advance development of technologies that reduce emissions from energy enduse and infrastructure reduce emissions from energy supply capture and sequester carbon dioxide reduce emissions of nonco 2 greenhouse gases improve capabilities to measure and monitor ghg emissions and bolster basic scientific contributions to technology development as reported by omb federal funding for climate change technology has increased from 845 million in fy1993 to 453 billion enacted for fy2008 370 billion 536 increase president bushs fy2009 budget requested 441 billion for fy2009 114 million increase 3 above fy2008 50 as requested the cctp would constitute 62 of federal funding on climate change as reported by omb however the actual increase in funding for these efforts may be lower than the reported dollar amounts suggest as the agencies and omb have redefined the initiatives included within the cctp over time for example an increasing number of existing nuclear energy programs as well as some clean coal programs have been added to the count in later years though they existed but were not included in ombs earlier reporting of climate change technology funding such changes make it difficult to track the content and evolution of specific climate change technology efforts and funding for them across the years gao has made similar observations 49 us climate change

presented in ombs more recent reports may not be comparable to previously reported technology funding51 introducing uncertainty in the funding trend as quantified results expected from programs are set and monitored as required under the government performance and results act of 199352 redefinitions of program areas also may complicate performance tracking and accountability in addition to making funding comparisons difficult from year to year g5g5g22g18g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561g139g162g561g22g142g140g145g151g152g149g152g144g162g561 generally funding for the cctp is presented by agency and program crs analyzed data for the fy2009 funding request by technology across programs and agencies 53 the preliminary results are in figure 5 the reported cctp funds do not constitute all the funding and other financial incentives for research development and deployment of technologies they are subset selected according to omb guidelines for the cctp 54 according to the data available 29 of the funds requested for the cctp for fy2009 would support nuclear energy equivalent to 20 of all funding for climate change activities funding for nuclear energy research would be more than twice the amount requested for any other technology category the next largest categories in the crs analysis are mixes of technologies 13 of the fy2009 request is for programs that either support multiple technologies or the specific technologies have not been identified another 12 of the funding would support renewable energy chnologies other than biomass and biofuels such as wind solar and others appendix f provides table of funding highlighting the administrations stated priorities for specific technologies planned for development by doe and epa under the cctp these are not necessarily the technologies receiving the largest funding reported under the cctp or among all climaterelated rd there is broad support for federal interventions to stimulate technological advance and multiple studies have shown that effectively stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions over the coming century would require radical technological change compared to current patterns globally55 such rapid change has some precedent but on narrower geographical and economic scales for example the transformation of frances electricity sector to nuclear energy or the adoption of private motor vehicles the former example was driven by governmental fiat and the latter by the large private benefits associated with vehicle ownership and use the us technology strategy has been thus far one of federal sponsorship of research on specified technologies but there is clear relationship between federal investment in particular technologies and success in 51 gao climate change greater clarity and consistency are needed in reporting federal climate change funding gao061122t september 2006 p 3 52 pl 10362 53 most of the detailed funding data were provide by the management office of the cctp in the department of energy 54 an alternative historical analysis of federal financial support to energy technologies is management information services inc 2008 analysis of federal expenditures for energy development prepared for the nuclear energy institute washington dc the misi analysis includes broade r funding as well as tax policy effects government services regulations and other forms of support that are not included for the cctp accounts it concludes that nearly threequarters of federal support for energy from 1950 to 2006 has promoted fossil fuels 55 see crs report rl33970 greenhouse gas emission

or opposition to governmental picking and choosing of technologies moreover there is much wider array of public incentives that affect private technology choice than those identified under the cctp these other incentives may support the climaterelated investments or may counteract them56 there are likely opportunities to improve efficiencies of federal stimulation of technological advance by reviewing them all as package and considering their cumulative effects 56 for example see crs report rl33578 energy tax policy history and current issues by salvatore lazzari or misi 2008 opcit

major program in president bushs climate change strategy was international climate change assistance to encourage other countries to slow and then reduce their emissions of greenhouse gas emissions major policy challenge is negotiating international commitments to address climate change after 2012 and especially gaining global engagement in ghg mitigation developing countries have stated that their degree of participation will depend on the degree to which the industrialized countries have fulfilled their commitments under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc these commitments include financial and technological assistance to the lower income countries and to countries that may be harmed by policies to abate greenhouse gas ghg emissions the united states as one of the wealthiest nations and the leading emitter historically of ghg is considered worldwide to have extraordinary responsibility to address climate change most people consider that while addressing climate change must be common global effort the united states must play leading role among nations president bushs request would have more than tr ipled federal funding of climate

reductions and preparations for adaptation to climate change according to the cif website two trust funds are being created under the climate investment funds the clean technology fund will invest in

longterm greenhouse gas savings the second fund the strategic climate fund will be broader and more flexible in scope it will serve as an overarching fund for various programs to test innovative approaches to climate change the first program under this fund is pilot aimed at increasing climate resilience in developing countries forest investment program and scalingup renewable energy program are also expected to be created in the coming months 58 the financing is intended to help meet existing commitments of the united states and other developed countries for financial assistance to developing countries this commitment would supplement other obligations under the united nations framework convention on climate change for which some multilateral mechanism exist see for example the discussion on the global environmental facility below accompanying the funds is the hope that the commitment will increase trust and garner developing countries engagement in new ghg mitigation commitments in the current round of negotiations on climate change actions59 60 there is general acknowledgment that more and more effective assistance to developing countries would be necessary to reduce their ghg trajectories several debates however have emerged over the ctf which technologies should be financed which countries should receive ctf assistance should funds aim at transforming recipients energy economies or at making marginal changes in large countries might the ctf substitute for reform of world bank policy to make all its investments less emitting andperhaps most strategichow does the ctf fit into the confusing set of existing and emerging f unds to promote ghg mitiga tion and adaptation to climate change

the conference of the parties to the unfccc set up the least developed countries fund ldc fund to assist the poorest countries to adapt to climate change it restricts eligibility to least developed

resolution continues funding through march 6 2009 at fy2008 levels which did not include an explicit contribution to the ldc fund the unfccc parties also set up the special climate change fund sccf to leverage additional resources from bilateral and multilateral sources in four areas of action adaptation to climate change transfer of technologies energy transport agriculture forestry and waste management and activities to assist diversification of the economies of those developing countries that depend greatly on fossil fuel production the united states has not contributed to the sccf parties to the kyoto protocolthe united states is not partyalso set up an adaptation fund af the af is to be financed at least in part by 2 surcharge on emission reduction credits exchanged through the kyoto protocols clean development mechanism cdm it may also be financed by voluntary contributions of countries or private entities the united states is not obligated to contribute to the af but may face pressure to make voluntary contributions the degree to which congress appropriates assistance to developing countries will likely influence the degree to which the department of state can enhance us credibility and garner developing countries engagement in ne w ghg mitigation commitments for the post2012 period on the other hand providing assistance alone cannot guarantee that developing countries will consider it measurable reportable and verifi able finance technology and capacitybuilding as called for under the bali action plan of 2007 another issue in some countries views is whether financial assistance provided outside of the financial mechanisms of the unfccc should be regarded as fulfilling financial commitments under the convention controversy is likely as well over how multilateral funds might be managed further issues concern whether financing will be considered new and additional any conditions placed on the financing and whether the funds are

fourth major type of financial support to climate change activities reported by the administration is tax provisions or tax expenditures tax provisions often not for the explicit purpose of addressing climate change may cont ribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by establishing incentives for incremental investments in technologies eg wind energy that emit less than the technologies they are thought to replace eg fossil fuel combustion in its federal expenditures reports omb enumerates certain tax expenditures which are the estimated loss of federal revenues that result from taxpayers taking advantage of these preferential tax treatments ombs estimates of tax expenditures rose sharply overall from 580 million in fy2003 to 152 billion in fy2007 table 1 the rise in the estimates from fy2006 to fy2007 was primarily due to expected loss of revenues resulting from tax incentives included in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 these provisions were due to expire at the end of 2008 67 omb projected the estimated tax expenditures to remain at 152 billion for fy2008 and then fall to 14 billion in fy2009 and continue to decline through 2013 these projections are likely altered by the extension in late 2008 of various incentives for renewable energy included in the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 one policy issue related to the tax provisions is their continuity over periods of time that are consistent with planning and construction of large capital projects including commercial wind and other renewable energy installations because these take number of years to execute tax provisions may not predictably be available for sufficiently long period for investors to take advantage of them for entirely new facilities as opposed to facilities that may already have been planned this could reduce the effectiveness of tax incentives to help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on the other hand the tax incentives are intended to stimulate deployment of new technologies rather than to support market that may not become commercially viable the full effects of tax incentives could be understood only in the context of other tax provisions that support activities that may aggravate climate change such as support for fossil fuel production and use data on these are not provided by omb existence of tax incentives for both lowghgemitting technologies and highghgemitting technologies likely counteract each other and together would mask the full cost of energy to consumers while tax provisions support variety of policy objectives such as energy security and employment overall efficiencies may be gained by revising the counteracting provisions in the context of meeting several objectives together and supporting winwinmeasures such analysis however is beyond the scope of this report 68 67 tax expenditures were reported for 11 types of tax credits deductions and exclusions for wide variety of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments ombs estimated value of these tax expenditures jumped sharply from 369 million in fy2005 to 116 billion in fy2006 and to 173 billion in fy2007 this rise in estimates was primarily based on tax incentives authorized in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 specifically in title xiii of that statute the energy tax incentives act of 2005 68 for related analysis see crs report

energy production foreign assistance and tradenot single integrated strategy the current federal effort largely has been built bottom up from variety of existing programs presidential initiatives and congressionallydirected activities choices tend to be based on departmental missions and the degree of support for the input activities there is synthesis that establishes quantitatively or even qualitatively how federal funding will lead to accomplishment of national climate change goal as presidentelect barack obama stated on decemb er 15 2008 that the effort before us will demand coordination across the government and my personal engagement as president 69 to assist with these he has designated former ep administrator carol browner to be assistant to the president for energy

legislative language required the executive branch to report crosscut budget for climate change activities as had been the case for more than decade the executive branch consequently did not produce

budget information is limited spreadsheets were available upon request to the office of management and budget the absence of requirement for crossprogram crosscut budget continues into fy2009 agencies

climate change funding without such an ombassisted crosscut the congress may elect to continue with the status quo in terms of separate agency budget reports which may or may not identify climate changerelated programs or wish to reinstate reporting requirement for climate change funding and tax incentives if the congress were to require annual reports as it did for more than decade it may wish also to consider specifying the criteria for including funding since many programs may exist primarily for other purposes as well as detailed supporting information that could improve the clarity consistency and usefulness of such reports to congress it may also be helpful for budget justifications to be more clear about both increases and decreases to activities the stakeholders affected and their priorities and to facilitate transparency for decisionmaking and bargaining about the tradeoffs presidents historically have categorized agencies climate changerelated efforts and funding into three broad programs science technology and international assistance in recent years the office of management and budget has also prov ided estimates of annual tax incentives these broad groupings given the limited information typically available from each agency may not clearly express the objectives of many activities for example agencies may consider some programs to be directed say at impact assessment and management of adaptation or at policy analysis neither of which fits neatly into those three program categories hence the traditional omb reporting by three broad programs may not meet the needs of congress in its oversight and appropriations functions if the congress were to require annual funding or expenditure reports it may also wish to specify how to organize the information to increase its usefulness different organization of budgetary information might for example be aligned with elements of climate change legislation likely to be considered in the 111 th congress in addition it could be organized by its expected contributions to measurable objectives of climate policy the priorities and achievements of funded climate change efforts have frequently been evaluated at the level of component activities but not at more integrated levelexcept for the climate change science program the climate chan ge science program ccsp and component elements have arranged numerous prospective and retrospective evaluations by the national research council particularly the committee on strategic advice on the us climate change science program and other independent bodies similar degree of evaluation has not been performed on the climate change technology prog ram cctp although it now constitutes more than twothirds of all federal funding for climate change nor has evaluation been conducted of the international assistance effort and broader foreign policy on climate change entity has been charged with or provided an evaluation of the federal effort in its entirety such evaluations may be useful however if calls for additional resources to address climate change are to be persuasive given many competing national priorities within constrained federal budget

decline of funding for climate change science by 23 adjusted for inflation from fy2001 to the fy2008 enacted level led to less buying power to support satellitebased observations and proportionately greater decline for other types of observations and for research analysis and applications external evaluations of the ccsp suggest that improvements would be beneficial in overall leadership and

climate changerelated programs while some stakeholders may disagree with the federal balance of funding across techno logy types almost all agree on the importance of advancing lowemitting

five years these funds may help to achieve global participation in abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change major policy challenge is negotiating international commitments to address climate change after 2012 and especially gaining global engagement in ghg mitigation veloping countries have stated that their degree of participation will depend on the degree to which the industrialized countries have fulfilled their commitments under the united nations framework convention on climate change these commitments include financial and technological assistance to the lower income countries and to countries that may be harmed by policies to abate ghg emissions the united states as one of the wealthiest nations and the leading emitter cumula tively of ghg is considered worldwide to have extraordinary responsibility in addressing climate change many people consider that though addressing climate change must be common global effort the united states must play leading role among nations from this perspective the united states and other industrialized countries have already attained high standard of living and have greater financial and technological resources to address climate change than developing countries in view of these facts the united states committed in 1992 along with other wealthy countries under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc to provide financial and technological assistance to emerging economies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to climate change the

promote coal use and forestall ghg abatement there are additional funds and bilateral channels as well for providing assistance under the unfccc moreover many countries seek technological cooperation with the united states not strictly financing federal programs and private partnership will establish the united states role as leader collaborator or follower depending on their future character the degree to which congress appropriates funds for cooperation with and assistance to developing countries will arguably influence the degree to which the department of state can enhance us credibility and garner developing countries engagement in new ghg mitigation commitments for the post2012 period on the other hand providing assistance alone cannot guarantee that developing countries will

assistance provided outside of the financial mechanisms of the unfccc should be regarded as fulfilling financial commitments under the convention controversy is likely as well over how multilateral funds might be managed further issues concern whether financing will be considered new and additional any conditions placed on the financing and whether the funds are adequate and predictable

enacted that may stimulate technologies that emit less ghg than those currently common one policy issue related to tax provisions is their continuity over periods of time that are consistent with planning and construction of large capital projects including commercial wind and other renewable energy installations because these take number of years to execute tax provisions may not predictably be available for sufficiently long period for investors to take advantage of them for entirely new facilities as opposed to facilities that may already have been planned the dela through most of 2008 in renewing expiring incentives for certain renewable energy investments for example may have reduced their effectiveness to help to reduce ghg emissions because of uncertainties and reduced investor confidence in addition tax credits may not be as effective in the current economic situation in which both profit potential is down and financing is difficult to obtain and may have little effect on individuals or entities that do not pay enough taxes to take advantage of the tax credits few evaluations have been conducted of the effectiveness and efficiency of tax incentives although controversies exist regarding whether tax incentives or other mechanisms are most efficient in achieving policy goal eg in debates over tax credits or grants for weatherization existence of tax incentives for both low ghgem itting technologies and high ghgemitting technologies likely counteract each other and together would mask the full cost of energy to consumers executive branch reporting on climate change expenditures only reports tax incentives that may stimulate ghg reductions while tax provisions support variety of policy objectives such as energy security and employment data on these are not provided by omb potentially counteracting incentives to assist consideration of the overall effects on greenhouse gas emissions overall efficiencies may be gained by revising counteracting tax provisions in the context of meeting several objectives together and supporting winwinmeasures

the packaging of mostly existing programs into climate change strategy has resulted in an apparent lack of unifying mission across agencies to address climate change funding for climate change activities has largely reflected departmental missions and support for each activity rather than each activitys expected contribution to an overarching strategy this is not surprising given the variety of stakeholders and their priorities the new obama administration is expected to provide more actionoriented leadership but will face challenge of understanding climaterelated programs and funding and aligning those into an effective crossagency inter governmental mission as policy needs have evolved there increasingly have emerged overlaps and gaps among climaterelated program areas for example there are gaps in us governance infrastructure such as data management and accessibility and public communications federal resources for economic evaluations of options and other policy analyses are well under 1 of total funding many stakeholders have argued that programs to assess potential impacts of climate change and plan for adaptation are underfunded although the analytical perspectives for the fy2009 request 72 stated that the fy2009 proposal for the ccsp would add emphasis to researching the impacts of climate change and for the science of adaptation such added emphasis was not apparent in the documentation available in the multiagency crosscut nor in individual agencies budget submissions at the same time in some instances several agencies all manage programs to address given issue such as sequestration of carbon by soils and vegetation or development of greenhouse gas emissions estimates and there may be opportunities to improve efficiencies across programs finally there may be numerous mundane but important constraints on funding that may weaken efficiency or effectiveness of climate changerelated programs such administrative requirements or constraints can include authorities to use contracts versus grants whether agencies may finance entities in foreign countries sufficiency of travel money to collaborate or oversee international activities authorization of personal services contracts etc one potentially important element in the success of programs is the expertise of federal officials in these programs and whether federal policies enhance or hinder the recruitment development and effective use of personnel barriers to job mobility of federal personnel across programs and departments also likely discourage development interaction and collaboration across agencies and disciplines number of sources have reported that finding funds can be problematic for interagency teams to accomplish specific common good tasks although there have been some adjustments to address some of the issues above number of critics argue that there remain important weaknesses in the federal program some have concluded that structuralpotentially legislativefixes are necessary as result many proposals within and outside of the us congress to restructure and expand climate change programs may be debated in the 111 th congress the congress may seek ways to encourage integrated strategies across climate change programs and to minimize fragmentation of legislative measures across committee jurisdictions given the high profile and growing accord that addressing climate change appears to have in the legislative agenda 72 executive office of the president analytical perspectives budget of the united

interest in how federal funding may reflect and enable an overall strategy to address climate change with deepening budget pressures calls to expand funding to address climate change may face challenges in demonstrating program benefits that can compete effectively with other demands in addition with directionchanging pledges by the new president and an evolving congressional debate over appropriate policies to address climate change priorities among climate change activities will likely change such discussion could be served by improved reporting of funding in addition this review of federal funding of climate change activities suggests that there will be opportunities to better align funding with strategic policy goals and to assure that programs are organized to accomplish those goals efficiently g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561 crs report rl31931 climate change federal laws and policies related to greenhouse gas reductions by brent d

the us greenhouse gas intensity the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of economic activity gdpby 18 through 201273 in parallel us programs to address climate change have aimed at reducing scientific uncertainties advancing development and introduction of energy efficient renewable and other low or nonemitting technologies and improving standards for measuring and registering emissions reductions specific outcomeoriented performance targets were set for selected programs such as for greenhouse gas reductions achieved by epas appliance efficiency energy star program and several other voluntary partnerships quantitative greenhouse gas science or technology performance targets have not been identified for most of the climaterelated funding requests on april 16 2008 president george w bush announced new national goal for climate policyto halt increases in us emissions of ghg by 202574 emissions would begin to decline thereafter so long as technology continues to advance75 according to president bush the united states would achieve this goal by regulatory measures and market incentives to encourage use of clean technologies president bush said that the united states would be willing to include this plan in future international agreement as long as all other major emitting economies also include their plans in the agreement some stakeholders have criticized the new bush policy for proposing any cap on future emissions while others have criticized it as too little too late president bushs 2002 strategy established new cabinetlevel committee on climate change science and technology integration figure b1 to oversee the implementation of the science and technology research programs across agencies this committee meets approximately quarterly typically at the deputies level the principal program design and management occurs within each agency according to the bush administration the strategy thus puts accountability and leadership for the science and technology programs in each of the relevant agencies others argue that this leads to less effective collabora tion and accountability for the crosscutting climate change goals than if there were greater central authority for the programs communication and coordination are facilitated through series of interagency working groups that meet with varying frequencies budget levels are established primarily through dialogue between each agency and omb this contrasts with the practice in the early 1990s of reaching agreement among the science agencies about any increments to the global change research budgets 73 the businessasusual decline for this period was estimated to be about 14 74 this is not the first quantitative ghg goal set for us climate change policy on april 21 1993 president william j clinton announced our nations commitment to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000 consistent with the article 4 aim of the unfccc the challenge in meeting that aim with voluntary measures only led to agreement on mandatory ghg reduction obligations in the kyoto protocol 75 white house fact sheet taking additional action to confront climate

other efforts president bushs fy2009 proposal would have increased nasas ccsp funding by 1256 million12 more than the enacted fy2008 levels under the continuing resolution for fy2009 nasas share of all ccsp funding remains approximately 58 spacebased observations of nasas fy2008 funding 666 million 62 was for acquiring observations by satellites of the total 1256 million increase proposed by president bush over fy2008 1023 million would have boosted satellitebased observations based on recommendations from the nrc decadal survey and in light of the decline of funding for these observations in recent years 77 if enacted president bushs proposal for fy2009 would have increased the satellite share to 769 million 64 of nasas total in order to ensure continuity of key climaterelated data the total solar irradiance sensor tsis would be restored to the first satellite scheduled to fly in the national po larorbiting operational environmental satellite system npoess in addition the clouds and earth radiant energy system ceres would be placed on the npoess preparatory project the precursor mission for npoess the data acquired by these two sensors would help to determine how much solar variability may be contributing to observed climate variability and how clouds and other atmospheric changes may influence the earths energy balance and the climate these and other technologies had been cut from nasas budget in 2006 in response to costoverruns and other problems 78 simultaneously earth sciences have been low among nasas pr iorities funds were shifted from fy2005 from programs that support climate change to other priorities such as the vision for space exploration an nrc report in 2006 charged with examining the balance concluded the program proposed for space and earth science is not robust it is not properly balanced to support healthy mix of small medium and large missions and an underlying foundation of scientific research and advanced technology projects and it is neither sustainable nor capable of making adequate progress toward the goals that were recommended in the national research councils decadal surveys 79 77 national

ccsp these revisions make comparison of budget authority difficult to track across multiple years elements of several satellite systems including the landsat data continuity mission the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and portions of the highend computing and scientific computing projects were newly included in the fy2006 request and 2007 white house report nasa is one of several agencies that support satellitebased climaterelated observations but is the only one that presents this funding distinctly in its ccsp budget submissions for example most of the proposed increase for noaa for fy2009 is also to support the same satellitesensor systems the department of defense also contributes through its defense meteorological satellite program usgs has additional efforts data management analysis and applied sciences within nasas earth science account applied sciences and education and outreach ar supposed to provide bridge between nasas missions and potential usersparticularly in the federal agenciesin order to ensure that societal benefits accrue from nasa investments nasa reports that its fy2009 budget would support evaluation and assessment of potential policy market and technologybased approaches to adapting to or mitigating the impacts of climate change as well as the impact of climate change on infectious diseases while funds for the satellitebased observations have declined in recent years the funding for other observations and for research and analysis have declined faster the nrc study that assessed balance among nasa science programs recommended in particular that nasa should move immediately to correct the problems caused by reductions in the base of research and analysis programs 81 despite that 2006 recommendation the nrc decadal survey that recommended enhanced space missions82 also noted that cutting research and analysis of observations from missions already launched reduces the return on investment from the high frontend expenditures to acquire satellitebased data recent nrc study also commented that users of nasa require better access to the data rather than new modeling or data analysis tools83

not apparent in the fy2009 proposal for noaa almost all the increases pr oposed are for observational capacities not applied research assessment or planning the proposal would have redistributed funding within noaa seve ral decreases would have partially offset an increase of 74 million to develop key satellite climate sensors the continuing resolution until march 6 2009 puts such

outgoing radiation as well as the total solar irradiance sensor tsis sensor to help determine solar variations as one driver of climate variability and change the two sensors could help distinguish the solar influence from other factors such as greenhouse gases driving climate variability and change these climate sensors had been demanifested in 2006 from the national polarorbiting operational

emerging and reemerging infectious diseases allergens and preparedness with the fy2008 appropriations hrept 110231 contained the following language pertaining to climate change additional scientific research is needed to further understand the potential health effects of global climate change and to identify tools to educate health professionals about adaptation strategies the committee encourages cdc to begin to develop public health research technical assistance and surveillance programs to understand the impacts of climate change on health p 116 in responding to this language the cdc identified 11 priority health actions and developed policy statement the agency reports that five workshops were planned to explore these issues further in october 2008 the world health organization who released an agenda of research priorities to address the health effects of climate change globally the main research priorities were interactions with other health determinants and trends such as economic development globalization urbanization and inequities both in exposure to health risks and access to care better characterization of longterm climate change effects through drought freshwater resources and population displacement including risks to mental health with focus on children and other vulnerable groups comparing effectiveness of shortterm interventions dealing with such health threats as heatwaves and floods assessing health impact of policies of nonhealth sectors including effects of biofuels incentives on food security and malnutrition strengthening

the fy2009 request included numerous changes to funding that congress enacted for fy2008 to support does climate change technology programs some of these proposed changes include 155 million 11 reduction for energy efficiency and renewable energy largely because of proposed elimination of lowincome weatherization grants small business innovation research support and state energy activities as well as reductions for hydrogen fuel cell research increases are proposed for geothermal systems biofuels and vehicle building and industrial technologies 5 million 5 reduction for energy supply and conservation for electricity transmission and distribution 251 million 51 increase for fossil energy research and developmentefficiency and sequestration including 52 increase carbon sequestration 52 million and almost tripling of the funding for futuregen to 156 million 365 million 71 increase for nuclear energy supply and conservation to support the global nuclear energy partnership and 208

house and senate passed bills in 2008 co vering most of the cctp appropriations and agreed on conference bill the amounts in these bills which never were enacted into law frequently deviated substantially from the fy2008 levels and the fy2009 request 98 in particular both chambers rejected elimination of the doe weatherization grants the continuing resolution that holds funding for almost all other programs to the fy2008 levels includes special provisions to add 250 million for weatherization division of pl 110329 from fy2003 to fy2004 the total budget authority for doe for the cctp

reduction of major pollutants its focus was reported by omb to have shifted to improving efficiency which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced funding for nuclear energy has increased by hundreds of millions of dollars in several different programs and it has become large share of cctp funding however less was enacted for nuclear than requested for fy2008 the fy2009 request would increase that funding almost to the level requested for fy2008 and would make nuclear energy more than half of the nccti funding if enacted according to does fy2009 budget justificati on the nuclear energy rd program is intended to develop new nuclear energy generation technologies to meet energy and climate goals however opponents have criticized does nuclear research program as providing wasteful subsidies to an industry that they believe should be phased out as unacceptably hazardous and economically uncompetitive the bush administrations global nuclear energy partnership gnep has been intended to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel without creating pure plutonium that could be readily used for nuclear weapons according to does budget justification such technologies could allow greater expansion of nuclear power throughout the world with reduced risk of nuclear weapons proliferation but nuclear opponents have disputed does contention that nuclear recycling technology can be made sufficiently proliferationresistant for widespread use in 2008 the house appropriations committee sharply criticized gnep as rushed poorlydefined expansive and expensive and eliminated all funding for the program on the other hand the house panel would have dramatically boosted funding for advanced nuclear reactors however fy2008 funding levels continue under the continuing resolution until march 6 2009 president obama has indicated that he would support safely harness nuclear energy as component of strategy to address climate change it is likely that further scrutiny and modifications of nuclear energy initiatives will continue in the 111 th congress and under the obama administration

for fy2008 president bushs budget proposal would have increased that funding by an additional 214 million in fy2008 to 1310 million though with increases and decreases across the different services dod appropriations for fy2009 were passed into law and signed on september 30 2008 pl 110329 because the climate changerelated activities are below the appropriations account detail it is unclear at this time what changes may have been made to the fy2008 enacted or fy2009 requested levels the administration requested to raise air force funding for the cctp by 817 million from fy2008 to total of 103 million fy2009 it would decrease cctprelated funding to the army by 419 million from the fy2008 enacted level to 164 million in fy2009 and to the navy by 162 million to 111 million in fy2009 further information was obtainable regarding the uses of these proposed funds however the dod would have many incentives and opportunities to engage in advanced lowgreenhouse gas technologies in 2005 the dod accounted for 97 of all us government fuel consumption at federal expense of more than 8 billion at 2005 energy prices 102 more than half of this consumption was by the air force more broadly the defense science board dsb issued report in february 2008 that concluded that the dods current energy consumption patterns put military operations at risk both in the battlefield due to high and expensive fuel demand and at installations due to dependence on an increasingly fragile electricity grid it noted that even in battlespace one half or more of demand may come from equipment such as air conditioners and field kitchens not combat equipment it 101 titlebytitle details of usdas farm bill recommendations are available at httpwwwusdagovwpspor

recommendations from 2001 task force on energy institutionally the task force concluded that solving dods energy problem would take more than producing documents establishing the new policies procedures and analytical products recommended by this report it depends on leaderships willingness to provide the oversight to ensure they are effective currently d ecisions that affect dods energy demand are scattered throughout the organization with little accountability or oversight while there is senior official with responsibility for energy use at installations this function oversees only about quarter of dods energy usage th task force recommends senior leadership establish oversight and accountability for implementing the recommendations in this report and ongoing measurement of their progress across the whole of dod this 2008 report recommended among other meas ures that dod establish departmentwide strategic plan that establishes measurable goals achieves the business process changes recommended by the 2001 dsb report and establishes clear responsibility and accountability executive summary p 6 decisions and technologies to enhance dods energy security could have profound implications for its related greenhouse gas decisions one vision of relying on alternative fuels produced from oil shale and other unconventional fossil fuels has been controversial however because of its potential for dramatically increasing net greenhouse gas emissions associated with aviation fuels this dispute culminated in constraint in the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 barring all agencies from procuring alternative fuels that resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil fuelsmost critical for the dod which accounts for almost all federal oil consumption similar language was debated in the fy2009 appropriations for dod but was not enacted the dsb after considering the climate change implications for dod concluded the global movement toward constraints on future carbon emissions is gaining support dod cannot be oblivious to this trend thus the task force recommends that if dod decides to provide financial backing to synthetic fuel production plants it should avoid investing in processes that exceed the carbon footprint of petroleum the task force recommends dod continue to invest in low carbon synthetic fuel technologies that address unique pressing dod needs for example equipment capable of producing fuel at forward deployed locations using locally available renewable or waste feedstock reduces gallon for gallon the amount needed to be moved and protected in theater dod should continue to invest in research into alternative nonpetroleum renewable and lowcarbon footprint fuels for the long term p 22 the dods defense advanced research projects agency darpa has been acclaimed by some experts for its contributions to technological advance broadly some technology experts have advocated for an expansion of this program to take on mission of advancing energy technologies to enable deep cuts from current greenhouse gas emission levels like new apollo project the congress appropriated funds of 63 million to initiate such an expansion darpae in fy2007 the administration proposed to eliminate this funding in dod for fy2009 saying that such research could be accomplished through similar programs in doe in 2008 the 110 th congress amended section 118 of title 10 united states code the department of defense dod authorization to require dod to consider the effects of climate change on

defense missions to update defense plans accordingly and to engage with allies and partners on climate mitigation strategies capacity building and relevant research and development and to develop the capabilities to reduce future impacts the new authorization also requires that the next quadrennial defense review assess dods capacities to respond to the consequences of climate change including extreme weather events both domestically and abroad it directs such assessment to use midrange scenarios of future climate change which may have roughly 5050 likelihood of occurring the subsequent

million in fy2009 under the continuing resolution funding will continue at fy2008 levels through march 6 2009 epa s role has been primarily in inventorying and evaluating greenhouse gas emissions from alternative sectors and technol ogies and operating voluntary programs that provide information technical assistance and marketing incentives to private and public entities to quantify and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 103 epa also provides key scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions and analyses of the economic impacts of mitigation strategies including proposed legislationthat are widely used by congress and the public president bushs proposal would have reduced epas funding for the energy star buildingrelated programs by 40 million from the fy2008 omnibus appropriations energy star is one of the principal voluntary ghg reduction initiatives and garners large portion of the ghg reductions expected by president bushs climate change strategy the budget would cut 13 million by eliminating the congressionallydirected industrial carbon outreach program the agency evaluates options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles including effects of biofuel mandates that have been legislated or proposed the fy2009 request would have reduced these transportation activities by 69 million to 119 million president bushs proposal would also have elim inated congressionallydirected funding for greenhouse gas reporting registry enacted at 34 million in the fy2008 omnibus appropriations the joint explanatory statement for the fy2008 omnibus appropriations directed epa to use 35 million before an acrosstheboard 16 recision appropriated within the federal support air quality management program to develop and publish rule requiring mandatory reporting of emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy the draft and final rules are due later than nine and 18 months respectively after enactment president bushs fy2009 proposal would not have continued the 34 million appropriated for fy2008 to develop this national greenhouse gas registry causing angry responses from some senators 103 for more information see

equitable functioning of any program to limit emissions and provisions for early reporting may facilitate rewarding those sources that show leadership in ghg reductions ahead of possible mandatory controls number of initiatives are underway besides the current epa effort that would develop guidance for how sources would report their greenhouse gas emissions and emission reductions in the event of mandatory reporting requirements initiative prior to epa s effort including does 402a program has gained widespread agreement as sufficient for mandatory requirement epa s fy2009 budget justification likely refers to the existence of these other initiatives when it states that epa is reviewing available data to maximize efficiency and reduce potential overlaps while exploring options for integration the fy2009 request proposed to add 50 million to support the asiapacific partnership see section on international assistancea request that has been repeatedly denied in previous years appropriations without fy2008 enacted funding none is available under the continue resolution through march 9 2009 as in other agencies the appropriations line items for the epa longer reflect current
