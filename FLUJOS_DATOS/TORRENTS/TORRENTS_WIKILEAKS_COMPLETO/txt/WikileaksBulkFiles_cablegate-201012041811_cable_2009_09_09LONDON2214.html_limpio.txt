present arguments needed 5 snf dfm ryabkov said it is important in the lead up to the revcon to find creative ways to present our arguments citing egyptian skepticism us tauscher agreed that we need

the us and russia stand together on fuel assurances he said it was good idea and they should look for the right occasion ryabklov also raised the 13 steps suggesting that some elements were obe and

preparing for ratification of the ctbt by the senate including new study by the national academy another key priority for the us is the fmct we were encouraged by the steps in the conference on

would welcome early us ctbt ratification russia had talked to the pakistanis about the fmct but dfm ryabkov indicated that they were quite evasive he urged the us to engage the pakistanis tauscher

reached by the two presidents in moscow regarding missile defense joint threat assessment and the joint data exchange center jdec responding to her proposal to send team to moscow to get russias intelligence assessment on the iranian missile threat ryabkov said that missile defense remains difficult london 00002214 003 of 007 issue for russia the presidential text was good guidance but russia

missiles 11 snf dfm ryabkov asked about the status of the russia 123 agreement us tauscher responded that some in congress are interested in moving forward on the 123 agreement and that further

contract for the sale of the s300s and acknowledged that russia needed to make decision regarding the s300 sale to iran an issue that has been the subject of utmost attention in many places russia is in position of growing difficulty for not honoring its contractual obligations and finances aside russia is getting points in iran ryabkov said russia understands the us and israeli arguments and

switching off the system to be quite high the runup to the end date of start could create difficulties us tauscher stated that we have the right to monitor until december 5 to which ryabkov replied that goes without saying tauscher went on that we see merit in continuing with the votkinsk system in the new agreement if the final decision is not to continue the system we are prepared to work out an arrangement that maintains our rights through december 4 contractors can box and ship the equipment there are ways to manage this she said conventional forces in europe cfe 13 snf dfm ryabkov said

comfortable with the current situation russia london 00002214 004 of 007 however does not want to return to the old treaty cfe adaptation plus more is required flank limitations are the core problem ryabkov said turkey is not that concerned about flank limitations but wants to keep the system for its own reasons there could be chance to move innovatively regarding cfe but the current situation is unsustainable 14 snf ryabkov concluded by saying russia wants someone on the us side who will deal with this issue on regular basis with mfa security and arms control director anatoly antonov russia

us and russia are now cooperating in many ways us tauscher said she has seen interest on the part of the other members of the australia group in russian membership given the concerns with respect to

tauscher asked that russia look further into the enduse controls on manportable airdefense systems manpads transferred to venezuela to ensure they do not wind up with the revolutionary armed forces of columbia farc ryabkov affirmed russias commitment to ensure legitimate enduser certificates and the ability to conduct inspections this is true for manpads the information provided was fragmentary he

tense situation between venezuela and colombia chinese perspective ctbt 17 snf us tauscher opened the discussion with chinese viceminister of foreign affiars he yafei with description of us

preoccupation the country views normalization of its relations with the us as the only way out of its current mess china believes the dprk leadership is anxious about economic development but they believe their security concerns override their economic concerns nonetheless there are signs the dprk is reaching out dprk wants bilateral talks with the us not sixparty talks china wants the sixparty talks to continue the dprk wants something in return to restart the talks vfm he asserted that china is encouraging the dprk to return to the sixparty talks china is also trying to convince the dprk

the three countries unsc summit 27 snf regarding the september unsc heads of state summit maisonnave observed that it could be difficult if not impossible to achieve consensus on specific language regarding the dprk and iran but strong generic message would help this was important to french political authorities us tauscher agreed and asked if there were other political messages france wanted

nonproliferation mechanisms briens expressed one small caveat about such mechanisms citing french displeasure with the global partnership and remarking that it provides huge benefit for russia by paying for its london 00002214 007 of 007 disarmament while russia builds submarines lets leverage what we have rather than spend money at the summit briens said maisonnave expressed appreciation for reassurance that the presidents summit would not be pledging conference fmct p3 coordination and red lines 31 snf us tauscher provided an update on start negotiations administration strategy regarding
