possession of controlled substance although the provision was not scheduled to go into effect until two years after the reauthorization debate regarding the implementation of the provision immediatel ensued many policymakers questioned the appropriateness of denying financial assistance to individuals who had already been convicted of crime and paid their debt to society other policymakers questioned the department of educations ed interpretation of the bills lang uage and their subsequent implementation of the policy the debate has continued since the last reauthorization of the hea g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 campus crimes including the sale and use of illegal drugs were among the topics discussed during the debates over the 1998 hea amendments during the discussion studies were introduced that illustrated that although campus crime rates in general were decreasing the number of drugrelated incidents on campuses was increasing 1 in various reauthorization hearings2 and in committee reports3 congress expressed concern about the increasing number of drug and alcoholrelated incidents occurring on college campuses during the reauthorization discussions representative souder stated that the country was facing an epidemic of drug abuse and proposed the provision on student eligibility as an important first step in dealing with this epidemic 4 congress ultimately added the provision to eliminate student eligibility for financial assistance for those who were convicted of drugrelated crimes as part of pl 1052445 g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 the legislation specifies that any student who is convicted6 of state or federal offense for the sale or possession of controlled substance7 shall not be

student aid handbook v olume 1 student eligibility any convictions that occurred prior to the student turning 18 unless the student was tried as an adult or any convictions that were overturned reversed or otherwise removed from the students record are not used in determining eligibility9 g20g142g145g138g139g146g149g146g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 student who is indefinitely ineligible for federal financial assistance must complete drug rehabilitation program in order to reacquire eligibility according to the program regulations 34 cfr 66840 an eligible rehabilitation program is one that meets the following requirements has received or is qualified to receive funds directly or indirectly under federal state or local government program is administered or recognized by federal state or local government agency or court has received or is qualified to receive payment directly or indirectly from federally or state licensed insurance company or is administered or recognized by federally or state licensed hospital health clinic or medical doctor in addition the rehabilitation program must include at least two unannounced drug tests participation in rehabilitation program reduces ineligibility to the preceding applicable period for example if student has been convicted three times for possession of controlled substance participation in rehabilitation program reduces the ineligibility period to the equivalent of two convictions eg two years from the date of the most recent remaining conviction person can participate in rehabilitation program for any of the convictions not just those resulting in indefinite ineligibility in addition future convictions will make the student ineligible again 9 the handbook can be accessed at

in response to the confusion and contention surrounding the provision the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 was enacted to change the manner in which the provision was being implemented the amended provision specifies that only those convictions for the sale or possession of controlled substance that occur while the student is enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving title iv student aid would disqualify student from receiving federal student aid the dra did not change the provisions pertaining to the period of ineligibility due to conviction for the sale or possession of controlled substance it remains that the period of ineligibility depends upon whether the conviction was for the sale or possession of controlled substance the recency of the conviction and the number of prior convictions g20g142g138g158g157g145g152g155g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 title iv of the hea may be considered in the upcoming reauthorization there are several legislative proposals to modify the existing drug conviction provision since its initial enactment issues have continued to arise including how th provision should be implemented what types of penalties if any should be imposed who should be penalized and whether there are other crimes that are more deserving of disqualifying student from receiving financial aid the following section presents brief analysis of selected issues that may be considered during the reauthorization discussions g21g146g151g144g149g146g151g144g561g17g158g157g561g6g155g158g144g561g3g139g158g156g142g561 in the discussions surrounding the addition of this provision to the student eligibility requirements during the 1998 reauthorization the increased incidence of drug usage on college campuses was continually referenced many policymakers expressed concern about the growing number of drugrelated crimes that were reported each year by institutions across the country largely in response to this increasing problem congress included this provision for eligibility however critics assert that drugs are unfairly being singled out representative frank is reported to contend that singling out drugs as the only crime for which student can lose financial aid eligibility treats drug convictions more harshly than rape arson or armed robbery 12 supporters maintain 12 greg winter furor over student
