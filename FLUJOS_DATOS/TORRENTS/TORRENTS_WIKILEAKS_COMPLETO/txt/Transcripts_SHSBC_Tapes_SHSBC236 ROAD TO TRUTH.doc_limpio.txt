the road to truth lecture given on 1 november 1962 all right here we are lecture two saint hill special briefing course 1 nov ad 12 i could give you very masterly lecture now on the subject of truth truth you see i dont really feel up to it but thats one of these histrionictype activitiesgiving lectures on truth ive stated it much better in other times and places i didnt keep any notes on what i was saying its very difficult go around remembering everything you know you get stuck its very applicable to talk about truth if one knows anything about missed withholds or really got the idea of what missed withholds are why you have to get some grip on this thing called truth there was fellow by the name of pontius somethingorother i think he went around washing his hands all the time he had some kind of fixation on it freudian complex before dianetics and he asked this propoundous propunderance what is truth and it was very good thing that he asked that at that particular time solved everything but the point here is that truth is very near ultimate see its quite close to an absolute in its most severe interpretation and if you were to say that something is true and not know at the same time the axiom that absolutes are unobtainable why you would fall into the error of putting positives where there existed only maybes and that is very very severe error ah theres been lot of blokes on the track of one type or another some of them wearing kimonos and some of them wearing togas and some of them wearing sandals and some of them wearing nothing at all and these fellows were always going around telling people what truth is chaps like plato and socrates and fellows of various momentphilosophers religionists vast numbers of peoplehave been peddling commodity called truth well truth is relative commodity and the best approach to truth is contained in mathematics that you probably will have very little knowledge of and i have very little conversance withits almost pretentious of to discuss this mathematicsbut it happens to be the mathematics which is used to connect up your telephone switchboards in major cities its how they select out subscribers and so forth they dont select them out with arithmetical truth arithmetic is theoretical truth but only so because theres commodity or definiteness connected with it it is truth of symbols as long as the symbols remain symbols and the only errors turn up when people say the symbols mean something and then they get into great deal of trouble they say two minus two equals nothing now thats very true statement as long as it remains totally in the abstract and is not applied to reality as soon as we say two apples minus two apples equals applesi dont know i think this is pretty good magicians trick lets look it over apple is relative thing what happened to this apple well the chemicals which composed the apple are still intact i dont care if it was eaten or boiled or baked or burned or buried there is still something of an apple we say well theres two apples on the table so we take two apples off the table and we have apples on the table ah well thats true thats true there are apples on the tableproviding time is right providing we can accept time as truth which i consider rather adventurous too because there were two apples on the table so we have to say if there are two apples on the table and we took two apples off the table there are now at this moment of mentionwhich is coincident with the exact removal of and with reference to the past or future and with reference only to this table in this place at this timeno apples now were getting much more positive about this you see and yet again that passes as truth well it probably is relatively speaking but the idea of saying two apples minus two apples equals apples is very very adventurous indeed because nobodyno thetan since the beginning of the worldif an apple existed ever totally asised an apple it presupposes the total asisness of something see it presupposes the perfect duplication of somethingness it presupposes all kinds of magic and yet in the course of fact digestion study all that sort of thing over the trillennia we have become accustomed to accepting such things as true now the figure two minus the figure two equals the goose egg nothing well as long as that is an abstract think we can say its true but then its only true because we have set it up to be true and the second we write it on the blackboard we have pieces of chalk now which are representing the symbols we have the symbols represented by symbol theres commodity has entered into it and somethingness has entered into it and it doesnt go someplace you ever erase blackboard you have to wash it pretty darn hard to get rid of the last problem in arithmetic that was written on it see you get all these relative facts relative truths now the person who adventures out on the road to truth adventures with great desperateness and i wish to pull long gray beard at that particular statement because statement about truth was ever relatively truer than that one person who would adventure on the road to truth is taking terribly adventurous step very adventurous philosopher who seeks to teachdiscover and teach truth is taking his life in his hands and that wouldnt be very important that he is taking his life in his hands what is far far far more important than that is he is taking in his hands the lives of great many other people therein lies his responsibility im not speaking about im just speaking about philosophers now what do i mean by its very adventurous thing what do i mean by that its because that is the only track you have to go the whole way on there is short stop on the road to truth that is the only track that you have to go all the way on once you have put your feet upon that road you have to walk to its end otherwise all manner of difficulties and upsets will beset you there is such thing as relative philosophical truth which is safe if it does not approach the actual composition of the subject matter it addresses now to be just little less pedantic about it you address the subject of this universe in the subject of the physical sciencesthe sciences and youre going to find that there are many weird things in your path if you are going to simply address it through the savants of the various quote sciences unquote heh the insouciance of these people you see to actually use the word exact science its an incredible impudence you walk into the chemistry department you find one construction of an atom there it is itll be sitting up there someplace around the department or the laboratory and itll show you the exact relations of molecules one to another in any given element and there it is ifs all in model form its put together with wiresand students can go and look at that and theyre all very fine and that student will be perfectly all right unless he goes over to the physics department because in the physics department they have an entirely different model and that is the same molecule of exactly the same element this is marvelous to behold because these two departments are each one departments of exact science and yet they are very often across the hall from each other the student gets very confused he goes into the chemistry department and if he doesnt say the atoms are composed this way that way and the other way hes gonna flunk man and he goes across the hall and heres an entirely different model has relationship to the first model and that is the atom of the same element that hes just been studying and hes going to get flunked in physics if he doesnt say its that way i think thats very fascinating these are exact sciences are they in the encyclopaedia britannica at the turn of the century theres an article there about time and space which is highly informative very wise man wrote that article and he said he didnt think many people will ever find out very much about time and space until they studied in the field of the mind and got the conceptual basis which preceded time and space now thats in the encyclopaedia britannica at the turn of the century with that much wisdom confronting them you would have thought that the exact sciences then would have pursued some interest in where all this came from but their mud theory got in their road they got all stuck up with it you know and there was that mud theory and oddly enough it isnt even new theory it is foundoh i think about three thousand years ago in india is the origin of our modern exact science mud theory and i think it originally was described and it was mud from there on down they got tired of explaining all this now there are the boys with their exact sciences and their exact truths and theyre playing with fire actually it may be called exact science to them but when they start telling people that these are truths that these are absolutes and then make model of the atom one way in the chemistry department and make it the other way in the physics department i think its time for somebody to decide they didnt know what they were doing the world right now is in most of its trouble because of the quote advances unquote in the field of physics in the field of physics they know how to blow something up but not how to keep it from blowing up or retard its blowing up at distance see they have all the overt weapons but none of the preventions for those weapons i consider this very fascinating because before you build an atom bomb you should have built sane man sane man precedes the structure now you have subject known as workable truth if you put glue on one piece of paper you can make it stick to itself or another piece of paper and thats workable truth you can use that post office department uses it to keep stamps on envelopes andall kinds of uses for this you see if you dig hole through mountain you can pave the bottom of the hole and cars dont have to drive over the top of the mountain dont you see and whole series of workable truths go into the construction of this tunnel and this roadway those are workable truths and this gives the exact sciences quote unquote very bloated notion of themselves because they deal with workable truths now in the field of man the first workable truth that anybody will try to give you is that nobody can do nothing about him nohow see nothing can be done about it truth exists in this field man is an animal based on chemistry where the hell did that come from its an animism of some kind or another its some kind of an odd theory or philosophy that grew up in revulsion against the control by religion of mens faith psychologypsycheologyis study which is peculiarly religious and is entirely and completely so up to 1879 when fellow by the name of wundt at leipzig germany concluded that men were animals and had psyches and he has taken off from the point of psyche as theorybut just mud and has gone forward and you have your modern psychology dont let anybody tell you that modern psychology is product of the physical sciences psychology in general is totally product of mans religion of yesteryear the only place its been taught has been in seminaries you get 1515 faculty psychology is taught in religious universities you get saint thomas aquinas 1200 and something writing textbooks on the subject and so forth this was entirely religious affair well nobody moved in on it sensibly somebody moved in on it in spirit of revolt just like religion has been blown up here and there down the track as the years have rolled on by the advances of the exact sciences socalled there had been an awful war in these two things so the exact sciences have now entrenched themselves in total falsehood in the field of the mind at the same time developing totally unworkable psychology to back up the exact science of blowing up the planet isnt that an interesting area to deadend well that gives you some of the liabilities of embarking on the track to truth and not going toward truth now buddha gautama siddhartha nobody should say any hard words about this man because he told everybody he was just man he was trying to set men free and he was trying to help people out and so forth and all that was perfectly true and he discovered how to exteriorize without being able to stably exteriorize without discovering any of the rules or laws of exteriorization without making it possible for anybody else to exteriorize at will how many hundred million people since twentyfive hundred years ago until now did gautama siddhartha totally condemn to utter and complete slavery by not walking down that road all the way because thatthose halftruths have been used and used and misused and abused and boobytrapped and monkeyed up and so forth thats merely because he didnt go all the way down the road dont you see now knowing this sort of thing it takes rather brave man to walk in the direction of truth because he knows very definitely that he must go on down the road if he knows anything at all he realizes that the traps of existence and the upsets of existence are composed of halftruths and that all work to amuse or enlighten or something is susceptible to being employed in the field of enslavement the slave makers always use it it serves as the mechanism to trap by the twoway flow dont you see somebody comes along and want to set everybody free and naturally the reverse flow on it is to trap everybody one has to recognize this as an action well we take this fellow aesop youve heard all about aesop youve read about the fox and the grapes and you read about all kinds of aesops fables of one kind or another now im sure that you are today much more moral person and much better for it the only trouble is that the original manuscripts of aesop were recently located and theres not moral in the lot they are just amusing stories about animals there is final lesson in any one of the stories every one of those lessons has been added to aesops fables and we today are accustomed to think of the moral as sort of an aesops fable thing you see he tells parable and that teaches us to be good and that wasnt what aesops fables were they were simply something to amuse people and lighten the tedious hour i think its quite wonderful it even enters the field of fairy tales now all of this is extremelynot apparently very pertinent to what you are doing but in actuality it is because in the microcosm of single human being of the single person you have the pattern of the macrocosm of the universe and one could deduce that the universe exists from series of basic postulates and proceeds on down the line in development from those postulates you could even spot the goal of gold the goal of lead you could even spot the methods of livelihood of quartz serpentine schist hornblende to name some combined elementsthe rules of what they do its not that these things are alive at all its that they follow certain dictated behavior pattern i was sitting looking at fly this morning while i was eating breakfast and he washed his face in exactly the way that all flies have washed their face for long time and he fixed up his wings in exactly the way flies fix up their wings and i thought i wonder how many hundred trillion scrillion quadrillion flies have washed their face that way and i thought to myself by golly its wonderful the way some postulates stick you get dead matter the world of insects lichen moss manit doesnt matter youre actually looking at the same cumulative structure based on certain intentions and dedications the whole world of chemistry could be reanalyzed on the subject of postulates and intentions the world of physics could be similarly analyzed instead of sitting there wondering how many microjilts are supposed to be imposed into the ohm an electronics man would much better spend his time if he really wanted to make some progress in an effort to analyze the pattern of intention which goes up and constructs certain power behavior what is this and if he could grasp that then he would grasp electricity but he shirks his duty by the simple reason that the first statement made to him as he walks into his polytechnic school or as he joined his boy scout troop doesnt matter where he connects with this stuff called electricity he always connects with itand his first postulate on it is nobody knows what electricity is and this is said to him as though it means something i think thats wonderful in fact everybody knows this statement but exactly what have they said analyze what theyve said theyve made remark they havent said anything theyve just remarked something they havent even given anybody any reason why nobody should they havent told you nobody could they just say nobody knows anything about it of course everybody is willing to agree that everybody is stupid so they let it ride thats the craziest thing i ever ran into nobody knows what electricity is i imagine thats taught that way in japanese today i imagine its taught that way in swedish german french italian to say nothing of english itll be soon taught that way in africanese ghanaese or whatever they talk down there i can hear it now now this stuff that goes snap crackle and popyou see it here you know goes snap crackle and pop well now the first thing you should know about thisthey always say this you seethe first thing you should know about this is that nobody knows what it is well that effectively keeps one from entering any road of truth that just puts one in bracket where he can be shocked blown up exploded fried where he can run out of batteries where he can go out in the cold morning and start to start his car and not have one start the direct and immediate results of this statement are everywhere around us today well that isnt road that has not been walked down that is road that is effectively barred everybody is saying by inference that you cant walk down that road thats the wildest thing i ever heard of and yet people have been telling people they couldnt find out about truth for long time and the only reason i really make fun of immanuel kant is the outrageousness of his premise ive even used some section of itto my shame but ive really used itbut its nice stuff to explain with you say to somebody you dont have to knowto begin this subject and to look it over and get some result in ityou dont have to know the totality of everything before you can begin on it you know in other words you dont have to have walked the whole path before you start to walk the whole path well to that degree the unknowable has some use but immanuel kant didnt use it that way he used it entirely differently he said there was the knowable and there was the unknowable and he said the unknowable aint never gonna be known by nobody and what i want to know is how did he find out about it and yet people at this minute are sitting in universities in the world listening with reverence and awe to those outrageous words that theres an unknowable that nobody will ever know anything about thats one to really tangle with man its outrageous even by philosophic examination if you cant ever sense it or experience it or be in time with it or have any clue of its existence then how do you know it exists to not be known about now i think you will find that there is considerable effort on the part of man wittingly or unwittinglyaberratedly certainlyto say that certain roads are closed and that those roads must never be opened it is very bad to know about the human mind well let tell you something if youre alive you know something about the human mind and ill tell you whats dangerous is never to find out any more about it thats dangerous and man today faces that danger and in just the last few daysjust the last few daysthe cobalt 60 was very close to spreading its fallout far and near over the steppes of russia and made in moscow or its suburbs was about to be scattered trademarked on scrap iron all over america because of what because it is so dangerous to begin to know anything about the human mind now people recognize that it is dangerous to some degree but dont really realize what really is dangerous because they know of the existence of something not to know all about that thing is dangerous and they are conceiving that they dont know anything at all about it and let propose that to you as the most idiotic premise in the field of the human mind theres little joe blow down here and you say do you understand women he says hell mand ever understand women he says you cant figure them out one day theyre this way one day theyre that way you ask his wife and you say you understand anything about men she said yes theyre pipe you know what theyre doing you know what its all about except you never get your way what are they talking about what are they talking about theyre talking about knowing something about somebodys mind arent they somebodys behavior pattern arent they in other words theyre aware of the existence of think figure calculate in other beings well that has already started on the road to research and knowledge in the human mind and it is very dangerous to go further so where do we get this thing if you embark upon line of truth as special action only proposed or done by few select individuals its the shopkeeper and the bus driver and everything else theyve all started to know something about it but it would be very dangerous indeed in fact it will cause their deaths not to know any more about it than they do i mean thats such an acceptable fact to you it doesnt even seem to be startling fact not knowing any more about the mind than they do will bring about their demise they will die from this everybody says yes of course you see how accepted it is and yet its quite startling fact theyre going to get an ultimate extinction through starting upon this stupid line but lets take specialized case where group of individuals decide to go for broke on the subject of knowing about the human mind theyre going to make clean break theyre going to go through this and theyre going to go down the line and theyre going to know all about this and somebody amongst them is going to tear the answers up left and right and dig them out from underneath this and that and the other thing and theyre really going to make some progress along that line listen the more they know the less dangerous it is the really dangerous entrance point is to suppose that people think and know nothing more about it than that thats dangerous not to walk off that point further in the direction of truth is dangerous action but any philosopher who singles himself out or any engineer or any research person who singles himself out as the person who is going to be spotted as the person who is walking that tracknow that becomes very very dangerous if this person doesnt walk the whole track see thats selectively dangerous you share in some of that dangerousness its been so boobytrapped that everything is very suspicious of anything being known be cause people who have jumped up and said something is known have very often lied now if they have pretended to know more than other people on this subject they have then committed overts and if they have then turned up some little piece of bricabrac and have never gotten any further than that but spread this bricabrac in all directions as the true wisdom they have committed the overt of committing perhaps millions or billions of human beings to slavery and i think thats considerable overt so theres substitute for walking the track youve got to go on down that road particularly in spot such as mine you got to bring this off man now theres never been any doubt in my mind about bringing off this particular study this is not something i have engaged in any doubts about ive sometimes wondered whether or not the time factor wouldnt upset things because we also have another time factor involved over here called world situation and ive needed few clear years and that has sometimes worried little bit but the fait accompli was pretty easy to envision because wed already made the sevenleague boot strides necessary to put us way on down the track toward the end of track anyway but now if you have reputation for knowing you enter into mechanism known as the missed withhold and as you go down this track separate from and distinct from your fellows as being one specially gifted in the subject of knowing about the mind you have entered into now peculiar liability that has nothing to do with the reaction or liability for simply treading the track of truth that has nothing to do with that this is reputational action people think that you know the truth and to them the only truth that exists is themselves its first dynamic truth their conception of truth is their own aberrations misdeeds and ideas of right or wrong conduct now every philosopher has more or less been engaged upon selection of ideas of rightness of conduct and wrongness of conduct particularly the oriental philosopher has been engaged upon this point it is totally missing and totally absent from the western philosopher he doesnt much talk about the rightness of conduct he talks about behavior patterns and he talks about social sciences and he talks about other things he doesnt even talk about ethnology this is an almost unknown commodity to him except as he applies this maybe to some savage race down on the banks of the bongobungo he doesnt realize that ethnology is equally applicable to savage race living on the banks of fortysecond street he actually doesnt approach this subject very closely he talks about behaviors and he wants to get away from this well one of the reasons he wants to get away from this is hes totally blind to the possibility that there could be an exact right conduct see he speaks of behavior pattern not rightness of conduct whereas the oriental philosopher wishing to lead people in the direction of better ways and that sort of thinglaotse confucius particularly these chaps are fixated on the idea of right conduct the right conduct and the wrong conduct and its to point where in japan if you drink out of the wrong side of the tea bowl you know youve practically had it youre socially ostracized theres another island country where if you dont cross your knife and fork in an exact way in the middle of your plate nobody ever invites you to dinner again these are rightness and wrongness of conduct and its adjudicated in those particular ways the crux of the situation is that all considerations of behavior all considerations of the ow mechanism are primarily based on ideas of right and wrong conduct back of the ow mechanism is the idea that right conduct can exist this is the only saving grace of the human race or of any race of beings its rather touching thing if you get down and think about it the idea that right conduct can exist its quite remarkable of course right conduct according to whom its the group mores your survival factors are put together on this your polynesian with his taboos was trying to maintain very compact population in an area that raised very little food and therefore was incapable of supporting overpopulations and so forth so he invented taboo system and he made whole series of rightnesses of conduct actually survival is your monitoring factor of rightness of conduct but it is not that an individual acts for his selfpreservation and commits overts because of his selfpreservation that is too direct look he commits overts because of survival it is his rightness of conduct see its slightly splithair difference if you follow the thing the behaviorist would try to tell you that it washe is athere is school of activity known as behaviorism i didnt refer to that they try to say that it is totally and only and always first dynamic existence and therefore it isnt survival its selfpreservation and by this they miss the whole boat they dont even put their foot on the gangplank they hardly even walk up to the right dock you know and they go right on off into the river boat there never intended to be one there either i mean thats really missing the boat because right conduct is always group activity and is never an individual activity matter how much the individual speaks about integrity to himself it breaks down eventually into group activity because his ideas of his own rightness of conduct are based on the group to which he belongs so we get the third dynamic aberration of right conduct as underlying all ow underlying even missed withholds the only thing senior to it is the pure pure mechanics of existence there is thetan and thetan does these things you see your very early axioms are quite unrelative as truths theyre just about as close to truths as anybody will ever be able to push it see theyre right up there pushing the axiom absolutes are unobtainable so close that there is hardly any distinguishing it at all but the aberrations which he then engages upon are his efforts to discover right conduct what is right conduct in self what is right conduct in others what is wrong conduct in self what is wrong conduct in others and of course from lifetime to lifetime he lives in different groups and his sets of mores change and change and change and change so there is road to truth on the subject of right conduct you just study nothing but what is right conduct and then take what the group says is right conduct and youre not going to wind up with truth now if you realize that its search for right conduct and an effort to adhere to codes of right conduct and breaking of codes of right conduct which then bring about the aberrated condition then you are walking road to truth now lets get this subtle difference its quite important to thee and borrowing liberally from the book of the winds andbook of changes and so forth confucius he say young man who support elderly parents he good man see well thats perfectly all right right up to the moment when somebody says this is truth because this is not truth this is only species of right conduct its only belief of right conduct in other words its actually an entrance of arbitraries into conduct and therefore if the entrance of arbitraries can be considered truth i think weve all had it that would make all the laws passed by the us government the english government the chinese government true particularly today the us government is always trying to legislate truth into existence i think its the most marvelous activity highly complimentary i mean fellows trying to lift elephants with their little finger should always be patted on the back and so forth but i think it should also be pointed out to them that those elephants are little heavier than the stressanalysis structure of the small finger theyre always trying to say their laws are true they longer consult the customs of the people in order to pass their cottonpicking laws and man how crazy can you get where are you going to go for law because any law professor i ever had that was worth his salt and was good joe always made this practically his first point laws are evolved from customs of the people and are eventually solidified in the form of legislation and become law of the land law which does not so progress either operates as total tyranny or is totally unenforceable you want to know whats tyrannical law or law you cant enforce its law that doesnt evolve from the customs and mores of the people thats unenforceable can give you numerous examples of this sort of thing prohibition somebody came along and said its evil to drink i dont know what the population of the united states was at that time must have been upwards to hundred million people and there were only few of them who agreed with that they waited till some ten million men were in uniform or something like thator maybe it wasnt that manyand couldnt vote at that particular time and then they passed this law into existence and these fellows came home and found out that it was illegal to drink and they didnt agree with this so prohibition was mockery i dont know how many lives it cost how much revenue it cost how much property it destroyed and so forth and finally even the great and mighty government threw in its spongesaid lap it up we cant do thing about it in other words not the whole army navy coast guard and everything elsenobody could enforce this thing nobody it wasnt borne out of the customs of the people in other words it went straight in the teeth of what people considered as right conduct in those days if man was man he held his liquor what if there was liquor to hold he had definition for man in other words you just pull the rug out man pull the rug out well this concerns you very vitally at veryi very seldom talk to you at high level of theorybut actually does concern you considerably it does because all around you people are determining truth from what people say right conduct is see they say well youre supposed to do this and supposed to do that and supposedtos supposedtos supposed tos and these things are true ill give you one of these dataone of these data thats very very interestinga datum concerning kleptomaniacs developed in the field of psychoanalysis when kleptomaniac cant steal anything he always burns down the house thats scientific datum in psychoanalysis you think im joking you know i never actually throw total punch in this particular line till i can get these textbooks and open them up and start actually reading them at random you want to really have ball sometime get somebody like karen horney textbook and sit down with four or fivewell fairly sensible blokes of some kind or another and just start reading them with straight face from any point in the book forward anything ive ever said in the field just turns pale you see im moderate in this line i dont like to exaggerate but they wont believe you if you sit there with your face toward them the back of the book toward them and actually just read out of the textbook they will not believe that you are reading the latest and best school of psychoanalysis theyll think youre pulling jokes theyll think its just nothing but solid gag from one paragraph to the next i finally one day saw an engineerto group of engineers that were being treated in this fashionactually just in rage get up and go around back of the fellow who was reading it aloud and jerk the book out of his hands and he didnt even want to read it and that engineer that pulled the book out of his hands had to actually be forcefully held up against the wall and the book had to be shown to him and that the person in that chair was actually reading exactly what was in that textbook on the subject of psychoanalysis and when he did at that moment the engineer for the first time in his life realized there wasnt science of the human mind extant on the planet up to that time the reason he paid attention to dianetics and scientology he thought there was science of the mind now thats one of the primary things that you run into people have whole bunch of data over here which are what theyre supposed to do and these are right conductand that to them is truthand what youre not supposed to do for instance the law defines sanity as the ability to tell right from wrong i consider this marvelous in what land well dont ever try zulu in an english court and dont ever try to try an englishman in zulu court because theres going to be some things messed up going to be some withholds missed now heres your peril your period of peril is past to be alliterative it was over period of time as to whether or nottaking you as unit of truthyou individually could have your state of understanding of yourself and those around you materially improved by study and processing now if anybody will sit still long enough and if the auditor will do the right things at the right time why this is going to happen today this is going to happen you could also carry it out to very nearly an ultimate very close to it you can get the fellow back to point of his total realization and recognition of exactly what he has done and where he has gonein other words clearingand exactly how hes done it and how it formed up and so forth and if you were to take raw meat and push them up to three or fourgoal clear why they might not tell you for other people they might not be able to articulate it which is the main trick after all but you hand them book of axioms and they say at that time of course what are you showing these for or oh yes yes oh yes of course of course that oh yes yes that right of course naturally yeah thats right thats right thats right thatsof course yeah thats pretty good and mostly what theyre saying is pretty good is thats fairly well stated yes id say the same myself if i could all theyre doing really is expressing some kind of an agreement youre not teaching them anything because they now have subjective reality on it weve got reverseend look on this thing and were starting at the point which is hardest to start as everybody is stupid as hell on the subject see and originally and basically that included see so you see where we have went to now we are essentially in the business of individuals and you must never forget that on the road to truth you are in the business of individuals i could give you long and tiradious lecture on the subject of the third dynamic and how it gets loused up but i dont think itd serve anybodys purpose just let say passant that most organizations as they exist on earth today exist in their first instant of genus on the fact that they could not handle an individual one individual the failure to handle that one individual then brought about not their demise but their construction all organizations on this planet today can be evolved from the first moment of failure to handle one individual they couldnt handle him they couldnt understand him they couldnt reach him they couldnt help him they couldnt solve his problems and so they set up an organization to do it that organization directly and immediately evolves from the failure to handle that individual now this doesnt tell you that this is true of all third dynamic activities this only says earth and this only says aberrated third dynamic activities but its an inversion youre on the lower scale youre way below the first dynamic they couldnt handle the first dynamic so they developed an organization not to do it oh ill give you an idea an organization tends to grow up even around to this degree yet were the one organization or the one activity on this planet at this time that doesnt follow this but it gets pulled in toward it every now and then as youevery one of youknow to your experience at some time or another an organization in scientology has not given you an answer or sent you book or done something or served your needs at that particular moment or purpose see well its all based on this thing its just not enough mest or time or space or speed or something of the sort in order to have delivered that service but we are the only group that would be capable of doing it and that do succeed in it we are handling the individual and you will never in your whole history handle more than an individual i dont care what youre trying to handle or if youve set up government for the planet you will only be handling one individual not one individual multiplied many times russia shoots individual and loves the masses i think thats quite marvelous how did they get that way well its total aberration on the subject you follow what im saying now now you can do this if everything you do do does serve the individual individually and peculiarly tailored to his needs so that he is not overlooked in the process but you set up an eddy and an upset every time you have failed to handle one individual you handle one individual and everything is fine and you handleyou fail to handle an individual and you will set up an organization to try to do it youll set up all kinds of things to try to do it youll set up all kinds of brutal laws and jurisprudence and everything else to try to do it where you have failed to handle an individual you will set up all sorts of ow in scientology were probably the only organization that has any capability at all of going in the direction of clear third dynamic and were going in that direction we use ow today to park somebody till we can handle him we never forget were handling an individual and i never forget im handling an individual im not handling people ever im handling you and you and you and you because you are truth i dont care what you look at as truth to begin with or what you will look at as truth at the end of the line if theres any truth to be found youre it if theres any truth to be known itll be you who will know it and beyond that and outside of it there isnt any truth now you see what im talking about as the road to truth audience mmmm now dont you worry about missing withholds on joe and pete and bill as they come into the pe class dont worry about that you wont suffer from it people wont do bad things to you because you dont know all about them instantly as somebody just said to your confront is very high scientologists confront is way up and very often when you look at somebody you almost cave him in because he says whatwhatwhat does he know about well your only mistake at that point is not to reach him as truth you are confronting that moment road to truth and youve got to travel it because youve already started to you have looked down it there is many pc youll start to process or many human being you will try to tell about scientology that you will say why did i get up this morning it must have been i knew something was going to happen because when i put on my left shoe i found it was designed for the right foot and from that moment on i could have taken warning and simply gone back to bed and i didnt and here i am arguing with this person in this pe course and hes saying i understand ron doesnt believedoesnt believe in god and youre trying to make some kind of heavy weather out of it or make conversation out of it or trying to fend off this accusation or trying to straighten it up or handle ityoure going to find yourself at that moment on the road to truth well ill tell you the wrong thing to do is unloadjump in the ditch thats the wrong thing to do your success in the future totally depends upon your ability to walk that road and not to jump off of it because all of your disasters anyplace will stem from that exact instant when you failed to walk that road and turned around and did something else and set up an organization to handle this jerk you see that audience yes theres this guy hes saying well ron doesnt believe in god and i understand this i heard this every place so how canyou can say hes truthful man see this guy knows what truth is you have faith in the big thetan see its kind of 1984 inwith cross above it you know and thats truth hes been taught all his life you must have faith in this thing hes been taught that is right conduct he sees somebody isnt instantly following down this and snapping and popping and making the sign of his particular cross i know of several crosses and how to make several signs of the cross but were not making his sign of the cross so therefore we are not truth see hes got right conduct mixed up with rightness of conduct is the source of aberration and these are entirely different remarks he doesnt realize hes nuts thats one of the first things he has to find out well youre going to find there are many ways to teach him this initial step and you will fail and you will succeed and you will do this and you will do that and listen you will only be wrongand im not now talking about right conduct of scientologist i happen to be talking about survival in the early axioms at that levelyou will only fail if you dont try if you dont make some stab at it because if you make some kind of stab at it youll be surprised he wont go away even though if you didnt handle him in that first fifteen seconds and you put him on the shelf to pick him up somewhere on the track youll be surprised this happens to every once in while i processed somebody one day he was lying in sickbed i thought he was going to die i thought i flipped the whole thing i thought it was gone sunk that was it never processed such lousy session in my life you know i couldnt even get the pc practically to answer the auditing command i got him to say it few times you know and i finally patted him on the shoulder and said well i hope youll be all right and so forth tried to put in little hope factor before i walked out of the room the man was dying see i actually felt bad about it foryou knowa little bit bad about it for several days i couldnt get through to the guy i couldnt do anything for him you know and so forth and there it was and his whole life all busted up and that sort of thing i almost fell off the top of the hasi steps at notting hill gateand that was long flight of steps if you remember there was this guy hale and hearty just having finished another intensive hed been alive and well for two years and he all dated it from that moment of being processed by youll many times think you fail when you havent the only mistake you can make is to try to go backwards on this road to truth its not possible without completely caving in very very dangerous thing to do so this fellow stands up in the pe class and he says how can you people know anything about truth i understand ron doesnt believe in god what are you going to say what are you going to say what are you going to say at that moment took you by surprise you didnt even think he was going to talk well at least be inventive enough to say well you know i think you ought to write him about that post box out there in the hall next question well at least youve made start at least youve done something the wrong thing to do is to back up and construct an organization which handles masses and never handles an individual because it is very certain that if you fail to handle this guy who stands up in the pe course if you fail to push home your confront on your friend who says he hates you because you might have missed withhold on him if you dont say to him well now just count off the number of times ive nearly found out something about you joe count them offyoure not even asking him what you nearly found out seeand press it home the guy finally says well azizizdadadaumm you know shatters him you say well i failed and you probably didnt you only fail if you didnt try so dont worry about the fact that you know more about them than they know themselves they only stand up to be handled the only way youre going to build up some kind of clumsy stupid mess of nonfunctional scientology administrative system will be totally and completely based on the one guy you didnt handle the one case you didnt solve your retreats are all based on that now i can only tell you from this point of view that every once in while somebody kicks the bucket and goes totally beyond reach that doesnt make feel good but i know very well well pick him up later thats all part of the road to truth various things happen various catastrophes occur people get mad at you would be utterly amazed how many people write today who were furious about four years ago utterly incredible now there is truth in the mass of things there is truth in moral codes truth isnt to be found there only agreements but in the final analysis there is truth to be found and there is road to truth you have that within you and every time you look at human being you see it in him and as you know what it is about the more you know about it the more you understand it the less these factors will trouble you but even the little fellow in the bakery shop whos doing nothing but wrap up bread has already started on the road to truth and his only stupidity is he hasnt got enough sense to keep going so dont worry about you being on the road to truth and that its very adventurous line or being on the road to truth shucks were almost there behind us lies the most thorny messedup track you ever saw in your life wouldnt navigate it again for afor box of biscuits but the truth of the matter is well were there that roads behind us possibly take us quite while to sit down and find out where we are now that were there but thats allowable too but well only retreat from our position to the degree that we dont realize this fact that you cant start case you cant embark upon clearing planet or an individual diffidently without to some degree seeing it through to final conclusion and your only disasters will simply stem from your failure to follow that road all the way through think them over and mark them up sometime along the line and youll see how true those words are thank you very much good night
