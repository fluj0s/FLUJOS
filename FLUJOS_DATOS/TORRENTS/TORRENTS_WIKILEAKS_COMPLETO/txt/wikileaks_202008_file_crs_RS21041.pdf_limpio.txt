report op cit 7 west will hit the talibans opium trade by jonathan oliver mail on sunday september 30 2001operations2 although the taliban reportedly banned opium poppy cultivation in late 1997 opium production in afghanistan increased through the year 2000 accounting for 72 of the worlds illicit opium supply according to us government sources most afghan opium is sold in europe and not the united states on july 27 2000 the taliban again issued decree banning opium poppy cultivation according to the march 2001 incsr the announcement of the ban caused prices to rise however the state department noted that neither the taliban nor the northern alliance has taken any significant action to seize stored opium precursor chemicals or arrest and prosecute narcotics traffickers on the contrary authorities continue to tax the opium poppy crop at about ten percent and allow it to be sold in open bazaars traded and transported3 some members of the us drug enforcement community suggest that new strategy may have been adopted by the taliban in the wake of their july 27 2000 announced ban on cultivation this strategy would reflect desire by the taliban to use their monopoly position to maximize profits ie restrict supply by restricting cultivation drive prices up dramatically and sell from an extensive supply of stockpiled opium according to the united nations drug control program undcp personnel in the past up to 60 of opium stock has been stored for sale in future years whether sincere or not in maintaining their most recent ban the taliban clearly has enforced it dea analysts note that afghani opium production has declined dramatically from over 3000 metric tons in 2000 to 74 metric tons through october 2001 the lions share of production in the wake of the talibans july 2000 ban reportedly takes place in areas controlled by the afghan opposition according to us drug enforcement data the price of kilo of opium in afghanistan and bordering regions has jumped almost tenfold from 44 per kilo to between 350 and 400 per kilo4 officials report that the price has jumped as high as 7005 fear of military strikes and increased needs for immediate cash have reportedly sparked reversal of the talibans ban on production spokesman for british prime minister tony blair announced that the british government has information that the taliban has lifted its ban on poppy growing and is now instructing farmers to cultivate opium for export6 the spokesman estimated 3000 tons of opium are being stockpiled in afghanistan significant portion of it by bin laden

links to drug trade in remarks delivered october 2 2001 british prime minister tony blair referred to the taliban as regime founded on fear and funded on the drugs trade he stressed that the biggest drug hoard in the world is in afghanistan controlled by the taliban and that the arms the taliban are buying today are paid for with the lives of young british people buying their drugs on british streets8 the prime ministers remarks indicate concern that the taliban finance substantial share of their military operations from the drug trade and use income from the opium trade to fund extremists in neighboring countries such as the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu and the chechen resistance additional news reports citing officials say afghan drug dealers expecting western military strike appear to be selling off their narcotics stockpiles for cash9 the december 2000 international crime threat assessment produced by an interagency working group chaired by the central intelligence agency reports that under predominantly taliban rule international terrorists and drug traffickers have been able to operate with impunity in afghanistan the taliban have given sanctuary to renegade saudi terrorist osama bin laden allowing him and other terrorist groups to operate training camps in afghanistan bin laden in return has used his extensive wealth and business network to help financially support the taliban despite the talibans public condemnation of the illicit narcotics industry virtually all of afghanistans opium poppy cultivation and morphine base and heroin processing laboratories are located in taliban controlled territory the taliban profits from the afghan drug trade by taxing opium production and drug movements10 taliban imposed tax rate of 10 on poppy cultivation is widely cited together with varying rates for sporadic taxation of processing and transportation11 department of state representative stated however in october 3 2001 congressional testimony that before last years ban the taliban collected from 1020 taxes on the yield of poppy fields as well as taxing the processing shipment and sale of opiates12 the international crime threat

report by barry meier of october 4 2001 p b3 have generally been given little credence in the law enforcement and intelligence community 18 britain targets bin laden drug trade profits by joe murphy sunday telegraph london september 30 2001uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan in particular believe that drug trafficking is major source of funds for insurgencies threatening their national security13 dea administrator asa hutchinson in october 3 2001 congressional testimony stated that credible dea source information indicates ties between the taliban and the drug trade the taliban directly taxes and derives financial benefits from the opium trade they even provide receipts for their collected drug revenues14 october 3 2001 department of state congressional testimony also points to taliban links to the illicit drug trade william bach of the bureau of international narcotics and enforcement affairs suggested that the drug trade brought at least 40 million to the taliban in 1999 he noted however that report by committee of experts on the resolution 1333 of december 20 2000 for sanctions against the taliban states that funds raised from the production and trade of opium and heroin are used by the taliban to buy arms and war materials and to finance the training of terrorists and support the operation of extremists in neighboring countries and beyond15 bach noted that if credence is to be given to reports that the taliban is directly involved in the drug trade as experts suggest then the talibans share of revenues may be far greater than the 40 million figure cited bach also pointed out that press reports indicate that bin laden encouraged the taliban to increase its drug trade as part of its war against the west16 bin laden links to drug trade news reports have linked osama bin laden and qaeda directly to the illicit opium trade to the extent that income from the trade sustains the taliban however bin laden may benefit at least indirectly as the taliban is bin ladens protector furthermore some reports maintain that qaeda earns cash by protecting afghanistans shipments of opium bound for the west17 there are indications that bin laden serves as middleman for the afghan opium produce rs using income derived from this role to run terrorist training camps in afghanistan for example there are news reports that the british prime ministers office has evidence that osama bin laden is personally involved in the opium trade to buy arms for qaeda and to undermine the west18 summary of the evidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21041crs5 19 responsibility

released by the prime ministers office the summary notes that bin laden is the leader of qaeda and that the network includescommercial operations able to raise significant sums of money to exploit its activity that activity includes substantial exploitation of the illegal drugs trade from afghanistan usama bin laden and the taleban regime have close and mutually dependent alliancethey jointly exploit the drugs trade the taleban regime allows bin laden to operate his terrorist training camps and activitiesand protects the drugs stockpiles19 policy options options for policy makers to address the afghan opium supply in isolation are limited steppedup enforcement activity at the borders of neighboring states is one option however iran has already been aggressively pursuing such policy and drug related corruption in afghanistans other neighbors poses significant obstacle locating and destroying stockpiles within afghanistan is seen by most observers as difficult as such stockpiles are well hidden it has been suggested that better intelligence on these stockpiles might be obtained if us forces begin operating in afghanistan thereby enabling us or allied personnel to seize and destroy them also spraying poppy crops could be an option should cultivation resume downside of spraying is that air operations in such remote and high altitude environment could be difficult should however the taliban regime fall wide range of options and opportunities for counterdrug cooperation may unfold for congress and the administration to address as part of wider assistance program to afghanistan meanwhile additional options may open in event of us or multinational intervention in afghanistan or deepening civil war in sustained antiterrorism campaign drug markets illicit drug products and major drug players could become legitimate targets for interdiction law enforcement military and paramilitary operations indeed british press reports indicate poppy fields supply lines storehouses and producers may become targets in efforts to prevent taliban funding of terrorists campaigns20
