august 21 1997 carol migdalovitz specialist in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs and national defense division congressional research service the library of congress greece and turkey aegean issues background and recent developments summary for many years nato allies greece and turkey have been adversaries in bilateral disputes which have produced crises and even brought them to the brink of war one series of disputes involves aegean sea borders the two disagree over the border in the air continental shelf and territorial sea over the status of islands in the sea and over the ownership of aegean islets in the aftermath of january 1996 crisis over the sovereignty of the imiakardak islet various dispute resolution initiatives were undertaken nato proposed militaryrelated confidencebuilding measures some of which are being implemented the president of the european union council of ministers proposed committee of wise men which was accepted in the form of greek and turkish committees of experts who are exchanging views via the president in march 1996 turkey suggested ways to address aegean issues year later greece made decisive overture that accelerated bilateral diplomacy finally in july 1997 the united states instigated joint greekturkish declaration of principles that is said to equal nonaggression pact the principles have yet to be applied to specific aegean disputes whether or not greece and turkey want to change the nature of their relations and resolve the aegean disputes is uncertain strong motivations to resolve exist greece wants to meet the criteria for joining the european monetary union and must control defense spending to do so it can only cut defense spending if the turkish threat recedes greece also wants to cultivate more positive image in european circles and its relations with turkey are an impediment turkish secularists want to be part of europe and to stop greek use of the veto in the european union as weapon in bilateral disputes the influential turkish military may favor rapprochement with athens in both countries however there may be domestic political constraints on policy change in greece the legacy of former prime minister andreas papandreou who asserted that turkey is the greatest threat to greece affects the current governments maneuverability in turkey nationalist former prime minister bulent ecevit is now deputy prime minister and the governments primary foreign policy spokesman and there is new thinking in ankara to match that of athens the united states wants stability in the eastern mediterranean and after the imiakardak crisis sought to become more active in dispute resolution us neutrality in the crisis however was perceived in greece as favoritism toward turkey and prevented the united states from engaging immediately the us desire to be force for positive change persevered and reached fruition with the madrid declaration in july 1997 the united states is determined to stay on course and work with the parties to apply the madrid principles to specific disputes the prospects for aegean resolutions are better now than they have been in years but domestic political developments in both greece and turkey could affect the outlook detrimentally contents introduction 1 the aegean issues 1 air 1 continental shelf 2 territorial sea 3 islands 3 islets 4 dispute

policy 13 prospects 15 greece and turkey aegean issues background and recent developments introduction the united states and nato look to greece and turkey to anchor stability in the eastern mediterranean region bordering the unsettled balkans and middle east often however the two allies are antagonists in bilateral disputes which have troubling incendiary potential since january 1996 crisis over an islet in the aegean sea took the neighbors to the brink of war1 efforts have been made to improve greekturkish relations other divisive issues notably those concerning cyprus2 the ecumenical greek orthodox patriarchate and greek orthodox community in turkey muslim mainly turkish citizens of greek thrace the kurds and the competition for regional allies sometimes complicate the search for reasonable accommodation aside from cyprus however these other issues are not crisisprone nor the subject of current diplomacy the aegean issues the longest border between greece and turkey is in the aegean sea and has been disputed in the air in the sea in the continental shelf and on islands islets and rocks air since 1931 greece has claimed airspace extending to 10 miles over the aegean countrys airspace rights usually coincide with its territorial sea rights greece claims sixmile sea limit therefore other countries including the united states recognize greek airspace as only six miles turkish military aircraft challenge greeces airspace claim by flying to within six miles of greek islands greece immediately accuses turkey of airspace violations and scrambles its planes to intercept the turks continuous mock and potentially dangerous dogfights ensue sometimes resulting in plane crashes air traffic control issues parallel the airspace dispute in 1952 the international civil aviation organization icao assigned greece air traffic control for the 1 see crs report 96140 greece and turkey the rocky islet crisis updated march 7 1996 by carol migdalovitz 2 the subject of separate crs product issue brief 89140 cyprus status of negotiations by carol migdalovitz updated regularly crs2 aegean flight information region fir ie international and greek domestic airspace over the aegean up to turkish national airspace after the cyprus crisis of 1974 turkey required all planes approaching its airspace to report after reaching the aegean median line in order to enable military radar to distinguish innocent flights from aggressors greece said that this impinged on its fir authority and abrogated responsibility for air safety over the aegean international airlines reacted by ceasing direct flights between greece and turkey closure of the aegean detrimentally affected commercial air flights over the sea to other areas the situation was resolved in 1980 when the pre1974 status quo was restored and international flights resumed over the aegean in general turkey claims that fir is technical issue that greece interprets and exploits as matter of sovereignty to restrict turkish aircraft and exercises over the aegean continental shelf the dispute over the definition of the continental shelf involves maritime resources as well as sovereignty turkey claims that the continental shelf under the aegean is an extension of its anatolian or asia minor land mass and that the continental shelf border is median line between the two mainland coasts greece claims that islands have continental shelves and that the continental shelf border is median line between the turkish coast and eastern greek islands which fringe the turkish mainland in support of its position greece cites 1958 united nations convention on the continental shelf and the more recent convention on the law of the sea which recognize that islands generate continental shelves greece is signatory of both conventions but turkey is not and rejects greeces claim as fundamentally inequitable the continental shelf dispute has provoked two crises in november 1973 turkey granted oil exploration rights in what it called international waters in the aegean adjacent to several greek islands in february 1974 greece protested that the area was part of its continental shelf that may the turkish government sent research vessel into the area with an escort of 32 warships at may 1975 summit of the greek and turkish prime ministers turkey appeared to agree to submit the dispute to the international court of justice icj governmental instability in ankara however rendered the apparent accord obsolete and turkey sent in another research vessel accompanied by warship greece appealed to the security council to address turkeys violations of its sovereignty and unilaterally petitioned the icj for determination of continental shelf rights the security council passed an ambiguously worded resolution 395 1976 calling for both direct negotiations and judicial recourse the icj rejected greeces request for interim measures what us courts would call temporary injunction because of greeces failure to show irreparable harm it also declined jurisdiction which depends on the consent of both parties to dispute the second crisis occurred in 1987 when greece granted oil exploration rights in the continental shelf near its island of thasos and turkey granted similar rights in waters near the greek island of samothrace turkish ship went to work with far smaller naval escort than in the 1970s greek prime minister andreas papandreou threatened to take all necessary measures to protect greeces sovereignty the crisis crs3 abated after intense nato and us mediation with each country assuring the other that exploration would only occur in its own undisputed territorial waters greece proposes that both countries jointly petition the icj for determination of continental shelf limits the demarcation of the continental shelf is the only aegean dispute for which greece is willing to petition the court jointly with turkey for resolution and accept an arbitral compromise on all other aegean issues greece maintains that turkey must initiate petition for legal recourse because it is disputing established greek sovereign rights territorial sea in 1936 greece claimed territorial sea of six nautical miles it reserved the right to claim 12nauticalmile limit right later codified in the convention on the law of the sea which the greek parliament ratified in may 1995 as noted above turkey is not signatory of the convention in response to the greek parliaments action on june 8 1995 the turkish parliament gave its government authority to take all necessary measures including military ones if greece exercised the right to 12 miles and increased its territorial waters greece has never affirmatively exercised the right to 12 miles if greece claims 12 miles then it would claim over twothirds of the aegean sea on june 12 1974 in the context of the continental shelf dispute above turkey had formally declared for the first time that an extension of greek territorial waters to 12 nautical miles would constitute casus belli cause of war turkish officials reiterated this position many times contending that greek territorial sea of 12 nautical miles would strangle turkey and transform the aegean into greek lake turkey believes that greek control of the aegean could threaten its access to international waters over two thirds of turkeys commercial traffic transits the sea greece says that it would ensure other countries rights of innocent passage islands there are about 2400 islands in the aegean almost all are greek and about 100 are inhabited the 1923 treaty of lausanne mandated the demilitarization of several islands then given to greece in the eastern aegean italy ceded the dodecanese islands to greece by the treaty of paris in 1947 which required their demilitarization as well greece began militarizing eastern aegean islands in 1960 and accelerated the program after the cyprus crisis of 1974 greeces militarization of lemnos and samothrace at the entrance to the straits of the dardanelles is of great concern to turkey greece militarized the dodecanese for selfdefense after 1974 turkey contends that greeces actions violate the lausanne and paris treaties greece argues that the relevant provisions of lausanne were superseded in 1936 with the montreux convention of 1936 which authorized turkey to militarize and control military traffic through the straits greece also claims that its actions are defensive after the fact in 1975 turkey established its fourth army based in izmir on the aegean coast the fourth army has an amphibious landing force capable in theory of seizing greek islands greece says that the fourth army must be redeployed before it reduces its military presence around turkey the respective greek and turkish positions however may be more political irritation than military threat crs4 when turks complain about the militarized greek islands some greeks raise the fate of two previously predominantly greekinhabited islands imvros gokceada and tenedos bozcaada in the northern aegean near the entrance to the straits that the treaty of lausanne granted to turkey the treaty required turkey to guarantee nonmuslim persons and property according to greece turkeys discriminatory and confiscatory policies instead forced most greeks to leave islets sovereignty over aegean islets and rocks was not in dispute until december 1995 when turkish merchant captain refused to have his vessel rescued by greece ship near an uninhabited islet imia to greece kardak to turkey that he said was turkish3 both countries media exploited the situation prompting government and military involvement the parties returned to status quo after us intercession subsequently turkish naval officer appeared to question greek sovereignty of the island of gavdos near crete at nato planning session although the turkish foreign ministry said that gavdos was technical not political question turkish officials began to refer to grey areas ie islets and rocks not specifically mentioned in treaties whose sovereignty may be unresolved they later said that there were 130 such islets and rocks greece demanded that turkey deny it had claims to gavdos dispute resolution initiatives since the imiakardak crisis several initiatives have been undertaken to resolve the aegean disputes nato soon after the crisis nato secretary general javier solana proposed confidencebuilding measures cbms based on may 1988 memorandum of understanding between karolos papoulias and mesut yilmaz the greek and turkish foreign ministers respectively in the memorandum turkey and greece agreed that to 1 respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other and their rights to use the high seas and international airspace of the aegean 2 avoid interfering with shipping and air traffic while conducting military activities in the high seas and international airspace and 3 avoid conducting military exercises in the high seas and international airspace during the peak tourism period of july 1 september 1 and main national and religious holidays 3 see crs report 96140 greece and turkey the rocky islet crisis cited above crs5 in september 1988 papoulias and yilmaz signed guidelines for the prevention of accidents and incidents on the high seas and international airspace which called inter alia for the parties to act in conformity with international regulations solana renewed his cbm effort in february 1997 his proposals strongly supported by the united states called for 1 moratorium on military exercises between june 15september 15 2 combat training missions only by unarmed planes 3 planes to use identification friend or foe devices iff instead of submitting flight plans to preclude intercepts reduce the need to scramble interceptors and decrease the number of mock dog fights 4 direct communication between greek and turkish air defense operations offices and 5 establishment of center at nato command headquarters in naples to monitor aegean airspace operations4 turkey agreed to the proposals with modifications greece agreed to the moratorium on military exercises for the proposed period while turkey agreed to july 1august 15 and said it would use iff during that time as it has done for decades greece rejected use of iff because it carved out special exception to the athens fir which it said applies to all countries turkey called for an exchange of information concerning flights in the aegean which greece also considered an infringement of its fir responsibilities greece refused to disarm its combat aircraft in its national airspace but said that training flights would not be armed greece reportedly agreed to hotlines between athens and nato and turkey and nato beginning in february 1997 the two sides began test program of sending pictures of aegean activity to nato headquarters in naples european union during its 1997 turn as president of the european union council of ministers the netherlands proposed committee of wise men to deal with greekturkish aegean issues greece did not want either direct dialogue with turkey that might be perceived as willingness to negotiate what it views as its nonnegotiable sovereignty issues or the involvement of third parties it counterproposed the creation of separate greek and turkish committees of nongovernmental experts who would report to the dutch presidency which then would evaluate the reports for common ground turkey accepted the dutch proposal and the greek counterproposal after 32 deputies of the ruling panhellenic socialist movement pasok voiced opposition to greekturkish dialogue in any form the greek government explained that the committees conclusions would be technical and procedural not political or binding the experts handed in reports to the dutch to 4 defense department briefing may 15 1997 reuters crs6 give to the other party for comment the dutch wanted the experts to meet turkey agreed but greece refused the dutch presidency handed an incomplete mission over to luxembourg at the end of its tenure after exchanges of comments via the presidency greek officials accepted that meeting could take place in the fall bilateral diplomacy on march 24 1996 turkish prime minister mesut yilmaz offered to enter into negotiations with greece without preconditions with view to settling all aegean issues as whole on the basis of respect for international law and agreements establishing the status quo in the aegean the proposal included talks on political framework agreement agreement on militaryrelated confidencebuilding measures avoidance of unilateral steps and actions that could increase tension and comprehensive process of peaceful settlement including third party arbitration5 yilmaz made his offer too soon after the imiakardak crisis for greek sensitivities the greeks were not yet ready to advance and initially said that they found the proposal lacking commitment foreign minister theodoros pangalos later welcomed yilmazs suggestions as great improvement but proposed step by step solution instead he said we should create joint committee to discuss the agreement in legal terms next we can revive the committees on good neighborliness to promote cooperation in mutually beneficial areas trade tourism and antidrug smuggling once we reach that level it might facilitate mutual slackening of the two countries military presence in the aegean6 on april 26 1996 the greek and turkish foreign ministers agreed to have their ministries experts meet in switzerland for domestic consumption pangalos underscored that there is organized dialogue or negotiations pangalos later expressed concern that his turkish counterpart at the time emre gonensay had spoken of grey areas disputing greeces ownership of other islets or rocks7 greece canceled june 1996 pangalosgonensay meeting because of what it termed turkeys provocations ie incidents wherein turkey appeared to question greeces sea and airspace rights as well as governmental instability in ankara greece called on turkey to implement the papouliasyilmaz measures on march 6 1997 foreign minister pangalos prodded by us officials to make positive gesture toward ankara said in washington that turkey certainly belongs to europe he amplified the point to turkish journalist on march 21 turkeys ultimate objective must be to integrate with europe greece definitely wants it to do so8 prime minister costas simitis and foreign minister pangalos set conditions for improved relations and for greece to lift its veto on about us475 million in european union aid to turkey that had been promised as part of march 5 turkish embassy

turkishgreek ties yeni yuzyil march 21 1997 translated by fbis online march 21 1997 crs7 1995 euturkish customs union accord the greek officials demanded that turkey renounce violence ie retract its threat of war if athens extends its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles even though greece did not intend to exercise its right immediately accept borders delineated by international treaties although matters pertaining to interpretation and implementation of this framework could be discussed and recognize the icj as judicial mechanism with jurisdiction for settling of bilateral disputes to assuage domestic critics government officials insisted that greece would not engage in overall negotiations leading to redelineation of borders9 in april 1997 the greek and turkish deputy foreign ministers and foreign ministers had more cordial contacts than previously which prepared for the eu experts committees above and the madrid declaration below then turkish foreign minister tansu ciller may have been especially encouraging saying that ankara does not want change in the aegean status quo one greek analyst interpreted this as turkey abandoning demand that the aegean regime be reviewed saying it can live with the current situation and that war was not among the measures to resolve greekturkish differences in response pangalos acknowledged new spirit of understanding10 finally in may 19 interview with greek television turkish president suleyman demirel said he could agree to nonaggression pact with greece11 on june 5 pangalos said that greece likewise was ready to sign nonaggression pact with turkey the madrid declaration us diplomacy on july 8 1997 at the nato summit in madrid us secretary of state madeleine albright invited greek foreign minister pangalos and his new turkish counterpart ismail cem to agree on six principles to govern bilateral relations prime minister simitis and president demirel then endorsed the principles which simitis said amount to nonaggression pact assistant secretary of state for european affairs john kornblum and his team worked to achieve the accord the principles provide for 1 mutual commitment to peace security and the continuing development of goodneighborly relations 2 respect for each others sovereignty 3 respect for the principles of international law and international agreements 9 greece threatens to veto

refrain from unilateral acts on the basis of mutual respect and willingness to avoid conflicts arising from misunderstanding 6 commitment to settle disputes by peaceful means based on mutual consent and without use of force or threat of force the final two provisions may have the greatest potential to deter conflict because they address matters that have been most provocative greece is committed to refrain from unilateral acts which may include the exercise of its right to 12 nautical mile territorial sea while turkey promises not to use force eliminating the casus belli the principles do not address or resolve specific aegean disputes and the hard task will be in their application motivations for change both countries have become motivated to improve bilateral relations by external influences that could benefit their internal development the european union appears to be the primary force for change greece in contrast to recent governments in athens the simitis government has distinctly eurocentric outlook and wants to meet the european union criteria for joining the european monetary union emu and to increase its competitiveness with european countries which meet the criteria before greece those criteria include budget deficit of not more than 3 of gross domestic product gdp and government debt of not more than 60 of gdp for 1997 greeces budget deficit is expected to be 62 of gdp and its government debt is forecast at 108 of gdp12 among eu member states greece spends the highest proportion of its gdp on defense13 and this expenditure manifestly contributes to deficits and debt to get them under control greece must cut military spending greek government however can make such cuts without also diminishing the turkish threat which propels the expenditures in the wake of the imiakardak crisis in june 1996 even the simitis government otherwise fiscally conservative announced new multi billion dollar arms program nonetheless largely because of their european orientation prime minister simitis and foreign minister pangalos are likely to persist in their outreach to turkey knowing that costly arms race could block convergence with europe and that the only alternative to it is peace in the neighborhood 12 little emu enlightenment the economist february 22 1997 p 88 13 in 1995 greece spent 55 of its gdp on defense while turkey spent 40 us arms control and disarmament agency world military expenditures and arms transfers online edition httpwwwacdagovwmeat96w96tbl1pdf crs9 greece has used its veto power within the eu as weapon to retaliate against turkey for bilateral disputes each veto has distanced greece from its european partners for eight years greece had blocked the eus customs union accord with turkey relenting in 1995 only when the eu agreed to begin membership talks with cyprus which is led by an independent greek cypriot government after the january 1996 islet crisis the new simitis government vetoed both new eu assistance program for mediterranean countries meda because turkey was included and aid to turkey that was promised as part of the customs union accord france spain and italy conceived of meda as major eu foreign policy initiative they and other eu members were angered by greeces veto of meda which denied innocent third countries aid intended to advance european economic and security goals by contributing to the development and stabilization of those countries14 after complaints from its european partners greece lifted its veto of meda in may 1996 it has however continued to veto the customs union funds pangalos has said that the veto will continue until turkish aggressiveness ends as greece seeks to be less of an outsider within an enlarging eu it may be rethinking its policy tools and approaches toward turkey it may be considering options other than using its eu veto for dealing with turkey this likely would require change in greek perceptions of turkish aggressiveness alternate foreign minister george papandreou has elaborated the need for policy change arguing that greece must present more positive image of itself to europe so that it would longer be considered obstructionist papandreou called on greece to shape future greekturkish relations constructively and not rely on vetoes he urged turkey and greece to seek pragmatic criteria for rapprochement15 finally samuel huntingtons clash of civilizations thesis has had an exaggerated impact in both greece and turkey although it is not us policy statement16 huntington forecast that culture will produce redivision of the world and new conflicts he drew cultural fault line across europe between western christianity on the one hand and orthodox christianity and islam on the other17 this theoretical division places greece outside of and in potential opposition to western europe and has outraged greek academics and politicians in march 1997 when europes christian democratic party leaders appeared to follow huntington by declaring the turkey could not be part of europe because it is muslim some greeks feared that they would be beyond the pale as well thus pangalos was defending greeces position in europe when he said that turkey must be part of europe if huntington had somehow linked the aegean neighbors greece would use the bond 14 in addition to turkey meda aids algeria cyprus egypt israel

inside in order to be in position to pull turkey into europe thus defined greece must improve its bilateral relations with turkey18 turkey the turkish secular elites have just experienced what they consider to have been close call with islamism year from july 1996 through june 1997 in which the islamist refah party headed the national government19 the secularists seek to reinforce turkeys modern european identity through ties with and especially membership in the european union some in turkey also are very preoccupied with the huntington thesis noted above and would like to disprove it by showing that turkey is in fact european turkeys tortured relations with greece have been one of the main barriers to improved turkish relations with europe europe therefore provides an incentive for some turks to seek to resolve bilateral disputes with greece unlikely as it may seem the influential turkish military may be force for better relations with greece the turkish general staff generally takes moderate position on aegean issues and greekturkish relations perhaps excepting cyprus and wants to improve them in 1980 after years in which turkish civilian governments had blocked the move military junta in ankara delinked the issue of greeces reintegration with nato from turkish complaints about the fir more recently chief of the general staff ismail hakki karadayi made the first official response to pangalos at reception at the greek embassy in ankara on march 25 general karadayi called on politicians and soldiers to show common sense to resolve problems in the way in which mustafa kemal ataturk and eleftherios venizelos the respective and respected turkish and greek leaders did when they signed the 1930 treaty of friendship nonaggression and arbitration karadayi said that he was forcing this door to greece open20 constraints on change in greece and turkey domestic politics constrain overall efforts to improve bilateral relations and specific initiatives to resolve aegean disputes 18 it should be noted that although greek officials say turkey is part of europe they have not advocated turkeys eu membership per 19 see crs report 97462f turkeys unfolding political crisis by carol migdalovitz april 11 1997 20 trt television network report march 25 1997 translated by fbis online march 16 1997 crs11 greece the legacy of andreas papandreou founder of pasok and twice prime minister21 may impede the simitis governments maneuverability in its policy toward turkey the charismatic papandreou had asserted that turkey greeces nato ally was the greatest threat to greece papandreous dogma is still influential in greece and in pasok now led by costas simitis pasok has majority of 162 out of 300 seats in the greek parliament and must stay cohesive in order to carry out its program when 32 pasok deputies questioned greeces acceptance of the committee of experts they signalled the potential political risks of policy innovation some 22 pasok deputies later charged that with the madrid declaration greece was gradually slipping into choices that result in recognition of turkish claims legalization of ankaras expansionist status and an expiation of its policies22 some smaller opposition parties were more alarmist democratic social movement leader dimitrios tsovalas who considers himself an heir to the papandreist mantle accused the government of opening the road to ceding national rights calling the agreement harmful for greece for our territorial integrity and for our national interests23 within the government defense minister tsokhatzopoulos and education minister yerasimos arsenis are known for their hardline views toward turkey tsokhatzopoulos was close papandreou associate and the security requirements of his defense portfolio may reinforce his antiturkism simitis defeated both tsokhatzopoulos and arsenis in the internal pasok contest to succeed papandreou as prime minister in january 1996 and tsokhatzopoulos in june 1996 vote for party leader although they have publicly supported the policy steps toward turkey that simitis and pangalos have taken so far tsokhatzopoulos and arsenis may be waiting for simitis to stumble in order take internal party and general domestic political advantage of failure prime minister simitis and foreign minister pangalos cannot get out too far ahead of their party rivals parliamentarians and rank and file thus after party dissent was voiced pangalos offered restrictive definition of the committees of experts mandate he and others still resort to antiturkish rhetoric playing to dissidents and rivals rhetorically however may constrain simitis and pangalos effort to lead and to shape public opinion in support of their policy toward turkey and it is heard in turkey where it breeds skepticism about greeces sincerity and acts as disincentive for improving ties simitis and pangalos may be able to overcome domestic political constraints the 32 dissenters decreased rapidly to 22 and may not be solid bloc threatening foreign policy innovation tsokhatzopoulos and arsenis may be perceived in the party as losers and lack following to pose real challenge tsokhatzopoulos is as 21 198188 199396 22 greek pasok deputies criticize madrid communique athens news agency july 11 1997 carried by fbis online july 14 1997 23 greece opposition party leader scores greekturkish accords athens et1 television 16 july 1997 translation carried by fbis online july 18 1997 crs12 much pasok loyalist as he was papandreou loyalist and may defer to his party leaders will moreover new democracy the main opposition party has reacted reservedly to the turkish outreach and therefore may be inclined to support it the support of the internationalist coalition of the left for the policy is given finally important elements in the greek press have made common cause with simitis and their influence should not be underestimated nevertheless the papandreou legacy of antipathy toward turkey produces other greek actions which harm attempts to improve bilateral ties and resolve aegean disputes greece seeks and has signed military agreements with turkeys neighbors which have problematic relations with turkey notably syria and armenia adding to turkeys perception of encirclement greeces conduct on the kurdish issue particularly sours relations turks view the 13year kurdish workers party pkk insurgency as threat to their territorial integrity in april 1997 110 out of 300 members of the parliament of greece proposed to invite pkk leader abdullah ocalan to athens the government quickly said that it did not intend to invite him greek mps have visited pkk camps and turkey accuses greece of arming the pkk which athens denies turkey has record of human rights abuses toward kurds but greece sometimes appears highly selective in its human rights advocacy focusing on the kurds and not other issues such as the treatment of turks and other muslims in europe moreover greek championship of kurdish human rights in the eu helps deny ankara dearly sought closer ties with europe and feeds antigreek sentiment in turkey finally there is strong cyprus lobby in athens opposed to any initiatives that would produce greekturkish reconciliation before cyprus settlement which traditionally has been greek precondition for rapprochement the has resumed the cyprus negotiations but the outlook for solution is uncertain or gloomy cyprus thus could stymie aegean peacemaking turkey ankara now has its third government since an inconclusive national election in december 1995 and an early election may be held in 1998 this governmental instability may affect relations with greece as politicians exploit foreign policy for domestic consumption and leave their weak coalition little room for compromise the islamistled government that was in office through june 1997 was directed toward the east and selected muslim countries it paid almost attention to greece because its rank and file had little if any interest the current seemingly mismatched coalition of right and left is led by mesut yilmaz who made the overture to greece in march 1996 after the imiakardak crisis however deputy prime minister bulent ecevit has emerged as the governments main foreign policy spokesman and his party controls the foreign ministry and the state ministry in charge of cyprus policy ecevit was prime minister in 1974 when turkey intervened ininvaded cyprus and remains proud of what he accomplished then ecevits nationalism on cyprus could interfere with the aegean opening yilmaz depends on ecevits party to stay in power and has little ability or perhaps wish to constrain him shortly after taking power this time ecevit initiated move toward partial integration of turkish northern cyprus with turkey as response to the eus announcement of membership talks with the greek cypriot government crs13 as noted resolution of the cyprus issue has been traditional greek precondition for improved ties with turkey athens and the greek media in particular reacted strongly to ecevits return to power and his cyprus policy ecevit may contribute to disruption of the renewed effort to obtain cyprus settlement24 and thereby set back turkishgreek relations on other fronts greek officials may not be able to persist in their outreach to turkey if ecevits impact is not mitigated ecevit may have another more indirect impact on greekturkish relations with him in the government better ties with europe may not be as strong an incentive for improving relations with greece although prime minister yilmaz has said that speeding up efforts toward full membership in the eu is priority foreign policy aim of the government25 many turks perceive europe as repeatedly rejecting turkey and some want to reject europe in response ecevit and others call for the customs union accord to be reviewed because europe has failed to live up to its aid commitments and because the customs union has aggravated turkeys trade imbalance with europe and harmed turkish businesses turks know that greeces veto is the impediment to aid on the other hand those still lured to europe perceive greeces policy of veto of turkeys relations with europe as an obstacle to their western identity potentially reinforcing support for islamists they may not be disposed to look benevolently on improving ties to greece finally turkey looms larger in greek thinking than vice versa the particular aegean initiatives have not produced reaction in turkey comparable to that in greece despite turkeys agreeing to the madrid declaration there appears to be thinking in ankara on the details of aegean issues or bilateral turkishgreek relations comparable to that of pangalos in athens political leaders are preoccupied domestically with islamism and government turnovers and the foreign policy establishment revises views slowly although general karadayi made positive comments in march the military is engrossed in fighting what it refers to as the two main threats to turkish national security islamism and kurdish separatism it is not clear if it will have sustained and involved interest in engaging itself actively on behalf of an aegean resolution two parties are required to create new paradigm to govern bilateral relations and turkey does not appear to be fully engaged us policy the united states wants to preserve stability in the eastern mediterranean region bordered by conflict zones it also wants to prevent nato from being embroiled in local controversies in order to achieve these goals the united states 24 for the first time in over 3 years the convened direct talks between greek cypriot president glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash on july 9 in new york and in switzerland on august 9 heightened activity is expected after the february 1998 cypriot presidential election see crs issue brief 89140 cited above 25 yilmaz presents government program trt television network july 7 1987 translation carried by fbis july 8 1997 crs14 has tried to remain neutral in and worked to resolve disputes between its two nato allies greece and turkey yet neutrality has not always been appreciated greeks maintain that an equidistant us stance benefits turkey and ignores what they believe is the right greek position on aegean issues greeces view of the regional power balance with turkey as the more powerful player necessitates that it seekdemand third party or international intervention to level the scales or to weigh them in greeces favor us neutrality fails to fulfill that need on the other hand turkey as the larger power assumes it can obtain more favorable outcome from negotiations solely between the two governments and usually calls for dialogue turks believe that they are the more important regional ally of the united states adjacent to the middle east and the caucasus they do not criticize us neutrality and generally appreciate and expect us services in mediating controversies with greece and in moderating their effect on turkeys relations with europe because the united states supports turkeys entry into the european union neutrality evidently interfered with usgreek relations after the imiakardak crisis when then assistant secretary of state for european affairs richard holbrooke had planned to travel to greece and turkey to help them achieve more permanent end to tensions in the aegean he did not make the trip holbrooke had brokered resolution to the crisis that appeared to restore the prior balance in the aegean but many in greece perceived it differently they saw the crisis as one of turkey questioning longestablished territorial rights and the status quo in the aegean holbrooke had failed to address the crisis in these terms and instead concentrated on eliminating the immediate threat of war greeks did not view his achievement on imiakardak favorably the newly established government in athens that had accepted the us resolution was weakened temporarily it did not have sufficient political capital to expend at the time on meeting with holbrooke and diplomatically found his trip schedule inconvenient ankara stood ready to welcome holbrooke and regretted that the visit was canceled although us initiative on aegean issues was undertaken in 1996 the brinkmanship of imiakardak was not forgotten the islet crisis had focused us attention on the tinderbox of greekturkish relations during prime minister simitis april 9 1996 visit to white house president clinton said i hope the united states can be helpful in resolving some of the problems in the aegean we believe that all these issues should be resolved without the use of force without the threat of force with everyone agreeing to abide by international agreements and to respect the territorial integrity of other countries we favor the resolution of the imia situation by referring the matter to the icj or some other international arbitration panel26 in this statement the president seemed to accept greeces perspective on the aegean in deference to his visitor and to reclaim greeces recognition of the united states as bona fide intermediary 26 transcript reuters april 9 1996 crs15 the administration has worked to resolve greekturkish differences through nato and by itself with defense department and the state department officials meeting often with greek and turkish counterparts in the region and in washington the defense department supports the nato secretary generals confidence building measures the state department champions these measures and more us ambassador to greece thomas niles declared that the united states believes that the 1988 papouliasyilmaz agreement must be fully implemented and that it is desirable to proceed beyond it27 finally the state department assiduously sought and obtained greek and turkish agreement to the madrid declaration the state department views madrid as an important first step it is encouraging the parties to apply the madrid principles in the resolution of their various disputes and to acknowledge the need for tradeoffs the first tradeoff may involve turkey taking the imiakardak controversy to the world court in exchange for greece lifting its veto on european union customs union aid but more work needs to be done as is said with regard to other international disputes in which washington attempts to obtain settlement the united states cannot want resolution more than the parties themselves as aegean issues are addressed the united states may have to recuse itself from the airspace controversy an irritant in greekus relations greek journalists persistently bait state department briefers to restate us policy which conforms to international practice each restatement prompts annoyed official reactions from athens this matter will continue to fester because the territorial seaairspace incongruity is unlikely to be resolved this usgreek policy dispute is otherwise not regular subject of official exchanges and highlights the negative impact the media can have on usgreek and greekturkish relations greek and turkish media are foreign policy actors producing unexpected consequences congress has not weighed in on recent developments since the 1970s foreign aid legislation has applied balance of forces policy to greece and turkey it tilts toward greece which many members view as facing demographically and militarily superior adversary in turkey28 congressional resolutions proposed but not passed after the imiakardak crisis mirrored athens position prospects history prompts circumspection about the prospects for resolution of aegean disputes and for greekturkish reconciliation other efforts have not been successful the 1987 crisis over the continental shelf produced the evocative spirit of davos switzerland where turkish and greek prime ministers met and began 27 us ambassador interviewed on greekturkish issues i

rapprochement in 1988 that foundered on the shoals of domestic politics nonetheless the overall prospects for improved greekturkish relations and for resolution of some bilateral aegean issues may be better today than they have been in decade and may justify some cautious optimism the major contributing factor to such an assessment is the strong domestic position and motivation of the athens government which has made sweeping unprecedented policy statements on greek turkish issues for example pangalos said that greece accepts that turkey has vital interests in aegean29 the simitis government also may be willing to lift the cyprus precondition to better relations with turkey foreign minister pangalos distinguished cyprus as an international issue from the aegean as national issue and prime minister simitis asserted outright that greekturkish relations and the cyprus question are not connected30 further as noted above p 7 greek officials had laid out three conditions for improved bilateral relations turkey met two of them with the madrid declaration the only remaining condition concerns court jurisdiction over the islet dispute pangalos has eased the way for compliance by saying that all turkey has to do is say that it is willing to go to the world court for their part the turks had wanted direct negotiations to precede recourse to the court prime minister yilmaz implied that requirement may be met by meeting of committees of experts when he observed that the committees can lead turkey to the court31 if turkey agrees to go to the court thereby recognizing greeces need for an international forum greece would have justification for not lifting lift its veto on european union customs union aid to turkey in possibly upbeat scenario lifting of the veto would do much to assuage hard feelings toward greece in turkey the outlook for the resolution of the different aegean issues varies the islet dispute may be open to resolution because its onset was largely unintended greece and turkey blundered into the imiakardak crisis which some consider media creation that got out of hand turkey subsequently could not find facesaving way to back down from the notion of grey areas and may have made it worse the two sides acceptance of the status quo in madrid underscores that their lack of interest in perpetuating the unsettling byproducts of the islet controversy the separate issue of militarized islands however is unlikely to be resolved because turkey will not move or change its 4th army at least until given longterm evidence of greeces friendship of the older aegean disputes the continental shelf may be ripe for settlement greece maintains that it is legal question to be resolved by the international 29 pangalos interview ta nea

to the job yilmaz has his own demands newsweek august 11 1997 p 39 crs17 court of justice turkey contends that it is also an economic political and strategic dispute requiring political settlement yet turkey has not categorically rejected an appeal to the court again after bilateral negotiations in the past decade expectations of oil or other mineral discoveries in the continental shelf appear to have lowered perhaps diminishing the value of the dispute as result the issue may be more soluble with both parties taking it to the court after some preliminary talks that would not be called dialogue word connoting unacceptable compromise and therefore anathema to some greeks with regard to the territorial sea madrid appeared to signal that it may be allowed to be less of an issue the modus vivendi involves greece retaining the right to 12nauticalmiles of sea but continuing not to exercise the right as long as it does not exercise the right unilateral move turkey will control its rhetoric and stop threatening war the airspace controversy is likely to linger as long as greece claims air space rights disconnected from territorial sea rights and interprets fir in sovereign manner the prospects for solution for all or any of the aegean issues depend on the governments in athens and ankara the simitis government is stable oneparty administration that probably will serve out its full four years it is strongly motivated and may persist in its outreach to ankara for some time weathering ups and downs unless turkish actions shut it out greeces motivations mostly are externally driven and it needs to work on creating solid domestic consensus for foreign policy shift toward turkey the yilmaz coalition government was founded in part on promise to hold early elections it has multiple political components and must reach compromises among them it may prove tempting for some politicians to exploit foreign policy issues for domestic advantage or as in the case of ecevit for principles unleavened by pragmatism moreover whether the government and its anticipated successors will work with the foreign policy establishment on consistent creative and responsive approach to different greece is yet to be seen this context renders positive outcome from present opportunities unpredictable for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97799
