by 105 state initiatives to respond to th demand for homebased services by frail homebound older persons is an important factor in their decisions to transfer funds eligibility and service delivery

participants were ol der and more likely to be poor to live alone and to be members of minority groups lmost half of homedelivered meal recipients and more than onethird of congregate meal recipients had income below the federa l poverty level compared to about 15 of the total us population aged 60 and over at the time of the evaluation recipients were also more likely to have health and functional limitations that place them at nutritional risk the report found the program plays an important role in participants overall nutrition and that meal s consumed by participants are their primary source of daily nutrients the evaluation so found that the prog ram leverages fairly significant amount of nonfederal dollars fo r every federal dollar spent the program leveraged at that time on average 170 fo r congregate meals and 335 for home delivered meals from variety of sources including state cal and private funds as well as participant contributions toward the cost of meals10 the
