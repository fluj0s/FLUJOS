summary section 13a1 of the fair labor standards act permits exemption of employers of bona fide executive adminis trative and professional employees from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements of the act that is from the basic wage and hour provisions of the statut what constitutes bona fide executive administrative or professional employee has been left by congress for the secretary of labor to define and delimit that pr ocess begun in 1938 lapsed after 1975 and was renewed by the bush admin istration in 2003 see 29 cfr 541 the first section 13a1 regulation appeared in 1938 inter alia it imposed two classification tests first to qualify as bona fide wo rker had to be paid at rate befitting an executive or administrator second the worker had to perform the actual work duties of an executive or administrator salary threshold was set at 30 week initially professi onals were subject only to duties test in 1940 an earnings threshold 50 week was set for professionals definitions were modified periodically both the earnings and duties tests so that they could serve credibly as indicators of who might be deemed an executive administrator or professiona l for section 13a1 purpos updates were always contentious with lower thresholds greater numbers of workers would find themselves unprotected by the terms of th flsa thus it was in the interests of employers to keep the thresholds low and the duties tests as broad as possible workers in turn sought higher th reshold and narrow definition of duties the last general revision occurred in 1975 but the effort encountered significant objections from employers in 1978 fu rther update was proposed but in 1981 it was withdrawn by the new reagan adminis tration it never reappeared the thresholds remain at 1975 levels 155 pe r week for executives and administrators and 170 for professionals with slightly lower levels for puerto rico the virgin islands and american samoa the dutie s tests have evolve d slowly since 1938 but remain heavily anchored in regulations from the acts early history on march 31 2003 wagehour administr ator tammy mccu tchen published in the federal register proposed

workers covered under th protections of the statute but in section 13 congress wrote into the act certain specific exemptions among them was the following the provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall not apply with respect to 1 any employee employed in bona fide exec utive administrative professional capacity as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the administrator the act went on

that bona fide executive administrative and prof essional employees were to be exempt congress provided the new administrator w ith little guidance the concepts bona fide executive administrative and professi onal were not defi ned reference was made in the statute to salaried as opposed to hourly paid workers nor was any distinction made between manual and nonmanual work while andrews could draw from the experience of the national rec overy administration 19331935 in which more highly paid workers appear to have been excluded from wage and hour standards he was under obligation to do so4 he

mind more than anything else and we will have that for you within the next week or two he discussed his experience with the issue in new york state pointing out how some employers had atte mpted to circumvent the state law by too broadly defining their workforce as executive or administrative or professional it is very difficu lt to say where worker leaves off and professional or executive begins6 during the fall of 1938 andrews with draft in hand called conference of representatives of industry and labor to ascer tain their views on the definition of the several terms7 on october 19 1938 five days before the act was to go into effect the department announced that the administ rator in consultation with the legal branch of the division d reached determination8 the terms executive and administrative would have single definition among other elements they were to have the primary duty of managem ent of the establishment and do substantial amount of work of the same nature as that performed by nonexempt employees of the employer the concept of professional was to be characterized by work that was predominantly intellectua l and varied in character as opposed to routine mental manual mechanical or physi cal work and was to involve discretion and judgment both as to the manner and time of performance as opposed to work subject to active direction and supervision the education of professional was to be based upon specially or ganized body of knowledge as distinguished from general academic education and from an appr enticeship or other routine training he or she was not to do any substantial am ount of work of the same nature as that performed by nonexempt em ployees of the employer9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs4 10 dolwhrseries press re lease of october

concept of salaried was not specified other than that an executive or administrator would need to earn not less than 30 for work week earni ngs threshold was t for professional in setting forth the section 13a1 regulations andrews had affirmed that the machinery within the department was in place for contesting any aspect of the definitions that were deemed flawed inviting citizen input10 but apparently protests were not forthcoming except possibly with respect to the concept of professional11 addressing the associated industries of ne w york meeting at syracuse in late 1938 rufus poole assistant general counsel for the wage and hour division asked have you ever tried to define professi onal that is hard enough but engaged in bona fide professional capacity is even harder the dictionaries do not give us the answer they indicate th at sometimes the word professional is used to mean person engaged in one of the learned professions that is medicine law and the ministry then th dictionaries talk about education and skill and even about one who engages in sports for money we had to define this term so that employers and employees could use it the concept of professional he stated was the only one that has been seriously questioned to date and even here dol f ound that critics were not able to suggest better definition poole added the re is statutory duty on the administrator to promulgate definition so we put out the best definition we could12 gradually employers would voice concern with the section 13a1 structure particularly with respect to certain highsalaried employees as the statute now stands andrews stated t hese persons are covered unl ess they fall within the definition of employees engaged in an executive administrative or professional capacity some employers had argued andrews reported that certain employees who do not fall within these categories are nevertheless paid rather high salaries and are engaged steadily in work which is of very responsible nature but the number of such employees is not known nor is the extent to which the provisions of section 7 of the act may impose ch anges in the personnel policies and the administrative practices of business enterpri ses andrews concluded any line of demarcation placing these highsalaried employees into separate category for special treatment would have to be very carefully drawn13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs5 13 continued before the american newspaper gu ild san francisco july 31 1939 pp 812 14 us department of labor first annual report of the ad

petitions that were presented they were granted promptly which disposes of all pending petitions and were the only ones which have been sent to the division requesting am endment and hearing in connection with section 13a1 of the act the division further advised that the hearing is confined to the wholesale distributive trades because those are th only interests whic h have petitioned for

manner in which the basic concepts surrounding the section 13a1 exemption were defined not just the pivotal words executive administrative or professional but also the terms of the explanatory language associated with the regulation when that reality was understood by the public there was move for more comprehensive hearings abraham isserm an counsel for the american newspaper guild wrote to fleming urging caution from the way this hearing was announced first impression was gained that persons employed in these categories in the newspaper industry would not be affected by this hearing on reflection however it becomes apparent that if these categories are re defined for the wholesale distributive trades precedent undoubtedly will be established which will have tremendous weight in the other industries covered by the fair labor standards act of 1938 isserman suggested that the hearing could result whatever its intent in fait accompli in the way of changed definitions in respect to which they would have had opportunity for study and comment he suggested somewhat broader agenda than the announcement had stated and urge d the division to make clear to all interested parties the potential implications of the april 10 hearing fleming in response indicated that he had considered and rejected concerns such as those of isserman prior to announcing the hearing there is such wide variation in the work and functions performed by executive administrative and professional employees especially in the administrative and professional classes that it appeared mo re practicable to hold separate industry hearings it follows that definition for one of these classifications in one industry is not necessarily to be treated as precedent in others fleming invited isserman and representatives of other worker interests to attend the hearing as observers or to submit oral or written comments but he also held out the possibility that hearings dealing with other industries might be conducted21 fleming extended the comment period with respect to the april 10 hearing and released the text of the changes proposed by the various industry groups22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs7 23 see dolwhrseries press releases of may 11and 12 1940 june 21 1940 and july 25 1940 comprehensive analysis of the information gathered through the hearings

redefined administrative to include clerical employees such as bookkeepers payroll clerks auditors cost accountants statisticians and all other office help regularly employed on straight salary basis and given vacations and sick leave with pay 26 the stein report pp 57 27 ibid p 2 stein added p 67 if congress had meant to exempt all white collar workers it would have adopted far more gene ral terms than those actually found in section 13a1 of the act the theory of general exemption is further negated by the grant of power to the administrator to define and delimit those terms in another context but in the same spirit dol has observed that exemptions provided in the act are to be narrowly construed against the employer seeking to asse rt them and their application limited to those who come plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit see 29 cfr 7802the hearing commenced as scheduled but it extended intermittently through several months23 in addition to the oral stimony approxima tely 180 briefs written statements and moranda were received24 some proposals were sweeping in concept the division estimated that some 1500000 clerical or white collar workers employed by all establishments in all industries were c overed by the act and could be rendered exempt ie ineligible for minimum wage and overtime pay protection depending upon th manner in which the basi c concepts were defined25 some argued for series of regional diffe rentials or earnings coverage thresholds based upon the population of the communities in which the firms operated how should onthejob training be treated for overtime pay purposes or the efforts of ambitious young men to improve their stat us by studying their employers business after working hours other issues were so raised some of which would reappear frequently through the next several decades26 in his review of the evidence stein t ook pains to distinguish between the terms defined and delimited as they appear in section 13a1 thus the administrator is charged he suggests with determining which employees are entitled to the exemption but also with drawing th line beyond which the exemption is not applicable he concluded the general rule in statute of this nature that coverage should be broadly interpreted and exemptions narrowly interpreted is so well known as to need little elaboration here27 new

follow the variations proposed and adopted with respect to each regulatory initiative in dolwhrseries press release of october 14 1940 there is somewhat detailed 10page analysis of the variations accepted by the division in 1940 see also the stein report cited above among industries testifying was the motion picture industry see discussion below 30 the language defining executive admini strative and professional is drawn from the regulation as published in the federal register october 15 1940 pp 40774078 the actual regulation includes additional detail and qualifications for exemption 31 dolwhrseries press re lease of october 14 1940 p 1 32 the division in dolwhrse ries press release of oc tober 14 1940 p 3 stated that the aspect of the original definition of exec utive which caused more questions than any other was the requirement that an executive do substantial amount of the work done by his subordinate thus percen tage restriction was added in 1940extent of these exempti ons under section 13a128 it is important to recall that the act itself provided only that sections 6 and 7 shall not apply with respect to 1 any employee employed in bona fide executiv administrative or professional capacity technical distinctions with respect to qualifications and tests for exemption were the constructs of the wa ge and hour division in defining and delimiting the brief manda from congress and even then it was the product of young agency exploring its mandate and wo rking with the benef it of relatively few precedents from which to draw guidance the 1938 regulation set down by administr ator andrews however useful was an administrative device which andrews himself recognized when inviting post facto comment but once in place the 1938 regulation became the standard upon which future regulations would rest fleming had before him some 2000 pages of testimony collected during the stein hearin gs from representatives of employers and organized labor but those hearings d operated within the context and under the assumptions set down in the andrews re gulation thus the fleming regulation 1940 modification of the andrews regu lation 1938 would begin some 60 years of parsing regulatory language leadin g to the proposed rule of march 31 200329 the 1940 regulation including covering stat ement ran just over one page in the federal register still reasonably simple statement of policy30 where the 1938 regulation had combined executive and admin istrative as single category the 1940 regulation separated them into two classifications31 an executive the regulation stated is one whose primary duty consists of management that is who customarily nd regularly directs the work of other employees who has the authority to hire or fire other employees who customarily and regularly exercises discretionary powers and whose time spent engaged in work comparable to that of nonexempt employees does not exceed 20 of his the executives work hours the regulation added that the 20 restriction shall not apply in the case of an employee who is in sole charge of an independent establishment or physically separated branch establishment32 an exempt executive must be paid salary of at least 30 per weekhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs9 33 the stein report pp 45 is less rigid while the usage of the two terms is so vague and so overlapping that there is generally reco gnized and precise line of demarcation between them it does violence to the common understanding of the words to apply executive to the person who is boss over men and apply administrative to the person who establishes or affects or carries out policy but who has little or authority over the specific actions of other individuals 34 dolwhrseries press re lease of october 14 1940 p 1 35 the earnings test would not apply with resp ect to an employee who is the holder of valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or medicine or any of their branches and who is actually engaged in the practice thereof the license or certificate would be taken as substitute in specific instancesan administrative employee is compen sated for his services on salary or fee basis at rate of not less than 200 per month he must reg ularly and directly assist another bona fide executive or administrative employee where such assistance is nonmanual in nature and re quires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment fu rther it provides an administrative employee is one who performs under only general supervision responsible nonmanual office or field work directly related to management policies or general business operations along specialized or techni cal lines requiring special training experience or knowledge and which re quires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment or whose work involves the execution under only general supervision of special nonmanual assignments and tasks directly related to management policies or general business operations involving the exercise of discretion and independent judgment33 administrative employees were more broa dly defined in the new regulations to include those whose duties while important and associated with management are functional rather th an supervisory34 professional is one whose work is p redominantly intellectual and varied in character as opposed to routine

casebycase basis where any controversy existed36 the pattern of requirement s fell gradually into place some thought the 30 earnings threshold for exemption as an executive was too high fleming reflecting the authority of the administrator explaine d it was my belief that there would be basic error in describing as an ex ecutive any person who is paid less than 30 week he added heretofore the exemption wa s applicable to hourly paid employees if their hourly pay wa s sufficiently high to produce 30 week this proviso has been changed and hourly paid employee can qualify for the exemption thus the salary basis test was set in place37 similarly other qualifying elements came to be established the work of an administrative employee for example w ould need to be nonmanual limitation on the amount of time devoted to nonea p duties must be more than 20 technical or routine work would not qualify worker for exemption38 further professionals to be exempt would have to meet series of tests which fleming enunciated and which w ould remain by and large part of the regulatory structure again the regulatory language the qua lifying elements for section 13a1 exemption was the

were to be treated under the flsa gradually more detailed policy would evolve paid on salary basis during the hearings of the late 1940s one issue raised by the witnesses had been the concept of payment on salary or fee basis48 the weiss report explained number of proposals relating to the salary basis requirements in the regulations were made in the course of the hearing one of these was that the requirement of payment on salary basis be eliminated and that the average compensation be used instead another that employees be permitted to qualify for exemption even if paid an hourly wa ge some witnesses suggested that the term salary basis be defined to mean payment of fixed or guaranteed sum the evidence at the hearing showed clearly that bona fide executive administrative and professional employees are almost universally paid on salary or fee basis compensation on salary basis appears to have been almost universally recognized as the only method of payment consistent with the status implied by the term bona fide executive similarly pay on salary or fee basis is one of the recognized attri butes of administrative and professional employment the proposals to eliminate the requirement and to apply an hourly rate or average earnings test may therefor be rejected as inconsistent with true executive administrative or professional status49 although presented as gene ral requirement in subpart of the regulation 29 cfr 541 the concept was explained more fully in subpart b50 by the 1950s speaking generally severa l patterns were already discernable where the salary tests were concerned first the threshold was regarded as the best determinant of who might legitimately be classified as an executive administrator or in some contexts professional second there was some interest in indexation of the thresholds though it also drew oppos ition and seems to have been dismissed by the division51 third it was clear that with infl ation there was some erosion of the

and cannot qualify them for exempti on as administrative employees52 in may 1953 the association of motion pi cture producers inc protested that many of its highly paid technical worker s ought to have been exempt under section 13a1 of the flsa except that they were paid on an hourly basis rather than on salary basis administrator mccomb ex plained that those portions of the regulations which define and delimit the terms executive administrative and professional include in each case the requirement that the employee must be compensated on salary basis the requirement had been written into the regulation in 1940 by fleming at his disc retion now at the urging of industry mccomb exercising his di scretionary authority proposed further change53 following 30day comment peri od during which

prestige status and importance and the employees salary serves as one mark of his status in management or the professions it is an index of the status that sets off the bona fide executive from the workin g squadleader and distinguishes the clerk or subprofessional from one who is performing administrative or professional work generally speaking sa lary is good indicator of the degree of importance attached to particular employees job maintaining the salary tests was discretionary with the administrator but there was practical consideration they simplif enforcement by screening out the obviously nonexempt empl oyees employees who do not meet the salary test he stated are generally also found not to meet the other requirements60 proposals varied there was apparent consensus that an increase was warranted but industry suggested lower wage stru cture whereas labor argued for higher range kantor in assessing the issue may inadvertently have exposed what some may view as the

lowwage industries and regions and in metropolitan and rural areas in an economy as complex and diversified as that of the united states having raised obliquely the issue of re gional differentials he did not pursue it however if the tests were to be used kantor opined they should be set at points near the lower end of the current range of salaries for each of the categories61 like stein kantor had concerns bout the entire process available information indicates clearly that there is considerable overlapping between salaries paid nonexempt employees and the salari currently paid employees for whom exemption may be claimed and again it has been the divisions experience that there is tendency on the part of employers to misclassify employees particularly in the administrative and prof essional categories when the salary levels become outdated by marked upward movement of wage s and salaries62 proposed rule ra ising the salary thresholds was issued on april 5 195863 although some urged that any increase in the thresholds be deferred because of unfavorable economic conditions administrator clarence lundquist resolved to proceed and issued final rule to take effect on february 2

1960s during the early 1960s the wagehour division took up two aspects of the section 13a1 exemption first there was the continuing issue of adjustment of salary thresholds second there was broader concer n about how exemption should be applied especially in re tail and service industries to which wagehour protections had been extended under the 1961 flsa amendments adjusting the earnings thresholds in january 1962 administrator lundquist noted the widespread increases in wage and payroll levels which have take n place since the various thresholds were last adjusted 1959 and convoked two h earings on the issue march 26 1962 in washington and april 9 1962 in santurce65 as might have been expected reaction to the eap exemption was split some employer representatives proposed elimination of the sa lary tests entirely b others argued for retention but set on an industry area or regional basis c still others proposed that the tests be set at the level of the lowest paid executive employees in the lowest wage and salary areas of the country the dominant position among employers dol reported was that the salary levels should not be increased generally employee representatives appeared to favor threshold increase it was also suggested that any increase in the salary thresholds be pegged to percentage of the increase in the cost of living form of indexation66 ultimately to be ffective september 30 1963 the thresholds were raised as follows for executives to not less than 100 per week 75 in puerto rico the virgin islands or american samoa for administrative workers to not less than 100 per week 75 in puerto rico the vi rgin islands or american samoa and for professionals to not less than 115 pe r week 95 in puerto rico the virgin islands or american

industry and should not be applied69 it was concerned inter alia about problems of definition of industry structure and of the separation of exempt from nonexempt functions the dol summary states employer representatives made it clear that the primary purpose of these their altern ative proposals is to extend the minimum wage and overtime exemption to assistant managers and assistant buyers again employer representatives further state that it is necessary in retail establishments to delegate managerial authority and responsibility downward to the lowest possible echelons with particular refere nce to assistant managers and assistant buyers in this regard they contend that such employees are not assistants to the manager or buyer but that they in fact have equal authority and responsibility with the manager or buyer in the managerial function some argued that the wagesalary structure in retail and service establishments with commissions bonuses etc was different from other industries and that the imposition of salary tests w ould require complete re vamping of their accounting practices70 lundquist was not persuaded that th managerial functions of executive employees in retail and service establishments differ in any significant particular from those of bona fide execu tive employees in other industries or establishments further the administrator stated without intending comment as to th merits of the proposed definition of management in retail and service establishments i consider it both unnecessary and improper to include in the regulations definition of the managerial function which would have exclusive pplication in any one industry lundquist argued for lowe r tolerance for nonexempt work by otherwise exempt executive and administrative employees71

raised b that the salary tests be eliminated and c that differentials be established for geographical regions and for different industries some empl oyers argued that increases should be limited to the percentage increase in the consumer price index in effect form of indexation at the same time moran acknowledged many organizations and individuals opposed our proposals on the ba sis that they would be inflationary labor spokespersons all agreed that an increase in the salary requirements was needed but that the proposed increases were insufficient one union representative recommended an automatic sala ry review provision stating that such provision would eliminate the lengthy periods which normally occur between revisions and would keep the sa laries current and meaningful75 by this

keeping up with past inflationary trends with respect to the union appeal for substantially higher thresholds he protested salary increase of the magnitude which they have proposed would in my judgment cause the loss of the exemption to substantial number of employees who were inte nded by congress to be exempted76 new salary tests were set as follows 125 per week for executive and administrative employees 140 for professi onal employees rate of 200 was set for persons earning at higher level unde r which less emphasis is given to workers duties and responsibilities77 for those

electronics and aerospace industr ies not strictly speaking in field of science or learning but whose crafts are learned primarily through extensive experience and onthejob training rather than through p rolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study the division faced with petitions from some industries was beginning to rethink the scope of the eap exemption and whether it might not be expanded to include certain workers presently covered under flsa min imum wage and overtime pay standards79 among issues specified for discussion were to explore clearer definition of prolonged course of sp ecialized intellectual instruction and study b whether those possessed of such training perform activities substantially different or more difficult than those having lesser degree of training and c the extent to which workers trained in fields of science and l earning consistently exercise discretion and judgment of substantial im portance as opposed to engaging in

ealing with the several salary thresholds under section 13a1 of the flsa the th resholds she pointed out had last been raised in march 1970 and she argued that th ey were increasingly out of date since the last round of increases she stated th consumer price index had increased by 270 points further congress had raised the federal minimum wage by 40 cents an hour from 160 to 200 with mandated st ep increases in the minimum wage to 230 by january 1976 to make the salary tests realistic mu rphy proposed new thresholds and called for co mment through 30day period89 the response was substantial and the administrator extended the comment period until october 29 1974 public hearing was also scheduled90 the proposal sparked attention but it was reported that comment was predominantly negative with the exception of trade union testimony the proposed threshold increases would be inflationary it was argued the national association of manufacturers nam protested that it did not see how it is possible to justify the increase91 for the nam michael markowitz stated throughout industry there are many supe rvisory positions both in the plant and in the office which pay less than 15600 year the interim upset test level proposed by murphy to establish the upper limit at that level would create administrative chaos since for subs tantial percentage of employees with responsibilities that are genuinely execu tive or administrative it would become necessary to document all the other test s to ensure compliance with the law92 similar concern t hough from different

they would be useless and the other duty tests woul d have to be depended upon to make correct separation between exempt and nonexempt employees93 the interim character of the proposed thre shold increases caused broad concern it would set in motion two shifts in personne l policy interim and longterm and there was concern that whatever survey by bureau of labor statistics bls might find rolling back the interim threshold leve ls would be impractical other issues were raised the desire for regional differe ntials for the south and rural areas small business viability and alleged inflationary and employment impacts94 murphy did not call for indexation of the thresholds per but she stated it is believed that the widely accepted cons umer price index may be utilized as guide for establishing these interim rate s although the increases initially proposed had been deemed economically justified by dol murphy opted for more conservative approach thus she stated in order to eliminate any inflationary impact the interim rates hereinafter specified are set at level slightly below the rates based on the cpi because she d adopted conservative approach murphy decided that further distinction shoul d be made between the covered workforce at large and those brought under the act by the amendments of 1966 or by subsequent enactments the new rates to become effective in april 1975 were listed as follows for executive and administrative employees not less that 155 per week for professionals not less than 170 special subminima were set at 130 per week for executive and administrative employees nd at 150 per week for professionals in puerto rico the virgin islands and american samoa for workers paid at higher rate and whose duties may not be monitored as carefully for exemption purposes the socalled upset test was set at 250 with special rate of 200 for workers in puerto rico the virgin islands and american samoa the threshold applicable to the motion picture industry was set at 250 per week murphy regarded the threshold rates as an interim expedient the present rates have become obsolete and inte rim rates are required to protect the interests of all concerned including employees and employers and to enable the wage and hour division to administer the act in proper and equitable manner but she admonished the use of interim rates is not to be considered precedent95httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs24 96 federal register march 31 2003 p 15562 97 us department of labor employment st andards administration executive administrative and prof

not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed subject to specified exceptions the employee must receive the full salary for any week in which any work is perform ed without regard to the number of days or hours worked111 thus for short periods the language w ould be interpreted to mean less than one day any deduction from an employees pay for hours not

majority leader tom delay rtx lauded the fiscal aspects of hr 2673 this omnibus represents the values of disc ipline innovation and conviction we all treasure and declared the bill full of sound disciplined policies funded at responsible reasonable levels146 and representative c w bill young rfl house appropriations committee chairman stressed fiscal res ponsibility observing is we are within the budget there ar lot of good increases but we offset those increases with rescissions so that we were able to stay within the budget147 from the context of the debate on the conf erence report

responded that lthough th proposed legislation was once good bill the admin istration had intervened at the eleventh hour and demanded changes laid down an ultimatum and even forced the conference to take positions in direct c onflict with earlier positions taken on rollcall votes in both the house and the senate certain provisions he stated now made the bill unsupportable to many senators nd

record january 22 2004 pp s128s129the debate that followed was divided along partisan lines with democratic senators taking the lead on the overtime question two issues seemed paramount first there was substantive concern th at the regulation proposed by dol would adversely affect workers senator joseph biden dde stated that the regulation would make it easier would actually create an incentive for employers to classify workers who have little advanced education and little or authority to classify those workers as white collar work ers with the result that millions of workers could lose the right to overtime pay151 second concern was with process senator jack reed dri protested that the bill contains elements that contradict the express votes of this body nd the other body bipartisan votes152 senator tim johnson dsd asserted that there w as conference in meaningful sense153 when there was request for time from the majority senator daschle pleaded for few days to work with the administration and the house to fix the most egregious provisions in this bill provisions that have already been rejected by both houses of congress and bipartisan majorities154 in reply senator frist

cloture an ticipating that clotur would carry senator daschle viewed what he stated was the hijacking of the process that went on during the deliberations on the omnibus appropriations bill the senator opined i know why we will probably get cloture today nobody here wants to be accused of shutting the government down everybody understands the commitment that this legislation reflect s in its support for veterans and for so many other things that we care deeply about senators are put in very difficult position turning again to the issue of process sena tor daschle affirmed i think it is an

elaine chao the lead witness opened the hearing by reminding congress that when adopting th flsa it has chosen not to provide definitions for many of the terms used but rather had left to the secretary the authority and responsibility to define nd delimit these terms from time to time by regulations the primary goal of the pr oposed rule she stated is to have better rules in place that will benefit more worker s especially lowwage workers its intent she affirmed is to restore overtime protections especially to lowwage vulnerable workers who have little bargaining power with employers she pointed to the need to clarify existing law to free the parties from costly class action lawsuits and allow employers to use litigation costs to grow and expand their businesses and create new jobs ms chao added clear conc ise and updated rules will better protect workers and strengthen the departments ability to enforce the law the department she st ated has zero toleran ce for

disagreement among the witnesses that the existing regulations 29 cfr 541 were ambiguous and that the salary thresholds for exemption needed to be updated there was significant disagreement however about both the intent and the likely impact of the proposed rule aflcio secretary treasurer richard trumka charged that the proposed rule would redefine 8 million workers as ineligible for federal overtime prot ection and thousands more workers every year would be stripped of their over time rights the proposal he asserted would effectively gut the 40hour workw eek through administrative regulation the issue before congress trumka argue d is whether the bush administration should be allowed to strip workers of thei r overtime rights the proposed rule he concluded was designed for the bene fit of employers not workers170 economist jared bernstein of the economic policy institute questioned the statistical foundation for dol assertions the difference between the departments impact assessments and those of the institute is large enough to totally change the way one views the proposed regulation and he argued that the proposed rule would be deleterious to the interests of workers171 management attorney david fortney former deputy and acting solicitor of labor in the first bush administration praised secretary chao for undertaking the long neglected task of updating the section 13a1 regulations wh ile he declared the rulemaking process to be fair and orderly fortney pointed out that those who might disagree with the outcome could always sue the fina l regulations he c oncluded will undoubtedly be the subject of challenges in the courts172 to avoid unnecessary litigation howev er was an issue of subcommittee concern if one acknowledges an absence of clarity under the existing regulations would the proposed rule be an improvement the daily labor report observed senator arlen specter rpa who ch airs the laborhhs subcommittee said several times at the hearing that the pr oposed rule does not clarify definitions of professional and administrative employees who would be exempt from overtime protections for example he sa id the proposed rule says professional should be performing work of substantial importance how do you define substantial importance secretary chao acknowledged that both th current regulation and the proposed rule were very complicated173 continuing focus of dispute neither passage of the omnibus legisl ation nor the hearings by the senate appropriations subcommittee resolved the dispute over the administrations section 13a1 proposal consideration of the issu would continue in variety of venueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs40 174 this report moves sequentially through consideration of the proposed rule and ultimately the final rule the provisions will change in some measure prior to promulgation of the final rule on april 23 2004exempting veterans central to the new regulation proposed by dol is the issue of definition for example how w ould bona fide profe ssional be defined for section 13a1 purposes under current regulation profe ssional is not simply highly skilled worker rather dol s anchored the concept to an academic credential normally through not in all cas college degree plus appropriate professional training the proposed rule w ould alter that and in the process the exemption of professionals from flsa wa gehour protection could be significantly expanded some argue compare the langua ge of the current and proposed regulations with respect to the requireme nts for professional status174 professional under the existing regulation 29 cfr 5413d and e2a professional under the proposed regulation 29 cfr 541301a and d knowledge of an advanced type in field of science or learning customarily acquired by prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study as distinguished from general academic education and from an apprenticeship and from training in the performance of routine mental manual or physical processes italics addedthe term advanced knowledge means knowledge that is customarily acquired through prolonged course of specialized instruction but which also may be acquired by alternative means such as an equivalent combination of intellectual instruction and work experience college education would perhaps give an executive or administrator more cultured and polished approach but the necessary knowhow for doing the executive job would depend upon the persons own inherent talent the professional person on the other hand attains his status after prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study italics addedthe best prima facie evidence that an employee meets this requirement is possession of the appropriate academic degree however the word customarily means that the exemption is also available to emplo yees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level as the degreed employees but who attained such knowledge through combination of work experience training in the armed forces attending technical school attending community college or other intellectual instruction italics and bolding added the proposed rule some argue is more flexible andor ambiguous than the language that it would replace moving from documentable professional degree to series of alternative sources and vels of knowledge that in turn would presumably need to be defined and meas ured what meaning is conveyed to an employer or employee in seattle or paso by the terms substantially the same knowledge level or the degreed employees or other intellectual instruction how much work experience with other instruc tion would be requi red for equivalency with the current concept of bona fide professional the

dols attempts to lower the edu cational requirements for the professional exemption and observe d that there is guidance on how to make the determination on whether or not veterans training in the military is equivalent to fouryear degree s ecretary chao perhaps misunderstanding the question replied that the military is not covered by these regulations176 ms chaos response did not quiet concer ns trumka of the aflcio later witness branded as particularly reprehen sible the action of the administration the proposed rule in stripping overtime ri ghts from veterans who have received technical training in the military trumka stated that if an employer determines training received in the military is equivale nt to professional training that employer will now be allowed to deny those veterans overtime eligibility and refuse to pay them anything for overtime work177 later that afternoon senator kennedy asserted that our veterans and our men and women serving so brav ely now in iraq and across the world return to civilian life only to find that the training they earned in the military is cruelly used to deny them their right to overtime pay he added under current regulations workers can be denied overtime protection if they fall within the category of what they call professional employees workers with 4 year degree in professional field it is changed this year under the bush administration the plan would do away with the standard and allow equivalent training in the armed forces you go and serve in iraq and get the training to serve in iraq and come back here and you are ineligible under these regulations for overtime pay178 discussion continued over seve ral days with senator kenne dy and others repeatedly raising the issue of training received in the armed forces

receiving overtime179 dialogue with the partment of labor departmental response was not immediate but dol spokesperson later st ated that veterans will be affected unless they are professionals180 to critics however the affirmation may have begged the question since at issue was how the concept of professional would be defined and how it would be applied to veterans once th ey were discharged and reentered the civilian labor force later under date of january 27 2004 s ecretary chao addressed letter to speaker dennis hastert ril in which she affirmed that the white collar exemptions do not apply to the military they cover only the civilian workforce she added that nothing in the current or proposed regulation makes any mention of veteran status and the pr oposed rule will not stri p any veteran of overtime eligibility ms chao argued that milita ry personnel and veterans are not affected by these proposed rules by virtue of th eir military duties or training and she charged that critics of the proposed rule were trying to confuse and frighten workers181 similarly assistant secretary victoria lipnic reportedly asserted this is new low in the disinformation campaign against the department of labors proposal to strengthen overtime pay protection for workers182 one is claiming that the rule aff ects the military force countered senator kennedy the issue is that the veterans who leave the military to work in the civilian workforce would lose overtime protections because they have had training in the armed forces the provision expanding the definition of learned professional to persons who have received t raining in the armed forces the senator stated is new language it is not in th current regulations the only purpose is to take away overtime for vete rans

active campaign of disinformationon february 12 2004 during hearing before the house appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services education and related agencies representative steny

others that training received in the military will be regarded as professional training which will then be used to exempt people from overtime eligibility secretary chao responded that there is great deal of malicious disinformation on this rule the hoyerchao dialogue continued chao these regulations are very ve ry hard now to enforce our own investigators are sometimes at quandary as to how to fully enforce these rules and whats happening is that the c ourts themselves are very confused veterans i dont know how the people who spread the rumors that veterans would lose all overtime ought to be ashamed of themselves because they are again potentially endangering veterans they are frightening them for good purpose and as i mentioned there is such provision in the proposed rule affecting veterans our final rule has not even come out yet hoyer but you didnt reference as to why the language was addedchao i dont think it was added at all it was not added there is impact at all on veterans there was some aspect about the military training this is whitecollar regulation so thats why it does not affect workers such as construction workers because its blue collar first responders it doesnt its only whitecollar workers second issue was about and this rule only applies to civilian workforce it does not apply to the military workforce hoyer veterans are for the most part civilians chao well this that is not the case veteran status has got nothing to do with qualifying for the professional exemp tion military training does not in and of itself qualify someone for the professi onal exemption so that is not true the secretary then responded more generally the current regulations are very very complex and the outdated na ture of the regulations have made it even more ambiguous and difficult to interp ret very very confusing184 on march 4 2004 the venue had change d hearing before the house committee on ways and means concerning the fiscal year 2005 budget but the

american workers the administration he stated has zero cred ibility on this issue overtime pay the proposed regulation is frontal attack on the 40hour workweek he averred that the new criteria for excluding employees from overtime are deliberately vague and elastic so as to stretch across vast swaths of the workforce senator harkin again raised the veterans training issue ccording to the proposed rules employers can consider specialized traini ng and knowledge gained in the military as equivalent to what is learned in profe ssional schools this will llow employers to reclassify

discussions with small businessmen in wyoming who are being killed by the current regu lations and in some cases by trial attorneys turning to the putative harkin amendment not then introduced senator enzi asserted that it would prohibit th secretary of labor from updating the rules exempting whitecollar employees from the wagehour protections of the act and would be an attempt to reject the new rn back the clock and look to yesterday for the answer to tomorrows problems senator enzi stated through the course of the debate on overtime over the next several days we will hear lot of numbers some of them are statistics and we know how statistics wo rk with that caveat he read into the record the statistical projections of possible impact presented by dol in support of the proposed rule188 senator enzi turned to the issue of th possible impact of the proposed rule for veterans supporters of th is amendment claim that military personnel and veterans will lose their overtime pa under the proposed rules however military personnel and veterans are not affected by the propos ed rules by virtue of their military status or training he said ignoring the issues raised by senator kennedy and others he observed nothing in the current or proposed regulation makes any mention of veteran status senator enzi described the current re gulation as antiquated and confusing adding ambiguities and outdated terms have generated significant confusion regarding which employees are exempt from the overtime requirement the confusion has generated significant litigation and overtime pay awards for highly paid whitecollar employees the proposed regulation he state d would update and clarify the treatment of workers under section 13a1189 discussion of the overtime pay issue continued intermittently as part of the general debate on s 1637 on march 4 senator reid appealed for vote on the harkin amendment to limit the authority of dol to proceed with the proposed rule we have not

senator harkin stressed how urgently necessary it is to deal with the proposed overtime rule192 pointing to the essential trust of the bill serious issues of trade and international economy he urged lets have good debate i am w illing to have time agreement if the other side would like to have time agreement referring to the paucity of opposition comment he stated i want to hear from the other side wh we should let these proposed regulations go into effect lets have the debate so the american people can understand what is at stake and lets have an up ordown vote lets have an upordown vote on whether the senate would agree with the administration that these proposed rules should go into effect he suggested that the department might go back to the drawing board work with congress do it in an open aboveboard manner193 senator charles grassley ria proposed that series of amendments to s 1637 including the harkin amendment be in order senator reid joining the senator from iowa in call for an upo rdown vote expressed concern that the majority still might invoke cloture which would be viewed as counterproductive in an effort to block the harkin amendment senator reid added i think it would be extremely doubtful without an upordow n vote on overtime that he the majority leader would be able to get cloture on this bill194 when the grassley amendment had been agreed to senator harkin

that cloture would be sought although he indicated that he would be opposed to doing so that of course is leadership decision were cloture to be called for nator grassley expressed the hope that it

senator then turned to the tax and trade issues of s 1637197 thereafter senator mitch mcconnell rky submitted motion for cloture198 the motion for cloture some suggested would serve as gauntlet the minority said senator reid believe we are entitled to an upordown vote regarding overtime he explained we know there is an effort not to have vote the reason being this amendment will pass th majority doesnt want to vote on this because it is embarrassing to the president who has support from the american people on this overtime issue while it was not the purpose of the minority he stated to amend this bill to death still cloture vote could result in bringing down s 1637 which he averred is not good for the country199 cloture denied the senate moves on senator max baucus dmt opened the session

upon an increase in the earnings threshold what the impact of that increase might be is subject to dispute as is the question of whether the proposed rule would bring clarity or added confusion but in any case the harkin amendment would not interfere w ith an increase in the earnings threshold it would simply restrict the secretary from redefining the nonmonetary concepts of executive administrative and professional as they appear in the proposed rule 205 congressional record march 23 2004 p s2979consequently has authoriz ed europe to do up to 4 billion year in sanction against us

he would like to get this bill through senator harkin averred the other side though simply because th ey do not want vote on overtime is saying they are going to go ahead and pay these tariffs it seems to what they are saying is they would rather pay tari ffs to europe than overtime to workers again the administration may want to take away overtime pay but at least we ought to have the right to vote on wh ether we ought to uphold that decision203 senator jon kyl raz rose in oppos ition to the harkin amendment and to critique the views of opponents of the dol initiative he sought to clarify the situation so american workers are not fri ghtened of these proposed rules which he said had been subject to mischaracterization by certain people he suggested that some comments about the rule might be inaccurate misleading and therefore frightening senator kyl then reaffi rmed the case for the rule that had been presented by secretary chao affirming it the proposed rule does not take away people it adds to the number of people who would qualify for overtime it will actually ensure that the lowest 20 percent of all salaried workers get pay of time and half for overtime work further he stated by redefining the concepts included in the section 13a1 exemption the dol initiative would eliminate all of the co st and all of the wasted energy in litigation and paying lot of trial lawyers by clarifying who is covered and who is not covered204 in general senator jeff sessions ral concurred with the senator from arizona he protested how frustrating it is to see very carefully constructed proposal by the secretary of labor elaine chao being mischaracterized therefore placing fear in the american people through the misrepresentation of the nature of these regulations205 of

about incurring large unexpected litigation costs due to their inability to properly interpret thes confusing rules even lawyers and department of labor investigators can have difficulty deciphering the line between exempt and nonexempt employees senator sessions added if we make it clearer so that it is indisputable what overtime is and what it is not we will see less confusion206 on the motion

the 152page document was divided into two pa rts section one summarizes comments received by dol together with the departments reaction and policy justification for the final rule the second section constitute s the rule per both segments are essential to an understanding of dols intent and to the interpretation of its policy the final rule quickly sparke d hearings and floor debate226 substance or illusion the final rule appears to differ from th proposed rule in some details but not in broad approach the lower salary threshold below which workers cannot be classified as exempt 22100 in the pr oposed rule was raised to 23660 the proposed rule d set 65000 and over as the salary test for highly compensated employees that upper threshold under the final rule was increased to 100000 above that level workers who perform some executive administrative andor professional functions can be classified as exempt thus there are three categories of salaried workers under the final rule those earning less than 23660 who are minimum wage and overtime pay protected b those earning between 23660 and 100000 who depending upon their duties may be exempt and c those earning more than 100000 who likely are exempt the new threshold levels of the final ru have received considerable attention how significant these changes are may not be clear most bona fide executive administrative or professi onal workers can be expected to earn in excess of 23660 above that level exemption rests larg ely upon the duties test while dol argues that the duties test under the final rule w ill be clearer and easie r to apply critics suggest that it could prove to be more complex and more likel to provoke litigation professional exemption ba sed upon knowledge acquired in the armed forces had produced strongly negative public co mment it was argued incorrectly according to dol that returning vete rans could find themselves unexpectedly exempt because they had r eceived training in or through the military for example in such fields as nursing electronics and space related work while the old rule had emphasized knowledge acquired on the basis of college plus technicalprofessional training the

rules will reduce the cost of litigation encourage employ ers to hire more workers and strengthen current overtime protections it is he concluded good for american workers for american employers and for the american economy255 conversely representative miller stated that the proposed rule would have threatened the overtime prot ections of millions of workers and asserted in the time available to read and analyze the 530 pages of these artfully crafted new regulations it seems clear that the polic continues to be to cut the overtime protection for millions of workers256 he enumerated groups of

lead witness accompanied by administrator mccutchen pointed first to the ambiguity and the outdated nature of the current regulations frozen in time and difficult and sometimes nearly impossible to interpret or enforce in the modern workplace258 then turning to the dol response she affi rmed we have listened very carefully and we have produced final rule that puts workers overtime protections first259 without delving into technical issues secretary chao listed groups of workers that she said would now be protected the final regulations preserve overtime protections for veterans cooks they were never never taken away we have also included union members and made sure that the final regulations preserve overtime protections for union members whose over time pay is secured under collective bargaining agreement she added all bluecollar nd manual laborers are entitled to overtime the new rules either preserve existing definitions of executive professional and administrative du ties or make them stronger and clearer to protect workers based on current federa l case law or statutes and further with these new rules workers will clearly know their rights to overtime pay employers will know what their legal obligations are and this administration which has set new records for aggressive wage and hour enforcement will have updated and strengthened standards with wh ich to vigorously enforce the rule to protect workers pay turning to the alleged campaign of misinfo rmation the secretar stated that unfortunately great deal of misinformati on and distortions harmful to workers has been spread about the impact of these rule s she urged people to not be misled by misinformation that is being spread mildly chiding critics of the final rule she asserted i am deeply concerned about the campaign of misinformation about these new rules the confusion it is designed to create will only harm workers by denying them good information bout their overtime pay rights260 interpreting the rules assertions of clarity not withstanding the final rule is lengthy and complicated replete with new terms and concepts that some charge will need to be litigated perhaps most notable among these is the new subsection 541301d which expands the criteria for professional exemption from primarily degreebased orientati on normally college plus tec hnicalprofessional education to broader and arguably mo re ambiguous standard employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees but who attained the

house committee on education and the workforce and the other hearings that would immediately follow the questions suggested by s ubsection 541301d were numerous inter alia what is meant by substantially the same how will the employer the employee and the department assess the substantial sameness of an employees knowledge and work how much work experience or intellectual instruction does it take to reach equivalency to the prolonged course of specialized in tellectual instruction under the existing rule and pre ssed how would one define intellectual instruction in the context of the section 13a1 exemption in practical terms would the option be loosely applied broadening the section 13a1 exemption and extending it to wide range of currently protected worker s or would its application be narrow registered nurses and lpns with publication of the proposed rule chairman boehner recalled concern was voi ced both by registered nurses and licensed practical nurses about threats to their overtime he asked secretary chao can you explain to the committee exactly how the final regulations treat registered nurses and licensed practical nurses and about nurses w hose overtime is guaranteed under collective bargaining agreement chao the new overtime rules actually strengthen overtime for licensed practical nurses for the very first time lpns are specifically listed as being guaranteed overtime registered nurses status remains unchanged it is what the current rule says furthermore re gistered nurses who are receiving overtime under collective bargaining agreements will continue to receive overtime and if registered nurses are continuing to receive overtime they will continue to receive overtime262 how the concept of substantially the same might apply with respect to nurses and lpns was not addressed nor were issues relating to the potential for adjustment of hourly and salaried pay status for nurses and related workers263 chefs and cooks the final

section 541700a the principal main major or most important duty that the employee performs section 541700b states that time alone is not the sole test of what constitutes workers primary dut thus an employee performing exempt functions for relatively brief period if not regarded as learned or creative professional could still potentially be classified as an exempt executive or administrator 265

predominantly routine mental manual mechanical or physical work264 and to the extent chef has primary duty of work requiring invention imagina tion originality or talent concepts not defined in the rule such chef may be considered an exempt creative professional 265 italics added here too the alte rnative standard substantially the same could come into play representative miller raised the issue with secretary chao we say that those chefs that have fouryear degrees are exempt and we describe the duties that will make them exempted and yet he tinued we know that there are hundreds of thousands of chefs in this country that have twoyear degrees that do those exact same duties266 ms chao affirmed that overtime rights are expressly guaranteed in the final rule and protested that there has been disinformation going on and lot of workers have been scared267 she then turned for technical response to mccutchen who explained that only chefs who have advanced four year college degrees in the culinary arts can be denied overtime pay and we clarified she stated that ordinary cooks and any other type of cook or chef who does not have fouryear post high school degree cannot be denied overtime pay268 later in the hearing the issue was re vived by representative robert andrews dnj who asked if chef in the crea tive professional categor ycould lose his or her overtime protection andrews but there are chefs that have less than this minimum academic standard who could lose their overtime under the new rule correct mccutchen only if theyre creating unique new dishes like theyre creating recipes themselves andrews every chef claims that he or she does that right269 for 12 years karen delaney smith now consultant and part of second panel had been an investigator with dols wa ge and hour division of chefs and sous chefs ms smith stated this is not whitecollar job it is manual much of it is repetitive it is not field of science or learning againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs61 270 statement of karen dulaney smith hous committee on education and the workforce hearing april 28 2004 the rules treatment of chefs is major victory for restaurateurs rob green of the national restaurant association reportedly told the daily labor report see dlr april 21 2004 p aa6 271 fdch transcripts pp 4344 272 subsection 5414 of the final rule 273 fdch transcripts p 6the regulation makes clear that chefs w ho have four year degree are exempt to the extent that chefs have creativ ability they can be exempt creative professionals that means potentia lly every chef can be exempt furthermore having declared the cu linary arts learned profession the department creates the possibility of attaining professional status not just through fouryear college degree but so through work experience how will the department determine that nondegreed employee has substantially the same knowledge as degreed souschef ms smith inquired rhetorically how w ill the department even tell cook from sous chef after all the dicti onary definition of chef is cook270 the restaurant industry smith said has been identified by dol as lowwage industry and she added that its very common in this industry to work 50 or 60 hours week271 status of union workers the final rule provides inter alia that employers and employees are not precluded from negotiating higher overtime premium than provided by the act again not hing in the act or the regulations in this part relieves employers from their contract ual obligations under collective bargaining agreements272 secretary chao assured the co mmittee we have made sure that the final regulations preserve overtime protections for union members whose overtime pay is secured under co llective bargaining agreement273 during questioning representative dale kildee dmi suggested that union workers had concerns about the final rule secretary chao quickly responded that union members covered by collective bargaining agr eements are not impacted at all by this rule and that such concerns were the result of misinformation that was being circulated the secretary added because we wanted to combat some of this misinformation we expressly put in overtime guarantees for union members who are under collective bargaining agreements because union members under collective bargaining agreements will abide by the collective bargaining agreement and when they get overtime that will of course remain the same representative kildee acknowledged that nothing in the regulation relieves employers from their contractual ob ligations under collective bargaining agreements but he added if the union contracts simply refer to applicable law for overtime eligibility union worker will be directly and immediately affected by these regulations when they take effect isnt that true the secretary asked that the question be repeatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs62 274 ibid pp 1618 275 ibid p 69 kildee if union contracts simply refer to applicable law for overtime eligibility union worker will be directly and immediately affected by the applicable law then in other words if the chao if worker is under collective bargaining agreement theyre covered by the collective bargaining agreement and it does not impacted sic by these whitecollar regulations kildee but if the contract refers only to the wage and hour act as it says in effect the overtime shall be in accordance with the wage and hour act then it would be affected by your changes in the wage and hour act chao i dont think so and i will give you another example just because at that point representative kildee broke in to affirm well but it would be brief discussion followed at the close of which ms chao again affirmed union members under collective bargaining ag reements are not impacted then she turned to mccutchen perhaps to clarif it even further mccutchen explained for union member if youre paid by the hour youre titled to overtime thats what these rules say if you perform bluecollar and manual labor 5413 clearly states that youre entitled to overtime so these rules strengthen protections for union workers matter whats in their collective bargaining agreement representative kildee protested you have still not answered my question274 related issues after short break discussi on resumed with second panel among issues discussed was the status of inside and outside sa people treatment of nursery school teachers how team leaders new cept in the final rule and working foremen or assistant managers or working supervisors were to be treated coverage of computer services employees and of those employed in the financial services industry each of these types of work involved technical issues some had been subject of congressional hearings and or of litigation their status for section 13a1 purposes appeared some ar gued neither obvious nor clear as the hearing closed chairman boehne r declared that trying to determine exempt or nonexempt status is not an exact science as for the final rule he stated is it going to be perfect is it lot better than it was absolutely275 hearing senate appropriations subco mmittee may 4 2004 senator specter had early focused attention on dols new overtime pay policy his appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education had conducted overs ight hearings on the issue on july 31 2003 and again on january 20 2004 see discussion above in each case dol had argued that the new rule would benefit both employers and employees but it had some believed been less forthcoming about the actual pr ovisions of the rule then only proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs63 276 secretary chao senate appropria tions subcommittee january 20 2004 277 dlr march 3 2004 p a8and how it could be implemented some subcommittee members questioned whether the rule if finalized would redu ce the need for litigation or conversely would render increased litigation inevitable at the january 20 hearing ms chao d affirmed clear concise and updated rules will better protect workers and strengthen the departments ability to enforce the law276 meanwhile dol spokesperson ed frank would speak of needless litigation and outdated flsa rules reiterating the views of ms chao frank stated clearer uptodate rules will also better protect workers overtime rights277 views from the department of labor the appropriations subcommittee on may 4 2004 conducted third hearing on the overtime pay rule now in its final form overtime pay is important to american workers and their families began administrator mccutche n and this updated rule repr esents great benefit to them the rule she affirmed will strengthen overtime rights for various categories of workers end much of the confusion about these exemptions and return clarity and common sense to the section 13a1 regulations it will help workers better understand thei r overtime rights make it easier for employers to comply with the law and strengthen the labor departments enforcement of overtime protections dols primary goal she said remains to protect low wage workers and further to reduce wasteful litigation she declared we simply cannot allow this lega l morass to tinue unabated mccutchen assured the subcommittee that dol had listened to thousands of comments and had designed new regulations that are clear straightforward and fair she also lamented that recent pre ss coverage and public debate over this rule has been misleading and inaccurate nd decried the tremendous amount of misinformation about the likely impact of the departments new rule on employees such as bluecollar worker s mccutchen explained the department never had any intention of taking overtime rights away from such employees and the final rule makes this clear beyond shadow of doubt the final rule provides that manual borers or other blue collar workers are not exempt under the regulations and are entitled to overtime pay matter how highly paid they might be this includes for example nonmanagement productionline employees and nonmanagement employees in maintenance construction and similar occupations mccutchen continued the department never inte nded to allow the professional exemption for any employee based on veteran status and those working under union contracts are protected under section 5414 she affirm ed adding the final rule will not affect union workers covered by collective bargaining agreements in closing she charged once more that great deal of misinformation has surrounded the regulations they have been unfairly ch aracterized as taking awayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs64 278 administrator mccutchen senate appropriation subcommittee may 4 2004 279 accordingly if an employee were engaged in professional work as result of training that was received in the armed forces it may be that he or she could be exempt on the basis of that training not on th basis of veteran status 280 david fortney senate appropriation subcommittee may 4 2004overtime pay from millions of americans when the exact opposite is true she affirmed workers win under this final rule278 voice in support of the final rule in defense of the final rule david s fortney deputy and acting solicitor at dol during the first bush administration characterized the existing regulation in starkly negative terms dramatically outdated imposing significant confusion and uncertainty frustrates compliance efforts vague regulations result in unintentional noncompliance and resulting liabilities and vague and ambiguous difficult to apply his comments were positive with respect to the final rule employers clearly benefit from having an unambiguous rule that help s facilitate compliance introduces clarity and common sense adds much needed clar ity more concise easier to understand clearer in scope he stated there also has been significant amount of confusion resulting from inaccurate information and news stories to provide clarity fortne addressed the matter of the professional exemption and training received in the armed for ces he assured the subcommittee quoting from the preface to the final rule that dol never intended to allow the professional exemption base d on veterans status he added again quoting the final rule thus vetera n who is not performing work in recognized professional field will not be exempt regardless of any training received in the armed forces the language of the final rule he explai ned was amended to clarify that veteran status alone will not be sufficient but that combination of work and experience may allow the employee to qualify for ex emption determined on casebycase basis279 fortney praised the primary duty test under current regulation he said there were drawn out disputes requiring expensive timemotion studies or similar efforts in order to determine whether th employee was properly engaged in exempt work the new test will avoid the need for such expensive and time consuming analyses and promote greater compliance he also stated unionized employees will continue to receive overtime as provided by their collective bargaining agreements and specific provision has been added to the regulations specifying that blue collar workers are not exempt from overtime he urged employers employees and government enforcement ag encies alike to embrace the final rule280 overall he ventured little beyond the final rule per technical administrative questions raised by critics remained to be addressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs65 281 dlr april 27 2004 p e3 282 ibid p e5 283 fdch transcripts pp 2728 284 ibid p 28doubts and concerns where supporters of the final rule tended to speak in general terms and to emphasize what they viewed as its positive aspects critics looked to nutsandbolts issues ie to definitional questi ons to practical aspects of administering the rule and to its more specific workforce implications team leaders subsection 541203c of the final rule introduced the concept of the exempt team leader it states an employee who leads team of other employees assigned to complete major projects for the employer such as purchasing selling or closing all or part of the business negotiating real estate transaction or collective bargaining agreement or designing and implementing productivity improvements generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative exemption even if the employee does not have direct supervisory responsibility over the other employees on the team italics added the aflcio quickly took note of this pr ovision declaring that it was an enormous new loophole that will allow management to disqualify workers from overtime simply by appointing them team leaders281 responding to aflcio concern dol declared in flat and unqualified term s the final rules ensure overtime protection for blue collar team leaders and are more protective of overtime pay for white collar team leaders than the current regulations282 bolding in original the issue had been raised during the april 28 hearing before the house committee on education and the workforce representative donald payne dnj questioned secretary chao about the team leader provision chao ill be more than glad to answer the issue about team leaders because that is also an area of confusion in fact our final rule strengthens overtime protection for workers because we tighten up on the language and we clarify language and narrowed its scope ms chao then turned to administrator mccutchen who read into the record the phasing of the final rule and affirmed that only the leaders of these major project teams can be exempt mccutchen adde d weve defined what it means to carry out major assignment and limited it to only those very significant assignments that happen in corporation the admin istrator concluded so its very much tightened and more protective than the current regulatory language283 representative payne suggested there seemed to be certain subjectivity rather than clarity you know what is significant to one person may not be significant to someone else284 former wagehour inve stigator karen dulaney smith raised similar concerns that word team leader is not in the current regulation we dont know what thats going to mean team lead ers smith statedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs66 285 ibid p 44 the term is not defined in the final rule 286 becker senate appropriations subcommittee may 4 2004 287 eisenbrey senate appropria tions subcommittee may 4 2004 288 fdch transcripts pp 1 and 6would have been nonexempt when i wa s an investigator unless they had supervisory duties and ma nagement responsibilities285 during her testimony week later at the senate appropriations subcommittee mccutchen was silent on the team leader matter but the issue was promptly raised by aflcio associate general counsel craig becker this is broad new category of exempt employees he stated given the increasing organization of work into teams and the incentive this provision will give employers to so organize work it potentially sweeps large numbers of employees in numerous industries outside the protections of the act286 ross eisenbrey of the economic policy institute shared similar view bizarre and poorly explained new exem ption for team leaders creates the potential for hundreds of thousands of currently nonexempt nonsupervisory workers to lose their overtime rights the use of selfmanaged teams of non managerial nonsupervisory frontline employees is widespread in american industry and millions of employees are routinely involved in them eisenbrey concluded the regulations provide definiti on of team leader it has never been defined in flsa case law nd the departments assertion that it is clarifying current law is patently false287 bluecollar worker protection before the committee on education and the workforce secretary chao had affirmed the new rules are very clear all bluecollar and ma nual laborers are entitled to overtime and again the new rule exempts only whitecollar jobs from overtime protection bluecollar workers will not be affected by the new regulation288 the final rule subsection 5413a however states in pertinent part the section 13a1 exemptions and the regulati ons in this part do not apply to manual laborers or other blue collar workers who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands physical skill and energy and later thus for example nonmanagement productionline employees and non management employees in maintenance construction and similar occupations are entitled to minimum wage and overtime premium pay under the fair labor standards act and are not exempt under the regulations in this part matter how highly paid they might be italics added what if bluecollar worker engaged in line or production work also had duties that could be classified as executive or administrative the final rule sets standard with respect to the proportion of workers time that must be devoted to exempt work in order to be classified as exem pt if upon whatever basis workers primary duty the principal main major or most important duty that the employee performshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs67 289 becker of the aflcio in his may 4 2004 testimony refers to vague definition of primary duty that requires applicati on of wide variety of factors and u ltimately subjective judgment he adds this vague and ultimately subjective test will lead many employers to misclassify employees as exempt based on the employers own notion of what is most important thereby contracting coverage and increasing litigation 290 eisenbrey senate appropria tions subcommittee may 4 2004 291 see us congress house committee on education and the workforce subcommittee on workforce protections hearing on the treatment of inside sales personnel and public sector volunteers under th fair labor standards act hearings 105th

by the employer can be said to be an executive or administrative function would that bluecolla r worker still be nonexempt289 it was technical question among many that the secretary and the administrator did not explore but eise nbrey expressed concer n about definitional issues involved he suggested that despite claims that bluecollar workers are entitled to overtime the rule limits overtime rights to nonmanagement bluecollar employees begging the question of who gets classified as management blue collar worker seemingly new class of exempt workers that will grow significantly under these new rules he observed i t appears that the management of team would transform manual labor er or other bluecollar employee into management bluecollar employee leading to exemption and loss of overtime pay290 financial services employees for the past decade certain interests have sought to have inside sales staff declared exempt from flsa overtime pay protection291 congress has not acceded inside sa staff remain nonexempt the final rule however moves toward exempting at least certain inside sales staff from wagehour protection secti on 541203b reads as follows employees in the financial services industry generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing information re garding the customers income assets investments or debts determining which financial products best meet the customers needs and financial circumstan ces advising the customer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of different financial products and marketing servicing or promoting the employers financial products however an employee whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for the administrative exemption italics added while the specified duties might include work such as those listed it need not include all of them others not listed among the examples set forth in the rule could also satisfy the requirement as in othe r areas the determinative factor would seem to be ones definition of primary duty since the final rule eliminates percentage factor with respect to perfo rmance of exempt duties amount of time spent single exempt function might be suffici ent to trigger exempt statushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs68 292 fdch transcripts p 10 293 ibid pp 1112 294 ibid pp 3738 the treatment of funeral directors and embalmers and of insurance claims adjusters was also contentious nd were included in representative biggerts question longstanding dol positions in these areas are overturned through the final rule and indirectly as the result of litigationwhat the definition of financial services industry encompasses may also be of concern for some for example alt hough it likely includes banks what about brokerage firms the insurance industry tax assistance the interpretation given to marketing servicing or promoting the employers financial products may be more troublesome how are those concepts to be differen tiated from selling the issue of definition was raised dur ing the april 28 hearing before the committee on education and the workforce with chao and mccutchen at the witness table representative miller reviewed the requirements of the final rule under 541203b and observed that if you call citicorp or you call wells fargo you find out that theres one person on the othe r end of the line that does all of those things for the employer representativ miller said little flag goes up make sure you dont designate these people as primarily sellin g the products292 administrator mccutchen re sponded that the financial services section of the final rule reflects the cu rrent regulation and also adopt s the current case law she added what we did was we took that current case law we read what it said and we adopted it and put it in the regulations so that employees and employers dont have to hire lawyer to go find the case law thats not reflected in the current regulations because as the secretary said this 50 years of federal court case law is not reflected in the current litigation293 later representative judy biggert ril caused dol to revisit the issue as you know weve heard in detail about lot of misinformation spread around about these regulations ms biggert stated can you specifically tell how the final rules apply to workers in the financial services industry the administrator replied mccutchen what we did is to dopt the existing federal court case law and we did not just list their title we took the case law and we said for example financial services employees who collect and analyze financial information who provide advice and consulting to customer about which financial products are appropriate are entitled to overtime consistent with the federal regulation ms biggert asked why did the departme nt specify these segments in particular ms mccutchen responded in pa rt because these were gments in particular that in recent years have generated lot of confusion and lot of litigation294 with the second panel seated representa tive miller raised the issue with former wagehour investigator karen dulaney smith

the least she suggested the provision would be confusion to employers and could encourage more litigation295 she termed the provisi on loophole that removed the distinction between inside sales nonexempt and outside sales traditionally exempt the administration said repeatedly that theyd like to have clearer law one that lets employers know what its obligations are this is not it296 when administrator mccutchen appear ed before the senate appropriations subcommittee week later her prepared statement made reference to the financial services issue craig becker of the aflcio however before the same subcommittee did raise the question the fi nancial services provision he stated exempts vast range of employees w ith the only exception being those whose primary duty is selling financia l products becker argued that blanket exemption for an industry was radical departur from prior practice which had relied upon the actual duties performed turning to dols reliance on case law he stated that case law is not as uniform as the department suggests297 chairman specter and ranking member harkin had expresse d strong interest in the overtime pay issue and the hearing pr esented an opportunity for an explanation of the final rule according to the daily labor report each now reacted to dol testimony with varying degrees of skepticism senator specter reportedly suggested that the new rules require lot of interpretation and will spawn lots of litigation lots of class actions senator harkin was quot ed characterizing the final rule as antiemployee and an attack on the 40hour workweek298 amending the jobs act s 1637 phase ii in early may 2004 the senate resumed c onsideration of s 1637 at issue was the harkin amendment to deny dol the authority to reduce overtime pay protection through implementation of the fina l rule see discussion above gregg amendment presented on may 4 2004 senator gregg rose to decry the fairly byzantine and complex set of regulations governing overtime pay and to applaud dol for its conscientious job with respect to the final rule he spoke of the hyperbole and attack to wh ich the rule had been subjected and the totally spurious and inappr opriate analysis prepared by people who either did not understand the rules or decided to pervert the rules and wh ich in turn led to lot of misrepresentation argu ments of critics he termed so bogus and so inaccurate that it is important to understand how misl eading it was as it represents sort of theme of inaccuracy relative to the initial proposed regulations299httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs70 300 congressional record may 4 2004 p s4791 senator gregg is chairman of the senate committee on health educa tion labor and pensions 301

this regulation as proposed is to make sure people earning not significant amount of money are going to get overtime what the rule does is try to put certainty and definition into the law300 senator gregg characterized the harkin amendment as an effort to stall the final rule and suggested that adoption of th harkin amendment would put at risk the overtime protection of 67 million people the amendment he stated provides attempt to address the overall issue in comprehensive and systematic way301 thereupon senator gregg proposed his ow n amendment to be juxtaposed to the harkin amendment302 he noted that about 55 gr oups have expressed concern about their overtime pay status under the fi nal rule we dont think most of them are at risk because we think the regulati on is pretty clear but just so there can be question about it this amendment sp ecifically names every one of those groups and says they have the right to thei r present overtime situ ation the gregg amendment provides 1

classifications described in paragraph 3 as the protections provided for such employees under the regulations in effect under such subsection on march 31 2003 3 the occupations or job classificati ons described in this paragraph are as follows the list of potentially impacted occupations or job classifications was included in the gregg amendment among them were the following any worker paid on an

affirmed this amendment goes to getting clarity clarity in the law303 senator harkin challenged senator greggs amendment as real acknowledgment that there is long list of occupations and people who are in danger of losing their overtime pay senator harkin suggested that one problem was definitional for example the gregg amendment puts in team leaders but we do not know what team leader is because it has never been defined what is team leader the gregg amendment puts in refinery workers does that mean oil refinery or does that cover ethanol plants in iowa that is refinery who is covered by that we do not know technicians what is technician ther is definition of technician the gregg amendment covers funeral director s but how about embalmers we dont know he suggested that he could support the gregg amendment to move the process along but his objections to it were numerous304 debate resumes reconciling the gregg amendment with the final rule was then explored senator kennedy urged support for the gregg amendment but argued that it would not produce clarification t the contrary it w ill provide additional litigation because the test in the final rule refers to the duties and not to the professional names that are be ing used the harkin ame ndment he said is the right way to go and i hope th senate will follow his lead305 conversely senator mike enzi rwy charged that

rule states first responders such as police firefighters paramedics and emergency medical technicians are eligible for overtime pay question gray area it clears it up the final rule also states licensed practical nurses do not qualify as exempt learned professionals and are therefore eligible for overtime pay the final rule clarifies that the contractual obligation under collective bargaining agreements is not affected the new rule will guarantee overtime pr otection for blue collar team leaders and is more protective of overtime pay for white collar team leaders furthermore there is change to curre nt law regarding the overtime status of computer employees financial services employees journalists insurance claims directors funeral director s athletic trainers nurse ry schoolteachers or chefs senator enzi further affirmed we need to keep it simple and understandable the rule does that lawsuits necessary it is very clear that is what the department intends after lamenting the antiquated and confusing current regulation with its windfall for trial lawyers he endorsed the gregg ame ndment which he said would provide clearer and fairer overtime rights for workers306 the final rule however did not dispel interpretive disagreements senator herb kohl dwi speaking immediately after nator enzi found it unlikely to clarify anything for small business we have not simplified anything he noted troubling exemptions of entire jobs and industries and observed that the rule exempts from overtime team leaders even though thes employees may have supervisory role he further stated certain industries have worked for years to get out of paying overtime to their workers and the rules list of exemptions reads like roll call of those that succeeded for reasons unclear even afte r 500 pages of explanation journalists personal trainers financial services wo rkers and computer industry workers to name just few classes are summarily ineligible for overtime senator kohl concluded any weakening of the overtime rules is step down on the ladder of economic progress307 while supporters of the final rule repeat edly affirmed that dol had listened and had revised the rule to render it more accep table some disagreed senator russell feingold dwi alluded to largely cosmetic changes that the administration grudgingly made at the eleventh hour that did not

agreed that clarity with avoi dance of unnecessary litigation was very important objective however on the basi s of an extended hearing this morning with administrator mccutchen and witnesses for and against the final rule he concluded that there is indication that this new regulation is going to clarify anything at all he turned to the issue of team leader this term team leader i think is going to provide additional complexity so that proposed final regulation here in stead of simplifying and directing and being an effective instrumentality to liminate litigation appears to to be advance over the current regulation and when you come down to the injection of new concept of team leader it creates additional complications senator specter declared that on the cu rrent state of the record i am opposed to the proposed regulation and he affirm ed his support for the harkin amendment309 division seemed wide does any body believe this administrations department of labor is trying to expa nd overtime pay aske d senator christopher dodd dct that is not why the business community is supporting this rule change because they want to expand overtime pay he stated the administration clearly wants to restrict it and redefine job categories that will allow them to do so310 proceeding to vote on may 4 the senate voted on the harkin amendment and the gregg amendment as well two parallel roll

administrator for policy wage and hour division was the lead dol witness for the may 20 hearing316 he began by affirming the department is very proud of the final rule overtime pay is important to american wo rkers and this updated rule represents great benefit to them he proceeded to list the groups of workers who dol held would benefit from the strengthened overtime protections he noted the alleged deficiencies of the current regulations stating that small business owners can ill afford large and potentially devasta ting legal fees to decipher and litigate the old rules maze of vague and complicated overtime standards and he praised the final rule as clear st raightforward and fair317 robinson assured the subcommittee that dol had listened to thousands of comments from workers and employer s and from congress whose comments have been tremendous benefit to the department then he added unfortunately much of the press coverage and public debate over this rule has been misleading and inaccurate318 robinson affirmed that dols primary go was to protect lowwage workers even lawyers he said have found it difficult to determine who is entitled to overtime pay under the old ru and very few employ ees understood their rights arguing for clearer rules that reflect the workplace of the 21st century he concluded we simply cannot allow this legal morass to c ontinue unabated setting

robinson observed that dol has relied on existing case law in drafting that provision 320 dlr may 21 2004 pp aa1aa2not likely to have substantial impact on small businesses he estimated that only 107000 employees who earn at least 100000 per year and perform office or nonmanual work and customarily and regularly perform exempt duties could be classified as exempt however the department believes even this result is unlikely italics in the original robinson added that few if any workers earning between the 23660 and 100000 thresholds are likely to lose the right to overtime pay in closing robinson again asserted that great deal of misinformation has surrounded the final rule but stated we at the department of labor are very proud of the updated rule although dol did not initially address issues raised in prior hearings they soon surfaced representative linda sanchez dca raised the issue of team leaders robinson responded that the final rule is more protective of such workers than current regulation when he stressed that team leaders would be engaged in major projects ms sanchez pointed to those w ho might be involved in quality teams suggesting that the concept could be subject to litigation319 ms sanchez also raised the issue of overtime protection for workers covered by collective bargaining agreement r obinson replied that these regulations do not apply to people in unions he expl ained union employ ees are protected by their collective bargaining agreements ms sanchez rephrased the question explaining that some collective bargaining agreements defer to applicable federal law on overtime issues and if the law or here the regulation were changed it could impact workers even those under collec tive bargaining agreement the query was expanded upon by

overtime requirements of the flsa the industry had sought exemption of such workers as professionals position that dol had consistently rejected until promulgation of the final rule the department concluded in the early 1970s fitch explained that license d funeral directors and em balmers do not satisfy the current duties test for learned professionals322 fitch argued that funeral directors continually exercise discre tion and judgment cannot dhere to rigid schedule because death is unpredictable and are employed by mostly small familyowned businesses and should not receive ove rtime pay when called upon to work more than 40 hours week323 under the final rule he concluded dol recognized for the first time licensed funeral directors and embalmers as professionals ross eisenbrey of the economic policy institute was more pessimistic the rule he protested is far more likely to provoke additional litigation than to prevent it324 italics in original he stated i believe the rule is so ambiguous and internally inconsistent that businesses will find themselves unable to understand or explain it and workers will be much more likely to sue when employers take ad vantage of the rule to reclassify their employees and cut costs the rule both eliminates key objective tests that provide clarity in the current regulations and introduces host of ambiguous new terms and provisions that will be the source of litigation for many years to come eisenbrey projected lawsuitbylawsuit interpretation of the final rule with questions and comments he walked the subcommittee through the rule why arent sous chefs who spend ll but few minutes of the day working with their hands blue collar it is only nonmanagement production line employees and non management employees in maintenance construction and similar occupations who are entitled to overtime premium payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32088crs78 325 subsection 5413a provides inter alia nonmanagement productionline employees and nonmanagement employees in maintenanc construction and similar occupations are not exempt under the regulations in this pa rt matter how highly paid they might be 326 eisenbrey predicted small business subcommittee may 20 2004 the single change from current law that will create the most conf usion and spark the most litigation is probably the new test for exemption as learned professional 327 dlr august 23 2004 p aa1the rule gives clue about how to distinguish management production line employee from nonmanagement production line employee or management maintenance employee from nonmanagement maintenance employee325 bolding in original this the concept of team leaders is broad new exemption that could apply to as many as 23 million currently nonexem pt team leaders throughout american industry the only limitation on this exem ption is that the teams project must be major definition of major is provided in the rule this new learned professional exempti on allows employers to deny overtime pay to employees who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees what does substantially the same mean it doesnt mean equal knowledge could it mean less how much less could nondegreed employee know and still be considered professional the dol has gone to great lengths to deny that knowledge employees gain from service in the armed forces can be used to establish this exemption the learned professional but how will employers prove that none of the knowledge veteran has that gives him substantially the same knowledge as degreed professionals was gained in the armed services326 eisenbrey raised number of other questi ons dealing for example with the definition of customarily and regularly as applied to exempt highly compensated employees the distinction for exemption purposes between marketing servicing or promoting the employers financial pr oducts and selling fi nancial products the former are exempt the latter are not the issue of working supervisors and the concept of concurrent duties summer and fall of 2004 as time for implementation of the new rule came closer the options of critics seemed to fade327 congress could intervene direc tly with amendment of the flsa but that would seem unlikely given the position of the administrati on congress might have taken up the specter proposal

the history of the fair labor sta ndards act and of its importance to workers especially to thos at the margins of the economy overtime pay rewards work and it reduces expl oitation the 40hour workweek he suggested creates jobs requiring timeandahalf pay for overtime work encourages employers to hire more worker s rather than requiring additional hours of work from existing employees to co mpensate such workers who are engaged through extended periods he st ated is simple fairness373 at this point senator harkin proposed new bill s 223 of the 109th congress that addressed the current flsa regulations in two ways first it set aside the existing regulations those in effect ce august 2004 allowing all workers to be covered under the act on the basis of th regulations in effect on march 31 2003 the proposal states that portion of such regulations as in effect on march 31 2003 that would prevent such employee fro m being exempt shall be reinstated second it provided for indexation of the cove rage formula under new rule that all persons earning less than 591 per week would be exempt from the rule that is covered by the standard wage and hour provisions of the act it then provided that not later than december 31 of each calenda r year the secretary shall increase the minimum salary level for exemption under subsection a1 by an amount equal to the increase in the employment cost index for executive administrative and managerial occupations for the year involved374 indexation of the exemption harkin affirmed would avoid future loss of overtime protections due
