middle eastern aﬀairs january 15 2009 abstract the gaza crisis constitutes conundrum for all involved israel would like to avoid drawnout invasion and occupation of gaza but at the same time does not want to abandon the military operation without assurance that the end result will leave israelis more secure from rocket attacks although the ground attack might endanger its rule in gaza hamas may welcome it in the hopes of miring israeli forces in closequarters combat to strip away their advantages in technology and ﬁrepower and in hopes of heightening perceptions that palestinians are being victimized linking the cessation of violence in and around gaza with international enforcement of truce or broader regional security initiative may be possible but at present proposed solution appears

military campaign dubbed operation cast lead against the palestinian islamist militant group hamas in the gaza strip in order to counter palestinian rocket fire and more broadly to significantly weaken all aspects of hamas rule in gaza on january 3 2009 israel began ground offensive into gaza likely intended to eliminate hamass willingness or capability to launch rockets at israeli towns and cities as of january 5 israeli bombings and ground forces had reportedly killed over 530 palestinians while five israelis had been killed by palestinian rockets and attempts to counter the ground invasion some israeli observers have suggested that neither toppling the hamas regime nor permanently ending all rocket attacks is realistic goal nevertheless by temporarily disabling hamass military capacity israel could ease the frequency and intensity of hamas attacks in the months ahead as it prepares to deploy new more sophisticated antirocket defense systems one complicating factor for israel is time the longer operation cast lead runs without definitive outcome in israels favor the more pressure will grow for cessation of hostilities the unraveling of the sixmonth tahdiya or temporary ceasefire between israel and hamas that led to the december 2008 outbreak of violence in and around the gaza strip can be linked to several factorssome tactical some more deeplyrooted some commentators have said that giving up on the ceasefire was in both sides interests the world response to the gaza crisis has been characterized by consistent calls for an end to the violence and by concern over the humanitarian situation in gaza the crisis also has exacerbated tensions between countries in the region with relatively prowestern orientationlike egypt jordan and saudi arabiaand other countries and nonstate actorslike iran syria and hezbollahthe more that the israeli offensive is perceived to target gazas largely impoverished 15 million residents the greater the possibility that palestinians in gaza and the west bank could decide to rise up in opposition another intifada could have wideranging consequences for israelis and palestinians and significantly hamper chances for reprising the peace process us presidentelect barack obama will likely be compelled to address the gaza situation directly at the outset of his administration the incoming 111 th congress may be called upon to increase various forms of assistance to israel to the palestinian authority headed by president mahmoud abbas and to palestinian civilians in order to support sustainable postconflict order that guarantees israels security and attends to the needs of the palestinian humanitarian situation the gaza crisis constitutes conundrum for all involved israel would like to avoid drawnout invasion and occupation of gaza but at the same time does not want to abandon the military operation prematurely for fear of having to go back into gaza at later date although the ground attack might endanger its rule in gaza hamas may welcome it in the hopes of miring israeli forces in closequarters combat to strip away th eir advantages in technology and firepower and in hopes of heightening perceptions that palestinians are being victimized linking the cessation of violence in and around gaza with international enforcement of truce or broader regional security initiative may be possible but at present proposed solution appears straightforward this report will be updated as necessary to reflect further developments

operation cast lead against the palestinian islamist militant group hamas in the gaza strip in order to counter palestinian rocket fire and more broadly to significantly weaken all aspects of hamas rule in gaza initially coordinated israeli air strikes against preselected targets took hamas by surprise as the operation was timed to coincide with meeting of its leadership as well as graduation ceremony of hundreds of new hamas police cadets in addition to hamas weapons caches and military facilities israel has targeted other symbols of hamass infrastructure that it believes have been used to advance military objectives including mosque the islamic university of gaza hamass aqsa television station and network of sm ugglers tunnels along the border with egypt israeli air strikes have killed senior hamas militants including shaykh nizar rayyan described by israeli media sources as one of hamass topfive decisionmakers and its top clerical authorityboth the religious leader of hamass military wing the izz din qassam brigades and its liaison with hamass political wing on january 3 2009 israel expanded its operations by beginning ground offensive in gaza sending thousands of troops over gazas northern border along with tanks armored personnel carriers and artillery divisions as of january 5 approximately 4000 israeli troops were in gaza reportedly seeking to take control of sites used for military purposes by hamas and its allies they have reportedly positioned themselves around gaza city after taking control of gazas main northsouth highway and there have been reports of fighting within gaza city itself some observers believe that by cutting off northward access israeli forces are seeking to choke off hamass supply lines preventing them from supplying their fighters with weapons and food smuggled into the south through tunnels from egypt as of january 5 israeli air and naval strikes and ground forces had reportedly killed over 530 palestinians and wounded approximately 2600 others including hundreds of hamas gunmen and over 100 palestinian civilians while five israelis had been killed by palestinian rockets and attempts to counter the ground invasion and approximately 50 others had been wounded israeli officials also have said that several hamas fighters have been taken into israeli custody according to israeli defense minister ehud barak and mark regev spokesman for prime minister ehud olmert israels attacks are intend ed to deal hamas severe blow ending its willingness and capability to launch rockets at israeli towns and cities following the commencement of ground operations barak said this will not be easy or short but we are determined some speculate that israels real goal may be to oust hamas from gaza completely citing statements from leaders such as the following one made on january 2 by vice premier haim ramon on israeli television what i think we need to do is to reach situation in which we do not allow hamas to govern 2 palestinian rocket attacks on southern israel have continued and hamas political chief khaled meshaal has pledged that dark fate will await the israelis as result of their ground invasion

has prepared based on methods used by hezbollah the lebanese shia militant group whose summer 2006 war with israel is regularly compared by observers to the conflict in gaza3 the intensification of israeli military operations has led to heightened international pressure for an end to hostilities or temporary ceasefire attention has also been called by some to what they characterize as worsening humanitarian situation for the people of gaza 4 although israel insists that it is not targeting gazas population at largeonly hamasand that it plans to continue to allow gazan civilians to receive necessary subsistence and medical care prior to the start of israels campaign experts had warned that fullscale resumption of israeli palestinian violence was imminent as egyptian mediation failed to extend the sixmonth cease fire tahdiya or calm that expired on december 19 2008 each party felt as though the other was violating the terms of the original ceasefire hamas demandedunsuccessfullythat israel lift its economic blockade of gaza while israel demandedalso unsuccessfullya full end to rocket fire and progress on the release of gilad shalit an israeli corporal who has been in hamass captivity for more than two years violence had already resumed in the waning days of the ceasefire after an israeli raid on november 4 ostensibly aimed at preventing hamass use of tunnels to abduct israeli soldiers palestinian rocket fire on israel resumed with greater intensity some analysts speculated that the crossborder skirmishes and rocket fire that continued into december represented jockeying by both parties for more favorable renegotiating positions as the ceasefires december 19 expiration approached 5 on the 19th hamas issued statement on its website that the ceasefire is over and there will not be renewal because the zionist enemy has not respected its conditions on december 24 approximately 60 rockets were fired into southern israel from gaza the magnitude of this violation of israeli airspace and territoryalthough it did not cause casualtiesapparently prompted the israeli leaderships decision to launch the december 27 air strike and larger offensive although it appears that the timing of the conflicts outbreak was driven primarily by the end of the ceasefire the fact that it occurred during the us presidential transition and on the eve of israeli elections scheduled for february 2009 not to mention just two weeks before the possible although disputed expiration of abbass pa presidential term on january 9 2009 6 has led some observers to speculate that these political factors had at least partial influence on israels and hamass actions in any event it now appears likely that the fighting in and around gaza could impact nearterm

gazamilitary economic and culturalso that it would take several years of rebuilding for hamas to return to its pre december 2008 strength by temporarily disabling hamass military capacity israel could substantially ease the frequency and intensity of hamas attacks in the months ahead as it prepares to deploy new more sophisticated antirocket defense systems with gaza blockaded by land and sea israel has calculated that it would take hamas significantly longer to rebuild than it took for hezbollah after its war with israel in 2006 weakened hamas may also be more susceptible to accepting terms of reconciliation offered by its palestinian rival fatah the political movement currently headed by mahmoud abbas who is both president of the palestinian authority pa and chairman of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization plo which has been bolstered by international assistance and israeli engagement over the past year

have suggested that survival is hamass main goal as the organization may try to retain some rocket capability until the fighting wanes in anticipation of the israeli ground incursion there has been much speculation over the size and capabilities of hamass guerrilla army in gaza experts have warned that if hamas like hezbollah possess network of underground bunkers antitank missiles and shoulderfired anti aircraft missiles it may be formidable opponent for israeli ground forces hezbollah has benefitted however from significant iranian and syrian weaponry and training it is unclear whether hamas has had the same level of external assistance though israel routinely accuses iran of supplying hamas weaponry to date israeli ground forces do not appear to have met formidable resistance from hamas fighters or prepared positions one complicating factor for israel is time th longer operation cast lead runs without definitive outcome in israels favor the more pressure both internal and external will grow for cessation of hostilities furthermore the risk of unintended regional escalation though it remains low is always possibility as palestinians in the west bank or hezbollah in lebanon could respond to further arab civilian casualties g14g152g151g144g556g22g142g155g150g561g5g145g138g149g149g142g151g144g142g156g561 while israel may seek to take advantage of the time that it might take for weakened hamas to reconstitute its strength the underlying political fundamentals may not change favorably in the aftermath of the current violence gazas 15 million residents remain dependent on assistance and imports for their survival and israeli concessions to weakened hamas regarding the opening of border crossings might be interpreted as symbols of hamas effectiveness in outlasting attacks to achieve palestinian ends the prospects for reconciliation between hamas and fatah which many believe to be integral to effective peace negotiations may be undermined by the selective targeting of hamas and the passive acceptance of the israeli offensive by fatah the pa and the plo which is apparent despite their token opposition 12 12 washington post

unraveling of the tahdiya or temporary ceasefire between israel and hamas that led to the december 2008 outbreak of violence in and around the gaza strip was not only result of short term tactical considerations by israel and hamas see overview outbreak of conflict above but reflective of the deeplyrooted dilemma posed by hamass steady rise in influence over israelipalestinian relations during the last 20 years and more recently in gaza proper because of its militant antiisrael ideology and its acts of terrorism hamas has been politically and financially isolated by israel the united states and other international actorsmaking any engagement with the organization even through third parties extremely difficult israel has repeatedly asserted that hamas will remain in isolation until it renounces violence and more importantly recognizes israels right to exist as nationstate

base of support and particularly strong influence in the gaza strip even though its current political headquarters is in damascus syria hamass politicization and militarization can be traced to the intifada uprising or shaking off that began in the gaza strip in 1987 in resistance to the israeli occupation hamas refuses to recognize the right of israel to exist refuses to renounce the use of violence and refuses to consider itself bound by previous agreements reached by the plo with israel for these reasons the united states designated it as foreign terrorist organization in 1997 and us aid to palestinians has been tailored to bypass hamas and hamascontrolled entities hamass victory in january 2006 palestinian legislative elections set in motion chain of events that has led to the current crisis the refusal of the united states the european union and much of the rest of the world to have direct dealings with or to give financial assistance to hamasdominated pa cabinet led to tense standoff that was only temporarily averted by february 2007 hamasfatah unity agreement brokered by saudi arabia these tensions contributed to the factional fighting between hamas and fatah that led to hamass forcible takeover of the gaza strip in june 2007 in response to the hamas takeover pa president abbas dissolved the hamas led cabinet and appointed caretaker technocratic pa government in the west bank leading to renewed us and international assistance for the pa in the west bank that prompted hamas to tighten its grip on gaza even further

rockets were fired into israel but most were attributed to nonhamas militant groups and progressively hamas appeared increasingly able and willing to suppress even these attacks casualties were reported only minor property damage was incurred and israel refrained from retaliation nevertheless israel cited the sporadic rocket fire as justification for keeping the border crossings and gazas seaport closed to nearly everything but basic humanitarian supplies hamas other arab leaders and international organizations involved in aiding gazan civilians complained that israel was reneging on its promises under the agreement some in israel believed that the pressure applied through blockade on gaza could squeeze hamas from power by turning gazans against the islamist group even though other observers asserted the exact oppositethat confining economically desperate people in gaza would likely increase their dependence on hamas the nearly complete shutdown of the highly exportdependent gazan economy 14 left israel and its supporters open to charges that they were knowingly worsening the alreadyprecarious situation of gazas populationone of the most densely concentrated gazas 15 million people live within the territorys 146 square miles and poorest in the world the united nations estimates that at least 70 of gazans live below the poverty line many believe that all along both sides considered the temporary ceasefire to be merely an opportunity to prepare more fully for eventual conflict accounts of hamass military buildup and its use of tunnels from egypts sinai peninsul for smuggling weapons and reports describing how israel devised plans for the gaza offensive support this argument some commentators have said that giving up on the ceasefire was in both sides interestsasserting that hamas wanted to reclaim the mantle of heroic resister in order to reverse recent erosions in its popularity among palestinians since its takeover of gaza while israeli leaders wanted to prove their ability to defend israeli citizens on the eve of national elections 15

to the conflict have consistently condemned the israeli air campaign and ground invasion as disproportionate and tantamount to massacre of palestinians in gaza governments as well as other regional leaders have issued statements criticizing the attack for example grand ayatollah ali sistani the prominent iraqi shia cleric condemned the attacks as barbaric iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and syrian president bashar asad called the israeli campaign outrageous aggression 17 there were more moderate reactions in joint press conference the egyptian and turkish foreign ministers urged both parties to stop attacks and called for palestinian reconciliation they also focused attention on humanitarian needs in ga za contrary to the view s of its own citizenry and some of its parliament members the jordanian government also has taken more tempered position though king abdullah ii has condemned the attacks and called on israel to halt all military actions in gaza in addition to condemning israel some regional voices are criticizing certain arab governments these criticisms reflect existing intraarab and sunnishia faultlines as protests have broken out across the region and as arab media outlets have run footage from gaza hezbollah syria and iran have charged moderate arab governments of complicity in the attacks because of their inaction in particular the egyptian government faces increasing criticism for its refusal to open the rafah border crossing which links egypt with gaza for humanitarian aid see mounting pressure on egypt for more detailed discussion of

amenability of postconflict situation to reprise of the peace process the most important may be how long the conflict lasts and how it ends its intensity the degree to which the respective parties are

of the gaza strip as mentioned briefly earlier in this report see the middle east subsection under regional and international response above palestinians the wider arab world and egyptian citizens themselves all have accused the mubarak government of colluding with israel to the detriment of palestinian civilians on december 28 hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah said we are facing partnership with israel and the usa by some arab states and complicity by some other arab states concerning the events in our region go out to the streetsopen this egyptgaza crossing at rafah with your bare chests i am for the generals and the officers to go to the political leadership saying the honor of our m ilitary uniform does not allow us to see our kinsfolk in gaza being slain while we guard the borders with israel 30 the egyptian government has responded by asserting that hamas itself is to blame for the failed ceasefire as one progovernment editorial suggested that if you cant kill the wolf dont pull its tail31 although egypt has officially called on israel to stop not to widen its military operations president hosni mubarak stated that the rafah border will remain closed until palestinian authority forces loyal to pa president mahmoud abbas not hamas can be deployed along the egyptgaza border egypts stateowned media have responded vigorously to the charges of collusion with israel simultaneously condemning israel for its attacks and chastising hamas for irrationality and for the death of an egyptian border guard in armed clashes with palestinians32 since israels withdrawal from gaza in 2005 egypt has been placed in difficult position visà vis hamas on the one hand it has attempted to serve as an intermediary between hamas and israel and to broker hamasfatah unity negotiations on the other hand the mubarak government unlike many of its own citizens does not sympathize with hamas and wants to keep it isolated but because of domestic political considerations is sensitive to accusations that egyptian policy is tantamount to the collective punishment of gazan civilians in addition the secular mubarak regime is opposed to islamists wielding real political power and it fears that hamas could serve as model for egyptian muslim brotherhood activists who may yearn for an iranianstyle revolution in egypt 29 this subsection was written by

political chief khaled meshaal and endorsed by lebanese hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah it could have wide ranging consequences for israelis and palestinians and for prospects of arabisraeli peace with possible ripple effects throughout the middle east on the other hand it is possible that west bank palestinians may calculate that they have more to gain from remaining on the sidelines

some sense inextricable relationship between hamas and the general population of gaza hamas uses several social and charitable organizations for support and civilian cover and the difficulties of precision warfare within gazas denselypopulated urban geography narrowing the focus of israeli strikes to avoid popular palestinian condemnation may not have been possible in any event israeli air strikes have killed dozens of civilians including young children in such places as the jabalya refugee camp and bus stop just outside united nations training center for youth 33 and have caused extensive damage to mosques and to the islamic university in gaza city which israeli officials claim have been used to advance hamas military goals widespread outrage over gazan civilian casualties and damage to cultural institutions which may exacerbate palestinians existing resentment of the perceived injustice and futility of their situation could provoke angry and possibly violent responsesranging from political demonstrations and civil disobedience to suicide and rocket attacksfrom palestinians even those not directly targeted or affiliated with militant groups drawnout invasion and occupation which could be the end result of the ground attack might lead to still greater palestinian willingness to retaliate stepup in israeli security measures over recent yearsincluding the construction of separation barrier still ongoing that roughly tracks the 1949 green line separating israel from the west bank even though it cuts deeply into the west bank at various pointsclaiming 810 of west bank territorymight make it harder for palestinians to carry out sophisticated largescale attacks within israel yet israeli arabs and palestinian jerusalemites have shown that impromptu knife attacks and vehicular hitandruns can also create fear and anxiety among israelis new wave of popular palestinian resistance could have the opposite effect from the one israel ostensibly intended when it launched the gaza offensivepossibly strengthening rather than weakening hamas and other islamist militant groups such as palestinian islamic jihad pij another usdesignated foreign terrorist organization relative to fatah not only in gaza but also in the west bank the dismantlement of fatahaffiliated militias such as the aqsa martyrs brigades in the west bank over the past year and half in association with various pa amnesty and reform programs could lead to surge in hamas and pij which have apparently resisted dismantlement by lowering their profiles membership in the west bank as angry 33 however georgetown professor of inte rnational affairs robert j lieber asserts that the casualty ratio apparently more than 80 hamas security personnel killed for every 20 civilians killed might compare favorably with the use of force by us and nato troops in afghanistan lieber op cit

israel are less likely to find realistic secular alternatives if the clamor for resistance against israel grows pressure could build on abbas and other fatah pa and plo leaders to support it or be branded as collaborators with israel after all they have invested in peaceful engagement with israel and the international community though it seems unlikely that abbas and his associates would back new intifada doing so would risk destroying their opportunity to pursue peace process once the fighting ends this nowin situation for abbas gives hamas an opportunity to broaden its appe by insisting to palestinians that both the gaza offensive and the failure to reach peace with israel within the timeline set at annapolis show that the pa strategy of peaceful engagement plays into the hands of an israel that seeks to weaken the palestinians by sowing division through the false hope of future state34

the west bank respond to an onset of popular resistance could there be repeat of what happened during the second intifada when many palestinian security force personnel turned their guns on israel and

sponsorsprovide decisive check against having the resentment fueled by the current violence escalate in the west bank despite charges from their fellow palestinians that they are israeli collaborators the pa forces are being put to the test right now as they are being tasked with making sure that west bank demonstrations in response to the violence in and around gaza do not spiral out of control lt gen keith dayton the us security coordinator for the west bank says that the transformation and professionalization of the pa security forcesmarked by months of rigorous training for special gendarmeriestyle battalions and their leadershave made them far less likely to slip into factional conflict than their predecessors 35 there is nearly universal consensusin israeli palestinian and international circlesthat the level of competence and professionalism of these newlytrained pa forces far outpaces that of their predecessors particularly those from the bygone era of yasser arafat yet some observers question whether the improvements are sufficiently decisive it is possible that undisciplined elements in the security forces could contribute to one or more incidents that fan the flames of conflict thus far however the discipline of the pa security forces in the west bank has held senior western official in the region has told crs that the forces have performed exceptionally

to factional loyalty among the pa forces than before some argue that the forces future actions are likely to depend at least partly on how they are used although they might currently be motivated to

the united states is the largest singlestate donor to the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east unrwa which provides food shelter medical care and education for many of the original refugees from the 19471949 arabisraeli war and their familiesnow comprising approximately one million palestinians in the gaza strip and three million other palestinians in the west bank jordan syria and lebanon in response to the fighting in gaza the state department announ ced on december 30 that it was contributing 85 million in emergency assistance to unrwa60 million to the general fund 25 million to special emergency appeal fund for the west bank and gazaon top of the approximately 185 million the united states had already contributed to unrwa in 2008 depending on the damage incurred from the fighting in gaza congress could face additional requests for fy2009 appropriations to the state department accounts from which unrwa contributions are made to accommodate the humanitarian needs of the refugeeheavy gaza population proposal for continued or increased aid to unrwa could meet with increased scrutiny if there is perception that resources from unrwa or other international organizations were used with or without organizational complicity to strengthen hamas or to repel israeli military operations in gaza 45 independent from its unrwa contributions the united states has provided substantial economic and development assistance to the west bank and gaza approximately 2395 million in fy2008 and it could be asked to increase such assistance as supplement or substitute to its unrwa contributions and to aid postconflict rec onstruction and development in gaza andor to the west bank if fighting erupts there currently economic assistance to the west bank and gaza is subject to prohibitions on aid to hamas or hamasaffiliated organizations 44 for more information on all us assistance figures listed in this subsection

boasts of little private sector activity or foreign investment cu rrent law forbids the pa to use us budgetary transfers for the payment of pa salaries in gaza if the pa regains control over gaza in the aftermath of the current conflict however there might be calls for congress to lift this restriction and perhaps increase direct budgetary aid to the pa to accommodate the increased expenses the pa may incur as it reestablishes itself in gaza conversely if the pas control slips in the west bank or it is seen as participating in or endorsing violence from the west bank against israel as result of popular discontent from the current fighting in and around gaza there could be calls for congress to cut or cease aid to the pa and further limit economic assistance to the west bank and gaza

the outcome of the fighting in and around gaza could be crucial in determining the future of current us and internationallysponsored programs to help recruit train equip house manage and reform pa security forces congress might ask whether the assumptions that justified security assistance to the pa in the west bank before the conflict remain operative in its aftermath how the pa security forces perform throughout the conflict whether they handle their crowd control and public order duties competently and professionally and refrain from aggravating factional conflict and from attacking israelis could be particularly relevant as could the words and actions of abbas and other pa leaders another important factor could be whether the israelis remain open to the concept of gradually increasing the pa forces freedoms of movement and of action that appear to be pivotal to the forces continued development and assumption of responsibility over palestinianadministered areas if the conflict leads to renewed israeli distrust of the pa forces expectations for what is achievable with the forces could diminish from the earlier levels that led to 1613 million in us appropriations since mid2007 on the other hand if the pa forces acquit themselves well during the gaza conflict andor find themselves entrusted with establishing andor improving security in gaza as well as in the west bank support from israel and the obama administration for significantly expanded appropriations for the us security assistance program could be forthcoming

fertile breeding ground for hamas and its militant antiisrael ideology israel felt compelled to launch operation cast lead to squelch or minimize the threat from hamas although the ground attack might endanger its rule in gaza hamas may welcome it in hopes of miring israeli forces in closequarters combat to strip away israeli advantages in technology and firepower and in hopes of heightening perceptions that palestinians are being victimized israel would like to avoid draw nout invasion and occupation of gaza but at the same time does not want to abandon the military operation without achieving its objectives for fear of having to go back into gaza at later dateperhaps under less favorable circumstances israel is also loath to accept ceasefire or truce that gives hamas the victory of having border crossings opened even though some believe that if the crossings do not open thereby facilitating commercial opportunities for gazans the devastation in gaza is only likely to increase its peoples dependence on hamas and decrease the chances that longterm end to hostilities could be achieved 47 questions have arisen and still linger can israel reduce or eliminate hamass capability andor motivation to conduct attacks and to smuggle weapons and contraband is israel likely to stop at this objective or might it seek hamass ouster in gaza if israel ousts hamas who will take overisrael the pa some internationallymandate d authority assuming israel does not wipe out hamas how do the two reach accommodation with the other while each saving face how can gazas economy be restored without enabling hamas the most problematic issue is how various actors particularly israel the quartet the pa and other arabmuslim states might deal with hamas without conferring statelike legitimacy upon it and thus undermining the pa and abbas thus far leaders in the united states and europe have favored isolating hamas instead of engaging it which has led israel to seek thirdparty arabmuslim state brokers to help it reach indirect coexistence arrangements with hamas hamass relationship with egypt has deteriorated considerably in connection with the gaza conflict and the november 2008 collapse of hamasfatah unity talks other westernallied arab states such as saudi arabia and jordan appear wary of getting too involved for fear of being doublecrossed and of losing credibility with the arab street the emergence of turkey and qatar as regional interlocutors and the desire of france and other europeans to become more active present some options going forward the
