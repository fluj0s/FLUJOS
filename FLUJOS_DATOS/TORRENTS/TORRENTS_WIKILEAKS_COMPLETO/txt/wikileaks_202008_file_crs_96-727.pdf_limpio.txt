eferencetwo_column_table resumeshtm comparable compilations of statistics for the first through the 79th congresses before legislative activity began to be quantified in the daily digest section of the congressional record are extremely difficult to come by some researchers have pulledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96727crs2 together figures on measures introduced for few scattered selected years but they do not all use the same definition of measur so the resulting figures cannot be compared accurately compilations exist of earlier statistics on th numbers of laws enacted covering both the pre and post80th congresses however the same problems of differing inclusions and exclusions in the figures used apply to these as well consequently there will be some differences between figures in those compilations and in the table given here in the following table two things sta nd out steady decline since the mid1970s in the number of bills and joint resolutions intr oduced and drastic decline in recent years in the number of private laws enacted an important reason for the former is changes in the rules of the house of representatives on bill sponsorship the number of cosponsors allowed on an individual bill was once severely restricted often causing many different members to introduce identical versions of popular proposals beginning in 1967 up to 25 cosponsors were allowed on bill and in 1979 the house rules were amended to permit unlimited numbers of cosponsors the decline in the number of private bills and laws cannot be traced to specific rule change private bills deal with one or more named individuals or entities in the 20th century most private bills concerned immigration cases or private claims over the yearscongress has delegated more of its authority on individual immigration matters and private claims to the executive branch so the number of private bills and laws has declined dramatically table 1 selected legislative statistics congressbills joint resolutions
