are being driven by the vision for space exploration an nounced by president bush in january 2004 and endorsed by congress in the nasa authorization act of 2005 p l 109155 the vision includes returning the space shu ttle to flight status then retiring it by 2010 completing the space station but discontinui ng its use by the united states by 2017 returning humans to the moon by 2020 and then sending humans to mars and worlds beyond the president did not pr opose significantly increased funding for nasa to accomplish the vision instead most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other nasa activitie s dr griffin has described this approach as go as you can afford to pay the funding requirements of the vision thus constrain other nasa priorities in the science

was silent on how reductions should be allocated among constellation sy stems and the other programs meanwhile also in sae reduced gr owth in science funding would have added up to proposed reduction of 31 billion through fy2010 relative to projections in the previous years request most of that reduction would have been to offset higher than expected costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status following the february 2003 columbia accident the request for science included full funding for hubble space telescope rvicing mission but funding for several robotic missions to mars we re cancelled or deferred funding was requested for the sofia airborne infrared telescope or the europa mission to one of jupiters moons the request for research and an alysis which provides grant funding to individual researchers was down 15 fro m fy2006 in most programs the house provided 75 million more than the reque st for science including 50 llion for research and analysis the senate committee recommended increases totaling 315 million for two science programs and di rected nasa to proceed with sofia from within available funds the final appropriation how ever was 5251 billion less than the request by 79 million the request for aeronautics research in sae was about the same as was projected the previous year but its content had changed significantly the largest program vehicle systems has been renamed fundamental aeronautics and now focuses on core competencies in subs onic supersonic and hypersonic flight regimes including work on rotorcraft in the fy2006 budget cycle proposals to
