government twice determined chinese violations of the missile technology control regime guidelines and determined both cases to have involved transfers of category ii missile components for the m11 shortrange ballistic missile to pakistan although the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt does not ban peaceful nuclear projects certain chinese nuclear transfers to pakistan and iran may have violated the npt andor us laws in 1995 china reportedly sold to pakistan unsafeguarded ring magnets that could be used for uranium enrichment the clinton administration decided that us sanctions were

uppliers group australia group or the wassenaar arrangement the pressures to join nonproliferation efforts that china faced in the early 1990s have weakene d while its commitment to nonproliferation is unclear chinese missilerelated transfers have not violated any international treaties since the mtcr is not treaty but have vi olated chinese pledges and us laws in 1991 and 1993 the us government twice determined chinese violations of the mtcr guidelines and determined both cases to have involved tr ansfers of category ii missile components for the m11 short range ballistic missile to pakistan the administration has not determined violations for chinese missilerelated sales to syria or iran since the 1987 sale of c ss2 intermediate rang ballistic missiles to saudi arabia the executive branch has not determined that china supplied complete missiles to another country nevertheless concerns re main about chinese missile technology transfers although the npt does not ban peaceful nuclear projects certain chinese nuclear transfers to pakistan and iran may have violated the npt andor us laws in 1995 china reportedly sold unsafeguarded ring magnets to pakistan the clinton administration decided that us sanctions were not warranted chemical weaponrelated transfers would not violate any treaty since the cwc has not entered into force however they may defy us laws which may require sanctions transfers of biological agen ts for weapon programs would violate the biological weapons convention and us laws chinas acquisition of russian or ot her advanced technology or

proliferation threat president clinton has stated that t he proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security foreign policy and economy of the united states1 cia director john deutch testified in february 1996 that free nations of the world are threatened by rogue states iran iraq north korea and libya that have built up significant military forces and seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological2 main concern is the risk of us or allied troops facing wmd on the battlefield the 1991 persian gulf war ag ainst iraq strongly demonstrated the danger posed by secret wmd programs only after the war did the world learn of iraqs wmd efforts despite safeguards and treaties many concluded it is essential to strengthen and expa nd nonproliferation regimes as one of five declared nuclearw eapon powers and supplier of sensitive equipment and technology china has played critical role in supporting nonproliferation efforts as well as the pr oliferation of wmd and the missiles that could deliver them china especially since 1992 has responded to some extent to us and other pressures to make progress in joining some international nonproliferation efforts china has also ma intained that it has not legally violated any international agreements yet there is evidence indicating that certain chinese technology transfers have violated chinas commitment undermined the nonproliferation regimes ndor defied us laws heightened concerns throughout the 1980s chinese missile and nuclear technology exports including css2 intermediaterange missiles to saudi arabia silkworm antiship missiles to iran and nuclear technology to pakistan c onflicted with us foreign policy goals chinese assurances regarding exports were vague and unsatisfactory but washington moderated its criticism of beijing in part due to chinas strategic importance in counter balancing moscow several events however dramatically changed us perceptions the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown froze uschina relations and raised human rights as central issue the end of the cold war in 1991 reduced chinas strategic importance and provided openings for argu ments favoring tougher us policy toward china on proliferation human rights and trade after the 1991 persian gulf war revelations about iraqs advanced missile chemical and nuclear weapons programs heightened worldwide concerns about the spread of wmd technology andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96767crs3 dualuse supplies disclosures in the ear ly 1990s about chinese missile and nuclear technology transfers to countries such as algeria pakistan and iran also added impetus to international criticism of china in 1992 after the us imposed some sa nctions and threatened others china signed the nuclear nonproliferation treat and agreed to abide by the missile technology control regime in 1994 be ijing reaffirmed the latter commitment in joint statement with washington and in 1996 issued another statement about selling only safeguarded nuclear technology nevertheless it is uncertain whether china is in full compliance with all of its commitments dangers of chinese transfers chinas transfers of technology are dangerous on several counts technology transfers advance the indigenous capabilities of recipients to manufacture their own missiles or wmd and potentially make sensitive sales to others china has pursued such sales in part because technology tr ansfers or allowing scientists to work with customers do not necessar ily violate international treaties china does not appear to recognize missiles as destabilizing and has been willing to supply missile t echnology if not entire missiles it is troubling that china has been willing to supply dualuse nuclear and chemical components with ci vilian and military applications to countries suspected of pursuing wmd programs iraq demonstrated that lot of comme rcially available technology can be applied to wmd programs and clandestine nuclear weapon programs can proceed despite iaea safeguards secrecy has shrouded many of ch inas nuclear exports especially to iran and pakistan and its exports of missiles or related technology beijing is believed to be modernizing its wmd and has increasingly bought weapon systems from moscow there are concerns of possible retransfers of more advanced technology three aspects of the issue the issue of chinese proliferation invol ves three aspects chinas support for nonproliferation efforts chinas transfers that promote

perceived security need for nucl ear weapons is mitigated by commitment by its rival nonnuclearweapon state not to acquire nuclear w eapons to ensure compliance the npt requires that nonnuc learweapon states comply with iaea safeguards7 the npt does not prohibit peaceful nuclear projects for long time china in show of unity with the third world opposed the npt as discriminating against developing

october 1994 in the white paper the chinese government formally reiterated past statements that it pursues policy of not supportin g encouraging or engaging in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and not assisting any other country in the development of such weapons the white paper on arms control and disarmament also continued to say that at the same time china holds that preventing the

it does not produce or possess chemical weapons since acced ing to the bwc in 1984 china has fully and conscientiously fulfilled its obligations under the convention significantly the white paper did

to restrain dangerous sales rationales china likely has significant rationales for its armsrelated exports several countries that were denied western sales turned to china as supplier of sensitive

at times has refuted that missiles are more destabilizing than ai rcraft in addition some analysts believe that chinese arms sales are controlled by certain influential military officials with important family connections to top leaders they do not have to answer to the foreign ministry which primarily negotiates with washington16 some have asserted that decentralization of the chinese econom in general and the defense industry in particular in the name of profits s hampered government export controls strengthening chinese exports controls will require development of the rule of law others argue however that the absen ce of toplevel appr oval for arms exports may be true only in cases of less sensitive transfers because of the potential impact on uschina relations and chinese compliance with international agreements the chinese government would exercise restra ints over the more questionable exports moreover chinas president jiang zemin is also the chairman of the central

was carrying chemicals that could be used for mustard gas and nerve gas specifically thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride one unus ual factor in this case was that it was chinese media which disclosed

plans for shipping the chemicals were aborted when the chinese realized the united states had been alerted and beijing allowed the yinhe to continue in order to embarrass washington fourth the incident was set up to discredit us intelligence on this and other proliferation questions in the second recent case german shi p the asian senator was inspected in january 1994 in saudi arabia and

1996 there is still concern that china will c ontinue to develop new nuclear weapons including more compact warheads defense department report said that china likely has nuclear weapon for relatively small cruise missile133 chemical and biological weapons there is also concern that china has maintained and modernized its chemical and biological weapons in 1993 an intellig ence finding reportedly said that it is highly probable that china has not eliminated its bw program134 in the discussion of compliance with the bwc in 1995 acda stat ed that there are strong indications that china probably maintains its offensive program135 the secretary of defense reported that china has mature chemical warfare capability and may well have maintained the biological warfare program it had prior to acceding to the biological weapons convention in 1984 it has funded chemical warfare program since the 1950s and has produced and weaponized wide variety of agents its biological warfare program included ma nufacturing infectious microorganisms and toxins136httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96767crs38 lessons learned since 1991 some lessons for us policy can be drawn from an examination of chinas proliferation activities nd approach to nonproliferation issues since 1991 there are cases where china reportedly violated both the letter and spirit of its commitments on nonprolif eration interna tional treaties and guidelines china may have violated the npt and the bwc while china has strengthened its assurances to abide by the mtcr there is reported evidence that china breached those voluntary guidelines even if they do not violate any tr eaties transfers of technology can be more dangerous than transf ers of complete weapon systems technology transfers improve the indigenous capabilities of chinas customers to manufacture missiles or wmd on their own beijing faces the challenge of both upholding obligations in international nonprol iferation regimes and selling weapon technology the government and pr emier li peng in particular has been involved in foreign nuclear cooperation contracts companies selling missile tec hnology are governmentown ed defense industrial entities among the various issues in us china relations proliferation is one which china has been willing to negotiate and move toward common international goals gi ven conducive ove rall relations in 1992 china started to join inte rnational nonprolif eration efforts likely because of several pressures first be ijing was ostracized after the june 1989 tiananmen s quare crackdown second it faced immense pressure in light of alarming disclosures after the gulf war about iraqs wmd programs third there was real trepidation that mfn status would be revoked f ourth the june 1991 sanctions had been imposed and waivers had yet been granted as nuclear weapon power with st rategic missile force china had very little to lose and much to gain from acceding to the npt promising to adhere to the mtcr or signing the cwc china has been able to continue its missile and nuclear modernization programs china understands its commitments although some have asserted that china may not have underst ood the international treaties and guidelines chinese officials have made statements confirming that they do have firm grasp of chinas obligations with such understanding china has not held the mtcr guidelines with the same level of commitment as it does international treatieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96767crs39 like the npt or cwc premier li peng personally committed china to the npt but avoided involvement on the mtcr china does not always shared we stern nonproliferation concerns china has claimed that aircraft are just as destabilizing as missiles and has not voiced the same wester n concerns about proliferation of missiles in some cases china has argued that if sales improve the balance of power then there is greater stability china has increasingly linked nonpro liferation issues to us arms sales to taiwan then presiden t bushs september 2 1992 decision to sell taiwan 150 f16ab fighte rs has complicated the sinous dialogue on nonproliferation some analysts believe the chinese even increased proliferation activities in retaliation for the f16 sale aspiring to be global leader china has retreated from positions where it was isolated on an important international issue it generally has preferred to advance an image as responsible world leader the pressures to join inte rnational nonproliferation fforts that china faced in the early 1990s have weakened while its commitment to nonprolifer ation is unclear china has made progress in breaking out of relative isolation and committing to major international agreements and guidelines china has not been reported to have supplied critical nuclear weapon knowhow since giving pakistan nuclear bomb design in the 1980s there has been determination that china transferred complete missiles which exceed mtcr guid elines since the 1987 sale of css2 irbms to saudi arabia or since china first promised to abide by the mtcr in 1992 nevertheless aside from compliance issues there are policy concerns china has not expanded its international commitments to join some significant but informal nonproliferation groups such as the nsg there are reports that china continues to sell sensitive missile nuclear chemical or biological technology and maintains banned weapon programs the prospects for greater chinese coope ration might improve if china realized the benefits of nonproliferati on for its interests and us efforts were augmented by multilateral pressures on china such pressures on china to participate fully in strengthening nonproliferati on regimes could capitalize on chinas desire to be treated as great power and perceived as responsible world leader what us policy approach should be pursued to promote greater chinese cooperation with nonproliferation regimes nd improved compliance what are us
