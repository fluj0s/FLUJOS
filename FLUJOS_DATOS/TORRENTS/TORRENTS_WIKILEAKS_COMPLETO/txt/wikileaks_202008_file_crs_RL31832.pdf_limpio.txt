authority for export controls on sensitive dualuse goods and technologies items that have both civilian and military applications including those items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weaponry the eaa which originally expired in 1989 periodically has been reauthorized for short periods of time with the last incremental extension expiring in august 2001 at other times and currently the export licensing system created under the authority of eaa has been continued by the invocation of the international emergency economic powers act ieepa eaa confers upon the president the power to control exports for national security foreign policy or short supply purposes it also authorizes the president to establish export licensing mechanisms for items detailed on the commerce control list ccl and it provides some guidance and places certain limits on that authority the ccl currently provides detailed specifications about dualuse items including equipment materials software and technology including data and knowhow likely requiring some type of export license from the commerce departments bureau of industry and security bis bis administers the export administration regulations ear which in addition to the ccl describe licensing policy and procedures such as commodity classification licensing and interagency dispute resolution procedures in debates on export administration legislation parties often fall into two camps those who primarily want to liberalize controls in order to promote exports and those who believe that further liberalization may compromise national security goals while it is widely agreed that exports of some goods and technologies can adversely affect us national security and foreign policy some believe that current export controls can be detrimental to us businesses and to the us economy according to this view the resultan t loss of competitiveness market share and jobs can harm the us economy and that harm to particular us industries and to the economy itself can negatively impact us security others believe that security concerns must be paramount in the us export control system and that export controls can be an effective method to thwart proliferators terrorist states and countries that can threaten us national security interests controversies have arisen with regard to particular exports such as high performance computers encryption technology stealth materials satellites machine tools hotsection aerospace technology and the issue of deemed exports the competing perspectives on export controls have clearly been manifested in the debate over foreign availability and the control of technology the efficacy of multilateral control regimes the licensing process

commerce these regulations establish the framework for regulating exports of dualuse potentially sensitive commodities software computers and technology exports are restricted by item country and recipient entity the eaa which was written and amended during the cold war focuses on the regulation of exports of those civilian goods and technology that have military applications dualuse items export controls under the eaa were based on strategic relationships threats to us national security international business practices and commercial technologies many of which have changed dramatically in the last 20 years some members of congress and most us business representatives see need to liberalize us export regulations to allow american companies to engage more fully in international competition for sales of high technology goods other members and some national security analysts contend that liberalization of export controls over the last decade has contributed to foreign threats to us national security that some controls should be tightened and that congress should weigh further liberalization carefully this report discusses the export administration act in terms of its evolution in the 20 th century its major features including the types of controls authorized by the act the commerce control list and export licensing procedures and issues concerning the maintenance of export controls under ieepa it then highlights several controlled commodities that have been featured prominently in export control discussions finally it discusses competing business and national security perspectives concerning several of more contentious themes in the export control debate the controllability of technology the effectiveness of multilateral control regimes the organization of the export control system and the impact of export controls on the us economy and business

war led to major refocusing of export control policy on the sovietbloc countries enactment of the export control act of 1949 pl 8111 was formal recognition of the new security threat and of the need for an extensive peacetime export control system the 1949 act identified three possible reasons for imposing export controls shortsupply controls were to be used to prevent the export of scarce goods that would have deleterious impact on us industry and national economic performance foreign policy controls were to be used by the president to promote the foreign policy of the united states the broad issues of regional stability human rights antiterrorism missile technology and chemical and biological warfare have come to be controlled under this rubric national security controls were to be used to restrict the export of goods and technology including nuclear nonproliferation items that would make significant contribution to the military capability of any country that posed threat to the national security of the united states coincident with the establishment of the postwar us export control regime was the establishment of multilateral counterpart involving our nato allies the large amount of critical technology being transferred from the united states to the nato allies and the growing capability for technological development by the allies themselves required the establishment of multilateral control regime toward this end the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls cocom was established in 1949 coco m controls were not mirror image of us controls but generally did reflect uniformly high level of restrictions with little change in the perceived threat the export control act was renewed largely without amendment in 1951 1953 1956 1958 1960 1962 and 1965 with the onset of the ussoviet era of detente in the late 1960s however the first serious reexamination and revision of the us export control system occurred at this the growing importance of trade to the us economy and those of our allies began to exert significant political pressure for some liberalization of export controls congress passed the export administration act of 1969 to replace the nearembargo characteristic of the export control act of 1949 the continued shift of policy toward less restrictive export controls continued in the renewal of the act in 1974 and 1977 the act was comprehensively rewritten in 1979 and this act forms the basis of the export control system today it was amended in 1985 and some moderate further liberalization occurred in the following years the collapse of the soviet union in 1989 an event some have partially attributed to the success of us cold war export control policy marked dramatic change in the nature of the external threat the united states beginning with the george hw bush administration the export control system has been reduced in scope and streamlined but the basic structure of the law remains intact there are many who see need to revamp the act whether to enhance exports to shift the focus to current national security threats or to increase penalties for violations the dissolution of cocom in 1994 and its replacement by the wassenaar arrangement in 1997 also significantly changed the export control environment 2 this new multilateral arrangement is continued significant goods and technology with the passage of pl 76703 an act to expedite and strengthen the national defense in each of these instances the rationale for control was the necessity of not giving aid and comfort to the nations enemies 2

authority to block transactions of other members generally more liberal control practices abroad raise important questions about the ultimate effectiveness of us export controls under either the current or revised eaa in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to american industry congress has not been able to agree on measures to reform the export administration act that regularly have been introduced since the 101st congress the export control process was continued from 19891994 by temporary statutory ex tensions of eaa and by invocation of the international emergency economic powers act ieepa thereafter export controls were continued for six years under the authority of executive order 12924 of august 19 1994 issued under ieepa authority many of those who favor reforming the act whether to liberalize or to tighten controls contend that operating under ieepa imposes constraints on the administration of the export control process and makes it vulnerable to legal challenge thus undermining its effectiveness legislation passed by the house and senate and signed by the president on november 13 2000 pl 106508 extended the eaa of 1979 until august 20 2001 temporarily removing the need to operate the export control system under ieepa powers since then export control authority has again been operating under ieepa

regime in 2004 the house version of ndaa 2005 hr 4200 contained two export controlrelated provisions that would have affected dualuse export controls the first sec 1404 would have required license for dualuse goods controlled under the export administration regulations ear for technology and items contained in the militarily critical technology list mctl list compiled by the department of defense dod see p 6 the provision is in response to march 2004 dod study which noted that several mctl technologies were not controlled under the ear or the international traffic in arms regulations itar the second provision sec 1405 would have required that exporters obtain licenses for items controlled under the ear or the itar to destination if that destination had previously exported such items to china in addition the granting of the license would be conditional on the written assurance of the foreign government or entity not to transfer the licensed item without the written consent of the president the house ndaa report hrept 108491 expresses concern that military embargoes on china imposed after the tiananamen square massacre may be repealed which may lead to the transfer of such us goods or technology to china however neither of these provisions were contained in the conference report hrept 108767 signed by the president on october 28 2004

comprehensive legislation to rewrite or reauthorized the eaa was introduced in the 110th congress legislation was introduced that sought amend the enforcement and penalty structure of the act to integrate export control information into electronic filing of export data and to target countries of diversion concern on august 3 2007 senator dodd introduced the export enforcement act of 2007 s 2000 which was referred to the senate banking committee this bill reflects the draft legislation that the administration submitted to congress on april 24 2007 the draft bill would reauthorize the export administration act for five years and amend the penalty and enforcement provisions of the act it was not considered during the 110 th congress g18g142g151g138g149g157g146g142g156g561 the proposed legislation would revise the penalty structure and increase penalties for export control violations the bill would raise criminal penalties for individuals up to 1 million and raise the term of potential imprisonment to ten years for each violation for firms it would raise penalties to the greater of 5 million or 10 times the value of the export under the 1979 eaa the base penalty was the greater of 50000 or 5 times the value of the export or five years imprisonment certain violations such as those for exports controlled for foreign policy purposes could have received higher penalties the bill would also raise civil penalties from 10000 or 100000 for national security controls violations under the old act to 500000 it would expand the list of statutory violations that could result in denial of export privileges and it extends the term of such denial from not more than 10 years to not more than 25 years g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561 the draft legislation would expand the authority of the department of commerce office of export enforcement to investigate potential violations of eaa overseas it would expand enforcement authority to other places at home and abroad with the concurrence of the department of homeland security the proposed legislation would restate the enforcement provisions of the eaa to account for the current structure of customs and border security and the immigration and customs enforcement in the department of homeland security it would also direct the secretary of commerce to publish and update best practices guidelines for effective export control compliance programs it also would expand the confidentiality provisions beyond licenses and licensing activity to include classification requests enforcement activities or information obtained or supplied concerning us multilateral commitments the bill includes new language governing the use of funds for undercover investigations and operations and would establish audit and reporting requirements for such investigations it would also authorize wiretaps in enforcement of the act the export enforcement act of 2008 title ii hr 6828 was introduced by representatives sherman and manzullo on august 1 2008 it tr acks the above legislation with regard to enforcement except that it does not expand the confidentiality provisions as did s 2000 it did not address penalties perhaps because the international emergency economic powers enhancement act pl 11096 signed by pr esident bush on october 16 2007 increased the existing penalty structure see below issues

title 1 of hr 6828 sought to integrate the various licensing requirements embargoes and data collection rules imposed on exporters and shippers when goods leave us ports into the automated export system an electronic version of the shippers export declaration sed that customs requires exporters to submit prior to the clearance of shipment for export the export control provisions of the bill

to the 110 th congress this issue first surfaced in 2006 with reports that computer circuits exported to the ited arab emirates were diverted to iran where they were fashioned into bomb detonators and used in iraq this revelation initially resulted in licensing requirement on uaebased mayrow general trading and six other entities5 however the focus quickly shifted to the uae as transhipment hub and the status of its export control regime perhaps as means to goad the uae into action on export controls the bis proposed in february 2007 the creation of country category c which would be made up of countries of diversion concern country category c designees would face stricter licensing requirements for products thought to have high degree of dive rsion concern country was designated as belonging to category c and the rulemaking was never completed two pieces of legislation introduced in the 110 th congress sought to address the issue of transhipment and diversion title iii of the comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act of 2008 s 3445 doddhr 7112 be rman attempted to legislate the category c concept with regards to diversion to iran it required the administration to initiate government togovernment contact with countries of possible di version concern to assist in strengthening that countrys export control system if cooperation was not forthcoming from that country the administration would be required to designate that country as destination of diversion concern and exports to that country would be subject to additional licensing requirements more stringent license review and increased use of enduser checks s 3445 was reported out of the banking housing and urban affairs committee on august 12008 srept 110443 but received floor consideration its house counterpart hr 7112 introduced and passed under suspension of the rules on september 26 2008 title ii of hr 6828 sherman manzullo the export enforcement act of 2008 also sought to legislate the creation of country of diversion concern category this legislation did not limit itself to countries suspected of diversion to iran but to countries entities or uses of concern for proliferation or terrorism the legislation specifies criteria under which country could be designated as country of diversion concern but also sets forth specific reporting and certification requirements for malaysia and the united arab emirates to avoid being cited as country of diversion concern 5 general order concerning mayrow general trading and related entities 71 federal register

availability exists when good is available to controlled countries from sources outside the united states in sufficient quantity and comparable quality so that control of the item would be ineffectivesec 5f1a the 1979 act charges the secretary in conjunction with the secretary of defense and other appropriate agencies with determining on continuing basis whether any item currently subject to export control for reasons of national security meets foreign availability status under eaa request to make foreign availability determination can be made by license applicant or through the initiative of the secretary if the secretary makes foreign availability determination the item must be decontrolled although the president can overturn that decision with determination that decontrolling such items would be detrimental to the national security of the united states in such case the president is directed to enter negotiations with multilateral control partners to eliminate the availability in question the 1979 eaa provided for the decontrol of items on the ccl determined to have foreign availability and it set guidance for the secretary to make such determinations it gave the secretary the ability to initiate such determinati ons and it provided that license applicants could petition the secretary to begin the determination the secretarys determination of foreign availability does not need the concurrence of other agencies but he must submit determinations to other agencies as the secretary considers appropriate the bill also created the office of foreign availability to gather data for the secret ary to make foreign availability determinations and to report to congress on operations and improvements on the ability to assess foreign availability this office longer exists according to one commentator this is doubt largely because substantial activity in the 1980s and early 1990s produced only meager results 9

under legislation introduced in the 106 th and 107th congress the items manner of distribution its conduciveness to commercial shipping or its usefulness for intended purposes without modification or service were also criteria considered when determining mass market status this feature proved to have been controversial part of the legislation and was cited as stumbling block in negotiations over the bill in the 107th congress with some members arguing that its existence would provide for wholesale decontrol of sensitive items

these procedures confer on the secretary of commerce the secretary the power to review and to determine the dispositi on of export licenses the departments of state defense and energy have authority to review any licenses submitted and the secretary may refer licenses to others as he deems appropriate these agencies may waive their right to review license applications for certain commodities or to certain destinations within nine days of license applications registration the secretary must seek additional information refer the application to other agencies assure the security classification is correct return the application if license is not required grant the application or notify the applicant of denial in case of review by another agency the reviewing agency must request any additional information from the secretary within 10 days after reviewing the file the reviewing agency may request additional information which the secretary shall promptly request from the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application or of requested review information the agency must recommend approval or denial of the application nd provide regulatory or statutory justification for

operations per second mtops the actual mtops performed by an hpc over period of time can vary based on which operations are performed some can take longer than others or can be performed while other operations are taking place and the real cycle speed of the computer however the wassenaar arrangement approved new standard for calculating computing power in december 2005 which was incorporated into bis final rulemaking on april 24 2006 27 the new standard called adjusted peak performance app is the adjusted peak rate at which digital computers perform 64bit or larger floating point

for com puter software and technology is set at 004 wt and for computer development and production technology at 01 wt since the advent of hpc technology there have been restrictions on us exports however some advocates have maintained that because the com puting capabilities of hpcs have advanced so rapidly and due to the foreign availability of models comparable to some of those produced in the united states export restrictions of hpcs are neither practical or enforceable during the clinton administration hpc export thresholdsor the am ount of mtops capability that an hpc would need to

assessment of the deemed export regulatory regime the commission recommended the establishment of trusted entity program for academia and industrial entities to qualify for streamlined deemed export application process the commission proposed an evaluation of an applicants probable loyalties that would include consideration of an applicants country of birth prior country of residence current citizenship and an examination of persons prior and present activities to determine eligibility for deemed export license the commission also recommended streamlining certain terminology in the deemed export regulations and the establishment of an outside panel of experts to conduct an annual sunset review of technologies on the commerce control list 46 the deac recommendations were highly criticized by industry representatives and the research community with one group summing up the proposa ls as unadministrable for the government and difficulttoimpossible to comply with for industry47

principal theme in debates on export administration legislation is the tension between commercial and national security concerns these concerns are not mutually exclusive and thus it is often difficult to characterize opposing camps for example nearly everyone favors reform of the current system yet one considers themselves opposed to national security generally however many who favor reform of the current export control accept the business perspective that such reform would assist us business to co mpete in the global marketplace others view the issue more from national security perspective to this group reform should be concerned less with the abilities of us industry to export and more with effective controls placed on potential 45 david mccormick foreign talent need not

the foreign availability and mass market provisions of eaa reauthorization legislation and the underlying concept of the controllability of technology have proved controversial in the eaa debate industry groups that have taken an active position on legislation to replace the 1979 eaa have considered the adoption of these provisions as key benefit of potential eaa legislation the foreign availability and mass market concepts are integral to their contention that the flow of technology cannot be effectively controlled and that us dominance of cuttingedge technology can longer be assumed according to their arguments unilateral controls will not stop other countries from obtaining advanced technology advocates of this viewpoint claim that countries of concern will simply obtain this technology from other nations adherents to this view regard current multilateral controls on dualuse articles as ineffectual from this perspective only american business suffers from the unilateral nature of us export controls in the process foreign business wins new markets or gains an incentive to enter new markets 49 according to the industry position unilateral export controls are also becoming increasingly unworkable as the economy undergoes globalization the current export control system is predicated on goods being manufactured or assembled in one country in many industries however component parts are manufactured worldwide and are considered commodities if these parts are not available from one source on timely basis they can be obtained elsewhere 50 purchasing managers at daimler chrysler aerospace for example reportedly have been instructed to reduce dependence on american components for defense and space technology products because of delays associated with american licensing procedures51 other participants in the export control debate are concerned about the mass market and foreign availability arguments advanced by industry proponents critics charge that the mass market standard would effectively nullify the whole us control regime by decontrolling any item that met the criteria under the law they assert that virtually any product including dualuse items used for proliferation purposes could qualify for mass market status similarly as one non proliferation advocate testified regarding eaa legislation in the 106th congress the foreign availability criterion would allow the sale of anything controlled country can purchase from rogue buyer52 related argument made by industry is that national security is enhanced by robust export industries this argument is predicated on the changing nature of defense procurement research and development during the cold war the formative period of the current export control regime 49 for

quality of the technology available for national security purposes thus industry argues it needs streamlined export process one that will not needlessly impede exports critics of industrys national security position reject this argument they maintain that the united states does not promote its national security by selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states this technology if sold to regime of dubious stability could be used against the united states or allies in the future proponents of this argument point to the case of iraq which received us weaponry in the 1980s when saddam

as an illustration both of the uncontrollable nature of technology and the inability of the export control system to account for such innovation according to one national security analyst attempting to control computing power is not feasible or effective he maintains that the restraint of computer trade is selfdefeating because it cedes markets and profits that could be used for rd 53 increasing computing speeds combined with netw orking advances have blurred the distinction between supercomputers and commodity computers microprocessors that individually comply with export regulations can be linked together to create servers with mtops capabilities that breach export thresholds if enough processors are linked together they can create parallel processing system with capabilities that approach those of supercomputer the defense science board noted that the ability to cluster commodity computers in order to multiply computing power erodes the ability to restrict ac cess to highperformance computing even if highperformance standalone machines can be controlled54 other observers believe the united states can restrict access to the highest computer technology by limiting exports they maintain that americanmade computers are perceived as superior and thus carry greater cachet than products from other nations they note that the purchase of an americanmade computer product also buys superior networking and service often at better 53 richard perle former assistant secretary of defense for security policy in the reagan administration speaking at the forum for

has formulated common control list and member nations control the exports of those goods under their own national laws policy know as national discretion unlike cocom however these organizations do not perform review function prior to the grant of national export license the regimes members do pledge disclosure of export licensing decisions and pledge consultation on sensitive export licenses

state however these groups operate by consensus and are hampered by limited institutional structures some observers contend that the wassenaar arrangement in particular is ineffective because it relies on consensus of member states the necessity for consensus critics charge results in level of control acceptable to all its minimal reporting requirements mandate notification only that an item has been sold thus preventing effective preexport consultation among member states industry representatives stress the necessity of effective multilateral controls they argue that export controls are effective only if they are adhered to by all states capable of exporting given technology for example the machine tool industry has been at the forefront in criticizing the unilateral nature of our export policies especially concerning exports to china it notes that there is consensus among wassenaar arrangement countries on the proper limits of technology transfer to china indeed country is explicitly targeted by wassenaar stringent domestic controls combined with minimal multilateral co nstraints only damage american companies according to industry spokesmen they fault the us for having an overly rigorous licensing policy towards china without noticeably pursuing strategy to convince our allies to follow our lead 60 proponents of tighter export restrictions note that america traditionally has taken the lead in export controls and nonproliferation efforts these efforts included the original eaa adopted in 1949 and the establishment of cocom they argue that efforts to strengthen cocoms successor regime the wassenaar arrangement cannot succeed if washington itself is loosening export restrictions thus the united states must take the lead in order to convince other nations to follow the us example adherents of this vi ewpoint argue that the successful negotiating strategy in these multilateral fora is to adopt controls first and then persuade other countries to follow suit hence in their view an export contro l strategy pegged solely on the policies of other nations negotiated by consensus is ineffectual and harmful to national security61 both industry spokesmen and advocates of heightened export controls agree that the multilateral controls need to be strengthened yet to do this requires consensus on which goods and which countries represent threat there does seem to be agreement among western nations to restrict dualuse items to limited number of countries of concern 62 yet consensus breaks down with regard to other states notably china the export control dilemma in this context becomes clear without consensus on particular target country the question becomes whether the united states should impose controls unilaterally one then needs to determine either which nonproliferation or other foreign policy goals are sufficiently important to offset possibly damaging american business and possibly costing american jobs or how large an economic benefit would justify risking important national security goals g5g145g146g151g138g561 debate over export controls has often focused on china the dilemma that encapsulates us export control

security interests of exporting sensitive dualuse technologies to china some representatives of the business community have argued that us export control policy toward chin is too stringent they claim such controls have hampered technology transfers to china in the past few years while the controls of us allies have not they reported that chinese companies will not ask us companies to bid on sales because of the delays associated with the us licensing process as one industry spokesman has testified the result has been that the chinese are denied nothing in terms of high technology but us firms have lost out in crucial market this serves neither our commercial nor our strategic interests 63 however other analysts and several members of congress have expressed grave concerns about chinas dualuse technology acquisitions they cite findings of the cox commission that china evaded existing export controls to illegally obtain missile design and satellite technology and that china has circumvented enduser controls on highperformance computers 64 according to this view the commissions findings show the need for both tightened controls and greater enforcement of export controls against china in addition china has been implicated in several nuclear missile and chemical proliferation activities65 g22g145g142g561g515g5g145g146g151g138g561g20g158g149g142g516g561 on june 19 2007 bis published the final rule entitled revisions and clarification of export and reexport controls for the peoples republic of china 72 fed reg 33646 the final rule is composed of three parts new licensing requirement for certain products for military enduse in china validated enduser veu program and requirement to obtain an enduser statement for certain licensed products the proposed rule has been driven by the concern that the export of commercial technology to certain endusers is undermining the arms embargo that the united states and others maintain against china others including industry have questioned the scope and efficacy of these new controls the new licensing policy has two distinct components the establishment of new military enduse controls for the prc and revised license review policy for national security controlled items destined for the prc the aspect that has received the most attention is the establishment of new military enduse controls on 20 product categories consisting of 31 export control classification numbers eccn currently these items are controlled primarily for antiterrorism reasons thus license is required only for exports to countries determined to be state sponsors of terrorism cuba iran north korea sudan syria under the new rule bis will require license for the export reexport or in country transfer of these items if the exporter knows has reason to know or is informed by bis that the item is or may be intended for military enduses in the prc the final rule also revises the longstanding licensing policy for national security controlled items destined for the prc contained in the ear part 7424b7 it clarifies that there is presumption of denial for license applications to export reexport or transfer items that would make direct and significant contribution to the prcs military capabilities in certain key weapons systems 63 freedenberg p 7 64 for more information on technology transfers to china see crs report 98485

exemption threshold for obtaining enduse statements eus from the ministry of foreign commerce mofcom of the prc the prc requires that mofcom issue an eus before bis can conduct prelicense check or postshipment verification for an export us exporter must request that the importer obtain the eus for license application because the bis inspection is often statutory or regulatory pre requisite for approving some applications the rule increases the amount of the value of the license exempted from the eus requirement fro m 5000 to 50000 for most goods to the prc however it expands the eus requirement to cover all license applications to the prc reaching this threshold previously eus were required only for items under national security controls the final rule also establishes the validated enduser veu program the veu establishes method by which trusted prc civilian endusers can be nominated for the program and if approved by bis the eligible endusers may receive items eligible under the program without license the rule sets up an applications process by which an enduser can be nominated for the program in approving candidate for veu status the erc will evaluate the entitys

program items controlled for crime control or missile technology by the ear do not qualify for export under this program due to statutory reasons in addition not all items that are eligible for export under this program can be exported to all validated endusers the approved veu application will be accompanied by list of items that can be exported to the enduser and this list can be expanded or contracted by the erc once approved the veu can import approved items from any exporter not just the nominee according to bis the proposal would stream line licensing for certain companies for whom exporters routinely request and receive licenses for the same product over time thus resources that currently process these routine applications could be diverted to staff more problematic license applications on october 2 2007 bis announced the expansion of the veu program to eligible companies in india 67 however eligible indian companies were named in 2008 on october 19 2007 bis announced

military the wisconsin project also contend that some of these entities affiliat have run afoul of us proliferation sanctions and export control laws69 bis undersecretary mario mancuso responded to the report by maintaining that the companies had demonstrable history of using us technology in the pastwe know lot about these companies and k now lot about how they use the technologies they are authorized to receive through veu these technologies were previously available to these companies by license and the veu judgment was based on data not conjecture 70 controversy regarding the veu has not abated gao study of september 200871 recommended the suspension of the veu program with china because bis has not been able to reach veu specific inspection agreement with china for conducting onsite reviews of validated endusers nor has the agency developed criteria for selecting candidates for onsites or the procedures for conducting the onsite review itself according to gao commerce notes that it has conducted checks under the preexisting 2004 enduse verification understanding euvu however checks conducted under this system require the aforementioned mofcom enduse statement running counter to the trade facilitation rationale of the program and if the companies do not voluntarily seek an eus from mofcom then an inspection cannot take place 72 on january 13 2009 bis announced full implementation of the veu to china with agreement on procedures to ensure the programs secure and efficient operation73

as noted earlier the bureau of industry and s ecurity bis within the department of commerce doc is responsible for regulating dualuse exports however other agencies also provide input into the licensing process bis consults with other members of the national security community on license applications and commodity classifications the defense technology security agency in the department of defense conducts national security reviews for license applications referred from commerce and state the department of energy also reviews dualuse license applications referred by bis for nuclear uses and nuclear endusers and it and the nuclear regulatory commission license exportation of nuclear materials in addition the directorate of defense trade controls ddtc at the state department administers the international traffic in arms regulations through the us munitions list ddtc controls the export of weapons and military technology industry leaders identify several problems with the existing licensing system first overlapping jurisdiction between the commerce and state departments with regard to certain dualuse products makes it unclear where the exporters need to apply for licenses second extended time periods required for license approval compromise the reliability of us suppliers and make it hard for manufacturers and customers to plan ahead third the licensing system does not reflect advances in technology foreign availability of dualuse items and the economic impact of export 69 wisconsin project on nuclear arms control in china we trust january 2008 available at

for judicial review of licensing decisions others consider foreign availability and economic impact to be important considerations yet secondary to national security export administration officials claim that they conduct thorough fair and expeditious license reviews time is required to check proposed export items against lists of controlled items check end users and end uses against lists of suspect recipients and coordinate with several government agencies officials say they must be able to stop the clock to obtain additional information and investigate certain issues on casebycase basis to insure that sensitive technologies do not find their way into the wrong hands some analysts who see national security as the primary purpose of the export control regime question whether bis belongs in the department of commerce they claim that docs mission is mostly one of promoting exports and generally serving commercial interests this in some eyes may create an institutional bias towards the granting of export licenses and skew the process against national security goals other analysts point to the full and equal participation of other agencies particularly the department of defense in the current structure to argue that such bias is unlikely to prevail g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 ian f fergusson
