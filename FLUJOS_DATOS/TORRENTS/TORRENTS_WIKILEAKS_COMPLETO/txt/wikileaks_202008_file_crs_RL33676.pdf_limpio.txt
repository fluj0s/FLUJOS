areas receiving funds under this provision are american samoa guam the commonwealth of the northern mariana is lands and the republic of palau palau will cease to be eligible for perkins f unding when it enters into an agreement to extend the compact of free association the united stat virgin islands does not receive funding under this reservation because it is considered state for the purposes of the state allotment formula 5 the compact of free association has governed the economic political and military relationships between the united states and the fas since 1986 for further information see crs report rl31737 the marshall islands and micronesia amendments to the compact of free associati on with the united states by thomas lumthe amount reserved for ssistance for outlying areas4 has been reduced from 02 of funds appropriated under section 9 to 013 this reduced percentage reflects the fact that two freely associated states fass micronesia and the marshall islands are longer eligible for perkins funding because the united states and these fass signed agreements to extend the compact of free association5 in addition the reservation for incentive grants has been repealed under perkins iv funds previously rese rved for incentive grants and funds that would have been provided to the outlying ar eas in previous years are included in the amount available to make state grants as previously mentioned however the state grant formula under perkins iv diverges from the formula used under perkins iii if additional funding also referred to as new money is available for state grants additional funds is defined as amounts in excess of funds allotted to states for fy2006 plus the amount set aside for incentive grants for fy2006 and 827671 the 827671 figure represents the amount of funding set aside for the outlying areas in fy2006 that is longer needed in subs equent fiscal years due to the reduction in the number of outlying areas eligible for f unding that is it is the difference between 020 multiplied by the fy2006 sec tion 9 appropriation 1182388000 minus 013 multiplied by the fy2006 section 9 appropriation adding the incentive grant amount and 827671 to the fy2006 state amounts ensures that the new formula will be triggered only by increased appropriations not from reductions in setasides using dollar amounts the fy2006 base amount is calculated as follows formula fy2006 base amount 1155902206 fy2006 state grants 6384894 fy2006 incentive grant set asid 82 7671 excess funds for outlying areas thus the fy2006 base amount is 1163114771 if this amount is exceeded the new formula discussed in subs equent section is triggeredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33676crs4 6 grants to states have been weighted based on population groups since the vocational education act of 1963 pl 88210 was enacte d the law specified that funds should be provided to states on the basis of the numbe r of persons in the various age groups needing vocational education section 3 the same population groups used under perkins iv were also used under pl 88210 7 the virgin islands and puerto rico are required to be assigned an allotment ratio of 060state grant formula for level or decreased funding perkins iv retains the formula used to calculate state grants under perkins iii if the total amount of funding available for stat grants is equal to or less than the base amount of funding available in fy2006 this section provides detailed analysis of how the formula works in practice as the formula remains unchanged under perkins iv for level or decreased funding the an alysis is based on how fy2006 state grants were calculated as all data needed to make these calculations are available this is followed by discussion of estimated fy 2007 grants assuming level funding and 1 decrease in funding these estimates are provided solely to assist in comparisons of the relative impact of changes in state grants resulting from changes made by perkins iv to setaside provisions and popula tion changes some of the data which will be used to calculate the fi nal fy2007 grants are not available calculation of grants under both perkins iii and iv the in itial factors that determine state grants are population factors and per capita income population is based on the number of individuals in three age groups and the comb ined number of individuals in these age groups each of these groups is weighted in formula that calculates total population6 the largest weight 05 is assi gned to the age group including persons aged 15 to 19 the age group including persons aged 20 to 24 is assigned weight of 02 while the age group including persons aged 25 to 65 is assigned weight of 015 the final age group included in the calculation includes all individuals aged 15 to 65 and is assigned weight of 015 thus among states with similar number of people aged 15 to 65 states with rela tively younger populations will have higher weighted population count than states whose populations are relatively older per capita income pci also affects th weighted population count for each state through an allotment ratio per capita income is defined as the total personal income in state divided by the population of the st ate for the purposes of determining state grants each state is assigned an allotment ratio the allotment ratio is calculated by dividing the pci for given state by the pci for all states combined the result is multiplied by 05 and subtracted from one th is calculation assigns higher values to states with pcis lower than the national average and lower values to states with higher than average pcis state however may have an allotment ratio higher than 060 or lower than 0407 state that had pci equal to the pci for all states would have an allotment ratio of 05 this allotment ratio is multiplied by the total number of individuals in each of the aforementioned age groups prior to the weighting of the population counts in each gr oup the inclusion of pci in the formula helps to provide states with lower pcis with additiona l grant funds and vice versahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33676crs5 8 for history of minimum grant provisions related to the perkins act see appendix 9 the nappp is determined for each state by dividing the total amount allocated to all states by total population ages 15 to 65 in all states the resulting amount the national average per pupil payment is then multiplied by each states total unweighted population count for individuals aged 15 to 65 10 ratable reduction refers to the reduction of ea ch states grants except for those receiving some minimum grant amount by the same percentage notice in column g of table 2 that many states have their initial allocation reduced by 162 11 states other than delaware that have th eir estimated fy2006 grants based on 150 of the nappp include montana south dakota and the virgin islandsthe resulting calculation of state grants based on population and pci factors is referred to as states in itial allocation column b in table 2 shows what these estimated grant amounts were in fy2006 column c in table 2 provides the percentage of total funds each state woul d receive for its initia l allocation based on fy2006 appropriations for state grants under current law there are several provisions that alter these initial allocations to ensure that states allocation is below certain minimum grant levels8 one minimum amount is the states fy1998 grant hold harmless provision the other minimum is ½ of the total allocated to states the ½ minimum may be adjusted based on the following calculations first it is determined what the state would receive if provided with minimum grant of ½ this amount is compared with the grant amount that would be awarded to the state under special ru that provides the state with the lesser of 1 150 of its prior year grant or 2 state population multiplied by 150 of the national average per pupil payment nappp9 based on these calculations the state th receives the lesser of ½ of total funding or the grant amount calculated under the special rule referred to as the adjusted ½ minimum grant this amount is subsequently compared with the amount the state received in fy1998 and the larger amount is awarded for any state whose initial grant exceeds its minimum grant amount its initial allocation is ratably reduced10 to provide states whose initial allocations were below their minimum grants with their final grants however the resulting ratably reduced grants may be further adjusted if the results fall below states fy1998 grant or the adjusted ½ minimum grant amount for state figure 1 and four examples are provi ded to demonstrate how the formula works in practice example 1 delaware fy2006 grant based on population and pci factors delaware would receive an initial allocation of 29 million or 025 of total funding as this is below minimum grant of ½ 58 million minimum grant of ½ is calculated and the special rule is used to determine delawares final award under the special rule delaware w ould receive 74 million based on 150 of its prior year grant and 48 million when stat population is multiplied by 150 of the nappp the smaller of these two payments is the latter this is then compared with the minimum grant amount of ½ as the amount obtained by multiplying the states population by 150 of the national average perpupil payment is the smaller of the two grant amounts but is greater than delawares fy1998 grant delaware receives the 48 million11 this is referred to as the 150 nappp strategy in column d of

source table prepared by crs apr 17 2006 based on data provided by the us department of education budget service notes details may not add to totals due to rounding the final strategy for determining the state grants column reflects the relev ant requirement in the state grant formula that determines the states grants ratably reduced means that states initial gran t was at or above the 05 minimum grant amount thus the grant was subsequently ratably reduced to provide states whose initial allocations were below the 05 minimum grant amount with additional funding the expression 150 nappp means that states grant was u ltimately determined based on the states population multiplied by 150 of the na ppp ½ minimum grant means that states grant was ultimately determined to be the minimum grant of ½ and fy1998 means that the state was held harmless at its fy1998 state gr ant amount weighted perperson funding was calculated using the weighted population counts that are used in determining state gra nts these are estimated grants only in addition to other limitations some of the data that will be used to calculate final grant s are not yet available these estimates are provided solely to

weighted by the factors assigned to each population group for the calculation of st ate grants eg 05 for individuals aged 15 to 19 dividing estimated fy2006 state grants by this weighted population count produces the amount of funding state received for each person16 as depicted in column i of table 2 there is substantial variability in perperson funding by state more specifically am ong states

funding level used in this example maine and rhode island however received fy2006 grants of 5811000 which is 900000 below the minimum grant amount of ½ at the fy2007 funding level since the difference between the fy2006 grant amounts and the minimum grant amount of ½ for fy2007 is greater for vermont and wyoming than it is for maine and rhode island vermont and wyoming would receive greater share of the new money that is both vermont and wyoming would each receive over 500000 while maine and rhode island would each receive 31000 as result of this allotment procedure none of the small states could receive more than the minimum grant amount of ½ of the current amount allotted for state grants the remaining funds at least tw othirds of the new money or about 775 million based on the above example would be allotted to the other states based on the underlying formula except that st ate would receive grant less than its fy1998 grant it should be noted that even if all the small states had reached the minimum grant amount of ½ in fy2007 for example they would still need all or portion of their share of the new money in subsequent years to remain at the minimum grant amount of ½ or as close to it as po ssible depending on the amount of new money available it might be possible to increase grant amounts but not maintain states at the minimum grant amount of ½ that is it is possible that state that reaches the minimum grant am ount of ½ in one fiscal year may fall below the minimum grant amount in succeeding fiscal year while still receiving an increase in funding figure 2

provided by the us department of education budget service fy2007 estimates were calculated by crs using 2005 population data available from the us census bureau note details may not add to totals due to rounding these are estimated grants only in addition to other limitations some of the data which will be used to calculate final grants are not yet available these estimates are provided solely to assist in comparisons of the relative impact of alternative formulas and funding levels in the legislative process they are not intended to predict specific amounts states will receivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33676crs21 23 the vocational education act of 1963 was also amended by the vocational education amendments of 1968 pl 90576 but these am endments did not modify the state grant formula 24 states that were not subject to the second t of calculations were held harmless at their fy1985 grant amount this resulted for example in massachusetts receiving its fy1985 grant amount until fy2002 with the exception of fy1992 when massachusetts received slightly higher allotment 25 for example delaware montana and sout h dakota have exceeded their fy1991 grant amounts but have not reached the minimum grant amount of ½ of total fundingappendix minimum state grant requirements this section examines minimum grant provisions in federal career and technical education laws beginning with the voca tional education act of 1963 pl 88210 while this act did not mark the beginning of federal involvement in career and technical education the stat grant formula included in the act provided framework for subsequent legislation under pl 88210 state grants were calculated using only population and pci factors all states were guaranteed minimum grant of 10000 the vocational education act of 1963 was amended in 1984 by the carl d perkins vocational education ac t perkins i pl 9852423 perkins i replaced the 10000 minimum grant with minimum grant of ½ of total funds not to exceed 150 of states prior year grant it also included provision that held states harmless at their fy1984 grant amounts unde r perkins i states that were receiving less than the minimum grant of ½ gradually received increases in their grant amounts but these increases were limited by the 150 cap on yeartoyear increases by fy1989 all states reached the minimum grant amount of ½ and continued to receive the minimum grant amount of ½ in fy1990 the carl d perkins vocational nd applied technology education act amendments of 1990 perkins ii pl 101392 further amended the state grant formula by adding the special rule that provides states with the lesser of 1 150 of their prior year grant or 2 state population multiplied by 150 of the nappp the special rule also included provision that held states harmless at their fy1991 grant amounts24 the special rule effectively left states that received less than the minimum grant of ½ in fy1991 at the sa amount they received in fy1990 42 million over time handful of these st ates eventually exceeded their fy1991 grant amounts25 the carl d perkins vocational and t echnical education act of 1998 perkins iii pl 105332 retained the state grant formula used in perkins ii but modified the hold harmless provision to hold all states harmless at their fy1998 grant amounts regardless of whether they were subject to second set of calculations this effectively left alaska district of co lumbia north dakota vermont and wyoming at their fy1990 grant amounts as their grant amounts did not change from fy1990 through fy1998
