power in the msb mutual savings bank14 in february 2004 ncua amended its rule on credit union conversi ons 12 cfr part 708a to require converting credit union to disclo additional information to its members to better educate them regarding the conversion15 among the requirements of the amended rule are the following 1 the vote on the conversion proposal must be by secret ballot and conducted by an independent entity 2 converting credit union must enclose with each written communication sent to its memb ers concerning the conversi on disclosures of ownership and control expenses and their effect on rates and services possibility of subsequent conversion to stock institution which may allow executives of the institution to profit by obtaining stock in excess of that available to the institutions members and costs of the conversion 3 federallyinsured stat chartered credit union must include in its notice to ncua statement as to whether the state law under which it is chartered allows it to convert to mutual savings bank it will remain subject to any state law requirements more stringent than the regu lation including any internal governance requirements 4 converting credit union mu st be careful to make certain that its member list is accurate and co mplete 5 converting cred it union must be careful to conduct its special meeting concerning c onversion in manner which will accommodate all members wishing to attend there is some concern that the ncua may have overreached its authority in regulation 708a when it required such disclosures as an ex planation of any foreseeable stock related benefits associated with subsequent conversion to stock institution some believe that this kind of disclosure in cluding the disclosing of future plans for selling stock to the public is an issue for th banking regulators rather than ncua to oversee others believe that the possible ter sale of the converted credit union as stockissuing organization is the major i ssue in converting credit union to mutual savings bank they argue that if the dir ectors of the converting credit union intend that the organization later convert to stockissuing entity thereby perhaps enriching these directors the directors shoul d disclose this intention16 hr 3206 109th congress was introduced july 12 2005 and referred to the committee on financial services subcommittee on
