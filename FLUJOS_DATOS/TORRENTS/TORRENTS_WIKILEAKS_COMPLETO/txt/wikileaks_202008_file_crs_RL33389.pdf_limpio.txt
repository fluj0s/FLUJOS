nuclear issue although adjustments were made such as ch anges to senior us officials in charge of policy in east asia and the addition of human rights and criminal activities to the agenda of items to cover with north kor ea overall relationships and regional trends saw major reversals or breakthroughs north korea escalates tension in early 2005 in the first half of 2005 north korea calated the security situation on the korean peninsula through words and actions on february 10 pyongyang officials announced that north korea had nuclear w eapons and would inde finitely suspend its participation in the sixparty talks the multilateral negotiation forum dedicated to the peaceful denuclearization of north korea made up of the united states china japan north korea south korea and russi north korean officials followed up in april with the assertion that the fo cus of the negotiations should adjust to regional disarmament talks given its status as nuclear weapons state reports of preparations for possible nucl ear test in april further escalated the sense of urgency in may north korea announced that it had removed 8000 fuel rods from the yongbyon reactor for reprocessing expert s estimate that the reprocessed plutonium could provide enough material for an additional six to eight nuclear bombs later that month north korea launched shor trange missile into the east seahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33389crs2 return to the sixparty talks after nearly year without meeting negotiators from the six nations re convened in beijing in late july 2005 for fourth round of talks the outcome joint statement of principles agreed to in september by all parties was hailed as major breakthrough the key statement committed north korea to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuc lear programs and returning at any early date to the treaty on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the international atomic energy agency iaea safeguards in exchange north korea was provided with security assurances south korea committed to provide 2 million kilowatts of electricity and the us and japan pledged to take step s toward normalization of relations with pyongyang crucial disagreement during the talks involved north koreas right to develop peaceful nuclear energy programs as compromise the united states and north korea agreed to discuss pyongyangs right to such program and its demand for lightwater reactors lwrs at an appropriate time the accomplishment proved to be shortlived how ever as just day after the statement was issued north korean spokesman asserted that north korea would return to the iaeas nonproliferation treaty npt only after it received an lwr from the united states secretary rice dismissed the claim but the sense of significant progress diminished and additional talks we re not held in 2005 after the sixparty talks stalled again hostile rhetoric between washington and pyongyang intensified incoming us ambassador to south korea alexander vershbow labeled north korea criminal regime and likened the state to nazi germany for its criminal activities the same week jay lefkowitz the special envoy for human rights in north korea appointed under the north korean human rights act visited north korea and ca lled it deeply oppressive nation while attending human rights conference in seoul the escalated attacks were met with torrent of hostile responses from north ko rean sources at brief reconvening of the sixparty talks in november the count erfeiting issue became the main focus the north koreans insisted that the imposition of sanctions on macau bank for its alleged role in helping north korea under counterfeit us dollars constituted hostile action that made implementation of the beijing joint statement impossible human rights on agenda criticism of north koreas human rights record became more prominent on the us agenda in 2005 jay lefkowitz was ppointed as the special envoy for human rights in north korea position created by the north korean human rights act of 2004 his public statements on the situa tion facing refugees and north korean citizens paired with highprofile mee ting in the white house between president bush and prominent north korean defector and author amplified the administrations concern about north kore as human rights record emphasizing this record drew attention to the gap be tween the united states and south korea in dealing with the norths human rights abuses in order to avoid provoking pyongyang seoul abstained from voting on resolutions condemning north korea at the united nations commission on human rights conference and the united nations general assembly meeting in 2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33389crs3 counterfeiting issue takes center stage in addition to human rights north ko reas criminal activities began receiving heightened attention in late 2005 in september american officials imposed penalties on banco delta asia macau bank that llegedly allowed the laundering of us dollars counterfeited by north korea noting the chilling effect on the sixparty talks some analysts question the timing of the announcement but treasury officials insist that the issue is lawenforcement activity and in way related to the multilateral negotiations south korea has distanced itself from the us accusations and reiterated its stance th at raising such matters causes unnecessary friction with pyongyang and jeopardizes the resolution of the nuclear issue china warned by the united states to crack down on illegal north korean transaction in its banks has taken some steps to curb such activity but us officials say it is unclear how aggressively chinese authorities are moving beijing has also urged pyongyang not to use the issue as reason to boycott the sixparty talks in december the us treasury department also put out an advisory warning us financial institutions to be wary of financial relationships with north korea th at could be exploited for the purposes of illicit activities north korea increases rest rictions on foreign aid in august 2005 the north korean government announced it would longer need humanitarian assistance from the united nations including from the world food program wfp the primary channel fo r us food aid in response the wfp shut down its operations in december 2005 and the united states suspended its shipments of food aid north korea also as ked all resident foreigners from the dozen or so aid ngos operating in pyongyang to leave the country in november 2005 pyongyang decided to reject aid from the european union eu after the eu proposed resolution on human rights in north korea part of pyongyangs motivation appears to be have been desire to negotiate less intrusive foreign presence particularly the wfps fairly exte nsive monitoring system officially the north korean government has attributed its decisions to an improved harvest the decline in wfp food shipments desire to end dependence on food assistance and its unhappiness with the united states and eus raising the human rights issue apparently north korea will continue to accept direct food shipments from south korea and china and many have accused these countries with undermining the wfps negotiating leverage with pyongyang china which provides all of its assistance directly to north korea is wi dely believed to have provided even more food than the united states since 2001 south korea has emerged as major provider of food assistance perhaps surpa ssing china in importance in some years almost 90 of seouls food shipme nts from 20012005 have been provided bilaterally to pyongyang notably ch ina apparently does not monitor its food assistance and south korea s small monitoring system changes to us team in ch arge of north

the sixparty talks as rice began her post at the state department policy analysts studied her language for clues about the us approach to north korea during her confirmation hearing rice included north korea among the list of outposts of tyranny thereby appearing to signal t ough approach to the north however her declaration during march swing through asia that north korea was sovereign state was interpreted as willingness to negotiate with pyongyang apparently operating with more authority than his predecessor hill engaged the north koreans in bilateral meetings and eventually in the sixparty talks two figures that appeared later in the year however were seen by many in the policy community as delivering more hardline message to the north koreans alexander vershbow the incoming us

counterweight to his visit to seoul for the apec summit the following month many analysts view chinas strategy as largely successful in serving its national interests avoiding major diplomatic crises
