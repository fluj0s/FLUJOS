earmarks selective look at energy efficiency and renewable energy rd programs summary appropriations earmarks for the department of energys does energy efficiency and renewable energy eere programs have tripled from fy2003 to fy2006 according to the executive office of the president and the private american association for the advancement of science aaas this affects the conduct of programs and may delay the achievement of goals further the administration has proposed new funding for hydrogen biomassbiorefinery and solar energy initiatives proposed under the american competitiveness initiativeadvanced energy initiative aei the report discusses the potential impact of congressional earmarks on eere research and development rd programs and in particular whether continued high levels of earmarks could lead to new cuts in staff and dilute the desired impact of the aei initiatives under eere should congress decide to fund them the congressional debate over earmarks centers on the transparency of the process with focus on earmarks not initially approved in either chamber that appear in bills conference report opponents contend that the earmarking process is not open fair or competitive proponents say it is legitimate practice and is justified by policymakers knowledge of local needs as it spreads research money to deserving states and institutions the appropriation figures cited as earmarks in this report are those labeled by doe budget requests as congressionally directed activities and for fy2006 appear to be completely consistent with figures in the fy2006

budget earmarks selective look at energy efficiency and renewable energy rd programs background definition of earmark in general there is single accepted and specific definition of the term earmark for the congressional appropriations process nor is there standard practice for earmarks1 however for funding provided by energy and water development ew appropriations laws to the department of energy doe this report defines an earmark as funds set aside within an account for individual projects locations or institutions in the fy2006 ew appropriation law earmarks were labeled as congressionally directed projects2 and most often appeared in the joint explanatory statement of the conference report3 accordingly doe budget request documents usually refer to earmarks as congressionally directed activities and often report on them in separate account lines under the functional energy area to which the earmarks are applied4 debate over earmarks there is general debate in congress over earmarks in which key concern is the transparency of earmark activities in the deliberative process critics of the current earmarking process argue that it is not the subject of open debate and that the number of earmarks has grown rapidly dear colleague letter that seeks to change the process says we believe the process of earmarking undermines the confidence of the american public in congress because the practice is not open fair or competitive and tends to reward the politically wellconnected5 opponents further contend as noted in the letter above that it is wrong to take an earmark provision that survives neither the house or the senate version of bill and 1 crs report 98518 earmarks and limitations in appropriations bills by sandy streeter 2 for example see the

this they say stifles debate and unfairly empowers wellfinanced lobbyists supporters of earmarking generally agree on the need for more transparency but they counterargue that earmarks are not inherently wrong nor should they be forbidden by rules of congressional process at february 2006 hearing on the subject one proponent said the constitution placed the responsibility for making spending decisions not in the executive branch but in the congress congress has always had the final say on that issue some would say that the earmarking process has been abused in recent years and i would agree especially in cases where earmarks are inserted into conference reports that have not been scrutinized by either body6 in general proponents agree that some modification of the process may be needed but otherwise contend that earmarking is legitimate under the constitution and is justified because elected officials are better able to make decisions about funding for local needs than program managers in the executive branch7 doe energy efficiency and renewable energy earmark funding in review of the fy2006 doe budget the american academy for the advancement of science aaas examined earmarks for doe energy research and development rd programs and found that earmarks eat up whatever increases there are for most energy programs and cut deeply into core rd programs energy rd earmarks total 266 million in 2006 more than double the previous record from last year and make up one out of every five rd dollars but they are especially concentrated in some areas including biomass rd where they make up more than 50 of total program funds hydrogen 27 and wind energy 33 ratios far higher than in previous years as result there will be enormous cuts to competitively awarded

competitiveness initiative aci which would increase support for rd and technological innovation including certain energy initiatives12 to help stimulate economic growth the administrations aci document expresses concern about the potential for earmarks to impede the proposed initiatives consistent with the previously noted definition it defines earmarks as the assignment of science funding through the legislative process for use by specific organization or project it says the practice signals to potential researchers that there are acceptable alternatives to creating quality research proposals for meritbased consideration including the use of political influence or appeals to parochial interests the rapidly growing level of legislatively directed funds undermines americas research productivity13 aci contends that this type of funding is rarely the most effective use of taxpayer funds on the other hand some proponents argue that rd earmarks help spread the research money to states and institutions that would receive less research funding through other means also some supporters of earmarking contend that earmarks 10 doe fy2007 budget request laboratory tables preliminary

fy2007 would they lead to new cuts in staff positions at nrel if congress were to approve the administrations requested increases for the aei renewable energy initiatives would earmarks continued at
