not exploited are incandescent bulbs banned incandescent bulbs are not banned or pr ohibited by the new law instead performance standard is set for nonexcluded cat egories of bulbs requiring them to meet minimum energy efficiency requirements if bulbs cannot meet the standards as defined above suppliers are not allo wed to continue selling them the law does not specify technology winners and losers ra ther the intent of the standard is to draw more efficient light bulbs into the market manufacturers are introducing advanced inca ndescent bulbs such as halogen lamps with special coatings that meet the standards or are very close to doing so in october 2007 philips lighting company in troduced the halogená ener gy saver incandescent bulb series that reportedly meets tier i standards5 the 70watt bulb in this product line for example looks similar to regular light bul bs and can be used in table lamps floor lamps and ceiling fixtures it provides highquality light equivalent to the output from many traditional 100watt bulbs other new incandescent products will likely be introduced by the effective dates of the law general electric ge for example says that it will have an incandescent bulb that uses half the energy of today s bulbs by 2010 and only quarter by 20126 non incandescent products including compact fluorescent lamps7 cfls and light emitting diode8 led bulbs can already meet tier i standards efficient lighting can reduce energy costs and use energy efficient light bulbs can save significant quantities of electricity compared to traditional incandescent bulbs table 2 summarizes the characteristics of several types of bulbs although cfl bulb is more expensive to purchase than traditional incandescent bulb its electricity savings rec over the higher purchase price in several months depending on use the led example in the table is not directly comparable to the other options because it produces different type of light than incandescent and

retrofit pr oject building engineers would also need to account for changes in heating and air conditioning requirements after switching to the cooler efficient light bulbs for small projects these costs are almost insignificant see the costeffectiveness of compact fluorescents in commercial buildings h chertoff energy pulse january 23 2008 c the led bulb in this table is not directly comparable to the other options due to current limitations in bulb availability and differences in light output the led bulb modeled here produces half the lumens of comparable incandescent or cfl bulb cost calculations in the led column thus assume that two 10watt leds are needed to deliver an equivalent amount of light unlike the other options led lights deliver highly directional light so this comparison may not be completely valid evaluation of lighting options consumers today have wide range of pr oduct options to meet their lighting needs both traditional and efficient lig hting products are now available at large retail stores and on the internet as well as at some local supermarkets these options often require consumers to decide what types of lighting best suits their needs incandescent bulbs traditional incandescent bul bs are preferred by some consumers because of their familiarity low purchase price and relatively high quality light these bulbs are quiet dimmable and turn on instantly despite their high energy use and relatively short lifetime s there is reason this technology has survived for overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22822crs5 9 two technological advances

of incandescent bulbs fluorescent lamps fluorescent lights have been used in commercial and industrial settings since the 1930s due to thei r lower operating costs they were slower to enter residential markets until compact versions b ecame available in the 1980s and 1990s9 early brands had poor lig ht quality and higher purchas costs which gave many consumers negative first impression of cfls two decades of market pull and technology push strategies has led to improved quality and cheaper cfls today10 there are now many varieties of cfls that meet energy star certification requirements defined by the environmental prot ection agency epa and the doe11 in 2007 nearly 300 million energy star certified cfls were sold in the united states doubling previous year sales and accounting for 20 of the light bulb market12 there are inexpensive highquality cfls available in retail stores and through the internet but brands can vary significantly in quality as described more fully below cfls have tradeoffs including the fact that they contain small quantities of mercury light emitting diodes leds leds are ubiquitous they are found in computers radios televisions traffic lights exit signs and holiday lights however they have only recently become available fo r general illumination manufacturers are developing new types of led bulbs for genera l lighting and expect rapid cost reductions although led bulbs are beginning to match cfl and incandescent lternatives in light quality purchase costs are still an order of magnitude higher leds produce light in way that is f undamentally different from incandescent or fluorescent bulbs13 leds used for general illumination are expected to be more efficient than cfls in the near future but remain slightly less so today leds can produce almost any color light and last about five times longer than cfls they turn on instantly contain mercury and because they have filament or fragile bulb are not easily damaged by vibration or external shock but leds are not widely available in general illumination markets14 besides high cost leds can experience problems in cold below 15 ef or hot above 120 ef environments with light that is highly dir ectional or focused leds currently seem better for task lighting than for general illuminati on some consumers complain that led light is too cold or blue these issues ma be addressed as th technology matureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22822crs6 15 any other bright ideas new york times january 10 2008 16 it is important to use cfls according to thei r intended design installing certain types of cfls upside down in recessed fixtures turning them on and off frequently or using them with dimmer switches when they are not labeled to be used that way can significantly shorten bulb lifetime 17 ballasts control the current and voltage to the bulb 18 see information on compact fluorescent light bulbs and mercury us epa may 2007 19 cfls typically take from 30 seconds to 3 minutes to warm up and reach full brightness depending on the type of ballast 20 new cold cathode fluorescent lights use elect rodes without filament and are reported to have full instanton operation like incandescent bulbs and lifetimes of 50000 hours consumer criticism of cfls some consumers comp lain about the quality of cfl products they report that cfls generate harsh unflattering light or that they dont last as long as advertised15 some of these objections may be due to experience with earlier bulbs that had poor color temperatur rendition or that were used incorrectly16 some objections involve pers onal preference cfls may not be appropriate for every lighting application cfls are now availa ble with broad range of size shape brightness and color temperature characteristics consumers have also reporte d objections to noise and f licker in cfl bulbs most of these problems have been solved w ith the introduction of improved electronic ballasts17 although some low quality brands may still exhibit these problems there is concern about mercury in cfl bulbs used and disposed of properly cfls can actually reduce mercury in the environm ent due to the lower demand for coalfired electricity which emits that element to the atmosphere s till the ep recommends special precautions in using and disposing of cfl bulbs18 for more complete discussion of cfls and rcury see crs report rs22807 compact fluorescent light bulbs cfls issues with use and disposal by linda luther another concern involves difficulty dimmin g cfl bulbs there are new varieties of cfls designed to be used with dimming switches these versions cost more than standard cfls and usually have only three settings off low and high compared to full range of light output in incandescent bulbs some consumers also complain about the time lag19 between when the light is turned on and when the bulb illuminates again modern electronic ballasts have at least partially addressed this issue but most cfls still need to warm up before reaching full illumination advanced cfl products may overcome this consumer concern20 legislation on march 13 2008 the light bulb freedom of choice act hr 5616 was introduced to repeal the new lig hting performance standards unless the government accountability office finds that 1 consumers would obtain net financial savings by switching to the more efficient bulbs 2 health risks would be introduced by the switch and 3 total us co2 emissions would decline by 20 by 2025 as result of the switch
