support services for disadvantaged students selected hea title iv programs although important support outside of the hea flows to postsecondary education institutions through multiple federal agencies for such activities as research and development the federal presence in postsecondary education is shaped to significant degree by hea programs for example the hea is the statutory authority for nearly 42 billion in federally supported student financial assistance this is nearly all of the available federal student aid and about 69 of all financial aid awarded to postsecondary students1 over time the various federal income tax benefits enacted in 1997 such as the hope scholarship and the lifetime learning tax credit will come to constitute significant portion of the total federal aid for students2 to place the hea in context it is important to consider the magnitude of the postsecondary enterprise it includes traditional higher education institutions ie public or private nonprofit 2 and 4year colleges and universities as well as other postsecondary institutions ie proprietary or for profit schools offering technical training programs usually of less than 2years duration and public vocational schools the hea title iv student aid programs are open to all types of 1 for details on student aid funding over time see college board trends in student aid 1998 washington 1998 2

billion in student assistance this cumulative total amount of aid provided includes directly appropriated federal funds student loan volume in the federal family education loan and direct loan programs and institutional matching funds required under several of the federal student aid programs title iv student aid is provided in the form of grants which do not have to be repaid loans and workstudy assistance the two largest title iv student aid programs are pell grants and federal family education loans ffels under both students receive funds to attend the postsecondary education institutions of their choice pell grants are needbased aid for undergraduate students these grants aided an estimated 37 million students with nearly 63 billion in the 19971998 school year4 ffels are made by private lenders and are available to undergraduate and graduate students and their parents some kinds of ffels are needbased others are not in 19971998 some 218 billion was borrowed under this program relatively new program federal direct loans dls provides the same kinds of loans as the ffel program but the loan capital is provided directly by the federal government participating postsecondary institutions or contractor act as the loan originator on behalf of the federal government some 109 billion in direct loans was borrowed in 1997 19985 3 for more information on

perkins loans6 the heas primary programs for student services are the federal trio programs which provide disadvantaged students with support services to help them complete high school and enter and persist in college the trio programs so called because there were once just three of them include talent search upward bound student support services educational opportunity center mcnair postbaccalaureate and staff training for fy1998 735000 individuals participated in the various trio programs which received about 530 million related program prior to reauthorization was the national early intervention scholarship and partnership neisp program which sought to increase high school completion and college enrollment by combining academic and social services targeted on low income youth to enable them to complete high school with scholarship aid for college enrollment states were awarded funding for this program7 the primary institutional assistance programs are the institutional aid programs found in title iii of the hea prior to reauthorization which award grants to higher education institutions to strengthen their academic administrative and financial capacities separate funding is awarded to historically black colleges and universities hbcus and to institutions serving substantial percentages of hispanic students annual funding for these programs

house and senatepassed versions of hr 6 established the same new formula for interest rates for new stafford loans after july 1 1998 borrowers pay interest based on formula of the 91day treasury bill 17 while in school grace or deferment and the 91day tbill 23 in repayment pl 105 178 authorized this new rate temporarily until october 1 1998 this formula provides students with lower interest rate than previously authorized at the same time the special allowance paid to lenders is set at rate higher than that which students pay but lower than under prior law to provide them with an additional 5 return as an incentive to remain in the program the senate bill sunset the new rates on july 1 2003 the house bill also changed consolidation loan interest rates to the weighted average of loans consolidated the senate bill kept current law which allowed lower rates the same as the stafford rates for consolidation loans in the dl program the new law includes the new lower stafford loan rates and higher special allowance it sets ffel consolidation loan rates at the weighted average but maintains current lower consolidation loan rates in the dl program through january 31 1999 after january 31 consolidation loan rates in both programs will be set at the weighted average the senate but not the house bill provided new extended repayment option for ffel borrowers with high loan balances both bills provided loan forgiveness for limited group of borrowers entering teaching see below both bills also included separate loan forgiveness provision for child care providers the new law includes the new extended repayment option as well as the loan forgiveness provisions both bills restructured ffel guaranty agency financing preserving current federal reserve funds while recalling additional reserve funds both provided guaranty agencies more flexibility in the use of future revenues the new law reflects the provisions in both bills that reform guaranty agency financing and recalls 250 million in reserves10 pell grants the senate bill increased the authorized maximum pell grant more than the house bill actual pell grant maximum awards are determined by appropriations the fy1998 authorized maximum was 4500 the appropriated maximum was 3000 the house bill increased the level at which the program award rules become sensitive to tuition from 2400 to 3000 both bills increased the amount allowed for dependent care or disability expenses under tuition sensitivity the senate bill also lowered the minimum pell grant award to 200 from 400 and set time limit on students eligibility of 150 of the normal time to complete an undergraduate program the senate bill but not the house bill authorized pell grant support to students in nondegree postbaccalaureate programs providing courses required for teacher licensing such students must be enrolled at institutions not offering baccalaureate degrees in education the new law increases the authorized maximum gradually from 4500 in 19992000 to 5800 in 2003 2004 increases the tuition sensitivity trigger to 2700 and raises the allowances for child care and disability expenses under tuition sensitivity the senates provision allowing additional pell grant support for future teachers was adopted however 10 for more details on the amendments to the student loan programs see crs report 98 291 student loans 1998 amendments by margot schenet crs6 the provisions on the minimum award and time limits were not included in pl 105 244 the house bill but not the senate bill included separate authorization of appropriations for new superpell that would double students pell grant awards for the first 2 years of college if they graduated in the top 10 of their high school class pl 105244 includes new program in hea title iv part that authorizes an award equal to students pell grant for the first 2 years of college if they graduate in the top 10 of their high school class11 campusbased student aid programs the house bill but not the senate bill amended the institutional allocation formulas for each of the campusbased programs to reduce the amount of aid awarded on the basis of the historical level of aid received by participating institutions and increased the amount awarded on the basis of institutional need for assistance in addition minimum share of fws funds was reserved for reading tutor jobs the senate bill extended these programs without major changes to the allocation formulas the new law includes modified version of the house provision which preserves the historical level of aid institutions receive but allows new funds above the fy1999 levels to be allocated solely on the basis of institutional need provisions for the use of fws funds for reading tutors are also included institutional eligibility both bills recognized that distance learning programs may face barriers under current rules they provided the secretary with authority to conduct demonstrations to evaluate the impact of such programs on access and the appropriate level of federal support and to recommend necessary changes to the eligibility provisions the senate bill initially limited the number of such demonstrations to 15 degreegranting institutions or consortia and also specified that the western governors university is eligible to participate the new law includes provisions for distance learning demonstrations that allow title iv eligible institutions systems or consortia and western governors university to participate in an initial 15 demonstrations with an additional 35 to be allowed in the third year an institutional eligibility rule that was originally established in 1992 hea amendments to curb fraud and abuse in the proprietary school sector requires proprietary institutions to have 15 of their revenue from nontitle iv sources the 8515 rule the house bill specified that revenues may include funds received for educational and training programs not eligible for title iv support thus overturning existing regulations on this issue the house bill also made more changes to the cohort default rate rules that govern eligibility in the student loan programs than the senate bill the house bill added definition of exceptional mitigating circumstances that exempts institutions from the default cutoff it was similar to but somewhat less stringent than the definition in existing regulations the house bill but not the senate bill also extended the cohort default rule to participation in the pell grant program schools ineligible for participation in ffel because of high defaults would also be ineligible for participation in the pell grant program both 11 for details on changes to the pell grant program see pell grants background and issues crs7 bills provided an exemption from the cohort default rate rules for schools with few borrowers the senate bill but not the house bill revised institutional refund policy requirements pl 105244 modifies the current 8515 rule to 9010 includes definition of mitigating circumstances in the statute that is similar to existing regulations but reduces the poverty rate and placement rate required exempts institutions with few borrowers from the cohort default rate rules and extends the cohort default rules to participation in the pell grant program modified version of the senate provision on refund policy requirements is also included the new refund requirements will apply to all students for hea title iv assistance only the house bill also exempted for one additional year historically black colleges and universities hbcus and tribal community colleges that had been explicitly exempted from cohort default rules until july 11998 after july 1 1999 such schools that demonstrate progress at reducing their default rates below the cut off of 25 may at the secretarys discretion continue to be exempt for further 2 years only the senate bill extended the hbcu and tribal college exemption until 2002 but gave the secretary discretion to impose cutoff after 2 years if there is evidence of progress the new law ends the hbcu and tribal colleges exemption in 1999 but allows further exemptions until july 1 2002 at the secretarys discretion if institutions exhibit substantial improvement in their cohort default rates12 administration of student aid programs both the senate and house bills established new performancebased organization pbo responsible for managing the information processing and delivery systems for the student assistance programs authorized under hea title iv under both proposals responsibility for establishing policies affecting the student aid programs would remain with the secretary of education and the pbo would be part of ed further the pbo would be directed by chief operating officer coo with experience or expertise in management financial services andor information technology among other responsibilities the secretary and the coo would attempt to integrate student aid delivery systems improve service to students and reduce administrative costs while increasing flexibility and accountability the new law includes these provisions to establish pbo in ed to improve the administration and management of the student aid programs need analysis the house and senate bills and the new law make several changes to the need analysis procedures used to determine what students and their families are expected to contribute expected family contribution toward their costs of education these changes are intended to increase the eligibility for federal 12 for more information on rules for institutional eligibility in the student assistance programs in the hea and changes made by pl 105244 see crs report 97671 institutional eligibility for student aid under the hea background and issues by margot schenet crs8 financial aid particularly pell grants of working dependent students and independent students without children13 for working dependent students the house and senate bills amended the hea to adjust the income protection allowance ipa for such students the hea prior to reauthorization set this ipa at 1750 although fy1998 appropriations legislation increased it to 2200 for 19981999 the house bill raised the ipa to 3000 while senate bill set it at 2200 for 19992000 both bills provided for annual adjustments to the ipa for inflation further both bills included an additional allowance against dependent students income in cases where parental income is too low to cover living expenses finally only the house bill sought to reduce disincentives for saving and working by combining student and parental assets instead of assessing student savings separately under the new law the dependent student ipa will be 2200 for 20002001 the same as its 19981999 level and the level set by the appropriations process for 19992000 this level will be adjusted for inflation in subsequent years the law now includes the additional allowance against student income when parental income is too low to cover living expenses the house proposal to combine student assets with parental assets was not adopted the ipas for independent students without children were also adjusted in both bills the hea prior to reauthorization specified an ipa of 3000 for single independent students and for married students without children when both spouses are enrolled fy1998 appropriations legislation boosted this ipa to 4250 for 1998 1999 for these students the house bill increased the ipa to 5500 while the senate bill set it at 4250 for 19992000 for married independents with children when only one spouse is enrolled the hea specified level was 6000 which was raised to 7250 for 19981999 by fy1998 appropriations legislation the house bill increased the ipa for these students to 8500 while the senate bill maintained the 7250 level for 19992000 both bills provided for annual adjustments in these ipas for inflation the new law sets new ipas for independent students without children for the 20002001 award year 5000 for single independent students and for married students without children when both spouses are enrolled and 8000 for married students with children when only one spouse is enrolled these levels will be adjusted for inflation in subsequent years the appropriations process maintained the 19981999 ipa levels for 19992000 both bills removed montgomery gi bill education benefits from consideration in the determination of students financial need under existing law these and other veterans education benefits were not considered for determining pell grant awards but could affect determination of need for other hea title iv assistance 13 for the history of changes in these provisions in the 1992 hea amendments and the concerns that were raised about the treatment of these students see pell grants background and issues crs9 the new law specifies that montgomery gi bill active duty education benefits will be excluded from consideration in the determination of students financial need for subsidized student loans otherwise current law treatment of these veterans education benefits is continued the treatment of education awards provided under the national and community service act of 1990 is adjusted from current law to conform to the new treatment of montgomery gi bill active duty education benefits college costs concern over annual increases in college costs above the rate of inflation prompted the house and senate to include provisions in their bills intended to provide clearer picture to policymakers parents and students of these costs and factors contributing to their increase under the house bill both ed and the gao were charged with collecting and reporting information on college costs to assist in analysis of costs and to educate consumers similarly the senate bill required the collecting and reporting of college cost data by ed to support informed decision making about college attendance the senate bill provided for fine of up to 25000 for institutions failing to provide requested cost data in addition the senate bill required ed to develop higher education market basket to gauge changes in the costs faced by higher education institutions the new law requires ed to collect and report college cost information the authority for fines of institutions for failure to report data is included the bureau of labor statistics is responsible for developing the market basket in consultation with ed elementary and secondary school teachers the house bill authorized teacher quality enhancement grants program of competitive matching grants to eligible grant recipients state governors unless another individual or entity is responsible for teacher certification and preparation and to eligible partnerships which must include exemplary higher education institutions preparing teachers and local education agencies leas eligible grant recipients were to use their funds for certification reform alternative teacher preparation institutional accountability for the quality of teacher graduates effective ways of removing incompetent teachers and teacher recruitment eligible partnerships would use their funds for similar activities as well as professional development and the integration of technology into teaching to be eligible for this program exemplary institutions in the partnerships would be required to have at least an 80 pass rate by their teacher education graduates on state teacher assessments by the second year all other teacher education programs in the state would be required to have at least 70 pass rate leas in the program must inform any parent who requests the information about the qualifications of their childrens teachers under these competitive grants onethird of the annual appropriation was to fund partnership applications when the annual appropriation exceeded 250 million awards are made by formula to eligible grant recipients who will also make awards to eligible partnerships the initial authorization was such sums as may be necessary the senate bill authorized three separate programs supporting teacher preparation and recruitment teacher quality enhancement grants would be awarded competitively to states participating states were to designate the chief individual or entity responsible for supervision of education to administer activities of the program authorized activities were similar to those in the house bill crs10 participating states must report on progress in various areas including the pass rate on teacher certification exams as with the house bill any benefitting school district must provide information on teacher qualifications upon parental request the senate bill also authorized teacher training partnerships grants for partnerships involving higher education schools of arts and sciences schools of education leas and individual schools they included high need districts and schools ie serving areas with high levels of poverty high percentages of outoffield teachers or high rates of teacher turnover partnerships were to provide preservice clinical experiences for prospective teachers reform teacher education curriculum and prepare teachers to use technology partnerships must have evaluation plans with such objectives as increasing the pass rate on teacher certification exams the initial authorization level for these two programs enhancement grants and partnership grants was 300 million divided evenly between them in addition the senate bill authorized recruitment program initial authorization of 37 million for higher education institutions with teacher education programs working in partnership with school districts in underserved areas relatively high poverty areas these partnerships provided scholarships with service payback requirements to prospective teachers as well as support services the new law consolidates the programs authorized under the house and senate bills into single funding authority supporting separate grants to states and to partnerships for teacher improvement activities and grants for teacher recruitment open to states and partnerships the initial authorization is for 300 million 45 of the annual authorization is for state grants 45 is for partnership grants and 10 is for recruitment grants under the state grant the eligible recipient is the state governor unless another individual or entity is responsible for the activities supported under this program authorized activities for state grants are similar to those in the house and senate bills partnerships must include higher education institution with teacher education program that demonstrates high levels of performance or that requires its students to participate in intensive clinical experience and meet high academic standards and certain subject major requirements other required members of the partnerships are school of arts and sciences and high need local educational agency the law identifies certain mandated and permissive activities drawn from those in the house and senate bills recruitment funding supports either service payback scholarships that are coupled with support services and followup activities or activities to enable high need school districts to recruit highly qualified teachers accountability requirements are imposed on participating states and partnerships continued funding is conditioned upon progress in meeting program purposes goals and objectives leas or schools receiving funds under this program must provide information on teacher qualifications to parents who request it the house and senate bills also included broad accountability requirements regarding the preparation of teachers by higher education institutions although they differed in many specific details both bills required any state receiving funds under the hea to provide information annually to ed concerning such issues as teacher licensing standards assessments and pass rates on such assessments ed was to publish such information higher education institutions that receive federal funds house bill or have teacher preparation programs enrolling students who receive crs11 federal assistance senate bill must report widely their pass rates on teacher licensing examinations the house bill but not the senate bill required states to identify to the secretary those heaaided institutions having teacher preparation programs with pass rate of less than 70 both bills had similar requirements that states receiving hea funding must have procedures for identifying lowperforming teacher education programs further if an institutions teacher education program had lost state approval or state financial support by virtue of its low performance that institution house bill or that teacher preparation program senate bill was ineligible for any professional development funding from ed and hea title iv aided students could be accepted to or enrolled in the teacher education program the new law includes the broad accountability requirements contained in both bills institutional reporting requirements are imposed on institutions whose teacher preparation programs enroll students receiving federal financial assistance the reporting requirements are similar although states are not required to prepare separate list of teacher preparation programs with pass rates below 70 states are required to report pass rates in rank order by institution the consequences for teacher education programs that lose state approval or support because of low performance are the same as in both underlying bills14 both bills authorized cancellation of subsidized ffels and dls loan forgiveness for fulltime teaching in an eligible lowincome public or private nonprofit elementary or secondary school under both bills only amounts borrowed for the first 2 years of undergraduate study could be forgiven the house bill required that borrowers have taught for 2 years before being able to cancel their loans the senate bill required 3 years of teaching the house bill limited the total amount that could be forgiven to 17750 the maximum in the senate bill was 8000 the house bill required secondary school teachers to have majored in the subject areas in which they are teaching the senate bill required that the major be relevant to the teaching subject both bills require elementary school teachers to have demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in elementary subject areas the new law provides cancellation for subsidized and unsubsidized loans made to new borrowers on or after october 1 1998 such cancellation can only occur after 5 years of eligible teaching and is limited to 5000 the house bill but not the senate bill prohibited any funds under the hea or any other act from being awarded to the national board for professional teaching standards which is developing voluntary national program of teacher certification pl 105244 does not contain such language institutional aid the primary institutional aid issues addressed in the new law focus on minority institutions in particular hispanicserving institutions hsis tribal colleges and universities tcus and hbcus the treatment of each of these groups of institutions is considered separately below the house and senate bills are described first followed by description of the new law 14 for more information on the new hea teacher education provisions see crs report 98166 teacher quality and quantity proposals in the 105th congress by jim stedman crs12 both bills transfered the authority for assistance to hsis from old hea title iii to separate title they also modified the definition of an hsi to require only that at least 25 of fulltime equivalent undergraduate students be hispanic and that at least 50 of those students be lowincome only the house bill amended other hsi eligibility requirements to include proprietary institutions meeting specified criteria under both bills hsis were newly authorized to use funds to address graduate and professional opportunities the senate and house bills authorized hsis to spend 20 of their grants on endowment building the primary difference between the new law and the language in either the house or senate bills is that it does not make any proprietary institutions eligible for assistance both bills authorized assistance to tcus for activities similar to those authorized for other institutions the house bill authorized tcus to use funds for endowment building and apparently applied 20 limitation the senate bill specified that up to 20 could be used for this purpose the new law authorizes assistance to tcus and specifies that up to 20 of their funds can be used for endowment building in other amendments affecting institutional aid the house and senate bills permitted the hbcu graduate and professional institutions specified in the hea prior to reauthorization to expand the number of graduates and professional programs they can fund both bills increased the number of hbcu graduate and professional institutions listed both bills allowed undergraduate hbcus to use up to 20 of their funding for endowment building institutions not falling into any of the groups of institutions described above socalled part institutions were also authorized under both bills to spend up to 20 of their funding on endowment building the new law reflects the concurrence between the house and senate bills on these various issues the senate bill but not the house bill added two additional groups of institutions to those receiving institutional aid alaska nativeserving institutions and native hawaiianserving institutions for activities similar to some of those authorized for other institutions the new law adds these two new groups of institutions as recipients of institutional aid15 student services the new law modifies and extends hea programs that support student services it adds new programs designed to provide such support some of the latter are described below both bills reauthorized the trio programs making several amendments to authorized activities including the addition of workstudy activities to the upward bound program pl 105244 reflects the provisions of the house and senate bills the house bill reauthorized the neisp program while the senate bill modified the program renaming it the connections program and incorporating into it some 15 for more information on the institutional aid programs in the hea see crs

hopes for college program the house bill authorized competitive matching grants to collegeschoolcommunity partnerships cohorts of students an entire grade level at participating lowincome school would receive throughout their precollege education various support services such as academic counseling activities to foster career awareness tutoring and mentoring in addition partnerships would seek to improve parents involvement in preparing their children for postsecondary education participating students would receive 21st century scholar certificates indicating the amount of federal financial aid for college that the students may be eligible to receive when they attend college the new law authorizes gaining early awareness and readiness for undergraduate programs gear up this program reflects combination of the neisp program and the house bills high hopes for college program the statebased features of neisp are continued with states eligible to receive at least 33 of gear up annual funding partnerships to serve cohorts of students are eligible for at least 33 of the annual funding the remainder is awarded to either kind of eligible recipient as determined by the secretary of education16 both bills also newly authorized grant program to higher education institutions for the provision of campusbased child care services they also created new special leveraging educational
