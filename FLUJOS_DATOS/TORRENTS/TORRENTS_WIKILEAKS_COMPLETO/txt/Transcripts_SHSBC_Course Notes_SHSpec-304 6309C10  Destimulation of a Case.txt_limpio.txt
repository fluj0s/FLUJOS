6309c10 shspec304 destimulation of case use arabic numerals to apply to routines use roman numerals to apply to body of data eg scientology iii not 3 auditor report forms are getting standardized format when handling service facs you are handling stuff that can bypass more stuff than any other thing there is if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on his case and he blows his skull off the service fac is what keeps the environmental restimulation restimulated when you are handling the service fac you are handling what makes aberration permanent many pcs have second dynamic service facs this has nothing to do with life but it has to do with your situation on this planet at this time the sickness and incidence of illness on this planet is unusually high because the way to make everybody wrong is obviously to produce nothing everybody counts on guys going ahead and making bodies keeping the civilization wheeling to keep thetans interested enough so they will keep reporting back the industrialist is in trouble at this time because he is producing on wholetrack basis thetan is in trouble simply because of mest that is how he looks at it if he could have arranged never to have created anything he would not now have anything to be in trouble with clearly so any creative activity is doomed to attack and the artists and musicians of this planet always attract someone who caves them in the same is true of industrialists etc they dont have enough force to protect their creativeness so people attack them therefore you find lot of service facs having to do with the second dynamic r3sc is thinice activity if you go one step too far you are in the soup so be careful to word questions with in this lifetime that way you will avoid lot of trouble from overrestimulation from getting onto the whole track with service fac running we are engaged upon keyout not bank erasure keep the pcs attention on this lifetime and be careful since it easily goes to other areas which can then easily become bpc that is the second factor that makes service facs fraught with potential arc breaks the first factor was that if the pc gives you his service fac and you refuse it you have bypassed the major charge on the case the moment you combine scientology iii with scientology iv you will lose you will have had it you will have left on the pc restimulation both from the pt environment and from the whole track how do you handle this so as to avoid this situation word questions so as to avoid all goaltype answers if an item rocket reads dont take it since only gpms rocket read you could get away with running it if you handled it very gingerly with in this lifetime and if you were very careful and didnt oppose it you can note it for later reference the best way to avoid problems is to ask questions that cannon be answered with goal asking for safe assumption about item is pretty safe in that you dont get goals but asking for safe solution to something tends to give you goals service facs are almost never to but they can be expressed that way avoid it scientology iii bypasses less charge run skillfully than scientology iv just because you are not among so many potentially heavily charged restimulatable things what you want to do with scientology iii is to destimulate the case so dont restimulate it in running service facs you can be wrong by restimulating the more you restimulate the more wrong you are the value of destimulation appeared in the search for ta action which is the only way to advance the case the whole track is too restimulative for most pcs getting into it produces overrestimulation and stops ta action the only reason that the ta doesnt move is that the pc is in overrestimulation take room and fill it half full of cotton bales representing charge person in that room wont be able to move too well then put some more cotton bales in the room now the person will have even more trouble moving trying to handle the situation by putting even more cotton bales in the room stops his entirely the proper course of action is to get rid of as much as you can that is already there clearing is getting all the false data and this lifetime restimulation off the case prior to recovering the truth one gets very good ta action doing scientology iii just by working on that line any case is overrestimulated when you start work on it the basic mechanism of entrapment is to keep the persons attention diverted to financial matters for instance to keep kicking him ground with various forms of trouble and worry so that he doesnt have chance to observe what is really going on the thetan wants something out of this planet and he thinks there is some pay he thinks that he is getting something out of it the trap wouldnt run at all unless the thetan was so busy in it that he never had time to look at it if he could see the trap he could get out of it but his attention gets diverted in it he then makes foolish decisions to hold off foolish confusion and gets still more entrapped it is perfected system of attention fixing shifting and dispersal real trap not just cynical snide comment those aspects of this planet that you protest are probably there to excite protest and overrestimulation eg finances money is bum itsa what is it in socialism you can never buy yourself off you stay tied down life is constant restimulation the pc comes into session subject to all this environmental restimulation restimulation comes in several different forms see fig 21 1 pt environment 2 restimulated bank restimulated by the service fac actually there is an interrelationship between environmental restimulation and service fac restimulation in that the pc wouldnt have the ptp of environmental restimulation if it werent for service facs 3 auditing restimulation what has been restimulated in auditing and not erased 4 current session restimulation what you are going to restimulate in the session or what you are in the process of restimulating in session 5 auditor restimulation restimulation occurring simply from being audited if the auditor is rough restimulation from flubs all of these sources of restimulation are interactive to some degree they all hinge on the service fac crossrestimulation occurs the only core on which it sits is the service fac the service fac keeps the environment restimulated it has great bearing on other forms of restimulation and prevents their discharge however it can be knocked out figure 21 the service facsimile and restimulation graphics inserted the most notable thing about the service fac is that the thetan is doing it right now he is making himself right and someone else wrong all on his own cockeyed determinism he is keeping the gpm in restimulation because he is using the service fac he is mocking up his bank and he is the effect of it too but he is responsible for everything that is happening to him the preceding is happening right now he is doing it it is decisional how does the auditor restimulate something by putting the pcs attention or letting the pcs attention go on any heretofore inert charge that can be restimulated ie anything that is not already discharged the pc is totally incapable of causing trouble in session the auditor can let the pcs attention wander all over restimulating anything his service fac directs him to you wouldnt have psychosomatic illness unless the thetan had as all do the service fac that the best way to handle situation is to get sick that is service fac that goes backtrack easily the way an auditor restimulates something is to let the pcs attention wander to it or to mention it how much it gets restimulated just depends on how often you mention it and with what intensity the mechanism of restimulation is name it the way to get an arc break is to name something and permit itsa this gives you instant bpc as when the auditor says sorry about that last session we had another way to get an arc break is to let the actions of the session bar the discharge of materials already restimulated eg the pc comes into session itsaing and the auditor getting model session in shuts the pc up auditors often ask silly questions to be sociable then shut the pc up in order to start the session cutting the itsa line an auditor can goof at start of session by putting in whatsit eg how are you doing and then not letting the pc itsa were going to start the session now you can do this any time it results in an explosion on an uncleared pc the service fac is interacting with whatever else is restimulated so the pc is putting in continuous restimulative factor in sessions you will get restimulation trouble as long as pc has prominent service facsimile getting one out of the way knocks about half the potential restimulation out of the way audit smoothly as you do it if you the auditor do the tiniest little thing wrong when you are approaching service fac the pc targets you as the one to be made wrong provide good specific small targets for the pcs attention and dont let his attention slide around it is trick to find service fac without restimulating everything here are some tips 1 audit smoothly this is the solution to session restimulation 2 restimulate more in your current auditing than you have to dont start naming whole bunch of things 3 give the pc frequent on auditing prepchecks to handle charge from past auditing do this every five or six sessions 4 keep up with the pt environment audit at least 2 12 hours week in case that was overrestimulated one would look to see what was practical to cut out normally the auditor would be concerned with reducing the auditing restimulation this is often overdone by excessively big targets b loss of control of the itsa line the auditor lets the pc talk too much one reason an auditor goofs is that he has his own service fac he is unwittingly trying to make lrh or the tech wrong he will usually come around when this is pointed out another phenomenon is that as you look for the pcs service fac and jog it he will target you to be made wrong which can be fairly restimulative and make the auditor flub one way to handle that would be to switch auditors you want to key out service facs so in assessing always use in this lifetime you dont want whole track only gpm rocket reads if you have room full of cotton bales you wont get anywhere with that finding the service fac directly because there is room to move around but you can reduce the restimulation in other ways if you handle all auditing on the basis of reducing restimulation you will seldom be wrong any pc who is running badly is doing so because of overrestimulation any solution of the auditing situation or the case has to take into account reduction of restimulation either by discharge or destimulation you can destimulate the persons life somewhat you can reduce one or more of the five sources of restimulation see p 503 above you could destimulate any restimulatable area whatever you can in fact work with then audit out this lifetime service facs case is as hard to run as it is restimulated more than that anything that reduces restimulation on the case is valid auditing for instance you could destimulate past therapies psychiatrists add more environmental restimulation than they pick off case so of course they fail
