around 1998 in 1997 the partnership for freedom initiative which chiefly sought to reverse sharp decline in russia aid made explicit plan to wind down largescale technical assistance to the whole fsu in 2002 but with smaller grassroots coope ration programs continuing beyond then to about 2006 in 2003 the bush adminis tration decided to phase out russia programs over several year s beginning with economic sector programs by 2006 the questions these or any proposed cuts raise is whether they are desirable or justified in terms of what has been accomplished or remains to be achieved in each country in the case of russia the ad ministration argued that economic reform programs were not required now that ru ssia has achieved strong economic growth the administration claim that democracy activities would be maintained however appears not to hold up to scrutiny in fy2002 and fy2003 russia fsafunded democracy programs amounted to 63 nd 61 million respectively however in subsequent years

of the total account the recent rise of democracy in ukraine and georgia and its evident decline in russia have highlighted the role and po ssible need for us democratization assistance the latter case in particular has elicited repeated calls for increased aid by expert observers during the last six years as putin has chipped away at democratic institutions and practices congress indicated its concern by passing the russian democracy act of 2002 pl 107246 which called for increased aid and emphasized the role of ngos and inde pendent media in democratization one aspect in the creeping diminution of democratic practices in russia is the attacks on aid recipients in civil soci ety and especially ngos that promote democracy in mid2005 ussupported human rights organization found itself accused of evading taxes even though its us foreign aid income is supposed to be tax free similar problems occurred in the early 1990s until they were resolved diplomatically by formal agreement with the us embassy this time however they are combined with attacks from the head of the federal security service on other ngos as well as the peace corps which ft russia several years ago amid similar

carri the danger of charges of us interference in countrys internal affa irs implementors have been careful especially in providing aid to political parties to be evenhanded and open to all comers but

lieve at the instigation of russia4 conditionality aid to the fsu has always come with conditions both the freedom support act and annual foreig n operations bills contain gene ral and specific conditions that all the states of the fsu are expected to meet in order to receive assistance conditions left to the broad discretion of the president include whether these countries are undertaking economic and politi cal reform are following international standards of human rights are adhering to international treaties and are denying support to terrorists other conditions blished by congress have been more firm and specific among these is section 907 of the fsa which for decade prevented with some exceptions policy reform and ot her direct assistance to the government of azerbaijan unless it took steps to cease bloc kades and other uses of forces against armenia and nagornokaraba kh beginning in 2002 and in each year following the president has waived this prohibition the majority of specific restrictions have been aimed at russia these include directions that aid be cut or withheld if russia implemented law discriminating against religious minorities if its troops re mained in the baltics if it did not provide ngo access to chechnya or if it did not coope rate with war crime investigations in chechnya since fy1996 direct assistance to the government of russia has hinged on its continuing sale of nucl ear reactor technology to iran as result in most years as much as 60 of planned us assistan ce to the federal russian government has been cut the new millennium challenge account compacts also come with their own conditionality to become eligible for th program countries must meet certain standards of behavior rela ted to governance social development and economic freedom while armenia for example appears to have t those standards sufficient to warrant compact agreement it also has been warned that it must maintain them or risk losing aid even as its 236 million award was announced in december 2005 letter from the mcc to ar menias president kocharian suggested that steps be taken to correct problems particularly with regard to charges of electoral fraud and media restrictions in the n ovember 2005 constitutional referendum5 currently the most difficult conditionality issue arises with respect to human rights in central asia the authoritarian governments of the socalled stans were not seen as fertile territory for us assistance in the 1990s cons equently most received minimal aid however after 911 these states became potential targets for muslim radicalism as well as front lines in the war on terrorism in fy2002 they received an additional 174 million in fsa account funds from antiterrorismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32866crs10 6 although
