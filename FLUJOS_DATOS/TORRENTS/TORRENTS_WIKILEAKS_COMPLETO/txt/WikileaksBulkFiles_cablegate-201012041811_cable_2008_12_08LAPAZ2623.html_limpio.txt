bolivia morales manipulates media owners ref paz 2569 classified by pas couselor denise urs for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary bolivian president evo morales continues on the offensive against the media part of longrunning campaign against the bolivian media through verbal and financial assaults the bolivian government is attempting to manipulate the way news is reported in this country the gob uses financial tactics such as hitting media with tax bills or spending large sums of money on advertising to influence editorial lines and to create fog about truthfulness it is also using its own media to expand and reinforce cult following around morales end summary gob on the attack 2 sbu the latest round of political attacks against the media reftel is part of an ongoing battle president evo morales regularly calls the media his principal opposition and his enemies notwithstanding his latest barbs however morales usually adds that he is not against journalists but against media owners rumors have been floating for months that in order to attempt to protect the president from his enemies venezuelan investors are trying to purchase various outlets including pazs secondlargest daily prensa but so far there is evidence that any sales have been concluded 3 c instead the gob is intimidating media outlets through legal proceedings and showing favoritism in the distribution of its significant ad budget to push the press toward more favorable view of its policies in one example the gob sent razon the largest newspaper in paz tax bill for nearly 5 million for having avoided taxes during 2006 highlevel officials at razon speculated to public affairs section officers that this tax bill may have been an attempt to intimidate the paper to move from its generally antigob editorial stance the tax liability would also lower the value of the paper so that it could be sold at lower price 4 c nationalization of certain companies has also helped the gob push its press agenda forward on may 1 president morales nationalized communications giant entel one of the largest advertisers in bolivia the gob has been accused of using the enormous advertising budgets of the companies it has nationalized including entel to reward media that publish progob articles and to punish those that do not 5 c with only one exception antigob television network unitel all of the major media in bolivia accept direct paid advertising from the government including spots that label the media as liars and suggest that bolivians should not trust what they read see or hear from the press ironically these same media often editorialize against the gob during the same broadcasts or in the same newspapers that carry antimedia ads pas officers have asked media directors why they continue to carry the gob ads and all have stated that without the income it would be more difficult to survive in the very competitive market who owns the media 6 sbu although the majority of media in bolivia are privately owned it is difficult to determine who the owners are there are public records that prove ownership and companies or individuals who own majority stakes can sell without public paper trail there are regular rumors about the possible sale of outlets but proof of such sales is nil and the rumors usually fade quickly 7 c another issue of concern is the influence of venezuelan money in the media pas regularly hears that venezuelan businessmen are negotiating the purchase of one of the television networks usually cashstrapped atb as well as numerous newspapers that are in financial trouble others claim it is mere speculation nevertheless venezuelan money has built technically stronger progovernment populist media network in the main bolivian cities called radio television popular 8 c pazs second largest daily prensa reported that morales has reformed stateowned media outlets in an effort to expand the popularity and cult following of the president the gob created network of community radio stations an internet wire agency abi and expanded the reach of the governmentowned tv channel 7 using 9 million donation from venezuela to install 120 repeaters there are also reports that the budget for channel 7 operations has expanded by 38 million and that the normal procurement protocols have been dropped the political opposition claims that the president is advised by team of communications experts from venezuela as well as other countries 9 c under the morales administration channel 7 empresa nacional television has become one of the governments primary media tools often presenting biased and misleading information openly propagandizing for the president and his policies and discrediting the opposition channel 7 is intent on expanding its reach and influence throughout the country the manager of channel 7 announced that it is upgrading to digital technology costly investment by bolivian standards year ago channel 7 announced the receipt of donation of equipment from unknown sources to improve its reach in the departments of paz and santa cruz and that it had purchased 50 new repeaters to be distributed to remote locations in the west and the amazon region after the iranian presidents visit to bolivia early in 2007 some publications reported that channel 7 would get large donation some reported the intended donation would be multimillion dollar investment to strengthen the state tv network but there has been indication that this is going to materialize iranian media are now reporting that the donation will be in the form of spanishlanguage programming channel 7 also airs venezuelan governmentowned telesur programming as part of its regular daily schedule who owns the print media 10 sbu two major media conglomerates appear to own most of the media in bolivia spanish group prisa owners of the spanish daily diario owns razon atb private tv network and extra8 cheap sensationalist daily the other media conglomerate the canelas and rivero families owns most of the national major dailies throughout the country in paz they own prensa in santa cruz leading daily deber in cochabamba leading daily tiempos they also own the only daily in alto alteo in sucre correo sur in potosi potosi and in tarija nuevo sur the canelasrivero group papers are generally critical of the government other smaller independently owned newspapers fight for evershrinking privatesector advertising revenues and often accept gob advertising to continue printing comment 11 c bolivias media environment is increasingly difficult the gob aided by large venezuelan investments has used financial pressures in an attempt to change the editorial line of the media and to hasten or provoke the sale of media outlets the regular rumors about the impending sales of media may be smoke screen to cover an actual sale they may be rouse to frighten the media or they may simply be the imagination of media owners it is always possible however that media will be sold without public knowledge changing the opinionleader landscape in the country end comment lambert
