of decadeslong effort to afford greater deference to victims in the criminal justice process it is akin to the victims bill of rights provisions found in the laws of the various states and augments fairly wide variety of preexisting federal victims rights legislation its enactment followed closely on the heels of discontinued efforts to pass victims rights amendment to the united states constitution g25g145g152g561g11g156g561g138g561g24g146g140g157g146g150g561 the definition of victim the question of deciding who should be afforded rights and who should not be was one of the difficulties that surfaced during the course of debates over the proposals to amend the united states constitution section 3771 provides an explicit definition for the purposes of this chapter the term crime victim means person directly and proximately harmed as result of the commission of federal offense or an offense in the district of columbia in the case of crime victim who is under 18 years of age incompetent incapacitated or deceased the gal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victims estate family members or any other persons appointed as suitable by the court may assume the crime victims rights under this chapter but in event shall the defendant be named as such guardian or representative 18 usc 3771e other than the coverage of victims of crime under the laws of the district of columbia the definition is by and large the same definition found in the general federal restitution statutes 18 usc 3663 3663a commentators have suggested that courts will be able to draw upon the case law developed under the two restitution statutes to determine who qualifies as victim under section 3771 recourse may be somewhat complicated however by the presence of additional language in the restitution definitions or by the references in the restitution statutes to specific persons and the types of harm that qualify for restitution nevertheless the courts do seem likely to consult their experience under the restitution statutes when construing section 3771s definition of victim section 3771 and the restitution statutes speak of victims who are persons crime victim means person although in common parlance this might be thought to restrict the class of victims to human beings general usage within the united states code is to the contrary unless the context suggests another intent the word person as used in the united states code is understood to include corporations companies associations firms partnerships societies and joint stock companies as well as individuals 1 usc 1 some courts hold that restitution is only available for harm directly related to the crime of conviction or provided for in some explicit exception such as that available for conspiracies and plea bargains other courts will permit restitution based on proximate harm if it is not too remote from the crime of conviction and if there are unrelated intervening causes or contributors to the harm thus for instance defendant convicted of bank robbery may be ordered to pay restitution for the damage he caused during his attempted getaway restitution is only available for harm related to the crime of conviction victims of crimes other than those for which the defendant is convicted are not entitled to restitution even if they were victims of offenses that were initially charged with the crime of conviction or are undisputably related to the crime of conviction the same may hold true for victims under section 3771 individuals may lose victim status under section 3771 during the course the criminal proceedings if charges covering the crimes of which they are the victim are dropped or dismissed even though related crimes continue to be prosecuted

of deceased victim the legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victims estate family members or any other persons appointed as suitable by the court may assume the crime victim s rights this suggests that family members of the deceased are not as such considered victims without more it implies that the parents and other relatives of an adult homicide victim may assume the victims rights under the appointment of the court but otherwise are entitled to none of section 3771s victims benefits the restitution cases may lend some credence to this view early case law construing section 3771 seems to leave the question unsettled g22g145g142g561g20g146g144g145g157g561g157g152g561g4g142g561g20g142g138g156g152g151g138g139g149g162g561g18g155g152g157g142g140g157g142g141g561g8g155g152g150g561g157g145g142g561 g3g140g140g158g156g142g141g561 section 3771 lists the right to be reasonably protected from the accused first among its victims rights it appears to have been the subject of little if any judicial attention one commentator has observed that the legal significance if any of these general provisions is unclear at the very least the section provides an explicit justifica tion for compatible judicial action taken in the interest of victim safety g16g152g157g146g140g142g561 section 3771s notification rights are subject to several limitations some explicit some implicit the section explicitly excuses failure to notify victims of the release of an accused when to do so might be dangerous and it permits the courts to seek reasonable accommodations when the number of victims in given case precludes strict compliance with the sections demands the notice clause has several distinctive features 1 the notice rights apply only with respect to public court proceedings and parole proceedings 2 the rights attach to those proceedings involving the crime but not necessarily to all those related to the crime 3 victims are entitled to reasonable accurate and timely notice and 4 victims are only entitled to notice of the release or escape of the accused with regard to this last feature committee reports on the equivalent language in the proposed constitutional amendment considered the terms accused and convicted interchangeable the sponsors of section 3771 were of the same view g3g157g157g142g151g141g138g151g140g142g561 section 3771 assures victims of the right not to be excluded from any public proceedings involving the crime except where to attend would color their subsequent testimony it is one area where balancing the interests of victim defendant and government may be the most challenging g18g138g155g157g146g140g146g153g138g157g146g152g151g561 unlike the rights to notice and not to be excluded the right to be heard is right to participate the section limits application to reasonable participation in public court and parole proceedings it does not on its face give victims the right to be heard in closed proceedings or to be heard on

to related forfeiture or habeas proceedings nor does it explicitly give he victim the right to be heard in any particular form section 3771 assures crime victims of the right to reasonably be heard at proceedings where plea bargain is accepted the right only attaches to the acceptance of plea bargains in open court ie at public proceedings the right clearly does not vest victim with the right to participate in plea negotiations between the defendant and the prosecutor which are neither public nor proceedings by the same token the right to be heard is not the right to decide victims must be heard but their views are not necessarily controlling it remains to be seen whether the existence of the right in open court will lead to more proceedings being closed to avoid the complications of recognizing the right the sponsors of the legislation seem to have anticipated that the right to heard at sentencing included the right to be heard orally and did not intend to permit the courts to require participation in writing except when faced with an overwhelming number of victims at the sentencing of single defendant thus far the courts seem to concur g5g152g151g143g142g155g561 the senate sponsors said of the right to confer with the attorney for the government this right is intended to be expansive for example the victim has the right to confer with the government concerning any critical stage or disposition of the case this right to confer does not give the crime victim any right to direct the prosecution prosecutors should consider it part of their profession to be available to consult with crime victims about the concerns the victims may have which are pertinent to the case case proceedings or dispositions under this provision victims are able to confer with the governments attorney about proceedings after charging at least some courts appear to believe that exercise of the right must be selfinitiated g20g142g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g561 the section affords the right to full and timely rest itution as provided in law it seems to confirm rather than enlarge existing law in the area of restitution sponsors felt that the rest of section would bolster the victims restitution interest by ensuring the victims rights to notice consultation and participation one appellate court has pointed out that the promise of full restitution extends only as far as the law provides fact that makes it clear that congress recognized that there would be numerous situations when it would be impossible for multiple crime victims to the same set of crimes to be repaid every dollar they had lost g20g142g138g156g152g151g138g139g149g142g561g8g155g142g142g141g152g150g561g8g155g152g150g561g6g142g149g138g162g561 section 3771 continues to describe the right to delay avoidance in limiting terms its sponsors suggested than the right was aimed at scheduling delays early case law indicates that the courts are sensitive to victims interest in delay avoidance but also that in some instances delay may be in the interest of at least some victims

privacy rarely found explicit expression in the proposed constitutional amendments although it clearly lies at the heart of all of them the same language appears in the earlier federal best efforts statute and similar right is featured in many of the state constitutional and statutory victims rights provisions

designates the judiciary as an insurer of the rights of victims requires at least some proactive procedure designed to ensure victims rights the trial courts obligation to ensure victims rights seems to set its responsibilities notch above the best efforts level of obligation imposed upon other officials

department of justice and other departments and agencies of the united states engaged in the detection investigation or prosecution of crime to make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of and accorded the rights the section confers it specifically instructs prosecutors to advise crime victims that they can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to those rights g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561 section 3771 expressly authorizes the government to assert rights on behalf of the victim the governments prerogative to assert the rights of victim apparently includes the right to petition for mandamus when they are denied victims also enjoy right to appeal denial of any their statutory rights using writ of mandamus at least two federal appellate courts have concluded that since congress had designated mandamus as the principal avenue of review it did not intend to require victims to overcome the hurdles typically faced by petitioner seek review of district court determination through writ of mandamus g16g152g561g16g142g160g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g3g140g140g158g156g142g141g561 person accused

damages on behalf of aggrieved victims but also to preclude requests for the appointment of counsel to represent indigent victims or for payment of attorneys fees for retained counsel the sponsors of section 3771 made similar statements during the course of debate with respect to the damage ban found in section 3771 but did point out that other sections of the legislation established grant program to provide victims with legal assistance other members bemoaned the fact that the section makes provision for the appointment of counsel for indigent victims
