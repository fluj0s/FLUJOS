from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to edward cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu subject re review confidential date mon may 12 172629 2003 ed just back from really sunny austria and very pleasant south of france have talked at length with jan and he says it is fine to send the raw and detrended cores series segmented for each site if possible do you also have convenient table with the lats and longs you used to plot the sites map this would mean i dont have to look them all up i will phone to report on our discussions and ask several things that arose from these just have to do essential other stuff first so probably tuesday afternoon my time do you have that review yet love and kisses keith at 0759 am 42903 0400 you wrote hi keith i will start out by sending you the chronologies that i sent bradley ie all but mongolia if you can talk gordon out of the latter youll be the first from outside this lab the chronologies are in tabbed column format and tucson index format the latter have sample size included it doesnt take rocket scientist or even bradley after i warned him about small sample size problems to realize that some of the chronologies are down to only 1 series in their earliest parts perhaps i should have truncated them before using them but i just took what jan gave and worked with the chronologies as best i could my suspicion is that most of the pre1200 divergence is due to low replication and reduced number of available chronologies i should also say that the column data have had their means normalized to approximately 10 which is not the case for the chronologies straight out of arstan that is because the sitelevel rcsdetrended data were simply averaged to produce these chronologies without concern for their longterm means hence the raw tag at the end of each line of indices bradley still regards the mwp as mysterious and very incoherent his latest pronouncement to based on the available data of course he and other members of the mbh camp have fundamental dislike for the very concept of the mwp so i tend to view their evaluations as starting out from somewhat biased perspective ie the cup is not only halfempty it is demonstrably broken i come more from the cup halffull camp when it comes to the mwp maybe yes maybe but it is too early to say what it is being natural skeptic i guess you might lean more towards the mbh camp which is fine as long as one is honest and open about evaluating the evidence i have my doubts about the mbh camp we can always politely disagree given the same admittedly equivocal evidence i should say that jan should at least be made aware of this reanalysis of his data admittedly all of the schweingruber data are in the public domain i believe so that should not be an issue with those data i just dont want to get into an open critique of the esper data because it would just add fuel to the mbh attack squad they tend to work in their own somewhat agendafilled ways we should also work on this stuff on our own but i do not think that we have an agenda per other than trying to objectively understand what is going on cheers ed ed thanks for this and it is intriguing not least because of the degree of coherence in these series between 1200 and 1900 more than can be accounted for by either replication of data between the series of which there is still some or artifact of the standardisation method with the use of rcs curves which are possibly inappropriate for all the data to which each is applied having then got some not insubstantial confidence in the likelihood of real temperature signal in this period the question of why the extreme divergence in the series pre1200 and post 1900 real geographic difference in the forcing replication and standardisation problems both are likely we would like the raw cores for each site the rcs indices upon which you base the chronologies the site chronologies which i think you sent to ray at first we will simply plot the site chronologies correlate each with local climate and come back to you again we will also plot each set of indices and compare site rcs curves and reconsider the validity of the classification into linear and nonlinear growth patterns i know you have done all this but we need to get feel for these data and do some comparisons with my early produce ringwidth rcs chronologies for ceratin sites and compare the trw series with the same site mxd chronologies all bit suck and see at first i am talking with tim later today about the review idea and i will emailphone before 1600 my time today thanks keith at 1001 am 42803 0400 you wrote hi keith here is the new esper plot with three different forms of regionalization linear vs nonlinear as in the original paper north vs south as defined in the legend and east vs west ie eastern hemisphere vs western hemisphere all of the series have been smoothed with 50yr spline after first averaging the annual values the number of coreschronologies are given in the legend in parentheses not surprisingly the north and south chronologies deviate most in the post1950 period before 1950 and back to about 1200 the series are remarkably similar to anyway prior to 1200 there is more chaos perhaps because the number of chronologies have declined along with the withinchronology replication however there is still some evidence for spatially coherent aboveaverage growth i showed this plot at the duke meeting karl taylor actually told that he thought it looked fairly convincing ie that the lowfrequency structure in the esper series was not an artefact of the rcs method cheers
