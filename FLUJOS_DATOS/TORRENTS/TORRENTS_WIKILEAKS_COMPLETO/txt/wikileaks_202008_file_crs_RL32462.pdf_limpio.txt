14 2008 james k jackson specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32462foreign investment in us securities summary foreign capital inflows are playing an important role in the us economy by bridging the gap between domestic supplie s of and demand for capital foreign investors now hold more than 50 of the publicly held and traded us treasury securities the large foreign accumulati on of us securities has spurred some observers to argue that this large foreign presence in us financial markets increases the risk of financial crisis whether as result of the uncoordinated actions of market participants or by coordinated withdrawal fro m us financial markets by foreign investors for economic or political reasons congress likely would find itself embroiled in any such financial crisis through its direct role in conducting fiscal policy and in its indirect role in the conduct of monetary policy through its supervisor responsibility over the federal reserve such coordinated withdrawal seems high ly unlikely particularly since the vast majority of the investors are private tities that presumably would find it difficult to coordinate withdrawal it is uncer tain though what types of events could provoke coordinated withdrawal from us securities market s short of financial crisis events that cause foreign investors to curtail or limit their purchases of us securities likely would complicate efforts to finance budget deficits in the current environment without such foreign actions having an impact on us interest rates domestic investment and the longterm rate of growth this report analyzes the extent of foreign portfolio investment in the us economy and assesses the economic conditions that are attracting such investment and the impact such investments are having on the economy economists generally attribute this rise in foreign investment to comparatively favorable returns on investments surplus of saving in other areas of the world the welldeveloped us financial system and the overall stability and rate of growth of the us economy capital inflows also llow the united states to finance its trade deficit because foreigners are willing to lend to the united states in the form of exchanging the sale of goods represented by us imports for such us assets as us businesses and real tate stocks bonds and us treasury securities despite improvements in capital mobility foreig n capital inflows do not fully replace or compensate for lack of domestic sources of capital economic analysis shows that nations rate of capital formation or domestic investment seems to have been linked primarily to its dom estic rate of saving to date the world economy has benef itted from the stimulus provided by the nations combination of fiscal and monetary policies and trade deficit over the long run however concerns are growing th at us economic policies and the accompanying large deficit in its interna tional trade accounts c ould have negative impact on global economic developments pecially for developing countries this report relies on comprehensive set of data on capital flows represented by purchases and sales of us government securities and us and foreign corporate stocks bonds into and out of the united states that is reported by the treasury

securities foreign capital inflows are playing an important role in the us economy by bridging the gap between domestic supplies of and demand for capita l international capital flows and international capital markets also give the owners of capital the ability to reduce their risk by diversifying their investments foreign investors are now major investors in us corporate st ocks and bonds and hold more than 50 of the publicly held and traded us treasury securities these capital inflows help keep us interest rates be low the level they would reach without them and allow the nation to spend beyond its current output incl uding financing its trade deficit some observers however are concerned about the extent of these foreign holdings because they argue that this exposure increases the overall risks to the economy should foreign investors decide to withdraw from the us financial markets for political or economic reasons inflows of capital into the us economy are not new such inflows however grew sporadically over the last decade as indicated in table 1 in 1996 total foreign capital inflows to the united states reached over 551 billion as figure 1 shows these capital inflows are comprised of official inflows primarily foreign governments purchases of us treasury securities and private inflows comprised of portfolio investment wh ich includes foreigners purchases of us treasury and corporate securities and financial liabilities and direct investment in us businesses and real estate by 2000 total foreign cap ital inflows totaled more than 1 trillion such inflows were reduced in 2001 and 2002 as the growth rate of the us economy slowed but grew to over 20 trillion in 2007 as the rate of economic growth improved private capital inflows comprise more than threefourths of the total capital inflows with foreign purchases of corporate securities stocks and bonds being the main components of these inflow s in 2007 official inflows are estimated to account for 17 of total foreig n capital inflows down from237 in 2006 capital flows are highly liquid can re spond abruptly to changes in economic and financial conditions and exercise primary influence on exchange rates and through those on global flows of goods and services economists generally attribute this rise in foreign investment to comparatively favorable returns on investments

p 431441capital flows in the economy table 2 shows the net flow of funds in the us economy the flow of funds accounts measure financial flows across s ectors of the economy tracking funds as they move from those sectors that supply the sources of capital through intermediaries to sectors that use the capital to acquire physical and financial assets1 the net flows show the overall financial position by sector whether that sector is net supplier or net user of financial capital in the ec onomy since the demand for funds in the economy as whole must qual the supply of funds deficit in one sector must be offset by surplus in nother sector generally the household sector or individuals provides funds to the economy because individuals save part of their income while the business sector uses thos funds to invest in plant and equipment that in turn serve as the building blocks for the production of additional goods and services the government sector the combination of federal state and local governments can be either net supplier of funds or net user depending on whether the sector is running surplus or defic it respectively the interplay within the economy between saving and i nvestment or the supply nd uses of funds tends to affect domestic interest rate s which move to equate th demand and supply of funds shifts in the interest rate also tend to attract capital from abroad denoted

through 1998 the household sector ran net surplus or provided net savings to the ec onomy the business sector also provided net surplus funds in 1996 or businesses earne d more in profits than they invested the government sector primarily the fede ral government experi enced net deficits which decreased until 1998 when the fede ral government and state and local governments experienced financial surpluses capital inflows from the rest of the world rose and fell during this period pending on the combination of household saving business sector saving and investment and the extent of the deficit or surplus in the government sector starting in 1999 the household sector bega n dissaving as individuals spent more than they earned part of this dissa ving was offset by the government sector which experienced surplus from 1998 to 2001 as result of the large household dissaving however the economy as w hole experienced gap between domestic saving and investment that was filled with large capital inflows those inflows were particularly large in nominal term s from 2000 to 2006 as household dissaving continued and government sect or surpluses turned to historically large deficits in nominal terms in 2007 capital inflows fell by about 150 billion from the amount recorded in 2006 this drop in capital inflows reflected sharp drop in household dissaving decrease in business sector dissaving and an increase in the deficits experienced by state and local governments in the firs t quarter of 2008 the flow of funds show large drop in capital inflows from the rest of the world from 918 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 through the firs t quarter of 2008 in addition households turned from dissaving of 178 billion in th fourth quarter of 2007 to net saving of 219 billi on in the first quarter of 2008 reflecting the growing concern among households over the state of the economy the federal reserve has reported that in the first quarter of 2008 households experi enced drop in their net worth of 17 trillion2 foreign capital inflows augment domestic us sources of capital which in turn keep us interest rates lower than they would be without the foreign capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32462crs5 indeed economists generally argue that it is this interplay between the demand for and the supply of credit in the economy that drives the broad inflows and outflows of capital as us demands for capital outstrip domestic sources of funds domestic interest rates rise relative to those abroad which tends to draw capital away from other countries to the united states the united states has also benefitted from surplus of saving over investment in many areas of the world that has provided supply of funds and accommodated the overall shortfall of saving in the c ountry this surplus of saving has been available to the united states because fore igners have remained willing to loan that saving to the united states in the form of acquiring us assets which have accommodated the growing current account ficits over the past decade the united states experienced decline in its rate of saving and an increase in the rate of domestic investment as indicated in table 3 the large increase in the nations current account deficit would not have been possible without the accommodating inflows of foreign capital as table 3 indicates compared with the 19942001 period us saving in 2007 declined by 34 of gross domestic produc t gdp while investment decreased by 08 of gdp this shift toward greater investment relativ to saving was accommodated by an increase worldwide in saving relative to investment among other advanced economies and the newly industrialized economies in asia both saving and investment declined in 2007 relative to the 19942001 period but investment declined more as share of gdp than did saving so saving increased as relative share of gdp in the emergi ng developing econo mies the developing economies of asia which includes china and the middle east saving as share of gdp increased faster and in some cases much faster than did investment which also increased in these areas table 3 saving and investment in selected

because foreigners are willing to lend to the united states in the form of exchanging the sale of goods represented by us imports for such us assets as businesses and real estate referred to as direct investme nt and stocks bonds and us treasury securities such inflows however put upward pressure on the dollar which tends to push up the price of us exports relativ to its imports and to reduce the overall level of exports furthermore foreign i nvestment in the us economy drains off some of the income earned on the foreignowned assets that otherwise would accrue to the us economy as foreign investor s repatriate their earnings back home some observers are particularly concer ned about the longterm impact of the us position as net international inve stment debtor on the pattern of us international income receipts and payments3 in 2006 the united states received 650 billion in income receipts on its inve stments abroad and paid out 614 billion in income payments on foreig nowned assets in the unite d states for net surplus of 37 billion in income receipts down from the 48 billion net surplus in income receipts experienced in 2005 considering the overall negative balance of the us net investment position it is not surprising that the net surplus of income receipts is falling as the annual amount of foreign investment in the us economy continues to exceed the amount of us investment abroad however it seems inevitable that us payments on foreignowne d assets will continue to ri relative to us receipts net outflow of income payments acts as drag on the national economy as us national income is reduced by the net amount of funds that are channeled abroad to foreign investors foreign capital inflows while important do not fully replace or compensate for lack of

shortterm economic events and speculation as they are by longer term economic trends 6 samuelson robert j dangers in dollar on the edge the washington post december 8 2006 p a39 7 traditional foreign exchange markets are organized exchanges which trade primarily in foreign exchange futures and options cont racts where the terms and condition of the continuedformation or domestic investment seems to be linked primarily to its domestic rate of saving this phenomenon was first presented in paper published in 1980 by martin feldstein and charles horioka4 the feldsteinhorioka paper maintained that despite the dramatic growth in capital flows between nations international capital mobility remains somewhat limited so that nations rate of domestic investment is linked to its domestic rate of saving5 capital flows and the dollar another aspect of capital mobility and capital inflows is the impact such capital flows have on the international exchange value of the dollar demand for us assets such as financial securities translates into demand for the dollar since us securities are denominated in dollars as demand for the dollar rises or falls according to overall demand for dollardenominated assets the value of the dollar changes these exchange rate changes in turn have secondary effects on the prices of us and foreign goods which tend to alter the us trade balance at times foreign governments have moved aggressively in international capital markets to acquire the dollar directly or to acquire treasury securities in order to strengthen the value of the dollar agains t particular currencies also the dollar is heavily traded in financial markets around the globe and at times plays the role of global currency disruptions in this role have important implications for the united states and for th smooth functioning of the international financial system this prominent role means that the exchange value of the dollar often acts as mechanism for transmittin g economic and political news and events across national borders while such role helps facilitate broad range of international economic and financial activities it also means that the dollars exchange value can vary greatly on daily or weekly basis as it is buffeted by international events6 triennial survey of the worlds leading central banks conducted by the bank for inte

specifically crossborder transactions of at least 50 million per month the custodi basis of the transactions means that some attribution of data to specific countries may distort the holdings data because some foreign owners entrust the safekeeping of their securities to such financial centers as belgium the caribbean banki ng centers luxembourg switzerland and the united kingdom which would

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32462crs12 as figure 3 indicates foreign private purchases of treasury securities turned negative between 1998 and 2001 and again in 2006 as foreign private investors experienced net sales of treasury secur ities from 2002 to 2006 and again in 2007 foreign private investors returned to ac quiring treasury securities but the amount they acquired remained relativ ely level at 100 billion per ear in contrast foreign official net acquisitions of treasury securities trended slightly upward between 2000 and 2002 but such net acquisitions more than doubled over the 2002 to 2004 period rising to 261 billion in 2004 in 2005 t hough official purchases of treasury securities plummeted to less than 100 billion and were less than private purchases in 2006 private foreign investors again reduced their net holdings of treasury securities this action was offset by large increase in acquisitions of treasury securities by foreign governments directed at least in part to slow the decline in the international exchange value of the dollar in 2007 foreign private investors returned to acquiring treasury securities with net accumulation of 116 billion while net foreign official purchases dropped to about 60 billion while the nominal amount of total purch ases and sales of corporate bonds on an annual basis has been much lower than th at for treasury securities the strong net accumulation of corporate bonds surpassed th at of treasury securities in 2007 this attraction to corporat bonds likely reflect s the attractiveness of bonds to foreign investors as an alternative to treasury securities and as hedge against falling interest rates the price of bond is invers ely related to the inte rest rate so lowering interest rates raises the price of bond and makes the bond mo re valuable net accumulations of corporate stocks has been the most volatile of the three groups of securities over the decade high levels of stock accumulation at the

developments federal reserve bulletin october 2001 639 economic implications the large foreign accumulation of us securities par ticularly of us treasury securities has spurred some observers to consider the potential for financial crisis such crisis could re sult from coordinated withdrawal from us financial markets staged by foreign investors for economic or political reasons or sharp drop in us equity prices as re sult of an uncoordinate d correction in market prices18 congress likely would find itself embroiled in any such crisis through its direct role in conducting fiscal policy nd in its indirect role in the conduct of monetary policy through its supervisory re sponsibility over the federal reserve coordinated withdrawal from us securities markets by foreign investors seems highly unlikely particularly since the va st majority of the investors are private entities that presumably would find it difficult to coordinate withdrawal it is uncertain what events could pr ovoke coordinated w ithdrawal from us securities markets some surmise that international concern over the ability of the economy to service its large foreign debt coul d spur foreign investors to rein in their purchases of us financial assets or that loss of confidence in the ability of national us policymakers to conduct economic policies that are perceived abroad as prudent and stabilizing could cause foreign investors to reassess their estimates of the risks involved in holding dollarde nominated assets in other cases the international linkages that connect national capital ma rkets could be the conduit through which events in one market are qui ckly spread to other markets and ignite an abrupt seemingly uncoordinated dec line in equity prices such market correction or market panic is expected to be shortlived however as investors would likely move to take advantage of drop in equity prices to acquire equities that would be deemed to be temporarily undervalued for instance concerns in us capital markets in early june 2006 over prospect s that rise in consumer prices and in the core inflation rate would push the federal reserve to raise key us interest rates sparked drop in

securities means that fo reigners receive any dividend or interest payments that arise from those securities and that the economy experiences transfer of wealth associated with flows of goods and capital across borders to the extent that foreign investors repatriate their earnings financial resources within the economy are reduced increased foreign ownership of corporate stocks and bonds also blurs the distinction between domes tic and foreignowne d firms and may well influence the way firms view trade ec onomic and other type s of public policies thereby affecting their relationships with congress in addition as long as credit demands in the economy outstrip domestic supplies of credit foreign sources of capital will be necessary to redu ce pressure on us interest rates to the extent that foreign investors become reluctant for an reason to continue to supply the economy with capital congress could find it more difficult to finance budget deficit by drawing on domestic capital markets without the economy feeling the impact of such borrowing the prospect of continued high levels of us borrowing from the rest of the world concerns various international or ganizations such as the international monetary fund imf and the organi zation for economic cooperation and development oecd in its april 2006 edition of world economic outlook 20 the imf highlighted the role us economic policies played in the short run in stemming potentially serious economic slowdown in both the united states and the global economy over the long run however th imf argues that the savinginvestment imbalance in the us economy threatens to affect global intere st rates productivity and income and the growing deficits in the nations already large current account exports imports and official capital flows as result of sustained high levels of capital inflows these effects could be esp ecially serious for many of the developing nations that rely on borrowing in global financial markets rising interest rates in the united states could raise interest rates globally which would raise borrowing costs to developing countries the imf argues that over time changes in us

world is affect ed in similar manner to the united states21 in may 2004 publication22 the oecd also questioned the feasibility of sustaining large trade deficits given that the deficits are accommodated by foreign investors who must remain willing to hold dollardenominated assets foreign investors essentially engage in crossborder risk management and will assess their estimates of risk based on broad range of factors including the ability of the economy to support potentially increasing vel of debt according to the oecd while the united states remains an attractive investment destination in many respects it is uncertain for how long fo reigners will continue to accommodate debt and equity claims against us residents at the recent pace23 the highly evolved state of financ ial and economic linkages between the united states and other fore ign economies significantly reduces the prospects of financial collapse in the united states should foreigners attempt coordinated withdrawal from us securities markets withdrawal by any single large foreign investor or group of investors from th us financial markets at time when those funds are necessary for closing th gap between domestic demand and supply of funds would likely have significant s hortrun effects any such coordinated attempt to withdraw substa ntial amounts of funds abruptly from the us markets would ordinarily be noticed quickly by dom estic and international financial markets as investors became aware of any large withdrawals they likely would follow suit driving the prices of the asset down sharply and causing us interest rates to rise abruptly any investor selling assets at this point likely would experience significant loss in the value of those assets similar downward spiral would occur over the shortrun in the value of the dollar if foreign investors attempted to convert their dollar holdings into foreign currency the financial and currency markets likely would adjust quickly to the demands of foreign sellers of dollars by driving up the price of foreign currencies this likely would result in decline in the value of the dollar and further erosion in the value of the assets of foreigners attempting to withdraw from the us markets over the long run the economic and fina ncial effects of foreign withdrawal from us financial market s would be limited because t hose factors which allowed foreigners to withdraw would attract other foreign investors to the us markets as us interest rates rose in response to the selling of secu rities other investors likely would be attracted to the higher returns of the assets which would curb the decline in the prices in the securities also the rise in us interest rates would attract foreign capital which would limit the rise in interest rates decline in the value of the dollar against other currencies would also improve the international pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32462crs22 24 jackson international capital flows fo llowing the september 11 attacks competitiveness of us goods as resu lt us exports would increase likely narrowing the gap between the earnings on us exports and the amount americans spend on imports thereby reducing the am ount of foreign capital the us economy would need furthermore those foreign i nvestors who are successful in withdrawing their funds from the us markets would have to find suitable alternatives even if they did not reinvest their finds in the united states the infusion of capital back into foreign capital markets likely would have spillover effects on the united states and on us securities it also seems unlikely that the federal reserve would sit on the sidelines watching while the us economy suffered financial collapse in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the us financial and foreign exchange market activities were slightly out of the norm but actions by the federal reserve and by other central banks helped head off financial panic and loss of confidence by ensuring that the financial system was supplied with liquidity through coordinated actions central bank coordination in times of crises is not uncommon but the speed with which the coordination was reached and the aggressiveness of the banks to stem any loss of confidence in the financial system demonstrate the recognition that national econo mies have become highly interconnected and that shock to one can create spillover eff ects onto other economies and markets24
