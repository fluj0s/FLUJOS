universe processes congress enewsletter thought being trapped by energy lets look at old dianetics and discover that the facsimile thats very interesting energy picture which individuals mockup that this facsimile would contain in it fiftyfive separate perceptions and an individual looking at facsimile could get kicked back by the facsimile all right if thats the case if thats the case then somebody must have thought the thought that energy was superior to thought and could entrap thought only if this were the case could an individual who is essentially thinkingness not an energyness could an individual be influenced in his thoughts by the impact of energy excerpted from the universe processes congress consideration and this universe an article by l ron hubbard from the universe processes congress theres time in thought thought is instantaneous or forever it doesnt matter there is time in thought how can there be any time in thought well its just the fact that hes also made up his mind that he can be worked upon by energy because time is in energy time is the coaction of particles if time is in energy then of course an individual can watch the energy and tell what time it is and hes agreed and postulated himself that certain amount of time passage goes by and things that happen over long period of time are harder to change than things that happen over short period of time that isnt correct but they just made up their mind to that actually mind can make up its mind to anything and then make up its mind to change or not to change its mind and out of all this we get what we get the fact that the basic common denominator of all thinkingness is the ability of the mind to consider to make up its mind about something just to consider to make up its mind to think something is true if an individual can is well off he can say snap and know that its true he can think snap and know that its true he can snap and that first postulate is gone and snap the other one is gone and snap something new is true he is the author of truth not the agreer upon truth and when he slavishly gets to level where he can only agree with other peoples truths then hes in difficulty then hes in difficulty that is the single barrier in all of the teaching of scientology the individual knows this instinctively that he cannot pick up my thoughts and use them as his own he knows this and so i try to make it very amply and adequately clear to him what is true about this im not talking about my thoughts im not talking about my thoughts im talking about that series of considerations which have taken place for the last 76 trillion years in this universe which have brought it to pass and to which youve agreed if youre here you agreed to them and to which i agreed too or i wouldnt be talking to you about them so whatever im talking to you about in scientology is actually this point consideration our consideration of now this consideration of course has been well codified in scientology probably could be much more ably codified because i did it but an individual getting in there and really doing scholarly job on it could have done much better job im sure because i wasnt much interested in doing scholarly job i just wanted to get an effective job done and different goals entirely so scientology has been and is search into that pattern of considerations which comprise this universe to discover the common denominators of all considerations to which all of us in this universe are liable or else we arent here it is study to find the most elementary of the considerations on which the other considerations depend in order to bring about situation where consideration itself can be altered by the group or by the individual with ease if you cannot alter consideration you cant have sanity you have stimulusresponse thinking unfortunately if everybody could alter every consideration which he ever had at any time you wouldnt have physical universe as far as we can tell that comes very close to the truth because using these principles we have gone long way l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture opening lecture history of dianetics and scientology this lecture is available in the universe processes congress thought being trapped by energy consideration and this universe universe processes congress universe processes congress what are these lectures about delivered in phoenix arizona in june of 1954 the universe processes congress was the culmination of eighteen months of intensive research by ron into techniques for exteriorization and the achievement of ot and the breakthrough he announced at the beginning of this congress was momentous because here was the discovery of the relationship of duplication to bridge progress if an auditor could not duplicate how could he deliver the tech and if preclear could not duplicate how could he do the process how could he exteriorize and go free here was the very key to entrapment on the whole track discovery so encompassing it provided the resolution for all cases and this opened the way to still more answers from how being creates space to how the material universe itself was created from why persons willingness to duplicate establishes his ability to communicate to why an exteriorized individual who can duplicate sees far better than anyone with mest eyes and finally to why any difficulty stems from persons unwillingness to duplicate here too were duplication processes delivered for the first time ever on group basis and introduced by ron with these words i have some phenomenal things never tried before to try out on you thus the congress experienced firsthand hours of processing personally from ron culminating in the universe processes the universe processes congress includes 14 lectures complete with transcripts an extensive glossary and guide with key lrh references which relate to the series the master glossary in the guide covers both the lectures and
