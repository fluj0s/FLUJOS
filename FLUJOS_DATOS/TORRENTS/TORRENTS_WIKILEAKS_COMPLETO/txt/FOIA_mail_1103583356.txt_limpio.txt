so dec 21 until dec 23 inclusive then again from jan 3 i will be checking email during the break from dec 28 onwards are you in control of the glossary additions and modifications as to change of base period this seems like decision for the whole of wgi to redo the global temperature average i can just move the series updown but this isnt the correct way to do it i should talk out new base period from all the individual stations and recalculate anomalies for the oceans for the oceans this isnt problem but the land it is serious problem many stations have good ie near complete base periods for 196190 but ill lose hundreds maybe over thousand stations if i went to 19812000 for both surface temperature and precipitation we dont have spatially complete datasets like models so it will be quite difficult for the circulation indices like soi and nao based on station pairs there is variance term sd some of the character of the series will change we could easily adjust all these series by simple offsetting but it isnt doing it properly im in the throws of project with the hc checking all the 6190 normals we have for series that are incomplete to ensure we dont have any biases this has taken quite time and i dont want to waste the effort the arguments of albert and dave make lot of sense continuity with the tar etc these sort of things can be explained but then the fod will not be compatible with all the papers we are referring to this will lead to lots of confusion i would like to stick with 196190 i dont want to change this until 19812010 is complete for 3 reasons 1 we need 30 years and 8110 will get all the msu in nicely and 2 i will be near retirement 3 is one of perception as climatologists we are often changing base periods and have done for years i remember getting number of comments when i changed from 195180 to 196190 if we go to more recent one the anomalies will seem less warm i know this makes sense scientifically but it gives the skeptics something to go on about if we do the simple way they will say we arent doing it properly best idea might be to show some maps of 19812000 minus 196190 to show spatially where it makes difference for temp and precip showing it is quite small and likely within the intermodel differences for years which are only nominally 19812000 this might keep both sides happy we also probably need to consider wgii also the paleo chapter will find 19812000 impossible 196190 is difficult for them but not insurmountable cheers phil ps fatima has received all the emails her email only came to not heard from some of our at 1544 20122004 kevin trenberth wrote hi all i have received comments on this from albert david dave and jim some below as i commented to jim the choice of base period affects the zero line in some of our plots namely the ones that have series of bars from the zero line to the anomaly value thereby infilling between the anomaly and the zero the zero base value is greatly emphasized this is in contrast to simple time series with points joined especially if the zero line is not also drawn in the latter case it is simple to move the axis up or down to fit with the new base period but it makes bigger difference to the bar plots now maybe that is comment on the use and utility of bar plots because the relative values do not change the choice also affects any anomaly plots for any subperiod but this is where the comparison with models is most likely to occur in this case there is spatial pattern to the offset namely the difference between means for 196190 and 19812000 we could also derive that difference for certain fields and provide it to modelers to enable comparisons with our plots for trends over certain subperiod this makes difference it seems that whatever we do we will need an extra appendix explaining some of this and perhaps even giving plots of these differences in the meantime let suggest to those of you making computations that you consider doing it both ways rather than having to go back and do it over later regards kevin i agree with albert this would make comparisons with the tar figures difficult dave klein tank albert wrote hi kevin my immediate response is that the choice for another base period will probably not affect our assessment of results but it will change all figures wrt the tar this will be difficult to communicate and will take much more space to explain albert original message subject re fwd re model mean climate for ar4 date mon 20 dec 2004 130644 0000 from parker david met office 1davidparkermetofficegovuk to kevin trenberth 2trenbertcgducaredu references 341c34cda3060304cgducaredu kevin it is obviously possible to use 19802000 though it would require some dataprocessing work the main objection is that anomalies of temperature would appear to be reduced relative to previous publications and readerspolicymakers could become confused minor objection is that 19802000 is bit short satellite data are of course in its favour in due course 19812010 will be ideal regards david on fri 20041217 at 2117 kevin trenberth wrote all please note the discussion below note the proposed base period of 19802000 can we get your reactions if it is decided to use this what difficulties would it create other comments kevin original message subject re model mean climate for ar4 date fri 17 dec 2004 141458 0700 from kevin

in chapter 3 is anomalies determined with respect to the 19611990 base period in observations there is strong emphsis on using 30 year periods and the more recent one 19712000 is not yet available we would need to discuss whether to try to switch to that it certainly wont be in any zod otherwise though we are placing lot of emphasis on trends from 1979 on the grounds for this are 1 the 197677 shift seems to be about when anthropogenic climate change took off prior to then we are under the realm of natural variability basically tar result and 2 1979 is when whole bunch of satellite data and other analyses like global reanalyses become much more reliable and global so 1979 is the closest proxy to 197677 if 19812000 is to be used it will of course include some climate perceptible climate change that may influence peceptions of anomalies but i agree there is lot to be said for consistency moreover it is manageable for observational data bases because of the satellite effects on obs it is important to start on or after 1979 and stop while we still have obs so for round numbers 19812000 makes most sense i think that was the conclusion we came to in trieste but it is not reflected in any material i have seen yet in our chapter phil is not available till after new year i believe regards kevin wood richard wrote dear jerry and other clas jerry would you be willing to do this please once some text is agreed all any comments on the proposed text esp from observational chapters re meaning periods an early response would be appreciated as if we send this to pis it needs to be done as soon as possible weve just had meeting of chapter 8 in san francisco one issue that came up was what period of what run to use for the analysis of the mean climate in the ar4 models for chapter 8 clearly we hope there will be number of diagnostic projects looking at the models over the next few months and the more uniformly that analysis can be done the better to cut long story short we felt that given the choice it would be most appropriate to define models mean climate by looking at the 19812000 mean from the all forcings 20th century runs or the ensemble mean if there is an ensemble that would be consistent with the base period chapter 10 is using for the projections we recognise that there could be all sorts of reasons why that is not appropriate in particular cases both scientific and practical eg the observational dataset covers another period or longer time mean is needed because of particular modes of variability or there is problem with model drift or trends so we wouldnt want to be prescriptive but all other things being equal we would suggest that as the analysis period if there are showstoppers for this we were thinking it would be good to send out brief email to the pis of the diagnostic projects to request that they bear this in mind in their analysis jerry there were few other topics that might be raised in such an email and karl taylor will contacting you about those to be definite i suggest below some strawman text that could be sent out thanks and best wishes richard defining model mean climate in defining the mean climate state of model for comparison against observations there are number of choices that could be made eg use model control runs which may have either preindustrial or present day trace gases or use the 20th century all forcings runs many of which are available as ensembles started from varying initial conditions for the 20th century integrations there is also choice of meaning period it is recognised that the optimal choice for given problem may depend on number of factors including the period over which obervations are available and the need for nondrifting or nontrending model solution we also recognise that some projects have already begun their analysis based on particular choice we therefore do not wish to prescribe solution to this problem and leave it to the judgement of individual projects however in cases where there is choice we wish to encourage as much uniformity in the analysis as possible and therefore propose that other things being equal model mean climate is defined based on the 19812000 period of the all forcings 20th centrury runs or the ensemble mean where appropriate richard wood met office fellow and manager ocean model evaluation met office hadley centre
