and there is also the obligation to require an export licence called an end use certificate for exports to nonstate parties it is currently be ing discussed in the opcw whether other kinds of

committee cwc issues for congress the cwc raises variety of issues fo r congressional consid eration although the vast majority of the worlds nations have signed the cwc some nations suspected of having chemical weapons have not egypt iraq libya north korea syria what effect does this lack of universality have upon the value of the convention the cwcs verification provi sions are extensive but they have not stilled the debate over whether they are eff ective enough to deter violations and if violations are detected are enforcemen t procedures and sanctions sufficiently stringent because the cwc extends its provisions to the civilian sector the impact of inspections reporting requi rements and export controls on commercial enterprise raises concerns unique to arms control trea ties the destruction of the us chemical weapon stockpile though c ongressionallymandated inde pendently of the cwc presents technical environmental and fi nancial challenges issues deserving attention can be grouped in six general ar eas 1 universality 2 verification 3 impact on us industry 4 enforcement 5 technology transfer 6 destruction of chemical weapons here and in russia and 7 costs universality how many nations are willing to ratify the cwc and more importantly which nations are not 153 nations have ratif ied the convention 24 nations have signed but not ratified the conven tion and 15 nations have not signed see appendix 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32158crs7 1 united states of america na tional statement to the first review conference of the chemical weapons convention april 28 2003 as delivered p 2examining the signatory list most are heartened to see china iran israel and russia nations known or believed to have or be developing significant cw capability however israel has not ratified the conve ntion and china iran and russia remain under suspicion with regard to compliance see verification and compliance some particularly troublesome nations such as iraq libya north korea and syria have not signed in addition number of middle eastern states notably egypt and jordan have refused to sign linking thei r participation to the removal of israels suspected nuclear capability at the april 2003 cwc review conferen ce the us delegation called for powerful incentives both positive and negative to those states remaining outside the convention to join pointing particul arly to libya north korea and syria1 critics of the cwc believe that its value is significantly reduced if all nations with the capability to develop and use chemi cal weapons are not pa rties particularly in region as volatile as the middle east the rationale is that even one nation having chemical weapons will create an incentive for its neighbors to follow suit they believe that it is unwise for the unite d states to relinquish its chemical weapons capability while other nations retain theirs some also maintain that the possibility of retaliation in kind ie with chemical weapons could be an important component of cw deterrence cwc supporters while agreeing to th importance of persuading all cwcapable nations to join believe that small number of holdouts does not pose sufficient threat to justify not ratifying the convention they note that in the first persian gulf war 19901991 the united stat forswore retaliation with chemical weapons even if iraq were to use them against coalition forces this decision was based on the assessment that the us arsenal was adequate for both limited or massive retaliation w ithout the use of chemical w eapons cwc supporters further argue that without the convention there w ould be even greater incentive to acquire chemical weapons and it would be easier to accomplish they assert that cwc now provides an international regime of export controls and widely accepted international norm to which all nations signatories or not can be held verification and compliance verification of compliance is undoubtedly the thorniest issue devising an acceptable verification regime was the most difficult task for cwc negotiators and is the most challenging for those imple menting the convention the cwc provides for the most intrusive and extensive verification regime of any arms control agreement to date the regime for the first time in arms control provides for routine monitoring and inspection not only of military facilities but also of certain civilian chemical facilities in ddition challenge inspection provisions expand compliance verification to suspect facilities of any sort the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons httpwwwopcworg oversees the conventions compliance verification httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32158crs8 2 united states of america na tional statement to the first review conference of the chemical weapons convention april 28 2003 as delivered p 4the most serious question is whether the opcw will be able to detect all clandestine production or st ockpiling of chemical wea pons ironically the cwcs supporters and detractors genera lly agree the answer is acknowledging that the verification regime will not be absolute carries differing significance for the conventions critics and advocates thos who question the conventions value believe that if compliance verification cannot be guaranteed and undetected cw possession may be possible the convention is not worth the cost and effort worse perhaps they are concerned that the convention would engender false sense of security they point out that in certain circumstances the selective use of relatively small amounts of chemical weapons coul d be significant milita rily particularly against unprotected personnel consequen tly wouldbe violators need not produce or stockpile vast amounts advocates argue that though cwc may be imperfect it can provide the most intrusive and extensive verification regime in the history of disarmament and represents notable improvement over curre nt cw nonprolifera tion regimes for signatories this fact could change the costbenefit analysis of cw production or stockpiling enough to deter violations provision for challenge inspections creates the likelihood that violations would beco public breaches of the international norm something not possible without the cwc the most difficult challenge is to detect existing chemical weapons that nation does not declare and continues to store clandestinely detecting illicit transfers of controlled chemicals is also challeng ing task covert production of chemical warfare agents and the subsequent manufacture of chemical munitions are higherprofile activities nd consequently more vulne rable to detection this assessment assumes that the opcw and signatories national intelligence resources will seek to uncover convention violators consequently the extent of intelligence sharing has significant impact on the cwcs effectiveness it is not clear however to what extent the states parties are sharing relevant intelligence information with the opcw it is possible that concerns over possible leaks or compromising intelligence sources have weighed more heavily than the desire to assist the opcw in its mission another factor that affects the opcw s verification capabilities is the amount and reliability of its funding by the conve ntions signatories without adequate funding to maintain the technological nd personnel resources necessary to monitor the international chemical industry and government activities the rigor of the verification regime suffers budgetary di fficulties have plagued the opcw for the last several years the united states has not supported requested budget increases in the past two years sought by the op cw administration to maintain inspection schedules but rather directed the opcw instead to establish more efficient appropriate costeffective approaches 2 however with new director general overseeing the opcw the united states has now approved an overall opcw budget increase of 67 for 2004 raising the total budget to 865 million in 2002 the united states negotiated reduction of its opcw dues to 22 of the operating budget which amounts to 1903 million for 2004 delinquent dues and

activities inconsistent with the cwc as follows china maintains an active offensive rd program possible cw stockpile and undeclared cwrelated facilities iran is retaining and modernizing elements of its cw program including rd an undeclared stockpile and an offensive production capability russia has not made complete declarations regarding cw production cw development fac ilities and cw agentsweapons sudan has established an offensive rd program at the cwcs first review conferen ce april 2003 assistant secretary of state for arms control stephe n rademaker reiterated us assertions against iran and sudan though secretary rade maker said that the opcw must not shrink from the task of confronting those st ates parties that are viola ting the convention the united states did not request formal opcw action regarding these allegations4 responding to those who questioned why the us did not avail itself of the cwcs challenge inspection provisions to addre ss its suspicions the us delegation maintained that challenge inspections woul d be ineffective in finding illicit weapons and could falsely exonerate nations5 specific reference was made to concerns over russia or china in secretary radema kers presentation to the opcw review conference with regard to russia the concerns over verification are primarily focused on russias failure to acknowledge research and development on binary chemical weapons binary chemical weapons use tw nonlethal chemicals that combine to form lethal agent after launching th united states worked on developing binary weapons sporadically from the 1950s ending the effort in 1992 when the signing of the cwc became imminent us intelligen ce has long believed that russia was undertaking similar program in 1992 russian scientist vil mirzayanov

continued the program after president gorbachev declared russias chemical weapons development at an end concern over this russian program rekindled in 1997 with the leaking of cl assified dod report to the press written at the us ground intelligence center the report supposedly maintains that the new agent can be manufactured in significant amounts in modified pesticide plants from chemicals not covered by the cwc washington times february 4 1997 p1 cwc opponents believe this in formation highlights the difficulties of verification and the lack of russian trustworthine ss cwc supporters have responded that without the cwc such program is legal but with the cwc and accession to it it would be illegal and suspect facilities would be subject to inspection the united states having specifically requested an accounting of the russian binary program and received inadequate responses is continuing discussions to resolve these discrepancies although the current data exchange is independent of the cwc russian recalcitrance on this issu could adversely affect support for the convention if russia is unwilling to be forthr ight in what is generally judged to be an open secret it raises the question of how seriously it considers the prohibitions of the cwc and consequently places greater emphasis on effective verification the bush administration has highlighted this point by its decision not to provide the certification of russias commitment to arms control upon which nunnlugar threat reduction aid is contingent unle ss russia provides further information on these programs see below chemi cal weapons stockp iles and facilities destruction impact on us industry many us enterprises do not meet the cwc threshold requirements for reporting and others may have minimal ob ligations eg onepage reports because of the nature of the chemicals they handl for the most part the heaviest burden annual reports on production consumptiontransfer nd at least one initial inspection falls upon enterprises that deal with substantial amounts of chemicals that could be very useful in the production of cw warfare agents implementing legislation for the cwc addr essed some

following the convention coming into force as noted earlier there is total ban on the export of chemicals on schedules 1 2 there are ongoing discussions on wh ether to apply this ban to schedule 3 chemicals in the near fu ture see above provisions of the chemical weapons convention the united states alread had variety of export controls on cwrelated chemicals quipment and technology6 these stem from both unilateral action and steps th united states has taken as member of the australia group ag7 the cwc export control provi sions have consequently not engendered significant controversy domestica lly the export control regime of the australia group remains an issue of contention with developing countries who maintain that it inhibits gitimate technology transfer and should not be applied to nations that are cwc states parties the australia group mbers have not found this argument persuasive nd remain convinced that th ag regime remains useful complement to the cwc particularly given that its control lists are more extensive than those negotiated for the convention httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32158crs12 enforcementsanctions the question of sanctions was addressed late in the cwc negotiations the consultative nature of the conventions provisions and the lack of specificity regarding sanctions to be levied against convention violators re flect the difficulty of those negotiations it is generally anticipated that international sanctions would consist of trade and perhaps arms em bargoes cwc critic s believe that its enforcement sanctions are too vague to be an effective deterrent they question the effectiveness of economic and arms embarg oes maintaining that 1 embargoes are almost impossible to enforce internationally 2 they historically have seldom achieved their foreign policy objectives and 3 if they are effective at all it is only over the long term cwc supporters argue that the lack of specificity regarding possible sanctions heightens potential vi olators uncertainty about breaking the convention they believe that this uncerta inty and the interna tional approbation that would be generated by the enforcement procedure will sufficiently affect the costbenefit analysis of chemical wea pons production to deter potential violator they also do not accept the assertion that in ternational sanctions are without effect maintaining that at minimum they significantly degrade nations ability to maintain cw program they point to the evidence that the international sanctions and inspection regime imposed upon iraq in the 1990s apparently stymied iraqs cw production and research to far greater extent than initially believed by many chemical weapons stockpiles and facilities destruction the cwc mandates the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities within 10 years of the conventions coming into force ie april 2007 the convention also specifies the order in which different types of weapons shall be destroyed nd interim deadlines clause permitting an extension of up to five years upon approval of the conference of state parties was included specifically in anticipation of russias not being able to meet the destruction deadline given its political and economic instability in the 1990s however now both russia and the united states have had to request extensions of both interim and final destruction deadlines u s chemical weapons destruction program in october the united states acknowledged that it would not be able to destroy 45 of its cw stockpile by the interim deadline of april 29 2004 of particular in terest is that the united states requested an extension of the 45 interim deadline to december 2007 full eight months after the conventions deadline for the destruction of the entire stockpile this request and its implication that the united states will not be able to meet the final destruction deadline of april 2007 reflects the many difficulties the destruction program has encountered over the last 18 years accepting that the united states is undertaking good faith ffort to destroy its stockpile on october 24 the eighth opcw conference of states parties approved th extension of the 45 deadline to december 2007 and the extens ion of the final deadline in principle with date specified these deadline extensions notwithstandi ng the united states

90 of the us chemical stockpile 28000 agent tons obsolete this decision coupled with 1985 congressional directive to destroy these munitions led dod to begin planning destruction program almost two decades ago nevertheless it is now entirely clear that the united states will be not able to meet the 2007 cwc deadline until very recently dod estimates have called for completing destruction on time but critics of the program have maintained for some time that these expectations were unrealistic indeed in october 1998 an independent analysis commissioned by dod and conducted by the arthur anderson firm estimated that none of the cw dest ruction facilities had even 5 chance of meeting their destruction deadlines dod re butted the audit maintaining that it was based on old data and did not re flect increased efficiencies8 in 2001 the controversy arose agai n when the senate appropriations subcommittee on defense obtained an internal army report operations schedule task force 2000final report that first indicated that it was doubtful that even an extended final deadline of 2012 could be met the report detailed the actual munition destruction rates at the johnst on atoll depot showing them to be much lower than previous official estimates and indicated that substantially the same destruction rates should be expected at ot her incineration facilities if so the cw stockpile destruction pr ogram would extend beyond 2014 dod initially contended that the report was worst case scenari but then the dod selected acquisition report released in april 2002 revealed an 80 increase in the destruction programs costs owing specifically to rev ised destruction ra tes and schedule extensions the task force 2000final report reflects the challenges at depots where

10 sustained leadership along with key strategi c management tools is needed to guide dods destruction program general accounting office september 2003 report gao031031 p 1general accounting office has issued several program assessments with the most recent continuing to emphasize significant administrative problems the chemical demilitarization program remains in turmoil because number of longstanding leadershi p organizational and strategic planning issues remain unresolved the program lacks stable lead ership at the upper management levels for example the program has had frequent turnover in the leadership providing oversight further recent reorganizations have done little to reduce the complex and fragmented organization of the program as result roles and responsibilities are often unclear and program actions are not always coordinated finally the absence of comprehensive strategy leaves the program without clear road map and methods to monitor program performance without these key elements dod and the army have assurance of meeting their goal to destroy the chemical stockpile in safe and timely manner and within cost estimates 10 gao issued several recommendations to improve program ma nagement eg establish longterm objectives define roles and responsibilities of dod and army offices and develop shortterm perfo rmance measures dod has concurred with those recommendations and s begun implementation ho wever given that the us request to the opcw for destruction deadline extensions left the date for final completion unspecified it would seem that uncertainty about the pace of the destruction progra m remains high difficulties that the united states has encountered with the chemical weapons destruction program have been reflected in the significant cost estimate growth since its inception in 1985 for example dod estimated the total program cost would be between 12 to 20 billion these cost estimates routinely increased reaching 132 billion in 2001 then in april 2002 ac knowledging the program delays noted above the department of defense selected acquisition report announced new 80 increase in the total cost estimate raising it to 237 billion for fy2004 the defense department requested to tal of 165 billion for the chemical demilitarization prog ram rd 251 milli on procurement 79 million operations maintenance 12 b illion

permit shchuchye funding only after dod certification that russia has agreed to provide 25 million annually for construction and operation russia has agreed to use the facility to destroy its four other nerveagent stockpiles the united states has obtained multiyear commitments from theinternational community to assist infrastructure improvement around shchuchye russia has agreed to destro its

and destruction of russias nerve agent stockpiles for fy2002 and fy2003 congress satisfied that sufficient progress has been made in meeting these conditions approved appropriation of 35 million and

the cwc conference of states parties has approved an extension of ru ssias interim deadline to destroy 20 of its stockpile to april 2007 and also agreed to an extens ion of subsequent deadlines in
