addition on march 9 2000 the treasury conducted its first buyback operation of outstanding treasury securities before maturity as of january 25 2002 the treasury had re purchased outstanding treasury securities with total par value of 635 billion this report examines these two methods of paying down the publicly held debt and discusses estimates of the publicly held debt that could not be retired by the end of fy2011 recent budget projections indicate that the us government will incur deficits in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 hence at least in the near term the publicly held debt will longer be paid down but instead will increase this report will not be updated beginning with fiscal year 1998 the federal government began running budget surpluses that is the flow of revenue into the us

the treasurys cash on hand exceeding its ability to retire debt held by the public hence cbos projections of the amount of publicly held debt simply assumed that the treasury would accumulat all funds exceeding the amounts needed to retire available debt5 methods of paying down the debt when the government first began running surpluse s in fy1998 the treasury used only one method to pay down the debtreducing new debt issuance today the treasury has another methodbuying back outstanding debt6 reduction and elimination of new debt issuance all publicly held debt eventually matures to reduce the debt outstanding the treasury issued smaller replacement issues issued securities less frequently and discontinued the issuance of particular maturities for example on may 6 1998 the treasury announced that it would stop issuing threeyear notes after may 1998 and that the auctions of fiveyea r notes would be changed to quarterly auctions from monthly auctions7 the dollar volume of new debt issued was less than the dollar volume of maturing debt consequently the dollar volume of outstanding publicly held debt declined buybacks of outstanding debt on august 4 1999 the treasury published for commen t proposed rules for permitting it to buy back outstanding debt securities before maturity lawrence h summers the secretary of the treasury stated that buyback of debt would offer the

what would otherwise be potentially costly and unjustified increase in the average maturity of our debt from just over five years to more than seven years on the current trajectory third by paying off debt we can absorb excess cash at times of the year when tax revenues exceed immediate spending needs this kind of absorption is an important part of sound debt management8 on january 13 2000 the treasury announc ed that during calendar year 2000 it would purchase outstanding treasury securities before maturity worth as much as 30 billion9 on january 19 2000 the treasury published its final

fy2011 because of different assumptions for example assumptions differed about the willingness of owners of treasury bonds to sell their bonds back to the federal government without being paid an unacceptably high premium the bush administration maintained that 1158 billion was nonretireable by the end of fy201114 of this total 790 billion was marketable debt consisting of 677 in coupon issues nonmat ured 10 and 30 year bonds and 113 billion in inflationindexed issues nonmatured 10 and 30 year bonds15 omb the office of management and budget estimates that it would cost between 50 150 billion in bonus payments to entice these holders to give up their bonds it makes more sense to let this debt mature naturally leaving the nation on glide path to zero debt after 201116 the other 368 billion was nonmarketable debt consisting of savings bonds 170 billion state and local government series 86 billion bonds backing up emerging market brady bonds maturing between 20192023 19 billion bonds issued as part of the savings and loan cleanup maturing between 20192030 30 billion and other debt 63 billion17 the congressional budget office projected that 818 billion was nonretireable by the end of fy201118 cbo assumed that after 2002 the magnitude of the treasurys debt buyback effort would decline because most holders of outstanding 30year bonds would not sell them at prices that the government is willing to pay19 cbo assumed that nonmarketable debt for example savings bonds or securities issued to state and local governmen ts that serves other purposes besides financing government activities would continue to be issued20 lastly cbo assumed that debt with maturity of five years or more will be issued after 200221 on march 2 2001 alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board of governors testified before the house budget committee that as of january 1 there was in excess of three quarters of trillion dollars in outstanding nonmarketable securities such as savings bonds and state and local serieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20302crs5 22 testimony of alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board of governors before the house budget committee on march

2011 some holders of longterm treasury securities may be reluctant to give them up especially those who highly value the risk free status of those issues inducing such holders including foreign holders to willingly offer to sell their securities prior to maturity could require paying premiums that far exceed any realistic value of retiring the debt before maturity22 but gary gensler former treasury undersecretary for domestic finance during the clinton administration stated that close to 30 trillion of the currently outstanding 34 trillion in publicly held debt could be paid off leaving outstanding between 410 and 500 billion in debt at the end of ten years i believe that treasury can achieve this in the future by 1 allowing the vast majority of this debt to mature as it comes due 2 making various changes to debt management policies over time and 3 smoothly repurchasing over time the majority of treasurys long term debt at market level prices23 he maintained that the treasury could discontinue issuance of any new longerterm debt continue to buy back longterm debt and begin exchanging shortterm debt for longterm outstanding debt24 furthermore he stated that the treasury could discontinue issuing special nonmarketable securities for state and local governments which then would invest in alternative debt instruments25 lastly he asserted that the thrift savings plan for federal employees equivalent to 401k program could replace its treasury securities fund option with new private bond fund26 return of deficits during fiscal year 2001 the us government had budget surplus of 127 billion which was below cbo and omb projections for three primary reasons first in march 2001 recession started that lowered revenues and raised expenditures second revenue growth was reduced by tax cuts in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 which was signed by president bush in june 2001 third the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 had negative effects on the budget and further lowered the surplus at the end of fiscal year 2001 all three of these factors have carried over into fiscal year 2002 on january 23 2002 dan l crippen

security29 he indicated that the federal budget would incur deficit of 106 billion for fiscal year 2002 and 80 billion for fiscal year 200330 mitch daniels director of omb said that the return of deficit spending would cause the federal governments pay down of the debt to be stopped temporarily31 both cbos baseline projections and ombs budget proposals indicate that surpluses reoccur consequently within several years the treasury may again begin reducing the publicly held debt
