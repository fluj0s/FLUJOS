leelanau talk blog my prefect resignation letter november 14th 2008 tags leelanau school letter prefect leave comment trackback near the start of third quarter i quietly resigned from my position of prefecture why because i realized that by being prefect i was putting myself above others the school had made it very clear to that i was not to cause any more disturbances or engage in politics so i didnt make big deal out of it or publish the letters while i think i did my duties well i didnt want to be doing them at all i wasnt member of the kindel dorm anymore and it wasnt my right to go around telling people to do their areas especially when other prefects were getting paid to let kids off the hook even before it wasnt my right when i joined the prefecture program part of my goal was to make it more equitable which i think i did by doing areas when the guys in my group did them often doing more than them i hope this set an example for future prefects to ms semanco head of prefecture program mr friley director of resedential life mr sonnenberg kindel head of house from alex bryan i appreciate the opportunity you have given to be prefect this year and for maintaining my status as prefect despite political differences as you know i have given up my life of political activism and i am now only engaging in political activity outside of school i do not believe that i adequately fill the roll as prefect i am writing this letter to tell you that i have decided to give up my status as prefect staring second semester since i left kindel i have quickly become alienated from it and my status as prefect is often confusing to the residents of kindel prefects are meant to be respected members of the dorm community who naturally fall into leadership roles i am longer member of the kindel community and i believe my status as prefect dilutes the programs original intentions students need person who they live with and i just cant bring that to the prefect program i have heard that there will be new prefect installed in algonquin and that joe has been groomed for the position because of the mixture of students placed in this dorm it has become hightension area and i constantly am aware of it due to my rooms proximity to the common area my last action as prefect and therefore informal representative of students is to strongly urge you not to make joe prefect in algonquin i do not think joe would be good prefect because he does not have the respect of the other members of the dorm the main issue i feel and observe is that joe does not give the same respect to other residents that he already expects and would expect more of if he were to be chosen as prefect at the prefect orientation meeting this year we were told that things would be different and they have the prefect title carries weight among students and longer means somebody who can get away with things because they played their cards right the previous year i was also told at the meeting that prefects were not to be administrators pets the community watch or anything along those lines but rather members of the community that naturally fell into leadership roles whom other dorm residents respected by setting good examples students would start to look up to prefects and take on leadership roles as well to joe would be that extension of the staff that many prefecture programs in other schools have i believe the community member model is much more effective and helps foster bonds between dorm members these bonds lead to working collaboratively and mutual respect other students may tell different story to you and i hope that you will listen to everybodys views and make the best decision possible i do not know who to suggest for prefecture or even if algonquin needs prefect however i do believe that algonquin needs dorm meetings for algonquinonly issues if prefect is to be chosen for algonquin then i believe john wilt is good candidate he has the respect of the other members of the dorm because of the way he treats them and handles dorm life i do not know how well he does with leadership roles or if he is interested in the position that is for you to evaluate i hope this letter has come soon enough for you to find replacement for and that prefecture continues to represent what it has represented this year to myself and other students this year i am willing to sit down and discuss things with you individually or as group if need be sincerely alex after i sent the letter not single word was spoken to about the prefecture program prefects get away with hell of lot so its good position to be in but its not right to make others do work against their will hopefully somebody got some joy out of this blog posting just putting it up so things can be more
