announcement of opportunity from international arctic research center and cooperative institute for arctic research university of alaska fairbanks the general theme is global change research in the arctic full text with description is attached bellow as we have read research themes from announcement they seem to be very congenial to our laboratory what do you think about this is there point in submitting proposal to iarc and cifar at the university of alaska fairbanks research theme would be 5000 year summer air temperature reconstruction from tree rings and impacts and consequences of global climate change on forest ecosystems in the polar ural and yamal peninsula subarctic regions of russia we have wide experience to submit proposal to any foreign administration we need in some advice could you give us piece of good advice how to do this well the questions are 1 we are not sure whether this action and theme is contrary to our future cooperative work 2 if not how big our chance to get award 3 could we submit proposal from our institute only without us partner proposals from foreign institutions should preferably have us partner see description bellow if us partner should be who in your opinion would be best regards stepan from arcticinfo arcticinfomailarcusorg to arcticinfoarcusorg subject iarc announcement of opportunity for more information on these research
