than 45 million cbo also specifies the number of these estimated new enrollees who were pr eviously uninsured and who had private coverage of the 26 million in fy2012 cbo estimates 15 million would be from the previously uninsured and 12 million would be from those who had private coverage the two numbers do not add to 26 million due to rounding 2 of the 22 million cbo estimates that 17 million would be previously uninsured compared to 04 million who had private coverage the percentage of new enrollees coming from private coverage is lower than in the sc hip estimates in the previous footnote because medicaid enrollees tend to be lower income nd therefore less likely to have been enrolled continueds 1893hr 976 the childrens health insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 on

lowincome children hereafter referred to as existing schip parent coverage waivers the 11 states with cms approval for such waivers would be permitted to use federal schip funds to continue such c overage during fy2008 and fy2009 states with existing schip parent coverage waivers would be permitted to continue such assistance during each of fiscal years 2010 2011 and 2012 subject to the following requirements 1 the secr etary would be required to set aside an amount as part of separate allotment equal to the fe deral share of 110 of the states projected expenditures for providing waiver coverage to such individuals enrolled in the waiver in the applicable fiscal year and 2 the secretary would pay the state from the set aside amount specified above for each such fiscal year an amount equal to the applicable percentage for expenditures in the quarter to provide coverage as specified under the waiver to pa rents of targeted lowincome children in the case of fy2012 only the set aside am ount for such states would be computed separately for the period beginning on oc tober 1 and ending on march 31 and the period beginning on april 1 and ending on september 30 any increase or reduction in the amount of the semi nnual allotments described bove would be allocated on pro rata basis to such set aside in addition the senate bill would require that such payments would be made for providing parent coverage to individuals whose family income exceeds the income eligibility threshold that was in place under the existing parent coverage waiver as of the date of enactment of the childrens health insurance program reau thorization act of 2007 in fy2010 only costs associated with ch parent coverage would be subject to each such states schip enhanced fmap for states that meet certain coverage benchmarks related to performance in pr oviding coverage to children in fy2009 or each such states medicaid fmap rate for all other states the provision would prohibit federal matchi

would be equal to the sum of the states fmap per centage and b the number of percentage points equal to onehalf of the difference between the states fmap rate and the states enhanced fmap rate if the state meets certain coverage benchmarks related to performance in providing coverage to children for the preceding fiscal year or 2 the states regular medicaid fmap rate if the state failed to meet the specified coverage benchmarks for the preceding fiscal year the provision would prohibit federal matching payments fo r the payment of services beyond the setaside spending cap finally the senate bill w ould require the government accountability office to conduct study to determine if the coverage of parent caretaker relative or legal guardian of targeted lowincome child increases the enrollment of or quality of care for children and if such parents relatives and legal guardians are more likely tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs11 enroll their children in schip or medicai d results of the study and recommended changes would be reported to congress two years after the date of enactment state option to cover lowi ncome pregnant women under schip through state plan amendment under current schip law states can c over pregnant women ages 19 and older in one of two ways 1 via special wa iver of program rule s through section 1115 waiver authority or 2 by providing coverage to unborn children as permitted through regulations in the latter case coverage includes prenatal and delivery services only s 1893hr 976 allows states to pr ovide optional cove rage under schip to pregnant women when specific conditions are met including for example 1 the upper income eligibility leve l for certain pregnant wo men under traditional medicaid must be at least 185 fpl 2 in deter mining eligibility for schip states must not apply any preexisting condition or waiting period restrictions and 3 the state must provide the same costsharing protections applicable to schip children and all cost sharing incurred by pregnant women must be capped at 5 of annual family income in addition costsharing would be allowe d for pregnancyrelated services states choosing this new optional c overage may also temporarily enroll such women for up to two months until formal determinati on of eligibility is made the upper income limit for this new coverage group is the upper income standard applicable to schip children in the state other eligibility restrictions for children under schip also apply to this new group of pregnant women ie must be uninsured ineligible for state employee coverage etc pregnancyrelated assistance would incl ude all services covered under schip for children in state as well as prenatal delivery and postpartum care also children born to these pregnant women w ould be deemed eligible for medicaid or schip as appropriate and w ould be covered up to age 1 limitation on matchi ng rate for states that exceed 300 percent of the poverty line the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most medicaid service expend itures it is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average and vice versa it has statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 the enhanced fmap efmap for schip equals states medicaid fmap increased by the number of percenta ge points that is equal to 30 of the difference between states fmap and 100 for example in states with an fmap of 60 the efmap equals the fmap in creased by 12 percentage points 60 30 multiplied by 40 percentage points 72 efmaps can range from 65 to 85 in determining the amount of income th at counts for eligibility purposes there are two types of income disregards used by states the first type is exclusions of particular dollar amounts or ty pes of income or certain expenses such as child carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs12 expenses nearly every state uses such disr egards in schip these disregards often mirror the disregards in states medi caid programs although an individuals gross family income may be above the states upperincome eligib ility level for schip the person may qualify because his or her net family income taking into account the states disregards falls below the u pperincome threshold the schip statute provides flexibility for states to use such disregards the second type of income disregard is when state excludes an entir block of percentofpoverty income for example new jerseys schip program covers children with net family income up to 200 of poverty the state excludes all family income between 200 and 350 of poverty as result children with gross family income up to 350 of poverty may be eligible for the states schip program under the senate bill for child health assistance or health benefits coverage furnished in any fiscal year beginning w ith fy2008 to targeted lowincome children whose effective family income would exceed 300 of the poverty line but for the application of general exclusion of block of income that is not determined by type of expense or type of income states would be reimbursed using the fmap instead of the efmap an exception would be provided for states that on the date of enactment have an approved state plan ame ndment or waiver or have enacted state law to submit state plan amendment to cover targeted lowincome children above 300 of the poverty line title ii outreach and enrollment grants for outreach and enrollment under current law title xxi specifies that federal schip funds can be used for schip health insurance coverage called child health assistance which meets certain requirements apart from these benefit pa yments schip payments for four other specific health care activities can be made including 1 other child health assistance for targeted lowincome children 2 health services initiatives to improve the health of schip children and other lowincome children 3 outreach activities and 4 other reasonable administrative costs for given fiscal year payments for other specific health care activities cannot exceed 10 of the total amount of expenditures for schip benefits and other specific health care activities combined s 1893hr 976 would set aside 100 million during the period of fiscal years 2008 throug h 2012 to establish new grant program under schip to finance outreach and enrollment efforts that increase participation of eligible children in both medicaid and schip such amounts would be in addition to amounts appropriated for schip allotments to states would remain available until expended and would not be subject to current law restricti ons on expenditures for outreach activities for such period the senate b ill would require that 10 of the f unding be dedicated to national enrollment campaig n and10 would be tside for grants for outreach to and enrollment of children who are indians the remaining grant funds would be distributed by the secretary to specified entities including states local governments communitybased organi zations and federal health safety nethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs13 organizations to conduct outreach campaigns that target geographic areas with high rates of eligible but not enrolled children who reside in rural areas or racial and ethnic minorities and health disparity popul ations grant funds would also be targeted at proposals that address cultura l and linguistic barriers to enrollment states that are awarded outreach and enrollment grants would be required to meet maintenance of effort requirement with regard to th state share of funds spent on outreach and enrollment activ ities under the schip state plan in the preceding fiscal year and state matching funds w ould be required for th state to receive an outreach and enrollment grant finally th senate bill would provide the greater of 75 or the sum of the enhanced fmap for the state plus five percentage points for translation and interpretati on services under schip by individuals for whom english is not their primary language increased outreach and rollment of indians s 1893hr 976 encourages states to take steps to enroll indians residing in or near reservations in medicaid and schip these steps may include outstationing of eligibility workers at certain hospitals and federally qualified health centers entering into agreements with indian entities ie the ihs tribes tribal organizations to provide outreach educa tion regarding eligibility benefits and enrollment and translation services the secretary would be required to facilitate cooperation between states and indian entitie s in providing benefits to indians under medicaid and schip certain nonbenefit payments under sc hip eg for other child health assistance health service initiatives out reach and program ad ministration cannot exceed 10 of the total amount of expend itures for benefits and these nonbenefit payments combined the senate bill would exclude from this 10 cap the expenditures for outreach to potentially eligible indian children and families demonstration program to permit states to rely on findings by an express lane agency to determine components of childs eligibility for medicaid or schip medicaid law and regulations contain re quirements regarding determinations of eligibility and applications for assistance in limited circumstances outside agencies are permitted to determine eligibility for medicaid for example when joint tanfmedicaid application is used the state tanf agency may make the medicaid eligibility determin ation medicaid applicants must attest to the accuracy of the information submitted on their applications and sign application forms under penalty of perjury the senate bill would create threeyear demonstration program that would allow up to ten states to use express lane eligibility determinations at medicaid and schip enrollment and renewal the demonstration would authorize and appropriate 44 million for the period of fy2008 through fy2012 for systems upgrades and implementation of this amount 5 million would be dedicated to an independent evaluation of the demonstration for the congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs14 the demonstration would allow states th option to rely on finding made by an express lane agency within the preceding 12 months to determine whether child has met one or more of the eligibility requirements eg income assets citizenship or other criteria necessary to determine an individuals eligibility for medicaid or schip the senate bill does not relieve states of their obligation to determine eligibility for medicaid and would require the state to inform families that they may qualify for lower premium payments or more comprehensive health coverage under medicaid if the familys income were direc tly evaluated by the state medicaid agency express lane agencies would include public agencies determined by the state as capable of making eligibility deter minations such as public agencies that determine eligibility under tanf schip dicaid food stamps head start the school lunch programs the child nutrition pr ograms etc also included are state specified governmental agenci that have fiscal liability or legal responsibility for the accuracy of eligibility determination findi ngs and public agencies that are subject to an interagency agreement limiting the disclosure and use of such information for eligibility determination purposes the senate bill would explicitly exclude programs run through title xx social services block grants of the social security act and private forprofit organizations as agencies that would qualify as an express lane agency other key components of this provisi on in the senate bill would drop the requirement for signatures under penalty of perjur and permit signature requirements for medicaid application to be satisfied through an electronic signature error rates associated with incorrect eligibility determinations would also be monitored under the demonstrations authorization of certain information disclosure to simplify health coverage determinations under current law each state must have an income and eligibility verification system under which 1 applicants fo r medicaid and several other specified government programs must furnish their social security numbers to the state as condition for eligibility and 2 wage information from various specified government agencies is used to verify eligibility an d to determine the amount of the available benefits subsequent to initial application states must request information from other federal and state agencies to verify applicants income resources citizenship status and validity of social security number unearned income unemployment information etc s 1893hr 976 would authorize federal or state agencies or private entities with data sources that are directly relevant for the termination of eligibility under medicaid to share such information with the medicaid agency if 1 there is family objection to such disclosure 2 the data would be used solely for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility and 3 there is an interagency agreement in place to prevent the unauthorized use or disc losure of such information individuals involved in such unauthorized use would be subject to criminal penalty in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs15 for the purposes of the express lane demons tration states only the provision would allow the medicaid and schip programs to receive such data from 1 the national new hires database 2 the national income data collected by the commissioner of social security or 3 data about enrollment in insurance that may help to facilitate outreach and enrollment under medicaid schip and certain other programs title iii removal of barriers to enrollment verification of declaration of citizenship or nationality for purposes of eligibility for medicaid and schip under current law noncitizens who apply for full medicaid benefits have been required since 1986 to present documentation that indicates satisfactory immigration status due to recent changes citizens and nationals also must present documentation that proves citizenship and documents personal identity in order for states to receive federal medicaid reimburse ment for services provided to them this citizenship documentation requirement was included in the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 and modified by the tax relief and h ealth care act of 2006 pl 109432 before the dra states could accept selfdeclaration of citizenship for medicaid although some chose to require additional supporting evidence the citizenship documentati on requirement is outlined under section 1903x of the social security act and pplies to medicaid elig ibility determinations and redeterminations made on or after july 1 2006 the law specifies documents that are acceptable for this purpose and ex empts certain groups from the requirement it does not apply to schip however since some states use the same enrollment procedures for all medicaid and schip applicants it is possible that some schip enrollees would be asked to present evidence of citizenship the senate bill would provide new option for meeting citizenship documentation requirements as part of its medicaid stat plan and with respect to individuals declaring to be us citizens or nationals for purposes of establishing medicaid eligibility state would be required to provide that it satisfies existing medicaid citizenship documentation rule s under section 1903x of the social security act or new rule s under section 1902dd unde r section 1902dd state could meet its medicaid state plan requirement for citizenship documentation by 1 submitting the name and social security number ssn of an individual to the commissioner of social security as part of plan established under specified rules and 2 in the case of an individual whos name or ssn is invalid notifying the individual providing him or her with pe riod of 90 days to either present evidence of citizenship as defined in section 1903x or cure th invalid determination with the commissioner of social security and disenrolling the individual within 30 days after the end of the 90day period if evidence is not provided states would receive 90 reimbursement for costs attributable to the design developm ent or installation of such mechanized verification and information retrieval systems as the secretary determines are necessary to implement name and ssn validation and 75 for the operation of such systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs16 the legislation would also clarify requirements under the existing section 1903x it would add additional documen tation options for federallyrecognized indian tribes require states to provide citizens with the same reasonable opportunity to present evidence that is provided to noncitizens who must present evidence of satisfactory immigration status provide permanent exemption for children who are deemed eligible for medicaid coverage by virtue of being born to mother on medicaid clarify that deemed eligib ility applies to children born to noncitizen women on emergency medicaid and require separate identifi cation numbers for children born to these women in order to receive reimbursement for an individual who has or is declared to be us citizen or national for purposes of establishing schip eligibility state would be required to meet the medicaid state plan requirement for citizenship documentation described above the 90 and 75 reim bursement for name and ssn validation would be av ailable under schip and would not count towards states schip administrative expenditures cap except for clarifications made to the existing citizenship documentation requirement which would be retroactive the provisi on would be effective on october 1 2008 states would be allowed to provide retroactive eligibility for certain individuals who had been determined ineligible under previous citizenship documentation rules reducing administrative barriers to enrollment during the implementation of schip states instituted variety of enrollment facilitation and outreach strategies to bring eligible children into medicaid and schip as result substantial progress was made at the state level to simplify the application and enrollment pr ocesses to find enroll nd maintain eligibility among those eligible for the program the senate bill would require the state plan to describe the procedures used to reduce the administrative barriers to the enrollment of children and pregnant women in medicaid and schip and to ensure that such procedures are revised as often as the state determines is appropriate to reduce newly identified barriers to enrollment title iv reducing barriers to providing premium assistance additional state option for pr oviding premium assistance under medicaid state medicaid programs may pay medicaid beneficiarys share of costs for group employerbased h ealth coverage for any medicaid enrollee for whom coverage is available comprehensive and costeffective for the state an individuals enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost effective if paying the premiums deductibles coin surance and other costsharing obligations of the employer plan is less expensive than the st ates expected cost of directly providinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs17 medicaidcovered services states were also to provide coverage for those medicaid covered services that are not included in the private plans under schip the secretary has the au thority to approve funding for the purchase of family coverage under an em ployersponsored health insurance plan if it is cost effective relative to the am ount paid to cover only the targeted low income children and does not substitute fo r coverage under group health plans that would otherwise be provided to the childre n in addition states using schip funds for employerbased plan premiums must ensure that schip minimum benefits are provided and schip costsharing ceilings are met because of these requirements implementation of premium assistance programs under medicaid and schip are not wi despread in august 2001 the bush administration introduced the health insurance flexibility and accountability hifa initiative under the section 1115 waiv er authority under hifa states were to direct unspent schip funds to exte nd coverage to uninsured populations with annual income less than 200 fpl and to use medicaid and schip funds to pay premium costs for waiver enrollees who have access to employer sponsored insurance esi this resulted in an incr eased emphasis on states use of the section 1115 waiver authority to offer premium assistance for employerbased health coverage in lieu of full dicaid andor schip coverage esi programs approved under the section 1115 waiver authority are not subject to the same current law constraints required under medicaids hea lth insurance premium payment hipp program or schips family coverage variance option ie the comprehensiveness and costeffectiveness tests the senate bill would allow states to offer premium assistance subsidy for qualified employer sponsored coverage to all targeted lowincome children who are eligible for child health assistance and have access to such coverage or to parents of targeted lowincome children qualified employer sponsored coverage would be defined as group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer that 1 qualifies as credible h ealth coverage as group health plan under the public health service act 2 for which the employer contributes at least 40 toward the cost of the premium and 3 is nondiscriminatory in manner similar to section 105hof the internal revenue code but would not allow employers to exclude workers who had less than three years of service qualified employer sponsored insurance explicitly excludes 1 benefits provided under health flexible spending arrangement 2 high deductible health plan purchased in conjunction with health savings account as define d in the internal revenue code of 1986 the senate bill would establish new cost effectiveness test for employer sponsored insurance esi programs gr oup health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer would be considered qualified employer sponsored coverage if the stat establishes that 1 the cost of such coverage is less than the expenditures that the state would have made to enroll the child or the family as applicable in schip or 2 the stat establishes that the aggregate amount of state expenditures for the purchase of all such coverage for targeted lowincome children under schip including adminis trative expenses does not exceed the aggregate amount of expenditures that th state would have made for providing coverage under the schip state plan for all such children httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs18 states would be required to provide supplemental coverage for each targeted lowincome child enrolled in the esi plan consisting of items or services that are not covered or are only partially covered and costsharing protections consistent with the requirements of schip states would be permitted to directly pay outofpocket expenditures for costsharing imposed unde r the qualified esi coverage and collect all or any portion for costsharing imposed on the family parents would be permitted to disenroll their children from esi coverage and enroll them in schip coverage effective on the first day of any month for which the child is eligible for such coverage the senate bill would also allow states to provide premium assistance subsidies for enrollment of targeted lowincome ch ildren in coverage under group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer if it is determined that such coverage is actuarially equi valent to schip benchmark be nefits coverage or schip benchmarkequivalent cove rage plans that meet the schip benefit coverage requirements would not be required

and deadlines for states in implementing any corrective action plans special provisions would apply to states for which the perm requirements were first in effect under interim final rule s for fy2007 or fy2008 and their application depends on when the final perm rule is in effect for all states the senate bill would also require the secretary to review the medicaid eligibility quality control meqc requirements with the perm requirements and coordinate consistent implementation of both sets of requirements while reducing redundancies for purposes of determining the errone ous excess payments ratio applicable to the state unde r meqc state may elect to substitute data resulting from the application of perm after the final perm rule is in effect for all states for the data used for the meqc requirements the secretary would also be required to establish statespecific sample sizes for application of the perm requireme nts to schip for fy2009 forward in establishing such sample sizes the s ecretary must minimize the administrative cost burden on states under medicaid and schip and must maintain state flexibility to manage these programs elimination of counting medicaid presumptive eligibility costs against title xxi allotment the senate bill would strike the language in existing schip statute that sets the federal share of costs incurred during periods of presumptive eligibility for children ie up to two months of coverage while final determination of eligibility is made at the medicaid matching rate and also would strike the language that allows payment out of schip allotments for medicaid benefits received by medicaid children during periods of presumptive eligibility deficit reduction act technical correction benchmark benefits under schip states ma provide coverage under the medicaid programs create new separate schip program or both under separate schip programs states may elect any of th ree benefit options 1 benchmark plan 2 benchmarkequivalent plan or 3 any other plan that the secretary deemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs24 would provide appropr iate coverage for the target population benchmark plans include 1 the

immunizations as well as dental vision and hearing serv ices in addition epsdt guarantees access to all federally coverable services nece ssary to treat problem or condition among eligible individuals the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 gave states the option to provide medicaid to stat especified groups through enrollment in benchmark and benchmarkequivalent coverage that is nearly iden tical to plans available under schip for any child under age 19 in one of the major ma ndatory and optional eligibility groups in medicaid wraparound benefits to the dra benchmark and benchmarkequivalent coverage includes epsdt in traditional medicaid epsdt is available to most individuals under age 21 the senate bill would require that psdt be covered for any individual under age 21 who is eligible for medicaid throug h the state medicaid plan under one of the major mandatory and optional coverage groups and is enrolled in benchmark or benchmarkequivalent plans authorized under dra the provision would also give states flexibility in providing coverage of epsdt services through the issuer of benchmark or benchm arkequivalent cove rage or otherwise in addition the secretary would be required to publish in the federal register and on the internet website of cms list of the provisions in title xix that the secretary has determined do not apply in order to enable state to carry out state plan amendment to provide benchmark or benchmarkequivale nt coverage under medicaid in such publications the secretary must also provide the reason for each such determination the ffective date would be the same as the original dra provisions ie march 31 2006 elimination of confusing program references the senate bill would repeal the section in pl 106113 that directed the secretary of hhs or any other federal officer or employee with respect to references to the program under title xxi in any publi cation or official communication to use the term schip instead of chip and to use the term state childrens health insurance program instead of child rens health insurance program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs25 thus for official publication and communication purposes s 1893hr 976 would reinstate chip and childrens hea lth insurance program as appropriate when referencing title xxi mental health pari ty in schip plans in 1996 congress passed the mental health parity act mhpa that established new federal standards for ment health coverage offered by group health plans most of which are employmentbased unde r provisions included in the 1997 balanced budget act pl 10533 medicaid manage d care plans and schip programs must comply with the requirements of mhpa medicaid expansions under schip follow medicaid rules thus when such expansions provide for enrollment in medicaid managed care plans the mhpa applies separate state pr ograms under schip follow schi p rules that have broader application than the medicaid rules in separate state schip programs to the extent that health insurance issuer offers group health insurance coverage which can include but is not limited to managed care the mhpa applies under mhpa medicaid and schip plans may define what constitutes mental health benefits if any the mhpa pr ohibits group plans from imposing annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage that are more restrictive than those applicable to medical and surgical coverage full parity is not required that is group plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limits eg with respect to total number of outpatient visits or inpatient days or costs haring requirements on mental health coverage compared to their medical and surgical services the senate bill would ensure that the financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to mental health or substance abuse benefits when such benefits are covered are more restrictive than the financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered under the state schip plan stat schip plans that include coverage of epsdt services as defined in medicaid st atute would be deemed to satisfy this mental health pa rity requirement dental health grants the senate bill would include authority for new dental health grants for programs and activities designed to improve the availability of dental services and strengthen dental coverage for children under schip among several requirements to be awarded such grant states would describe quality and outcomes performance measures to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of grant activities and must assure that they will cooperate with the collecti on and reporting of data to the secretary of hhs grantees would be required to mainta in

year th at facilitates pooling mechanisms including pooling across state lines and provides assi stance to small businesses and individuals including financial assistance and tax incentives for the purchase of private insurance coverage demonstration projects rela ting to diabet prevention the senate bill would create new demons tration project to fund up to 10 states over three years for

projected to face shortfalls based on their november 2006 projections 10 this provision affects only north carolinaappendix on july 30 2007 crs produced congressional distribution memorandum that showed projected fy2008 federal schip allotments as well as projected federal schip spending and balan ces based on s 1893hr 976 this appendix contains the descriptions and projections included in that memorandum these estimates are based on states own projections of fede ral schip spending submitted in may 2007 states will submit updated projections in august 2007 upon which the allotments under the senate bill would be partly based thus the actual amounts will vary from those shown here currently projected fy2008 s chip allotments based on s 1893hr 976 for fy2008 the senate bill appropriates 9125 billion to schip the states and territories schip allotment from thes funds are determined through new schip formula both the territories and the states llotments in fy2008 rely at least partially on fy2007 amounts for example fy2007 federa l schip spending or allotments an annual adjustment is calculated to raise the fy2007 amounts to fy2008 levels this annual adjustment for health care cost growth and child population growth is the product of 1 plus the percentage incr ease if any in the projected per capita spending in the national health ex penditures for 2008 over 2007 and b 101 plus the percentage change in the child populati on in each state except for the territories for which the national amount is used as of july 1 2008 over 2007 base d on the most timely and accurate published estimates from the census bureau for fy2008 states allotment is calculated as 110 of the greatest of the following four amounts with the curren tly projected amount for each shown in columns b through of table 1 1 the states fy2007 federal schip spending multiplied by the annual adjustment 2 the states fy2007 federal schip allotment multiplied by the annual adjustment 3 am ong states that were determined in fy2007 to have exhausted their own federa l schip allotments s hortfall states for fy20079 the states fy2007 projected spending as of november 2006 or as of may 2006 for state whose may 2006 projection was 95 million to 96 million higher than its november 2006 projection10 multiplied by the annual adjustment and 4 the states fy2008 federal schip projected spending as of august 2007 and certified by the state to the secretary not later than september 30 2007 for fy2008 each territorys allotment is its high est annual federal schip spending between fy1998 and fy2007 multip lied by the annual adjus tment for health care cost growth and national child population growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs30 11 the congressional budget office cbo has projected federal schip outlays at 78 billion in fy2008 under the chairmans mark that actual spending as projected by cbo is less than the amounts made available to the states and the territories through the allotments in fy2008 is due to the structure of the allotment formula eg 110 of the greatest of the numbers described earlier 12 if the 9125 billion were insufficient eg if states august 2007 submission of projected expenditures were markedly higher than the may submission the states allotments would be calculated differently as described in the chairmans mark because the current projections show the appropriation amount as fficient those calculations are not used in this memorandumthe last column in table 1 shows the currently projected federal fy2008 schip allotments under the sena bill these were calculated by using projected fy2007 and fy2008 federal schip spending s ubmitted by the states to the centers for medicare and medicaid rvices cms in may 2007 or earlier if the senate bill so specifies actual fy2008 allotments under the nate bill would be based in part on projections that will be provided later eg states august 2007 submission to cms those later projecti ons may reflect other policy changes from the senate bill eg increased spending ligible for qualifying states under section 2105g of the social security act per the provision in section 111 of the bill that permits such spending from all available allotments removes the 20 cap and permits such spending on behalf of children enrolled in medicaid with income as low as 133 of poverty in addition states later projections may differ for example because of more recent information on the states payments for services on behalf of schip enrollees or due to expansions of schip coverage recently enacted by states and approved by cms that were not re flected in the may 2007 submission as result the actual allotments will vary from those currently projected as shown in the last column of table 1 the available information from states the census bureau and cms leads to pr ojected fy2008 federal schip allotments totaling approxima tely 88 billion11 thus the amount appropriated for schip in fy2008 under s 1893hr 976 9125 billion is sufficient to cover the allotment levels projected here based on the assumptions described12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34107crs31 table 1 projected fy2008
