foreign sales are critical source of income for the us meat and poultry industries with the united states now exporting an estimated 26 of its pork production 18 of poultry production and 7 of beef production1 russia has become an important and expanding market it purchased an average of 740 million annually in us meat and poultry from 2005 to 2007 compared with 480 million annually during the early part of the decade in 2007 russia was the number one foreign destination for us poultry meat much of it broiler meat plus some turkey purchasing nearly 871000 metric tons mt or nearly 29 of all us poultry exports the united states is now the leading supplier of russian poultry imports it provided 79 of all broiler cut imports in 2007 for example russia was the number five foreign buyer of us pork in 2007 purchasing more than 80000 mt or nearly 8 of all us pork exports the united states provided 11 of russias pork imports in 2007 russia was among the many countries to ban us beef imports

russian agriculture and import quotas agriculture has been sensitive part of the economy throughout russian and soviet history its political importance far outweighs its share of the russian economy 72 of russian gdp in 2001 agriculture has been severely affected by the transition to market economy as much as or more than any other economic sector according to one estimate agricultural production declined around 40 in volume since 1991 with much of the decline occurring in livestock production2 russia is not competitive on the global market in red meats and poultry and its domestic production has not kept pace with consumption as incomes rise in recent years imports have accounted for half or more of russian poultry consumption even though government policies have attempted to encourage domestic production imports have accounted for roughly 30 of pork consumption and roughly 40 of beef production3 some analysts conclude that this domestic situation underlies russian actions that periodically have constrained the countrys imports of poultry and meat products the russian federal government has been under pressure from regional and local governments and from factions within the russian parliament to protect agriculture from further erosion and to provide time and resources to permit it to become competitive one major trade constraint was russias imposition in early 2003 of new import quotas on poultry and of tariffrate quotas trqs on beef and pork affecting not only the united states but other exporting countries4 the poultry quotas threatened what had 2 parts of this section are adapted from crs report rl31979 russias accession to the wto by william h cooper where more detailed discussion and additional sources may be found 3 source usda foreign agricultural

their domestic industries including in agriculture under continued crs3 become an important market for us producers although the united states was selling relatively limited quantities of pork or beef to russia at the time the new trqs would effectively block any future us growth there industry officials contended in late september 2003 the us trade representative ustr announced new market access agreement in principle with russia that the ustr declared would maintain historical levels of us sales of poultry beef and pork there see below for details negotiations on russian market access russia in 1993 formally applied for accession to the world trade organization wto then the general agreement on tariffs and trade in accordance with wto procedures since then it has been negotiating not only multilaterally but also bilaterally with individual wto members including the united states on each countrys conditions for russian entry when russia announced the imposition of quotas and trqs for meat and poultry in early 2003 the united states and other meatexporting wto member countries expressed stiff opposition claiming that the restrictions would retard the process of russias accession they specifically argued that russia was violating the standstill principle under which countries applying for wto membership are to refrain from httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22948 imposing new trade restrictions during the accession process russia countered that it was imposing the restrictions to protect its domestic meat producers from import surges right that is enjoyed by wto members5 following several months of negotiations the united states secured the agreement in principle that would effectively continue us exports of meat and poultry to russia under the new quota systems while allowing for future growth formal bilateral agreement was signed by the two parties on june 15 2005 which set the us share of russias worldwide quota for poultry and its share of the trqs for pork and for beef through the end of calendar 2009 the agreement also provides for rules on the allocation of veterinary permits and import licenses necessary to ship products to russia and establishes mechanisms for resolving traderelated problems including sanitary and phytosanitary sps issues6 under this agreement the united states has 901400 mt or 74 of russias 2008 worldwide quota of 1211600 mt for poultry it also has 49800 mt or 10 of russias 2008 worldwide trq of 493500 mt for pork and 18300 mt or 18 of the trq of 445000 mt for beef 4 continued trqs countries are permitted to export specified quantity of product or commodity at relatively low tariff with any quantity above that subject to much higher tariff for both quotas and trqs an importing country generally determines an overall quantity and then allocates amounts from that quantity among exporting countries 5 crs report rl31979 russias accession to the wto 6 ustr united states and russia sign agreement on meat market

accompanying side letters while attending regional economic summit in hanoi vietnam the agreement allowed the united states to address broad number of sensitive issues in its economic relations with russia although it did not accomplish all of the original us objectives7 with regard to agriculture the agreement or side letters httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22948 committed russia to permitting the immediate resumption of imports of deboned beef bonein beef and beef byproducts from cattle younger than 30 months and allowing imports of beef and beef byproducts from cattle of all ages once the united states received positive evaluation as beef producer from the world organization for animal health8 accepting safety certifications by the us department of agricultures usdas food safety inspection service fsis of pork and poultry slaughter processing and cold storage facilities to export their products to russia along with procedures to expedite the certification process accepting us freezing treatments as an adequate measure to prevent trichinae infestation in pork to be sold for retail sale as well as for further processing russia previously had only allowed frozen pork to be imported for further processing and continuing to apply until 2009 the provisions of the 2005 usrussia bilateral agreement on meat that established tariffrate quotas including in and overquota tariff rates and to conduct bilateral negotiations on the treatment of meat imports after the agreement expires sanitary and phytosanitary sps concerns russia has imposed sps measures that have impeded us meat and poultry imports in recent years9 in march 2002 russia announced ban on us poultry imports over 7 portions of this section are taken from crs report rl31979 russias accession to the wto 8 as noted all beef imports were banned after the 2003 us bse case but have since been restarted under these limited terms 9 sps measures refer to any of the laws rules standards and procedures that governments employ to protect humans other animals and plants from diseases pests toxins and other continued crs5 the possible presence of avian influenza in the united states us officials countered that the ban was not scientifically defensible and was discriminatory months of negotiations ensued extending into 2003 when the two sides announced resolution to the dispute nonetheless us meat and poultry exporters have remained wary that russia would raise safety concerns as reason to impose future import bans exporter concerns were reawakened in 2008 when on june 2 the russian chief medical officer signed resolution that could in effect block all us poultry imports by prohibiting the use of chlorine in antimicrobial washes to kill surface pathogens on poultry common us industry practice the rule to be implemented on january 1 2009 would set the maximum chlorine level at higher than the hygienic requirements for drinking water similar european union eu prohibition has kept us chicken out of the eu since 1997 in late july 2008 us and russian poultry industry leaders reportedly forged position whereby russia would not enforce the antimicrobial rule and would extend the expiring poultry quota allocations beyond 2009 but at reduced levels however russia entered georgia in early august before either of their governments had formally endorsed this reported agreement10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22948 recent developments the diplomatic tensions over russias military incursion into georgia have threatened to reverse longterm progress on many longstanding usrussia issues including in agricultural trade first the russians in late august announced ban on poultry shipments from 16 us establishments effective september 1 2008 three other establishments had been delisted on august 6 bringing the total to 19 the number widely reported in the press the bans followed round of joint usrussian plant inspections in late july and early august 2008 that uncovered what the russians claimed were number of safety problems many plants had not corrected problems found in earlier visits they stated adding that another 29 plants could also lose their eligibility the russian veterinary and phytosanitary service vpss claimed that tested products from the 29 plants were showing higher levels of antibiotics and arsenic than russia allows11 one of the primary reasons vpss cited for suspending the first 19 plants was an inability to visit us poultry farms even though the usrussia poultry agreement provides for such visits according to the usa poultry and egg export council the council acknowledged that us commercial producers administer small amounts of antibiotics and trace amounts of arseniccontaining compounds for animal health reasons but stated that they are within established tolerances 9 continued contaminants see also crs report rl33472 sanitary and phytosanitary sps concerns in agricultural trade by geoffrey s becker 10 administration pulls

poultry industry spokesman reportedly said some 80 poultry plants that remain eligible should be able to fill orders from any delisted plants cushioning the problems for us producers12 an official of tyson foods which owns three of the affected plants agreed noting that his company had 16 other approved plants that could ship to russia and that other countries are larger buyers of tyson exports13 nonetheless many analysts view the delisting of the 19 plants as precursor to additional actions that could further constrain us meat and poultry exports to russia russian health and safety official has threatened to enforce the ban on chlorine treatments calling it outdated technology at the same time russian agricultural officials predicted that they might reduce all poultry imports by 200000 mt in 200914 currently the worldwide quota for 2009 is 1252000 mt the united states has 931500 mt or about threefourths of it under the trq russian prime minister putin has gone further indicating that the country might suspend several trade agreements reached during its wto accession negotiations including those covering pork trqs as well as poultry quotas putin reportedly said that under the agreements russia has not received anything in return of benefit to the economy including agriculture however any suspensions could be reversed once russia joins the wto he added15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22948 there are some indications that the russians were considering quota reductions andor renegotiation of some import agreements even before tensions arose over the georgia situation nonetheless if any reductions are directed disproportionately against the united states andor various sps actions are applied more broadly here us competitors may gain larger share of the russian market currently brazil and number of eu countries are distant competitors of the united states there in poultry meats brazil already supplies more than three times as much pork as the united states the united states was starting to overtake denmark and remains ahead of canada as the other leading sources for russias pork imports brazil is the main supplier of russian beef imports followed by argentina uruguay and paraguay these developments began to unfold while congress was in its august 2008 recess agricultural leaders in congress could decide to wait to determine whether the russians follow through with additional actions affecting the us meat and poultry industries before determining what if any options to consider decisions about usrussian agricultural trade relations could hinge largely on the broader geopolitical situation16 12 russia warns that more us poultry plants may be delisted agripulse september 3 2008 13 russia ban not to significantly affect poultry
