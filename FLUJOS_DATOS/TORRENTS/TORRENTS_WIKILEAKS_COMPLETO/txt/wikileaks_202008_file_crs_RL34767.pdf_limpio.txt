congress is starting to debate broad health care reform for the first time in 15 years however the arguments involve complex issues nd other points and perspectives might be taken into account the welfare loss ma be difficult to gauge considering how consumers react to higher costsharing determining alternative tax benefits to replace the exclusion that would not adversely affect people with high costs could be challenging the larger tax savings to higher income people might not be an inequitable subsidy but only consequen ce of the proper trea tment of losses under progressive income tax

employerpaid disability insurance health care flexible spending accounts nd other benefits some consider useful the exclusion and regulatory decisions in the 1940s sometimes are said to be the reason why employerpaid coverage is the predominant form of private health insurance in the united states there is something to this argument but there are other reasons why employmentbased insu rance arose

and hr 3163 baird s 397 mar tinez and hr 914 ryan would limit the exclusion to specified amounts 5 the marginal tax rate is the rate that app lies to the last dollar of income received by taxpayer often it is the same as the statutory tax rate that applies to the highest band of taxable income for the taxpayer for marri ed couples filing joint returns for 2008 the statutory tax rate for taxable incomes not exceeding 16050 is 10 whereas the rate for taxable incomes over 357700 is 35 an exclus ion reduces the income that is taxed at the highest rate thus the tax savings on an exclusion of 1000 generally would be 100 ie 1000 x 10 for someone in the lowest tax bracket and 350 ie 1000 x 35 for someone in the highest bracket tempting target for policy makers and other advocates who seek to finance health care reform without explic itly raising tax rates4 the federal income tax exclusion the fo cus of this report has been targeted for other reasons as well since it reduces th aftertax cost of insurance to the worker in ways that are not transparent it likely results in people with insurance obtaining more coverage than they otherwise would not being explicitly capped or limited in some other manner it does little to restrict the generos ity of the insurance or annual premium increases these attributes contribute to what many economists argue is welfare or efficiency loss from excess health insurance for those with coverage these attributes also contri bute to rising health care costs and spending throughout the country in addition the federal income tax exclus ion often is criticized as unfair since the workers tax savings depend on their marginal tax rate high income workers generally have greater savings than middl income workers and the latter usually have more than low income workers5 when these tax savings are viewed simply as an economic subsidy this pattern strikes many people as wastef ul and inequitable these three assertions about the income tax exclusion that the revenue loss could instead finance health care reform that it contributes to inefficiency and rising health care costs and that higher income taxpayers unfairly get greater tax savings are the principal arguments put forth for repeal each is discussed in this report before turning to them however the repor t discusses the scope and origins of the exclusion both of which are more complex th an is generally recognized the income tax exclusion has been in the tax code fo r over 50 years and its repeal could have unintended consequences unless policy make rs understand what transactions it covers and what role it has had in the developm ent of employmentbased insurance discussion of the scope and origins will also reveal some of the uncertainties repeal would raise for both tax and health care policy limited to these topics the report does not address all issues that might be raised about the exclusion comprehens ive analysis would be difficult because of limited knowledge about who actually pays fo r employerprovided health insurance and how workers value insurance at different ages and income levels while there is general understanding about th matters it is reasonable to assume that much of the employer contribution is actually bor ne by workers through reduced wages httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs3 that is unlikely to be sufficient and could be misleading for drawing conclusions applicable to the diversity of employment arrangements throughout the country for legislation differences among types of empl oyers by size and industry for example and types of workers by gender family status and income often are important scope of the exclusion the statutory provision allowing an income tax exclusion for employerprovided health insurance is short but complex it covers more than health insurance and health plans that often are described as in surance and applies to most but not all workers including members of the workers families how other forms of coverage would be affected by repeal of the exclusion for health insurance might be considered in order to understand the ta x issue the exclusion resolves it should be considered along with another ex clusion applying to benefits when employees receive something of value from their employer the general presumption under an income tax is that it will be taxable whether taxes will actually be paid depends on the deductions and credits taxpayer might claim but at least the starting position is that whatev er is received should be taken into account for purpose of determining an employees tax liability this rule is reflected in section 61a of the internal revenue code which provides that all forms of income from whatever source are taxable unless there is an express exception with respect to employ erprovided health insurance there are two exceptions that are relevant an exclusion for coverage and an exclusion for benefits received these exceptions reflect two different tax questions that arise with this insurance whether the provision of coverage by itself should be taxable regardless of whether the taxpayer actually uses insurance benefits and whether the insurance benefits used should be taxabl regardless of whether the taxpayer paid for the coverage proposals to end th exclusion for employerprovided health insurance involve the former question and not the latter but there are interactions that might be noted in addition because the ex clusion for coverage applies to more than health insurance as it is commonly und erstood this section of the report also discusses whether it might be appropriate to retain the exclusion for some purposes coverage the exclusion for coverage can be found in section 106a of the code general rule except as otherwise provid ed in this section gross income of an employee does not include employerprovided coverage under an accident or health plan the provision allows employees to exclude that is leave out of their income tax calculations employerpaid premiums or contributions to trust or other fund for their accident or health plan there is an equivalent exclusion for employment taxeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs4 6 section 3121a2 for social security nd medicare taxes and section 3306b2 for federal unemployment taxes 7 in many selfinsured health plans the em ployer

propr ietors general partners in partnership limited partners who receive guaranteed payments and individuals who receive wages from scorporations in which they ar more than 2 shareholderselsewhere in the code that pertains to both employees and the employer6 the term accident or health plan includes not only health insurance but also accidental death and dismemberment insurance shortterm and longterm disability coverage and coverage through reim bursement arrangements such as health care flexible spending accounts fsas and health re imbursement accounts hras although usually described as an empl oyee exclusion the provision applies as well to coverage of spous and dependents of the employee whether prior to or after the latters death coverage of former employees is also included the exclusion applies to both insured and selfinsured plans an insured plan typically involves the purchase of covera ge from commercial carrier while under selfinsured plan the employ er retains the financial risk7 in addition the exclusion applies to coverage employees obtain separately in the individual insurance market provided employers pay the premiums direc tly listbilling or reimburse employees under secure arrangement that does not allow reimbursements to be diverted to another purpose individual market insura nce is not common with this exclusion finally the exclusion applies to em ployeepaid premiums under premium conversion plans under these arrangemen ts which must be set up by employers employees reduce their taxable wages in exchange for their employers using the money to pay health insurance from an accounting perspective the premiums are longer considered to be paid by the employees8 section 106a does not apply to selfe mployed individuals since they are not considered employees under the code9 however under current law they can obtain roughly the same income tax savings fro m the abovetheline deduction authorized under section 162l benefits exclusions for benefits received can be found in sections 105b and 104a3 section 105b allows taxpayers to exclude benefits they receive from employer financed accident or health plans it app lies to benefits for th eir spouse or dependents as well the exclusion is limited to expenses for medical care as defined in section 213d except to the extent they were cl aimed as an itemized deduction in priorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs5 10 section 213d defines medical care broadly including amount s paid for the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of di sease or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body internal revenue service publication 502 medical and dental expenses provides further guidance year10 thus the exclusion does not apply to disability benefits attributable to employer payments since these benef its need not be spent on medical care in contrast section 104a3 allows taxpayers to exclude amounts received through accident or health plans except for amounts financed by an employer the taxpayers themselves might pay for this insurance but that is not necessary the only requirement is that the employer not pay the exclusion here is not limited to expenses for medical care as is the exclusion in section 105b thus it might include disability benefits section 104a3 applies to indi vidual and group policies including employmentbased plans if both employers and employees pay for the coverage the benefits might have to be apportioned to determine their tax tr eatment this is not necessary for medical expenses from hea lth insurance which would be excluded under either section 105b or section 104a3 ho wever disab ility benefits attributable to employer payments would be taxable since they are not covered by section 105b those attributable to em ployee payments would be exempt under section 104a3 selfinsured plans covering highly co mpensated employees must comply with nondiscrimination rules if they do not the section 105b exclusion may be limited for these employees the nondiscrimination rules do not apply to insured plans selfemployed people are covered by section 104a3 not section 105b some policy issues if section 106a were repealed empl oyerpaid coverage under accident and health plans would become taxable to employees for the federal income tax states would likely adopt the same treatment as they do for most income tax provisions repealing 106a would not by itself end th exclusions for employment taxes but most proposals would abolish those as well if only to obtain dditional revenue for health care reform however repealing section 106a would also affect disability insurance and health care reimbursement arrangements among other employer benefit plans these possible changes have not received much ttention and they might not be what is intended consideration might be given to retaining the exclusion for these benefits though as will be seen doing so may raise other complications employerpaid disability insurance may be needed to prevent the adverse selection that occurs when employees purch ase coverage themselves when left to individual choice people who think they mig ht become disabled are more likely to purchase insurance than those who do not this drives up premiums as insurers adjusthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs6 11 for information on health care fsas hras as well as health

salary reduction agreements are llowed under the cafeteria plan provisions of section 125 health care benefits under an fsa are exempt under section 106a because they are technically considered to be provided by the employer 13 in the fy2008 and fy2009 budgets president bush pr oposed using health savings accounts hsas to serve so of these functions however there are number of unresolved policy issues regarding hsas and they remain controversialfor their anticipated cost employmentpaid disability insurance may also be needed to provide coverage to workers who will need but would fail to purchase it many people underestimate the like lihood of becoming disabled during their working years or do not think about the issue at all of course employers could purchase disability coverage for all employees even if the exclusion were repealed while the coverage would be ta xable the benefits would then be exempt under section 104a 3 however many employees would likely object to being taxed for coverage they would not choose in exchange for receiving taxfree benefits most will not need for disability insurance unlike health insurance there are few proposals for alternative tax subsidies to encourage peopl to purchase coverage an expanded tax deduction or tax credit might provide some of the incentive as the exclusion for employerpaid coverage though neither w ould likely overcome the adverse selection problem health care reimbursement arrangements allow employees to pay outofpocket medical expenses deductibles copayments and things not covered by insurance on pretax basis the most common form is health care flexible spending account fsa though some employers offer health reimbursement accounts hras11 most health care fsas are funded through sa lary reduction agreements under which employees agree to receive lower takehom pay in exchange for benefits though others are funded at least in part by empl oyers either way section 106a applies12 health care fsas are popular with empl oyees who have fa milies or otherwise anticipate having lots of medical and dental bills they can help families manage their expenses and cash flow employer s find them useful for helping employees deal with rising health care costs and fo r getting them to accept insurance with higher deductibles and copayments as well as restrictions on cer tain services and products while the section 106a exclusion raises ma ny of the equity and efficiency concerns for fsas as it does for health insurance retaining it for fsas might be justified as way to hold down rising premiums arguably the greater problem13 at the same time retaining the exclusion for these arrangements could raise technical and enforcement issues if fs as and hras retained tax preferences but insurance did not over time it is likely the former would expand and the latter would contract at least in terms of covered benefits if not cost in effect fsas and hras would assume some of the f unctions now borne by

allowed as part of the itemized deduction for medical expenses for time the nondiscrimination provisions for selfinsured plans now found in section 105h were included under section 106 16 the initial

effects of ending the exclusion it would also result in disparate treatment for small employers who often cannot establish fsas due to statutory nondiscrimin ation requirements similar issues might arise with respect to the health care employers provide with onsite doctors and nurses nd through wellness programs if section 106a were repealed coverage for some of these services might become taxable discouraging their use14 this would not further what some observers think is useful way to improve workers health if instead they were not taxable however over time they would likely expand replacing some of th services now covered by insurance attempting to delineate the line between wh at should be taxable and what should be exempt could be challenging origins the origins of the tax exclusion for em ployerprovided health insurance have become part of the debate over whether th exclusion should be repealed to some initial determinations about narrow tax issue coupled with contemporaneous regulatory decisions account for the pre dominance of employerprovided coverage in the united states however the history of the exclusion is not unambiguous in this respect and it reveals concerns about tax policy questions th at remain today section 106 was enacted in 1954 as part of comprehensive revision of the internal revenue code at the time it consisted only of what later became section 106a though the wording has changed seve ral times current law subsections b c and d which are not relevant to the present discussion were added relatively recently15 prior to 1954 there was statutory provision that explicitly allowed an exclusion for coverage under employerp rovided accident and health insurance regulatory rulings shortly after the modern income tax began

coverage still had to be provided through plans 19 for example the scope of the term plan remained unclear taxation of employee accident and health plans before and under the 1954 code yale law journal vol 64 19541955 p 222247medical and hospitalization insurance issued by commercial insurer was exempt income to workers17 since group coverage of this so rt had started spreading in the 1930s the need for resolution had become im portant nonethele ss apparently the distinction between which insurance arrangements qualified for the exclusion and which did not remained unclear employer payments for individual covera ge were always taxable prior to 1954 various rationales were advanced for the different treatment of group plans or at least certain gr oup plans nd individual insurance while the economic value of employer payments for individual insuran ce could be determined from the premiums individuals were charged the economic va lue of group coverage would vary among individuals perhaps substantially it was not at all clear as it still is not today how to value coverage for someone who w ould not be insurable in the individual market in addition there was parallel treatment at the time for life insurance employer coverage for individual life insurance or life insurance with cash value was taxable while group coverage for term insurance was not at least to point finally health insurance at the time often included wage continuation payments for periods of illness since rights for this were forfeited when employment was terminated it was not clear whether coverage by itself in contrast to actual receipt of payments constituted income the enactment of section 106 provide d basis for excluding employer payments for individual insurance and certa in other coverage such as union plans18 it also clarified number of other poi nts though other ambiguities remained19 sections 104a3 and 105b were also enacted as part of the 1954 code and have remained largely unchanged since the predecessor to section 104a3 can be traced back to the revenue act of 1918 when it was added to clarify that amounts received through accident or health insurance or from workmens compensation acts would be exempt under that provision as well as the successor section 22b5 of the 1939 code the exclusion was limited to amounts received through accident and health insurance which included commerc ially insured arrangements but not most private employer or employee association plans benefits from private employer plans were sometimes exempt when they were established pursuant to state law further uncertainty about the definition of insurance arose from the 1952 seventh circuit decision in epmeier v us which applied the term to selfinsured planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs9 20 one reason for the complexity and uncertainty prior to 1954 was that it was not unusual for health insurance at that time to have wage continuation benefits although arguably these could be exempt if the taxpayer had pur chased the insurance with aftertax earnings an exemption did not appear justified when th employer paid for the coverage particularly if that were excluded from taxation as well since wages from working were taxable the argument goes why should continuation wages from not working be exempt 21 melissa thomasson the importance of group

subject of two federal court cases inland steel company v nlrb 170 f 2d 247 and ww cross and company v nlrb 174 f 2d 875 the nlrb order in the former case dealt with retirem ent and pension plans though it made passing reference to insurance the order in the latter case dealt with group accident and health insurancepaying benefits base d upon salary and length of employ ment that is form of wage continuation20 the 1954 code clarified these issues by carrying over the language in section 22b5 of the 1939 code to present law s ection 104a3 and adding new section 105b that provided an exemption for be nefits from selfinsured plans the legislation allowed limited exemption for wage replacement benefits in section 105d but this was repealed by the tax reform act of 1976 debate over consequences by removing much of the uncertainty about these tax questions the 1954 code furthered the growth of group insurance not only did the statutory exclusion reduce the effective price of insurance but it made coverage easier to obtain as employers having clearer guidance became more willin g to establish plans one study shows how the change both increased the amount of coverage obtained and engendered shift from individual to group policies21 even before 1954 however group insura nce coverage had been expanding one reason for this is that the stabiliz ation act of 1942 which otherwise imposed strict limits on wage increases expressly exempted insurance and pension benefits22 employers eager to attract workers in tight labor market ex panded their benefit plans instead in addition the national labor relations board in 1948 held that fringe benefits could be covered under collective bargaining agreements this furthered the growth of union plans23 to some observers these tax changes and regulatory decisions largely explain the predominance of employmentbased insurance in the united states coming at time of dramatic growth in the number of people with insurance the policies were both response to changes in how insura nce was provided and the cause of theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs10 24 the proportion of the population with hosp italization insurance

resolving na rrow issue was responsible for both the way in which majority of the populati on now finances its health care and the problems associated with it there is something to be said for this argument at the very least it shows that tax policies currently at issue were largely shaped during particular period in history responding to what were percei ved to be the needs at that time an implication might be that current policies should be reviewed in light of todays needs and that further chan ges might now be appropriate at the same time the historical argu ment about the importance of tax and regulatory policies may be overstated enrollment in group plans expanded steadily from 1939 onwards starting prior to the tax ruling and regulatory changes mentioned above and increasing roughly in tandem with increases in enrollments in individual policies25 if employmentbased insurance s upplanted individual market coverage it was not evident at the time moreover other forces possibly contribut ed to the rise of employmentbased insurance according to one analysis range of influential groups doctors hospitals insurers and employers saw it as way of achieving their own goals while simultaneously reducing pressure for government solution in the form of compulsory social insurance the latter d been advocated by some during the years before world war two26 more important the historical argume nt does not explain why employment based insurance has persisted as the pre dominant form of coverage for people under age 65 while the proportion of this age group covered under employment plans has declined somewhat in recent years it is still about the same as it was 20 years ago much of the recent decline has occurred in smaller businesses where the principal problem has less to do with financing let alone the tax benefits than with lack of access to stable insurance pool s in which risk and administrative costs are spread over large numbers of participants employers are not legally required to provi health insurance to their workers let alone pay for it there is little doubt th ey do so partly because of tax advantages from the section 106a exclusion it is uncertain how much employers gain from the exclusion except from reductions in empl oyment taxes but even if they gained nothing directly they would likely provide c overage in order to give their

competitive labor market workers tax savings on one form of compensation might allow employers to reduce other forms however it is likely that employers pr ovide health insurance for other reasons as well one is that insurance is an attractive benefit to most workers both for the coverage it provides and for the time it saves them in shopping for policies on their own given these preferences when other employers competing for the same workers offer health insurance it is diffi cult for one employer not to do so second employers have an economic interest in healthy workers and to some extent workers healthy families according to some studies healthy workers are more productive these advantages are more lik ely to be found in large firms employing higherskilled workers they diminish as firm size shrinks and skill levels decline27 but even if employers could readily di smiss ill employees and replace them with others there would be turnover costs for these reasons whether employerpr ovided coverage would erode if the exclusion were repealed cannot be forecast with any certain ty particularly given the diversity of employment arrangements in the country much would depend on the availability of alternative tax benefits that might re place the exclusion as well as whether these would be linked to atte mpts to create stable insurance pools regardless of how the exclusion came to be pa rt of the tax code these present factors are likely to be more significant the future of employmentbased insuran ce is one of the most important issues in health care reform considering its dominant role in providing coverage for people under age 65 changes to the insuran ce whether intentional or not ought not be taken lightly most employmentbased insurance is thought to have larger and more stable risk pools than individual ma rket insurance and barring improvements in the latter some would oppose policies that might threaten the former28 some would argue that one of the first decisi ons to be made about reform is whether employmentbased insurance should be strengthened weakened or left alone and that decisions about the tax exclus ion should be based upon that choicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs12 29 the term excess health insurance may sound inappropriate when there is widespread concern about the growing number of people who are uninsured however the argument pertains to people with coverage not without it one reason that some people do not obtain insurance is that excess coverage increases the cost for everyone 30 ibid to some observers the country has serious problems of both excess insurance and growing numbers of uninsured 31 martin s feldstein the welfare loss of excess health insurance journal of political economy vol 81 marchapril

criticism of the exclusion for employerprovided health insurance is that it reduces the aftertax cost of insurance to workers in ways that are not transparent likely resulting in their obtaining more coverage than they otherwise would not being explicitly capped or limited in some other manner it does little to restrict the generosity of the insurance or annual premium increases the exclusion thus contributes to what some economists consider an excess of insurance coverage and significant welfare or efficiency loss for insured individuals and society as whole29 how repealing the exclusion would affect this welfare loss is complicated question however depending on how consumer s react to higher costsharing it could be challenging to determine alternative tax benefits to replace the exclusion without adversely affectin g people with high costs the welfare loss from excess insurance particularly insurance with low deductibles and copayments occurs because people pay more for health care services than they would if everyone assu med more of the cost themselves30 this outcome is caused partly by the increased demand attributable to insurance people generally use more services when they have covera ge because their effective price at the time of service drops and partly by the increase in market prices for services due to higher aggregate demand increased market pri ces in turn encourage people to purchase more insurance in order to avoid or minimize the additional financial risk from higher prices low deductibles and copayments reduce th financial risk insured people face and this welfare gain must be offset agai nst the losses describe d above even taking this into account estimates of the net we lfare loss from health insurance indicated that it could be large sum in an ar ticle on this issue in 1973 martin feldstein estimated that raising the coinsurance rate from onethird to twothirds of private hospital expenditures could ve saved 4 billion year out of base of 126 billion in 196931 later revision of feldsteins work in 1991 study estimated that the net welfare loss from excess health insuran ce could have been 1093 billion in 1984 dollars assuming that insurance induces large increase in gross prices and consumers place large marginal value on medical spending assuming constant prices and high marginal valuation th estimate would still have been 334 billion these figures obviously would be much higher in todays dollars32 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs13 32 continued other work on the concept of excess health insurance see mark v pauly taxation

gatekeepers for access to specialists for example and to limit providers charges as condition of th eir participating in network in these respects employmentbased health insuran ce is subject to rest rictions even though the tax exclusion itself is not nonetheless for the most part employ mentbased insurance does not have high deductibles in 2007 over 80 of workers in hmos did not have any general annual deductible which was also the case for just under 30 of workers in ppo plans and over 50 of workers in pointofservice p plans for those with general annual deductible the average amounts fo r single coverage were only 401 in hmos 461 for ppo plans and 621 for pos plans while the average deductible in high deductible plans with saving s options was 1729 only 5 of covered workers were in these plans34 enrollees in all of thes plans would likely have had copayments for most services whether moving to higher insurance cost sharing would reduce health care spending is not at issue notwithstanding measurement difficulties economic theory actuarial experience and empirical studies all indicate that it does probably the most frequently cited research demons trating this point is the rand health insurance experiment hie carefully designed study of nearly 6000 people between 1974 and 1982 among other things the study showed that per capita expenses for patients with 95 coinsu rance requirement fo r outpatient services were 31 lower than those for patients w ithout costsharing reductions were also present but somewhat smaller for patients with lower coinsurance requirements as they were for those with deductible policie s reductions occurred for broad range of conditions especially for ambulator care but also for hospitalizations 35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs14 36

the impact of patient cost sharing on health outcomes american journal of managed care vol 14 7 july 2008 p 412 the authors state that the rand findings should not be used to justify higher cost sharing across the boardmore debatable is what effect reducti ons in spending have on individuals health which could affect measures of the welfare loss common reading of the rand hie is that the health outcomes of those with high cost sharing were not different from those having conventiona l coverage with several exceptions36 the exceptions included high blood pressure nd vision imperfections in adults and anemia in children37 although more health problems might have arisen for the high cost sharing group had the experiment tinued longer there is way to prove or disprove this now however the similarity in outcomes for participants in the hie did not occur because individuals with high cost shar ing chose to forgo only services of limited clinical value instead it reflected beneficial reduction in harmful medical services that offset detrimental reduction in us eful services bad care and good care were both forgone resulting in outcomes similar to those having conve ntional coverage today there may be more effective treatments for chronic diseases that higher cost sharing would place at risk and formerly untreatable or acute illnesses may now be considered chronic and subject to treatment38 critical question here is whether greater cost sharing can be combined with other reforms so that indivi duals reduce their spending but maintain or even increase effective care possible changes include reducing or eliminating cost sharing for services likely to impart high value provi ding better informati on and helping people use it and making prices for services nd products more availa ble and transparent some steps have already been taken in th directions in c onsumerdriven health care plans for example though it is too ear ly to tell how far they will spread and whether they will make significant difference some policy issues ending the tax exclusion could be help ful in reducing health care spending since the exclusion reduces the net price of insurance it likely encourages workers to obtain more coverage than otherwise since it is uncapped tax savings and the incentive to purchase more coverage grow unc hecked as the cost of insurance rises in contrast while an altern ative tax benefit such as an expanded tax deduction or refundable tax credit might ve effect on the former problem since it too would reduce the net price of coverage it could provide brake on the latter depending on how it is designed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs15 39 description of revenue provis ions contained in the presid ents fiscal year 2009 budget

congressional budget office geographic variation in health care spending february continuedfor example president george w bush proposed terminating the exclusion and replacing it with standard deduction for health insurance sdhi of 7500 for self only coverage or 15000 for family covera ge the joint committee on taxation has estimated that adoption of the sdhi coupled with other parts of the proposal would result in net revenue increase of over 440 billion from fy2009 through fy2018 the increase would occur largely because the sdhi would be indexed to changes in the consumer price index while the exclusion it replaces would have grown at the higher rate for health insurance costs the reduced tax savings from the change presumably would affect the amount of coverage purchased39 however it may be somewhat speculative to assume that reduction in tax savings from indexing alternative benefits to the cpi would materialize to the extent envisioned if large savings were to occu r in the outyears the reduction in spending they encourage might lead to calls for congress to adjust the limits40 it may also be speculative whether ending the exclusion would also encourage more effective care one possibility is that deduction or credit would be allowed only if the insurance had incentives to this effect another is that if the cost of insurance exceeds what could be claimed as deduction or taken into account as credit people would become more costconscious and concer ned about effectiveness whether these things would occur is unknown however there are other issues with potentially ending the exclusion that merit attention for one thing in replacing the exclus ion with capped deduction or credit for example the 7500 and 15000 figures in the presidents proposal it is not immediately clear where to set the cap setting it too low might erode needed insurance benefits for some people if ma ny were affected th level might not be sustainable setting it too high may lock in current welfare losses delaying significant savings for years to come the same dilemma applies to proposals to cap the exclusion rather than replace it with deduction or credit the issue is complicated by the wide ra nge of health care costs throughout the country as analysis by the congressiona l budget office shows health care spending per capita in 2004 varied from appr oximately 4000 in utah to 6700 in massachusetts while differences in spending reflect more than price differentials they are also influenced by differences in health status preferences and other matters the magnitude of the differences suggests price disparities might not be inconsequential41 even if they were spending may be the better indicator for settinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs16 41

employers may be charged up to 102 of the total premium for this coveragea cap unless it is plausible to assume that usage can be reduced in high cost areas study by milliman of 14 major metr opolitan areas shows similar spending differences42 in addition health care costs vary among people with employmentbased insurance regardless of where they live in 2005 median health care spending was 2525 for people ages 55 through 64 and 623 for those ages 25 through 34 for women ages 25 through 64 with this in surance median spending was 1086 while for men it was 530 people ages 25 throug h 64 with this insurance who reported being in fair health had median expe nditures of 3777 while those who reported being in very good health d median expenditures of 89343 to the extent that health insurance reflects these differences its cost will vary the largest differentials might occur among small employer plans particularly in states where there are few restrictions on premium variations in insured plans at the same time small employers might drop coverage that becomes too expensive which large employers would be unlikely to do workers who incur very high costs might have illnesses or injuries that require them to leave their jobs reducing the differentials though sometimes the high cost person is family member conceivably tax limits on insurance costs might be adjusted to compensate for some of these differences for example the ceiling on deduction or credit or the cap on the exclusion could be set higher for people ages 55 through 64 alternatively high cost people might be allowed an additi onal deduction based upon some portion of their income similar to the current itemized deduction though here not limited to itemizers however these variations would add complexity and they might perpetuate diffe rentials that ideally should be reduced ending the exclusion would also rais the question of what amount should be included in employees income for tax purposes an average premium for example the cobra premium has been suggested44 however the economic value of group health insurance varies widely among workers as was recognized in debates over the exclusion prior to its codification in 1954 see the discussion above in the origins section the value of insurance to young healthy worker is likely far less than the value to an older worker in poor health or who perhaps

lower wages46 to the extent this is true it might not seem appropriate to increase the amount of the employer contribution olde r workers must recognize the current exclusion avoids all these technical issues everything is just left out of the tax calculations to some observers this is virtue at the same time while the simplicity of omission has obvious attrac tions it does not show variations in the allocation of tax subsidies that some woul d consider important differences in the amount of subsidy by age geography and health condition might seem inappropriate to some ending the exclusion would improve transparency and allow these difference to be assessed and debated at the same time it might create new controversies that dive rt attention from other health care issues tax equity two equity issues arise with respect to the tax exclusion of employerprovided coverage one is how people with employ erprovided coverage are treated for tax purposes compared to otherwise similar people who have coverage purchased in the individual market the other is how peopl with employerprovided coverage are treated at different income levels the former issue which is addressed first is easier to analyze and there is an obvious soluti on to what some people consider problem the latter issue is more complicated than is usually recognized and may defy simple solutions the tax exclusion sometimes is criticized for providing tax savings when employers pay for the insurance while c overage purchased in the individual market generally has tax savings to some this creates an unwarranted distortion in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs18 47 irs data for tax year 2005 the health insurance deduction for selfemployed taxpayers is claimed on about 3 of all returns in addition to being selfemployed the taxpayer must meet number of additional conditions the deduction cannot exceed the net profit and any other earned income from the business under which the plan is established less deductions taken for certain retirement plans and for onehalf the selfemployment tax it is not available for any month in which the taxpayer or the taxpayers spouse is eligible to participate in subsidized employmentbased health plan ie one in which the employer pays part of the cost these restrictions prevent taxpayers with little net income from their business which is not uncommon for new bus iness from deducting much if any of their insurance payments 48 the savings would be the same if the employ er paid for all the coverage or the workers could pay their share with pretax dollars under premium conversion arrangementinsurance markets in their view it is not obvious why health insurance which is essentially personal ma tter should be tied to ones job it is argued that the tie limits workers health plan choices and penalizes workers who might be able to work more productively elsewhere under current law there are two provisi ons that provide tax savings to people who purchase insurance in the individual ma rket one is the 100 deduction allowed selfemployed taxpayers who buy policies for themselves and their family members this applies only to small number of people less than 3 of all who file returns47 the other is the itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses which is available only to taxpayers who itemize thei r deductions and only to the extent the expenses exceed 75 of their adjusted gr oss income for most taxpayers the standard deduction is larger than the sum of their potential itemized deductions and of those who itemize most do not have extensive unreimbursed medical expenses in 2005 about 35 of all retu rns had itemized deductions nd of these less than 21 about 7 of all returns claimed the medical expense deduction most people who purchase insurance in the individual market cannot claim either of these deductions this imbalance in individuals tax savings could largely be remedied by allowing an abovetheline deduction fo r premiums that is available to everyone without employerprovided coverage this type of deduction which could be claimed whether or not one itemized might be standard deduction like president george w bush proposed or limited to premiums actually paid in the tter case the income tax savings to individuals would be approximately the same as those from the exclusion for equivalentlypriced employerprovided insurance48 the income tax deduction just described would not provide savings from the exclusion fo r employment taxes but an additional deduction might be allowed people with employment income for that purpose some might oppose this solution since employerprovided insurance generally has broader and more stable risk pooling in their view this should be protected and rewarded despite the apparent inequity in tax savings the second tax equity issue is how peopl with employerprovided coverage are treated at different income levels income tax savings from the exclusion for employer provided health insurance depend on taxpayers marginal tax rates for low income taxpayers the savings on federal income taxes might be 10 or as little

the sum of their standard deduction and pe rsonal exemption until their income exceeds 16975 their taxable income the difference between 16975 and 8950 would be taxed at 10 thus if single taxpayers with wa ge income of 13000 were given employer paid insurance worth 3000 their savings from the income tax exclusion would be 300 ie 3000 x 1049 for higher income taxpayers the inco tax savings would be greater for single filers in the top tax bracket of 35 the tax savings from the exclusion of 3000 of coverage would be 1050 appreciab ly more than the savings for low income workers for middle income taxpayers in the 15 or 25 brackets the income tax savings would be 450 or 750 respectively in 2008 the 15 bracket for single filers applies to taxable incomes of 8026 to 32550 the 25 bracket to taxable incomes of 32551 to 78850 and the 35 bracket to taxable incomes over 357700 different figures apply to taxp ayers filing as married or head of households but the pattern just described would be the same taxpayers often get additional savings from parallel exclusion on their state income taxes currently 43 states and the district of columbia impose taxes on individual incomes rates vary from state to state and while some of the tax savings would be offset by reduction in the itemized deduction for state income taxes typically higher income taxpay ers would get greater savings this picture is complicated by tax savings from the exclusion for employment taxes medicare taxes of 185 of wage s considering just the employees share apply to workers regardless of income t hus all would be affected equally by an exclusion for insurance worth 3000 for social security taxes however the exclusion benefits low and middle income workers but not those with wages above 102000 the wage base ceiling in 2008 the exclusion would save the former 62 considering just the employees shar or 186 for 3000 worth of insurance employment taxes aside the figures bove show that middle income taxpayers generally benefit more from the exclusion than low income taxpayers and that high income taxpayers generally benefit more than those with middle incomes when these tax savings are viewed purely as an economic subsidy this pattern seems unfair if not wasteful it is unlikely that an insura nce subsidy program using appropriated funds would be designed in this manner the equity problems are likely to be exacerbated in several respects for one thing higher income workers are more likely to be eligible for employerprovided health insurance one study showed that 896 of workers with family incomes above 400 of the federal poverty level were eligible for employer coverage in contrast to 398 of workers with incomes below the poverty level in 200550 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs20 50 continued 2005 issue paper kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured 2006 51 the distinction between catastrophic and rou tine expenses is not always an indication of what might be deductible loss some high expenditures are voluntary for example childbirth of planned baby whereas so routine expenditures are incurred only to forestall losses for example statin drugs 52 this was the argument put forth in once wellknown article by william d andrews personal deductions in an ideal income tax harvard law review vol 86 1972 p 309 for more recent discussion see jay sole d taxation of employerprovided coverage inclusion timing and policy issues virginia tax review vol 15 19951996 p 447same study also showed that 83 of those eligible in the higher income group actually accepted coverage compared to 635 of t hose eligible in the lower income group where these patterns occur the disparitie s in tax savings based on the 3000 figure in the discussion above would understa differences among income groups moreover higher income taxpayers may benefit more from the exclusion if their employmentbased insurance on average provides greater economic benefits than identical coverage provides wer income taxpayers as described in the previous section income on average increases with ag at least until the late middle ages and age usually is associated with higher health care expenditures the preceding analysis is not the only way of looking at the tax equity issue to some extent the tax saving s shown above might not be an inequitable subsidy but only consequence of the proper treatment of losses under prog ressive income tax in progressive tax system when gains are taxed at higher and higher rates depending on income then it is conceptually appropriate to deduct losses at those same rates to the extent that health insurance is view ed as method of smoothing losses over time and individuals then the greater tax sa vings for higher income people from the exclusion would not be inappropria or for that matter unfair the argument about progressivity would ve greater force if health insurance covered only catastrophic expenditures that ev eryone would clearly see as losses for example hospitalization for accidents or heart attacks however since portion of its cost is for anticipated expenditures for routine care not all of the exclusion can be associated with loss of this nature51 the root issue is whether health care is like other forms of personal consumption on reflection many people mig ht conclude that it is not health care takes time provides personal pleasure and most im portant usually is designed to return patients to condition prior to an accident or illness that one would choose to have had absent the latter it does not result in gratification or enha ncement of ones well being52 on the other hand health insurance which is the subject of the exclusion provides additional value because people r ecognize they cannot predict their health with certainty and worry that they might not be able to afford care when they need it it buys peace of mind as well as services in this respect insurance may be like otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs21 forms of personal consumption in that it is not directly associated with loss that should be recognized under an income tax since it is difficult to determine what portion of an insurance premium merits treatment as tax loss it is challenging to think of what might be an appropriate remedy the issue is compounded by the di versity of insurance arrangements and uncertainty about the extent to which par ticular workers ultimately bear the cost of employerprovided coverage conclusion there is much to be said for moving towards health care financing system that is more transparent equitable and efficient given the extraordinary complexity of american health care and increasing concer ns about rising costs and the growing numbers of uninsured new policy approaches are widely being given careful consideration whether ending the exclusion should be part of these approaches depends on what the replacement policies are problems attributable to the exclusion might also occur with new measures or other problems c ould arise it is difficult to evaluate one step without knowing the other given th origin of the exclusion it would not be inappropriate to consider re visions in light of todays problems however one might move carefully before dismantling policy that has been in place for over 50 years some policymakers appear to be interested in the exclusion primarily to raise money for health care reform in order to make substantial reduction in the number of uninsured for example there would likely have to be significant subsidies either through the tax system with refundable tax credits through the insurance system with premium subsidies and rating limitations or through some other means revenue increases from ending the exclusion would be one way to pay for these initiatives however if the sole objective were to raise money it might be simpler just to increase taxes generally for many peopl who currently have employmentbased insurance over threefifths of the population under age 65 the mathematical effect might be roughly the same at leas t for income taxes for people under age 65 paying for other private insurance an offsetting deduction could provide tax equity people under age 65 with other public insura nce might not be affected considering that their income often is too low to be taxed nonetheless some argue that the exclus ion should be ended not to raise money but to improve efficiency and limit costs and spending in the absence of alternative proposals to achieve these goals termination might be appropriate principal policy decision appears to be whether to maintain and possibly strengthen the employmentbased system of health care if that is the goal then maintaining the exclusion might be appropriate since it is unclear what the effects of termination would be over time if instead the goal were to move towards individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34767crs22 market insurance or
