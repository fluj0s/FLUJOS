proposal to sell 36 f16 cd block 5052 falcon combat aircraft to pakistan at an estimated case value of 3 billion the f16 falcon is single engine multirole aircraft manufactured by lockheed martin corp its relatively low cost and high versatility make the f16 one of the most exported fighter aircraft in the world the f16 was first fielded in 1979 and has been upgraded significantly the capabilities of the f16 vary greatly depending on the upgrade or modification fielded the most modern f16 flown by the united states is the block 5052 three other f16 related sale s to pakistan were also proposed some believe that these sales are partly an effort to reward the pakistani government for the role it has played in support of usled antiterrorism efforts and this consideration is noted in the text of the formal notification of the f16 sales some analysts however see the decision to resume f16 sales to pakistan as disruptive of regional stability and efforts to resolve disputes there combat aircraft are considered esse ntial for conducting surprise attacks or initiating largescale offensive operations therefore the transfer of combat aircraft can be significant policy d ecision especially to region with known tensions and territorial disputes generally speaking arguments for foreign military sales tend to focus on adva ncing us industry suppor ting allied countries and promoting interoperability w ith those countries argume nts against arms sales tend to focus on the negative aspects of military technology prolifera tion and the potential for causing regional instability the federal government approves arms sales on caseby case basis it is currently unclear what longterm effects potential sale of combat aircraft to south asia might have on us political relations with pakistan and india or the political relationship between them the reported us willingness to sell f16s or fa18s to india may mitigate that country s disappointment with any renewed us arms sales to pakistan and neutralize any increase in pakistans military capability militarily the importance of the proposed tr ansfer of new f16s and the upgrade of pakistans legacy f16s can be viewed in the context of pakistans conventional military confrontation with india its nuclear confrontation with that country and its struggle with terrorists and insurgents much of the commentary following the june 28th announcement centered on how potential sale of aircraft to pakistan and possibly to india would be beneficial to industry the potential benefits most frequently mentioned were

certify to cong ress that pakistan does not possess nuclear explosive device during the fiscal year for which aid is to be provided with the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan paki stans nuclear activities again came under intensive us scrutiny and in 1990 presid ent george hw bush again suspended aid to pakistan one result of this aid cutoff was the nondelivery of 28 f16 fighter aircraft purchased by pakistan in 1989 in 1998 the united states agreed to compensate pakistan with cash payment and goods including surplus wheat it was not until late2001 when the united st ates again looked to pakistan as frontline ally that major us aid includi ng major weapons systems again flowed to pakistan3 indiaus relations the usindia relationship was for decades dictated by the politics of the cold war the soviet collapse freed indiaus relations from the constraints of global bipolarity but during the 1990s interacti ons continued to be affected by the indiapakistan rivalry and nuclear

assist indias rise as major power in the new century despite concurrent us rapprochement with pakistan usindia security cooperation has flourished and includes regular military exercises in j une 2005 the united states and india signed tenyear defense framework agreement that calls for expanding bilateral cooperation in number of s ecurityrelated areas some laud increased usindia security ties as providing potential counterba lance to chinese influence in the region but the emergence of an overt counterweig ht alliance is viewed by many as both misguided and unlikely4 pakistanindia relations three fullscale wars and constant state of military friction have marked nearly six decades of rivalry between pakistan and india the acrimonious nature of the partition of british india into two successo r states in 1947 and the unresolved issue of kashmiri sovereignt have been major sources of tension both countries have built large defense establishments at significant cost to economic and social development nevertheless peace in itiative begun in 2003 has improved the relationship and led to january 2004 summit and an agreement to reengage in dialogue to bring about p eaceful settlement of all bila teral issues including jammuhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33515crs3 and kashmir to the satisfac tion of both sides in april 2005 the two governments released joint statement calling their current bilatera l peace process irreversible although some analysts believe the proce ss could quickly unravel following major terrorist attack or some other unforeseen development offici als from both countries and the united states offer generally positive assessments of the ongoing dialogue even as progress on territorial disputes pecially that involving kashmir has been minimal the pentagons june 2006 notificati ons to congress assert that pakistans planned purchase of new f16s and rela ted equipment would not significantly reduce indias quantitative or qualitative military advantage nor affect the regional balance of power us combat aircraft the f16 falcon is single engine multirole aircraft manufactured by lockheed martin corp its relatively low cost and high versatility make the f16 one of the most exported fighter aircraft in the world the f16 was first fielded in 1979 and has been upgraded significantly the capabilities of the f16 vary greatly depending

implications it is currently unclear what longterm effects potential sale of combat aircraft to south asia might have on us political relations with pakistan and india or the political relationship between them the bush administrations decision to resume f16 sales to pakistan after 16year hiatus was first announced at march 2005 press conference by unnamed seni or state department offici als at

the house wrote to pres ident bush urging him to not license the sale of f16 aircraft to pakistan as ch sale would undermine our longterm strategic interests in south asia and s quander an opportunity to continue building positive relations with india6 meanwhile indian prime minister manmohan singh expressed great disappointment at the u s decision saying the move could have negative consequences for indias security environment but he later softened his criticism and welcomed an apparent us willingness to expand cooperation with india fifteen months later when the bush administration formally notified congress of potential sale of f16s to pakistan an indian external affairs ministry statement said the step is not conduciv to improving ties between india and pakistan7 justifications for the decision to resume f16 sales include us interest that pakistan feel secure and perception that substantive us defense relationship with both pakistan and india will stabiliz the balance between them in june 2006 the white house said the planned f 16 sale demonstrates our commitment to longterm relationship with pakistan8 some believe the decision is reward to president gen musharraf and the pakist ani military for their post911 cooperation with usled counterterrorism efforts and see renewed exports as potentially increasing us leverage in islamabad while eroding antiamerican sentiments there such leverage could include increased pakistani cooperation in the areas of counterterrorism and nonproliferation9 it may be that the timing of the june 2006 notification was influenced by developments in usindia relations washington and new delhi are moving forward with ndmark civil nuclear cooperation initiative islamabad claims the initiative will cause power imbalance in the region and it repeatedly has requested similar arrangement with washingt on the bush administration rejects such requests and also has not moved to pr ovide pakistan with defense cooperation pact similar to

has repercussions for our dialogue that is currently at sensitive stage11 some in congress voice similarly grounded opposition in mo re explicit terms at june 2005 house hearing on us south asia policy one lawmaker said f16s is how you fight india its not how you fight terrorists this is outrageous the sentiment was echoed by several other mbers in attendance ho wever two nongovernmental experts appearing before the house pane l approved of such sales as important symbolic gestures that would likely result in muchneeded improvement in us pakistan relations12 several critics have contended that renewed f16 sales may strengthen nondemocratic forces in is lamabad though the bush administration has made spreading democracy cornerstone of its foreign policy pakistan continues to be governed by an army general who came to power through military coup and the state department has noted that pakistans democratic institutions remain weak13 in hrept 109486 june 2006 the hous appropriations committee expressed concern about pakistans lack of progre ss on improving democratic governance and rule of law furthermore some pa kistani commentators wonder why islamabad plans to spend billions of dollars on wea pons of allegedly questionable utility while the countrys social services and infrastructure are in dire need of improvements14 this perspective gained additional tracti on in the wake of pakistans catastrophic october 2005 earthquake when islamabad c hose to postpone and eventually scale down the number of f16s it would seek to purchase as noted above congressional concerns bout pakistans nuclear proliferation activities are longstanding some opponents of resumed f16 sales argue that the united states should not provide sophisticat ed weapons to

uraniumenrichment materials to north korea libya and iran to date pakistan re fuses to allow any direct access to khan by nonpakistani investigators and in may 2006 the isla mabad government declared the khan investigation closed some in congre ss remain skeptical however and house panel subsequently held hearing to furthe r discuss the issue at that hearing non governmental experts urged that us and international investig ators be given direct access to khan in particular to learn more about assistance given to irans controversial nuc lear program15 military implications the importance of the proposed transfer of new f16s and the upgrade of pakistans legacy f16s can be viewed in the context of pakistans conventional military confrontation with india its nuclear confrontation with that country and its struggle with terrorists and insurgents india dominated the air when it last cl ashed with pakistan in 1971 according to some accounts pakistani air strikes we re largely ineffective and air support of ground forces was nonexistent16 india currently enjoys significant quantitative advantage over pakistans air force it has 21 more figh ter squadrons than pakistan and larger number 124 of modern aircraft india operates an aircraft carrier with shorttake off and vertical landing fighters in terms of quality the f16 block 5052 aircraft appears to be roughl equivalent to indias most advanced combat aircraft the russianmade su3017 unlike pakistan however india supports its combat aircraft with aerial refueling electronic counter measures and modern air borne warning and control aircraft18 the sale of 36 f16s to pakistan and the upgrade of existing f16s would increase that countrys numbe r of modern combat aircraft but would still not

state june 18 2002it close to parity with india if india we re to add f16s or fa18s to its inventory the disparity in aviation capabilities betw een the two countries would grow even more some express concern that pakistan c ould use its new f16s to deliver nuclear weapons the overall potential impact on nuc lear deterrence and stability in south asia of additional pakistani f16s however appears unclear first because the 32 f16s that pakistan already fields are be lieved to be nuclear capable additional f16s dont appear to introduce new capabilities but may expand existing ones second pakistan also fields nuclearcapable ballistic missiles some believe that ballistic missiles add instability to the security equati on because they are high priority targets and consequently the pressure to use them early in conflict can be great19 thus if additional nuclearcapable f16s were to replace exis ting nuclearcapable ballistic missiles in pakistans arsenal some may argue that additional f16s could reduce nuclear instability some suggest that pakistan could use f16s against terrorists and insurgents it appears that f16s could be used in such operations but they could also be considered overdesigned for these tasks the block 5052 variant that is being proposed for export is the most advanced version of the f16 flown by us military forces it incorporates advanced weapons and avionics for ai rtoair combat that appear unnecessary for counterinsurgen cy operations less expensive and less sophisticated aircraft ch as attack helicopters unmanned aerial vehicles and combat search and rescue aircraft would appear to have greater utility in combating insurgents and other nonstate actors than supersonic fi ghter aircraft20 according to the indian defense minister the f16 and other lethal weapons are not required for fighting terrorism and are used in fullfledged wars give n pakistans track record we fear that such weapons w ill be directed toward india21 combat aircraft proliferation combat aircraft are considered esse ntial for conducting surprise attacks or initiating largescale offensive operations22 therefore the transfer of combat aircraft can be significant policy deci sion especially to region with known tensions and territorial disputes the sale of f16 block 5052 aircraft to pakistan will upgrade its inventory of this fighter but may not completely fulfill its perceived need for highly advanced current generation combat fighter wh ile financing the purchase of two different fighter aircraft could be pr oblematic for pakistan some in

gripen multi role fighter should the united states sell the f16 to pakistan sweden would reportedly offer to sell the gripen thus it seems unlikely that the united states will become pakistans principal supplie r of advanced combat aircraft23 the reported us willingness to sell f16s or fa18s to india may mitigate that countrys disappointment with any rene wed us arms sales to pakistan and neutralize any increase in pakistans military capability india may also use the prospect of the purchase of us fighters as leverage in negotiations with its primary military supplier russia to obtain more s ophisticated systems better financing or additional licensed production options for its domestic defense industry should india choose to purchase us fighters it ma seek not just the aircraft and support services but some form of coproduction or coassembly options prospect that would raise policy questions for the united states regarding the release of military technology and how such information might be used by india this is particularly important given indias ambitions to develop significant aerospace production capability and its past and present aerosp ace acquisitions from russia france the united kingdom and israel24 us industrial base much of the commentary following the june 28th announcement centered on how potential sale of aircraft to pakistan and possibly to india would be beneficial to industry the potential benefits most frequently mentioned were extending the production life of us airc raft with limited domestic pr ospects and improving us industrys position visavis other rivals in an increasingly competitive military export market after decades of succe ssful production the f16 production line appears to be approaching its end as currently projected the f16 production line which employs approximately 5000 work ers could close in 2008 sale of 36 or more f16s to pakistan could keep the line open for another year25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33515crs9 26 ibidthe larger prize however is poten tial sale to india and the consequent opening of market longclosed to us i ndustry india is seeking larger number of combat aircraft than pakistan 126 and has much larger inventory of combat aircraft approximately 700 that it will eventually need to replace us companies are contending with competitively priced russian and european aircraft for share of the global military aircraft market penetrating the indian market and beating european competitors could many believe help us companies compete in other aircraft export markets also it is argued that aircraft sales to india could prove tip of the iceberg for all types of military exports to that country india has embarked on longterm plan to upgrade its armaments and strengthen its military and some say that high on its list are early warning and missile defense systems nuclear fuel and technologies and spacerelated technologies26 questions remain about the potentia l domestic us benefit from these prospective sales while preserving us jobs appears clearly beneficial the number of jobs preserved and the value of those jobs remains unclear india would likely demand that the majority of aircraft be pr oduced in india this would increase jobs in india and reduce jobs in the united states also some say not all jobs are equal in terms of their benefit to the us i ndustrial base producing for india and pakistan the exact same aircraft that is currently being produced in the united states would preserve assembly linetype jobs many argue this would do little to advance innovation or make us indus try more competitive only if the exported aircraft require noteworthy design and engineering changes they say would these skills be developed to be nefit the of i ndustrial base
