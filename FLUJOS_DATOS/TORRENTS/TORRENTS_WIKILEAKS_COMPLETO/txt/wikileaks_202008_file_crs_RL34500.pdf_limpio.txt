federal law bars aliens residing without authorization in the united states from most federal benefits however there is widely held perception that many unauthorized aliens obtain such benefits the degree to which unauthorized resident aliens should be accorded certain rights and privileges as result of their residence in the united states along with the duties owed by such aliens given their presence remains the subject of intense debate in congress this report focuses on the policy and legislative debate surrounding unauthorized aliens access to federal benefits except for narrow set of specified emergency services and programs unauthorized aliens are not eligible for federal public benefits the law 401c of pl 104193 defines federal public benefit as any grant contract loan professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the united states or by appropriated funds of the united states and any retirement welfare health disability public or assist ed housing postsecondary education food assistance unemployment benefit or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual household or family eligibility unit by an agency of the united states or by appropriated funds of the united states the actual number of unauthorized aliens in the united states is unknown according to demographer jeffrey passels calculations based on the 2005 march current population survey cps there were approximately 111 million unauthorized aliens residing in the united states the most recent analysis with detailed statistical breakdowns passel further estimated the number of persons living in families in which the head of the household or the spouse was an unauthorized alien was 146 million there were 66 million unauthorized families which he defines as family unit or solo individual in which the head or spouse is unauthorized noteworthy portion of the households headed by unauthorized aliens are likely to have us citizen children as well as spouses who may be legal permanent residents lprs these mixed status families represent about onethird of all unauthorized families and five out of six unauthorized families with children as of march 2005 policy researcher steven camarota concludes based on his estimates drawn from the 2 002 cps that the us citizen children of unauthorized aliens account for much of the costs associated with illegal migration although the law appears straightforward the policy on unauthorized aliens access to federal benefits is peppered with ongoing controversies and debates some center on demographic issues eg how to treat mixedimmigration status families others explore unintended consequences most notably when tightening up the identification requirements results in denying benefits to us citizens still others are debates about how broadly the clause federal public benefit should be implemented this report will be updated if policy changes

national of the united states orif not citizen or nationalthat he or she is an alien in satisfactory immigration status 17 however many health education nutrition inco support and social service programs did not include specific provisions regarding alien eligibility and unauthorized aliens were potential participants18 these programs included for example the special supplemental nutrition

defined in statute historically it has been used to provide benefit to certain foreign nationals who the government knows are present in the united states but whom it has plans to deport or remove considered by many to be an obsolete construct prucol recently began re emerging in the context of quasilegal aliens prior to1996 eligibility for federal benefits depended on how the prucol standards were interpreted many service providers had construed prucol narrowly to include only those aliens here under certain specific statutory authorizations during the 1970s federal court however disagreed with these narrow interpretations in holley v lavine the united states court of appeals for the second circuit held that when legislative body uses the term under color of law it deliberately sanctions the inclusion of cases that are in strict terms outside the law but are near the border 19 at that time the court concluded that the prucol standard for aid for families with dependent

the years the united states however does not require its citizens to have legal documents that verify their citizenship and identity ie national identification cards although some assert that the united states has facto identification cards in the form of social security cards and drivers licenses or state identification cards none of these documents establishes citizenship 44 the us passport is one of the few documents that certifies that the individual is us citizen indeed for most us citizens it is the only document they possess that verifies both their citizenship and identity until recently selfattestation of citizenship was generally accepted for most government purposes false claims of citizenship have long been an illicit avenue for benefit fraud and as result are considered crime in general 1015 of the united states criminal code criminalizes acts of fraud relating to naturalization citizenship or alien registry specifically it is criminal offense for person to knowingly make any false statement or claim that he is or at any time has been citizen or national of the united states with the intent to obtain for himself or another any federal or state benefit or service or to engage unlawfully in employment in the united states 45 the ina also makes misrepresentation eg falsely claiming us citizenship ground for inadmissibility46 congress enacted in recent years several specific laws aimed directly at these perceived loopholes of citizenship selfattestation and identity document integrity in terms of document integrity for example the real id act pl 10913

that they actually receive benefits are not available that said there are few program evaluations and investigations as well as demographic projections that attempt to address this thorny issue 49 the most recent us department of labor dol study available for example estimated that 380 million in unemployment compensation u c was paid to unauthorized aliens in fy200250 in total the uc program expended 538 billion that same year51 in determining eligibility for uc the state agency requires that any individual applying for uc under penalty of perjury declare in writing whether or not he or she is citizen or national of the united states if the individual is not citizen or national the individual must present documentation from the uscis containing the individuals alien admission number or alien file number or such other documents as the state determines constitute reasonable evidence indicating satisfactory immigration status immigration status is supposed to be verified through the sa ve program 52 the dol concluded the largest reason for making the error involved the states failure to use information it had in hand to determine that this information definitely pointed to an eligibility issue 53 the dol study does not provide sufficient detail to determine the extent that these unauthorized alien beneficiaries were quasilegal migrants who had eads and ssns 47 the act

additionally included programs that unauthorized aliens are eligible fo r such as emergency medicaid and school lunch he concluded many of the costs associated with illegals are due to their americanborn children who are awarded us citizenship at birth greater efforts at barring illegals from federal programs will not reduce costs because their citizen children can continue to access them

an illustrative sampling of these issues g22g155g142g138g157g150g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g15g146g161g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g8g138g150g146g149g146g142g156g561 whether an unauthorized alien who is the head of house is permitted to be the payee of federal benefit for us citizen children varies across programs most statutes are silent on the matter because the benefit is paid directly to the eligible individual in the case of food stamps the assistance unit is household typically those living together who also purchase and prepare food together the value of food stamps allocated to mixedimmigration status family is based only on those family members who are eligible but includes the income of ineligible family 54 us department of agriculture characteristics of food

do not bar an unauthorized alien head of house from applying for and obtaining the prorated food stamp benefit on behalf of eligible family members the supplemental security income ssi program while not expressly barring them sets barrier for unauthorized alien parents to be the payees of ssi benefits for their us citizen children more precisely the social security act requires an investigation into potential representative payee to determine his or her suitability and as part of this investigation verify the social security account number or employer identification number of such person 59 this provision is somewhat analogous to requirement that taxpayers claiming the eitc provide their ssn and the ssn of any qualifying child60

fully above have biometric identification documents and their eligibility for federal benefits may be confirmed through the sa ve system congress has already enacted strong incentives for states to issue enhanced drivers licenses edls that indicate country of citizenship requiring that the social security administration issue ssns that may be used to verify immigration status and citizenship is another option proponents of expanding the documentary requirements to include proof of us citizenship assert that it is the most effective way to stop ineligible aliens from making false claims of us citizenship secondary argument is one of equal treatment that is it levels the playing field by holding us citizens to the same documentary requirements as foreign nationals medicaid provides an excellent example because as noted earlier citizenship documentation requirement was added in 2006 to supersede the selfdeclaration of citizenship status 61 medicaid now requires that state obtain satisfactory documentation of citizenship and identity to determine eligibility 62 when the us government accountability office gao evaluated the new requirement in 2007 it found only limited information about the extent to which the requirement deterred aliens who were not qualified from applying for medicaid these findings were consistent with the 2005 us department of health and human services hhs office of inspector general oig report on state selfattestation policies which did not find problems regarding false allegations of citizenship 63 rather the gao found evidence of inadvertent denials of persons who appeared to be us citizens twentytwo of the 44 states reported declines in medicaid enrollment due to the requirem ent and majority of these states attributed the declines to delays in or losses of medicaid coverage for individuals who appeared to be eligible citizens64 58 6 of the food stamp act 7 usc 2015 59 1631a2biiii of the social security act presumab ly

to be quite broad see the current federal law section above yet its implementation across federal public benefits is not uniform an excellent example of this ambiguity centers on tax refunds as noted earlier the internal revenue code generally does not distinguish between resident aliens who are lawfully present in the united states and those who are not with the exception of the eitc it appears that the internal revenue service irs permits unauthorized resident aliens to claim the additional child tax credit 66 there is indication moreover that the irs generally considers refundable tax credits to be federal public benefits that unauthorized migrants are barred from receiving67 it is possible that refundable tax credits could fall within the types of benefits described by 401 under this interpretation the refundable nature of credit makes it equivalent to grant or payment or assistance provided by federal agency or appropriated funds refundable tax credits as some elaborate are being provided to an individual family or eligibility unit and thus could be classified as federal public benefit under 401 of prwora 68
