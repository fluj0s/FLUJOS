is an activity steeped in parliamentary complexity while this report analyzes the evolution of voting beginning with the legislative reorganization act of 1970 lra some house rules related to voting have existed since the first congress the house has had nearly 220 years of experience with voting that manifests itself in precedents relevant today the lra contained two major departures related to record voting first it authorized development of an electroni c voting system second it allowed record votes in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union the form in which the house usually operates to c onsider amendments to legislation since the lras enactment there have been notable developments in record voting procedures in the house in gene ral the house through rules changes and precedents has limited votes that might be view ed as dilatory rather than substantive and has expanded opportunities for votes th at might be viewed as substantive changes in rules have also authorized th presiding officer to postpone and cluster votes and to reduce voting time to five minutes largely ended pairing and allowed delegates and the resident commissioner to vote in the committee of the whole policy announcements by the speaker and ru lings by presiding officers have ended the correction of members votes sought to limit the duration of votes and dictated the manner by which members may change vote once cast controversies have arisen on occasion so were related to the use of the electronic voting system some to members being able to cast or change vote after the 15minute minimum votingtime had expired others were related to perception that vote had been held open beyond reasonable amount of time only very few controversies have resu lted in an investigation the standards of official conduct committee has made th ree investigations select committee is currently investigating the manner by which vote was ended should the house wish to address rules precedents or practices or the sources of particular contr oversies it has number of possibl vehicles and potential options vehicles include house and party rules the speakers policies and administrative policies changes might be made to the electronic voting system operations on the speakers dais members ability to vote after the 15minute minimum and other aspects of voting in the

report is to discuss how the house has adapted to exigencies in conducting record votes and to analyze the occasion and resolution of controvers ies that have arisen the house in the 110th congress adopted rules change that sought to terminate record votes in manner that allowed all members to vote but did not purposely reverse an alreadyestablished outcome2 yet vote taken on august 2 2007 resulted in the house establishing select committee to investigate the termination of that vote the third purpose of this re port is to identify options and mechanisms available to the house if it

congressional record vol continuedon the second matter record votes in the committee of the whole the house through its history had continued to follow ancient british practice the committee of the whole originated in the time of the stuarts when taxation arrayed the crown against the commons and suspicion made the speaker talebearer to the king to avoid the chairs espionage the commons met in secret elected chairman in whom it had confidence and without fear of the king freely exch anged its views respecting supplies the informality of its procedure survived the occasion for secrecy in the house of representatives6 by rule and practice the committee of the whole house continues today to use separate set of procedures from those of the house before the lras enactment however the forms of votes available in the committee of the whole were voice division and teller the house rule in the 91st congress on voting which continued largely intact from the first congress7 stated the speakershall put questions in this form to wit as many as are in favor as the question may be say aye and after the affirmative voice is expressed as many as are opposed say if he doubts or division is called for the house shall divide those in the affirma tive of the question shall first rise from their seats and then those in the negative if he still doubts or count is required by at least onefifth of quorum he shall name one from each side of the question to tell the members in the affirmative and negative which being reported he shall rise and state the decision8 tell here was used to mean count or enumerate as explained by one member in debate on the lra the teller vote was conceived as method of voting the will of the people while escaping the wrath of powerful and vengeful

of the amendment made by subsection a13 republican representative mcclory and bipartisan proponents argued for the efficiency that an electronic voting system would bring to the house an oral rollcall vote typically consumed more than 30 nutes while vote using an automated system was anticipated to require half that much time advocates also noted that oral roll calls consumed too much time as the house work load increased and that changes in the lra could further increase the number of rollcall votes some members having served in state legislatures offered their experiences with automated systems as testament to the efficiency to be gained14 one member recalled an investigation of ghost voting the previous year and the recommendation from the standards of official c onduct committee for new voting system15 one spoke against automated voting durin g debate on the mcclory amendment several members commented on the use of may rather than shall in the wording of the amendment the names ofmembers may be recorded through the use of appropriate electronic equipment emphasis added representative mcclory responded to question on the word choice as follows the word may is in there so that the house through its organized committees can proceed to complete its work and so that we can record votes in that way however under my amendmen t it would not be necessary to record votes and roll calls electronically nor would we necessarily record all votes in that way these are questions to be determined at later time when details of the system are worked

amendmen ts could be offere d but not debated61 members opposed to the proposed change argued that it would return votes on important amendments in the committee of the whole to the secrecy that existed before recorded teller votes were allowed representative robert bauman argued i think the 20member rule is valuab right of the minority any minority when many members seek to avoid rollcall vote on hot issue such as congressional pay raise at least 20 members can force rollcallunder this new proposal i predict what will happen quorum will be established and then the chair will require 40 members to get vote on any given issue and we will never get rollcall if it is on very unpopular matter62 after agreeing 252147 to the gross amendmen t the house agreed to the resolution as amended63 however change included in the rules adopted by the house for the 96th congress 19791981 increased the number of members needed to support request for recorded vote in the committee of the whole the number was increased to 25 from 20 with the addition of new paragraph b to rule xxiii cl 2 together with new restrictions on quorum calls incorporated into clause 2 the change was justified as means

haysmr speaker someone face tiously asked minute ago if we would have system for retrieval of mbers who voted and rushed out of the chamber before the respective leadership on either side can latch onto them i can say to the gentleman there is plan for such retrieval system mr ashbrooki think what is going to happen is that we are going to see the passage of one of the most timehonored traditions around this house that is the system of putting pressure on members to change their votes in the well i think we have to be aware of the fact that member can vote and instantly leave the chamber i just asked the gentleman from ohio mr hays whether something can be done to equip the leadership w ith the proper tools maybe tracking device mr hays that is really leadership problem it will be possible for members to come into the back of the room and vote and go on their way mr ashbrook that might help our processes142 representative barber b conable jr stated that the current system discouraged members from changing their votes since the changes were reported he asked whether the new system would lead to strategic maneuvering on close votes to allow partys leadership to cloak from the other side where the votes are chairman hays acknowledged the possi bility and suggested several potential responses including programming change s and having members announce changes in the well of the house that would then be recorded mr conable also asked about the recording of members transactions with the electronic voting system chairman hays responded that all actions

the electronic voting system as giant stride toward greater efficiency and enlarged confidence in the work of the house he admonished his colleagues i must caution my colleagues that the in stallation of this system opens other doors which are not necessarily desirable there is always the possibility the new system could be abused or misuse d for example it could lead to the practice of ghost voting such as happened recently in the state government of pennsylvania where votes were cast for members of the general assembly who were not on the floor or in one instance even the country i urge my colleagues to support this improvement in house pr ocedure but emphasize we must guard against any misuse of the new system which could tend to destroy the credibility of congress in the eyes of the public146 speakers announcements anticipating electronic voting on january 3 1973 speaker albert announced that there would be delay in implementing the electronic voting system noting the need to

to re spond clause 5 of rule xv states that members have not less than 15 minutes to have their presence recorded152 since this clause was also incorporated by reference in rule xxiii pertaining to

policy on voting was as follows as members are aware clause 5 of rule xv provides that members shall have not less than 15 minutes from the ordering of the rollcall or quorum call to have their vote or presence recorded while the rule obviously states minimum rather than maximum time requirement for electronic votes and while occupant of the chair would attempt to prevent member who is in the chamber at the expiration of that time from casting his or her vote the chair has noticed that in the past session inordinate delays in concluding elect ronic votes or quorum calls would occur when members would notify the chair th rough the cloakrooms that they were on their way to the chamber from variety of locations the chair would encourage all members to depart for the chamber promptly upon the appropriate bell and light signal since there is guarantee that members can rely upon telephoned notice to the cloakrooms in order to have votes held open as indicated by his remarks on this subject on october 13 1990 the minority leader joins the chair in urging all members to help avoid the unnecessary loss of time in conducting the business of the house162 the speaker continued this policy in the 103rd congress 19931995 with the addition of proscription the speaker is advising the cloakroom s that they should not forward to the chair individual requests to hold open vote by

appropriate bell and light signal as in recent congresses the cloakrooms should not forward to the chair requests to hold vote by electronic device but should simply apprise inquiring members of the

the general nature of the bailout legislation while itin its present form would have an immedi ate effect on only one state the reported bill comprehends all states and territori in the second part

of member to vote229 speaker oneill made similar ruling on point of order in the 96th congress 19791981 that member named in re solution to expel him from the house should not vote on questions related to the resolution the speaker stated because the chair severely doubts his authority to deprive the constitutional right of member to vote and because of the overwhelming weight of precedent

based upon the explanation received from the chairman of the committee on house administration and from the clerk the chair will continue to presume the reliability of the electronic device so long as

members of the house251 the matter that the constitutionality of delegates and the resident commissioner voting on committees had not been established the disparity in population among the territories puerto ri co and the district of columbia and between the territories and congressional districts and the return of federal income tax receipts to the territories and puerto rico some members also argued that practically the votes of the delegates and resident commissi oner would be sought to build majority and politically the change reduced the republicans election gains by half since the

members should be aware that although the digital voting system used by the house of representatives is very reliable it is not perfect i have been assured by both the chairman of the committee on house administration and the clerks office that they are thoroughly investiga ting the incident and that it does appear to be true statistical anomaly which is unlikely to occur again finally while i was mistakenly recorded as voting aye on the amendment had i been present i would have voted nay305 also on june 26 the presiding officer asked unanimous consent that the congressional record be corrected to reflect that representative roybalallard was not present and had not voted dur ing roll call 305 on june 21 2000 as stated by the chairman of the co mmittee on house administration on friday june 23 2000 the clerk has informed the committee on house administration of recent anomaly on recorded vote representative roybalallard was absent on rollcall number 305 on june 21 2000 and was in possession of her voting card the clerk was made aware of the fact that she was recorded on that rollcall but on others on that day but due to the lateness of the hour could not get confirmation from her by the time the vote was made public that she was absent and in possession of her voting card since then the clerk has received that confirmation for that reason and the sta tistical improbability of the recurrence of that anomaly the chair and th chairman of the committee on house administration believe that it is proper to immediately correct the record and the journal as stated in volume 14 section 32 of deschlerbrown precedents since the inception of the electronic syst em the speaker has resisted attempts to permit corrections to the electronic tally after announcement of vote this policy is based upon the presumptive reliability of electronic device sic and upon the responsibility of each member to correctly cast and verify his or her vote based upon the explanation received from the chairman of the committee on house administration and from the clerk the chair will continue to presume the reliability of the electronic device so long as the clerk is able to give that level of assurance which justifies continuing presumption of its integrity without objection the chair will permit the immediate correction of the record and journal under the

record voting electronic voting has been in use for 35 years in the house of representatives however members have been casting votes in other ways for over 200 years the process for voting has remained relatively unchanged in all that time and the problems associated with voting have been relatively rare nevertheless matter how infrequently problems occur when they do the ramifications within the chamber can reverberate for days or ev longer whether changes to voting procedures are warranted or even necessary is open to discussion pursuant to hres 611371 the select committee to investigate the voting irregularities of august 2 2007 is authoriz ed to recommend changes to the rules and procedures of the house related to votin g accordingly this section discusses possible issues and options related to voting in the house the options range from making changes to complete overhaul in the procedures for conducting votes in the chamber some options are explored in detail while others are presented only as questions to be considered fu rther some options or vari ations of those options may appear under more than one heading the headings are not listed in an order indicating their importance vehicles for effecting chang related to record voting if the house chooses to make any changes to its voting protocol there are several options available to effect such changes each may carry its own advantages and disadvantageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34570crs101 372 for example hres 491 agreed to in the house june 18 20 07 governs earmark disclosure in conference

suggestions for rules changes in the late summer or fall prior to an election the majority members of the ru committee with input from the majority leadership consolidate and evaluate the suggestions any changes to voting processes could be included in this openingday rules package historically the rules resolution fo r new congress has most often been numbered either hres 5 or hres 6 the rules package is usually considered for one hour as an indivisible and unamendable entity although that has not always been the case it is therefore difficult to chan ge any part of the resolution the minority party routinely offers an alternative rules package but that normally fails on party line vote on occasion house rules are changed by the adoption of resolution on day other than opening day372 again such resolution would likely be debatable for one hour and amendments would ra rely be made in order house rules changes can also be effected by socalled self executing or hereby provision in related or unrelated special rule this process would allow the rules change to be made without vote on the change itself373 in addition although rarely successful measure making changes to house rules could be brought up for consideration through the use of discharge petition either discharging the measure itself or discharging special rule making it in order to consider resolution embodying the rules change unanimous consent it is possible to effect minor changes in the standing rules by unanimous consent rulemaking statute congress may enact statutes setting forth rules and

the house after the date of such conviction speakers policies following tradition beginning in th 1980s speaker nancy pelosi announced policies on certain aspects of the legislative process at the beginning of the new congress one policy dealt with votin g by electronic device the speakers announced policies for the 110th congress appeared in the congressional record daily edition on january 5 2007 on pages h59h61 6 conduct of votes by electronic device the speakers policy announced on january 4 1995 with respect to the conduct of electronic votes will continue in the 110th congress with modifications as follows as members are aware clause 2a of rule xx provides that members shall have not less than 15 minutes in which to answ er an ordinary record vote or quorum call the rule obviously establishes 15 minutes as minimum still with the cooperation of the members vote can easily be completed in that time the events of october 30 1991 stand out as proof of this point on that occasion the house was considering bill in the co mmittee of the whole under special rule that placed an overall time limit on the amendment process including the time consumed by record votes the chair announced and then strictly enforced policy of closing electronic votes as soon as possible after the guaranteed period of 15 minutes members appreciated and cooperated with the chairs enforcement of the policy on that occasion the chair desires that the example of october 30 1991 be made the regular practice of the house to that end th chair enlists the assistance of all members in avoiding the unnecessary loss of time in conducting the business of the house the chair encourages all members to depart for the chamber promptly upon the appropriate bell and light signal as in recent congresses the cloakrooms should not forward to the chai r requests to hold vote by electronic device but should simply apprise inqui ring members of the time remaining on the voting clock members should not re ly on signals relayed from outside the chamber to assume that votes will be he ld open until they arrive in the chamber members will be given reasonable amount of time in which to accurately record their votes occupant of the chair would prevent member who is in the well before the announcement of th result from casting his or her votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34570crs121 393 this report is available as crs report 98228 as it appears here it was updated may 19 2008appendix b house voting procedures forms and requirements walter j oleszek government and finance division393 voting is among the most public acts of representatives generally members try not to miss vote because it is an im portant demonstration to their constituents that they are always on the job procedural considerations suffuse voting and thus it is important to understand the methods of voting in both the house and in the committee of the whole where much of the chambers business is conducted in the house there are four ways for lawmakers to obtain vote in the house they are voice votes divi sion votes yea and nay votes and recorded votes voice vote this means that lawmakers call out yea or nay when question is first put by the speaker or speaker pro tempore as rule i clause 6 states the speaker will first say those in favor of the question say aye then the speaker will ask those opposed say voice vote can be quick and easy but it is sometimes difficult for the speaker to determine based on the volume of each response whether more lawmakers shouted aye compared to those who shouted division vote rule xx clause 1a states that if the speaker is uncertain about the outcome of voice vote or if mber demands division the house shall divide those in favor of the question shall first rise from their seats to be counted and then those who are opposed to the pr oposition shall stand to be count ed this procedure is reasonably accurate and takes only few minutes but it does not provide public record of how each member voted only vote totals 95 for 65 against for instance are announced in this seldomemployed method of voting yea and nay vote the constitution article i section 5 declares that the yeas and nays of the memberson any stion shall be obtained at the desire of one fifth of those present under th is provision it does not matter if quorum of the house 218 members is not pres ent to conduct business which the constitution requires because any member can say mr speaker on that vote i demand the yeas and nays if the demand is supported by onefifth of those present the speaker will say the yeas and nays are ordered there is also an automatic yea and na or rollcall vote provided in house rule xx clause 6 for example if it is evident to lawmaker that quorum is not present in the chamber he or she may object to vote on that ground and automatically vote will be ordered by the chair to request an automatic vote member says i object to the vote on th ground that quorum is not present and i make point of order that quorum is not present the actual vote will thenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34570crs122 simultaneously determine both issues the presence of quorum and the vote on the pending question clause 10 of rule xx also states that the yeas and nays shall be considered as ordered on final passage of limited number of measures or matters such as concurrent budget resolutions the constitution requires that votes to override presidential vetoes shall be determined by the yeas and nays recorded vote under rule xx clause 1b if any member delegate or resident commissioner requests recorded vote and that request is supported by at least onefifth of quorum such vote shall be taken by electronic device yea and nay and recorded votes are all taken by electronic device employed since 1973 unless the computerized voting system malfunctions then standby procedures outlined in rule xx clause 2b are used to conduct the votes to obtain recorded vote member states mr speaker on that i demand recorded vote if at least onefifth of quorum of 218 or 44 mbers stand and support the request then the recorded vote will be taken by ectronic device recall that the distinction between recorded votes and the yeas and nays goes to the number of members required to support each request onefifth of those present for the yeas and nays and onefifth of quorum 44 of 218 for recorded votes in the committee of the whole three methods of voting are available in the committee of the whole voice division nd recorded yea and nay votes are not permitted in the committee either the constitutional or automatic forms in short there is only one way to obtain reco rded vote in the committee where quorum is 100 members and it is ou tlined in rule xv iii clause 6e this rule of the house states the chairman shall order recorded vote on request supported by at least 25 members thus any member may say i request recorded vote and if 25 lawmakers the member who made the request can be part of the tally too rise to be counted by the chair the reco rded vote will occur by electronic device alternatively lawmaker who plans to request recorded vote even though few members are present in the chamber will usually say mr chairman i request recorded vote and pending that i make point of order that quorum is not present once the chair ascerta ins that quorum is not present there is an immediate quorum call and the member who requested the recorded vote can ask 24 other colleagues to support his request as they come onto the floor length of time for voting under rule xx clause 2a the minimum time for record vote by electronic device is 15 minutes in either the house or the committee of the whole the 15minute period is the minimum rather than the maximum time allowed for the conduct of recorded vote the chair has the discretion to hold the vote open longer new 110th rule states that votes are not to be held open for the sole purpose of revers ing the outcome of vote however this rule seems difficult to interpret in practice there are also occasions in the house see rule xx clause 9 when the speaker has the discretion to reduce the voting time to not less than five minutes the speaker so has the authority under rule xx clause 8 to postpone and cluster certain votes votes in the committee of the whole may also be reduced to five minutes as noted in rule xviii clause 6 fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34570 crs123 appendix c points of order relating to voting in the 110th congress to compile the list of points of order in the 110th congress

was held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome the acting chairman the chair has considered whether the new sentence in clause 2a of rule xx should be enforceable in real time the black letter of the rule is not dispositive it uses the mandatory shall it might just as well say should inasmuch as it is setting standard of behavior for presiding officers for this reason the chair thinks it more sensib to enforce the rule on collateral bases as by question of the privileges of the house set of w hereas clauses in the preamble of resolution could allege the facts and circumstances tending to indicate violation more coherently than they could be articulated in argument on point of order or in deba on an appeal the resolving clause of resolution could propose fitting remedy rather than requiring the instant selection of remedy in the face of competing demands for vitiation of the putative result reversal of the putative result or admonishment of the presiding officer the chair finds that the new sent ence in clause 2a of rule xx does not establish point of order having an immediate procedural remedy rather than contemplating ruling from the chair in real time the language should be underst ood to establish standard of behavior for presiding officers that might be enforced on collateral bases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34570 crs125 appendix d
