updated march 13 2006 michael m simpson specialist in life sciences resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress methamphetamine lab cleanup and remediation issues summary methamphetamine meth drug with limited medical use and high potential for abuse and addiction is subject of widespread concern once associated mainly with the west coast and white male bluecollar workers illicit meth is now used by diverse population groups nationwide with concentrations in the west southwest and midwest meth is supplied primarily by clandestine labs in california and mexico the drug is relatively simple to make from easily obtained recipes but access to certain ingredients has become more difficult meth production in small toxic labs stls increased initially due to the successful closure of some superlabs labs capable of making more than 10 pounds of meth in 24hour cycle relative ease of making meth continuing demand for the drug and desire for potential wealth and involvement in criminal underground social activity although the greater fraction of meth used and distributed across the nation comes from superlabs the sheer number of stls their geographic diffusion and their residual impacts have prompted concern in congress state and local governments law enforcement agencies and real estate and other groups meth labs have many significant and widespread residual impacts according to the united states drug enforcement administration dea there were 9092 stls and related meth sites in 2000 and 17356 in 2003 the number has been declining since these sites can be found in wide range of places such as apartments motel rooms abandoned buildings and packed in car trunks in parks and other locations meth makers can use common items such as mason jars coffee filters hot plates overthecounter medications containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine eg sudafed and some other nonprescription decongestants acetone hydrochloric acid and anhydrous ammonia making meth can result in eye and respiratory irritations chemical burns explosions and fires toxic wastes and contaminated surroundings some residual impacts of meth production threaten the health and welfare of children removed from meth sites this report focuses on the residual environmental impacts of stls cleaning and remediating meth site can cost more than 200000 depending on the magnitude of contamination state and local governments that incur expenses cleaning site can apply to the us environmental protection agency epa for reimbursement up to 25000 per incident alternatively rather than incur costs and apply for capped reimbursement state and local governments can notify dea of site and dea will perform and pay for cleaning in addition funds have been available from the department of housing and urban development hud to redevelop former meth production site uniform federal guidelines or standards exist governing the process or the endpoint for cleaning or remediating stls across various states acceptable levels of meth residue after remediation range from 005 to 01 micrograms of meth per 100 square centimeters of surface twelve

societal diffusion of the illicit production of methamphetamine meth has spread hazardous manufacturing wastes and related concerns into communities nationwide the need to reduce the potential safety health and environmental hazards of these wastes by cleaning and remediating the sites of illicit production consequently also has spread nationwide cleanup is the term often used to describe removing gross or largescale contaminants such as equipment and large quantities of chemicals cleanup is usually done for the purpose of securing evidence for criminal investigations and for reducing imminent hazards such as explosions or fires remediation is often used to describe removing residual or smallscale contaminants such as chemical residues in carpeting or walls usually for the purpose of rehabilitating facility for reoccupancy or reuse while there are many ways to make meth the most common way begins with overthecounter medications containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine1 and often involves cooking with acetone hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide ether and anhydrous ammonia to serially concentrate and purify the meth cooking meth which can result in eye and respiratory irritations chemical burns explosions and fires toxic waste products and contaminated surroundings can be dangerous to the meth cook to the people and community around the lab and to those persons who first come upon the lab such as fire fighters law enforcement officials emergency medical technicians or social welfare workers there are reports of emergency medical technicians and police officers suffering burns eye and respiratory irritations nausea and other injuries not just at meth labs but even from treating persons removed from the labs2 depending on the process used and the skill of the cook each pound of meth produces about six pounds of hazardous waste illicit meth cooks usually dump this waste into sewers streams rivers or the ground near the lab which may be farmland or land over groundwater supplies along highways in parks and forests or on hiking trails water used to extinguish lab fires also carries toxic chemicals into the environment cooking meth can also infuse carpeting walls furniture water 1 pseudoephedrine for example is an active ingredient in products like sudafed and some other overthecounter decongestants 2 united states department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention public health consequences among first responders to emergency events associated with illicit methamphetamine laboratories at httpwwwcdcgovmmwr previewmmwrhtmlmm4945a1htm crs2 supplies and the ground with toxic chemicals3 residues of meth have been measured as high as 16000 micrograms per 100 square centimeters of surface with levels as high as 300 micrograms per 100 square centimeters as long as six months after the last cook sometimes far from the actual cooking area4 while health effects on user from direct use of meth have been wellstudied longterm healtheffects research on exposures to substances associated with illicit meth production has just recently begun such healtheffects research considers impacts on children as well as on adults who might be in the vicinity of meth making site there are uniform federal guidelines or standards governing the cleanup or remediation of former meth sites either for meth residues themselves or for chemicals related to illicit meth production partly because there is lack of health effects research upon which to base such guidelines or standards guidelines as used in this report are discretionary recommendations often using the word should standards are mandatory nondiscretionary regulations which must be followed often denoted by words like shall or prohibited guidelines may be developed by regulators into more stringent standards there generally have been four main approaches to cleaning meth sites the united states environmental protection agency epa can respond directly when pollutant or contaminant at an stl site presents an imminent or substantial danger to public health or welfare but most stls do not rise to this level5 for most stls state and local governments can pay to clean meth site then apply to epa for reimbursement which is capped at 25000 per incident alternatively rather than pay directly for cleanup and later apply for reimbursement from epa state and local governments instead can notify the united states drug enforcement administration dea in the united states department of justice and dea will take responsibility and arrange for cleanup in addition there have been funds available from the department of housing and urban development hud to redevelop of former meth site the approaches to remediate meth sites are more variable involving private local and state decisions remediation is an additional cost after cleanup neither epa nor dea funds are available for remediation owners of contaminated private 3 united

section below on cleanup and remediation procedures remediation costs vary depending on the severity of contamination with meth andor methrelated compounds the average cost to clean meth lab is estimated to range from 1500 to 3000 with some cleanups exceeding 2000006 the cost of remediating an averagesize site has been estimated at 50000 according to the us department of justice7 several factors contribute to the geographic and societal diffusion of illicit meth production and use background methamphetamine meth is schedule ii narcotic under the controlled substances act csa title ii

production cycle in mexico and the united states producing meth and other drugs with vast networks of transporters distributors and money brokers who distribute not only meth but also cocaine heroin marijuana and mdma more commonly known as ecstasy while meth made in superlabs is for broad distribution meth made in smallscale labs tends to be for personal use or limited distribution successful closure in the united states of some superlabs the relative ease of producing meth the continuing demand for the drug and the desire for potential wealth and involvement in criminal underground social activity contributed to an increase through 2003 in meth production in small clandestine labs also known as small toxic labs stls10 official data aggregate the numbers of meth labs dump sites chemicals glass and other equipment and are reported as meth incidents since 2003 the nationwide numbers of meth incidents has declined as shown in table 1 table 1 number of all meth incidents

administration national clandestine laboratory database total of all meth clandestine laboratory incidents httpwwwdeagovconcernmap_lab_ seizureshtml according to state law enforcement and public health professionals the decline in meth incidents that occurred between 2003 and 2004 was the result of few factors some states and retailers began to institute policies to restrict access to nonprescription pseudoephedrinecontaining decongestants common meth ingredient over time the number of states and retailers restricting access to meth ingredients increased which made the tactic of traveling to nearby state or store that did not have policy to restrict access to meth ingredients more difficult some pharmaceutical companies reformulated their nonprescription decongestants to exclude pseudoephedrine 10 drug enforcement administration drug trafficking in the united states available at httpwwwusdojgovdeaconcerndrug_traffickingphtml crs5 stiffer sentences for those convicted of illegally making meth further discouraged involvement with stls11 in december 2005 iowa state authorities reported decline of approximately 80 following the passage in may 2005 of state law restricting access to pseudoephedrine12 subsequent to the passage of similar laws state officials in oklahoma and oregon each reported decline of approximately 5013 the decline is expected to be seen nationwide when complete 2005 data become available although only 20 of illicit meth used in the united states comes from stls14 the sheer number of such labs their residual impacts and their geographic diffusion have prompted concerns in congress state and local governments law enforcement agencies and real estate and other groups residual impacts of meth labs there generally are greater concerns about the environmental wastes from stls than from superlabs for several reasons first there is trend for superlabs and their wastes to be in mexico where the ingredients for illicit meth can be obtained more easily than in the united states second production processes used in stls tend to be less efficient than those used in superlabs and smallscale cooks tend more often to be careless resulting in proportionally more contaminants in the meth and in the environment than production processes in superlabs third while there are fewer superlabs there are thousands of stls across the united states approximately 9000 domestic smallscale labs with capacities under 10 pounds in 11 comments made by several participants at the midwestern governors association regional meth summit held

stls can reduce environmental hazards and remediation costs but some drug agents emergency medical personnel and addiction counselors note that meth supply has not declined because of increased imports and the higher cost and potency of imported meth is resulting in more overdoses and addictions and more burglaries to pay for the imported meth there have been suggestions for increased research and development possibly through the national science foundation for more effective demand reduction programs and treatments for overdosing 14 dea statistics in senators predict passage of meth law article by joseph rose in the oregonian february 25 2005 at httpwwwnationaldecorgnews20050225portland oregoniansenatorsoadecpdf crs6 200015 and 17000 in 200416 fourth these smallscale labs can be geographically scattered among wide range of sites such as apartments motel rooms abandoned buildings even packed in car trunks and moved among parks and other locations fifth the range of wastes from stls can be more varied and unpredictable than superlab wastes because smallscale independent cooks may develop new recipe or use any of number of meth recipes available on the internet the range of recipes and resulting wastes may be driven by the local availability of critical ingredients or equipment the range of substitutes for pure ingredients and sophisticated production equipment may include common items such as decongestants from retail and convenience stores mason jars coffee filters hot plates pressure cookers plastic tubing and gasoline cans there is range of residual impacts of smallscale labs children of some stl cooks have been found in residences where their parents were making meth meth levels as high as 5000 micrograms per cubic meter of air have been measured during cook which almost ensures that anyone including children in the vicinity of the cook will test positive for meth some children taken from home meth labs may show permanent damage to their respiratory tracts and possibly to their nervous systems17 the health and social welfare of these children whether with or removed from their parents are issues of concern research and cost further some meth cooks and others in the illicit drug business have been armed and mentally imbalanced18 consequently there is range of residual social impacts associated with stls cleaning and remediating meth labs there have been four main ways to clean and redevelop former meth lab site two involve epa one involves dea and the last involves hud epa alone local government state or regional entity or an individual can notify epa about possible meth lab19 the agency will study the site and its findings will help steer the next actions to be taken for example under the comprehensive 15

2204 total 48 107661 2243 source personal communication with epa in february 2006 the number of applications for reimbursement has been declining in proportion with the number of reimbursements as shown in the table22 one possible reason is the relative difficulty of using this process the state or local government must first incur the cleanup expenses and then with proper evidence of expended costs apply to epa for reimbursement which if approved may be received by the state or local government within six months of the agencys receipt of the application second possible reason is that this type of reimbursement is capped at 25000 per incident another possible reason relates to another alternate way to clean meth site notify dea 20 federal register vol 63 32 feb 18 1998 pp 82848291 for

procedures the range usually includes one or more of the following measures removal of contaminated items which cannot be cleaned this may involve outdoor as well as indoor items such as soil water carpeting and wallboard ventilation chemical neutralization of residues washing with appropriate cleaning agents encapsulation or sealing of contaminants providing alternate water supplies andor controlling access to the site with fencing and signs extremely contaminated structures may require demolition especially if cleanup and remediation costs are projected to exceed the commercial value of the structures while the decision to clean meth site is aided by the availability of epa and dea funds for cleanups the decision to remediate meth site may be more difficult neither epa nor dea funds are available for remediation an additional action and cost after cleanup an owner of contaminated private property eg an apartment building or motel needs to decide whether remediation is sensible remediation cost estimates may exceed the value of the property an owner may seek financial assistance for remediation from local or state governments local or state governments need to decide whether to remediate or simply restrict access to contaminated public area eg hiking trail or parking lot in forest remediation cost is determined largely by the severity of contamination but also by the decision at which level of cleanliness to stop remediation efforts28 26 united states department of housing and urban development fy2007 budget summary op cit 27 ibid 28 dea reports the average cost to clean clandestine lab is estimated to range from 1500 to 3000 with some cleanups exceeding 200000 depending on the severity of contamination dea also reports that it spent an average

processes while the endpoints for cleanup are relatively straightforward ie that sufficient evidence has been procured for successful prosecution and that imminent hazards such as explosion or fire have been eliminated the endpoints for remediation are less clear as mentioned earlier epa and dea funds previously described are for cleanups only epa or dea funds are available for remediation nine states alaska arizona arkansas california colorado minnesota montana tennessee and washington have feasibilitybased remediation standards specific to meth feasibilitybased standard considers costs as key factor levels of meth residue below the standards are considered acceptable the nine states standards range from 005 to 01 micrograms of meth on every 100 square centimeters of surface29 while some state standards only address residual meth itself others have acceptable levels for methrelated chemicals such as volatile organic compounds and corrosives30 some states require remediation to be completed by statelicensed or otherwise certified professional31 states and localities also differ in requirements to notify potential buyers renters neighbors law enforcement departments and other governmental agencies andor to maintain and make available public records of facility having been contaminated with meth and whether the facility was remediated32 while some feasibilitybased standards
