karzai on february 15 told undersecretary of defense for policy flournoy that his government welcomed the opportunity to join in the usgs strategic policy review he suggested his team likely would advocate for 1 greater efforts to target terrorist leaders and sanctuaries in pakistan 2 additional work to strengthen afghan communities to enhance security and 3 new multilateral talks with individual groups of taliban who agree to respect the afghan constitution on the contentious issue of civilian casualties karzai expressed satisfaction with the recent agreement on specific military operations and willingness to move forward the president predicted iran would respond positively to the new us administrations offers of dialog focus on pakistan 2 c nf the fight for stability in afghanistan must be taken to the terrorist planners and their sanctuaries in pakistan karzai said he noted he had long argued for greater efforts in this direction including in public remarks in kabul in 2005 karzai expressed frustration that the close relationship between the united states and pakistan had yet to yield serious campaign against terrorist leaders operating there instead he argued afghanistan paid the price of perceived us and pakistani reluctance to grapple with the problem pakistan of course had long used islamic fundamentalism as policy tool but pakistan is puzzle to now karzai admitted i see things happening on massive scale in the northwest that are not the work of isi the pakistani intelligence service 3 c nf on cooperation between afghanistan and pakistan karzai said zardari is of different positive mindset the pakistani president has yet to move however from good intentions to implementation and is weak karzai asked flournoy whether the us strategic review envisioned more direct bilateral military cooperation between afghanistan and pakistan with the us or nato as broker or whether only greater uspakistan military cooperation was under consideration flournoy replied that the regional strategic review while urgent and extremely important to the new us administration was only just underway renew community support 3 c nf the president underscored his analysis that the support of communities was key to countering the insurgency when i first returned to afghanistan karzai mused i had only 14 american soldiers with but we had the afghan people with us they believed in the moral correctness of what we were doing and even helmand was safe for girls to go to school now 4000 sic british soldiers are in helmand and the people are not safe we must stand on higher moral platform than the bad guys the president said 4 c nf community empowerment is not about the arming the tribes karzai noted media speculation about this approach is misleading we need ordinary people the elders and the villagers to trust in the governments ability to do the right thing and give them what they need to be able to defend themselves the president said in turn the government must minimize civilian casualties limit night raids and make sure women and children are protected during military operations increasing the numbers and capabilities of the police and army and strengthening government institutions are also important karzai added talk to afhgan taliban 5 c nf afghanistan and the us together should formally launch process of peacemaking with those taliban who are not qaeda or part of any terrorist network karzai proposed there are groups and individuals who would accept the afghan constitution who have run away from us because of our own failings he said saudi arabia pakistan and religious leaders have the right resources to make such process work and should participate but us partnership with afghanistan is key to success and has been the missing element in efforts to date 6 c nf if there really was taliban movement karzai said i would be greatly worried by us reports that iran is supporting the taliban but i do not think the taliban is really movement it is the result of three decades of past pakistani policy plus lot of poor desperate kids who lack kabul 00000376 002 of 002 connection to family or community friends despite frictions 7 c nf on several topics karzai said recent frictions in the bilateral relationship represent annoyances between friends we have been hurt by some recent statements he said and also i know my loud speeches on civilian casualties hurt your feelings still the two nations have common interests and the two peoples are friends afghanistan is very grateful for the generosity of us aid in reconstruction and development the agreement on civilian casualties is good start and we can now move forward to implement it and so speak with one voice on this issue on iran karzai said afghanistan cannot be channel but we can help you convey the nuances of your demands iran is likely to respond positively to us offers of dialog even though it will never give up its nuclear programs progress in curbing poppy cultivation this year probably largely reflects market forces such as high wheat prices afghans consider poppy not respectable however and with stability and hope for the future will respond to international efforts to replace its cultivation with alternate livelihoods 8 c comment coming in the immediate aftermath of special representative holbrookes visit this meeting reflected karzais effort to stick by his agreement to refound the relationship his calm constructive comments on civilian casualties contrast sharply to his attitude previously 9 u undersecretary
