highly accurate continuous all weather 3dimensional 3d pvt position velocity ground speed and time conste llation of satellites transmit spreadspec trum radio frequency rf signals for use by navigation sets each signal is modulated with unique code sequence and navigation data message the code sequence allows the naviga tion sets to identify each satellit the navigation data message provides the navigation set information about the operation of each satellite the navigation sets receive the signals and compute 3d position ground speed and time 312 n avstarglobalpositioningsystemstructure the gps structure is made up of multiple satellites ground control system and any number of navigation sets nav sets the satellites orbit the earth while the ground control acts as monitor and c ontrol center for the satellites the navigation sets are receivers that can be either installed in host platform s hips vehicles aircraft etc or carried by personnel 3121 s atellitesthe gps satellites provide navigation data to the nav t the satellites are arranged in six rings that orbit the earth tw ice day this arrangement provides worl dwide continuous coverag each satellite broadcas ts two spreadspectrum radio frequency rf signals each signal is modulated with uni code sequence and navigation message the code sequence allows the nav set to identify each satellite the navigation data ssage provides the nav set with inf ormation about the operation of the satel lite 3122 g roundcontrolsystemthe ground control system tracks the satellite s checks and controls s atellite orbits and updates the satellite navigation data message the ground control sy stem consists of monitor stations and control center monitor stations re unmanned stations located throughout the world they use special gps receivers to track each satellite the tracking information is sent to the control center the control center uses the tracking information to calculate precise satellite position and satellite clock error for each individual satel lite this data is called ephemeris data the c ontrol center calculates satellite position for all sat ellites called almanac data once each 24 hours the control center sends the ephemeris and lmanac data to each satellite this updates the navigation data message broadcast by the satellite 3123 n avigationsetsthe navigation set nav set receives and decodes r f signals from the satellites this decoded infor mation is used to calculate 3d position 3d speed and exact time data t he nav set is able to track satellites that are in open view of the sky from the receivers antenna position an d measures the time it takes for signals to travel from the tracked satellite to the nav set by multiplying travel time by the speed of light the nav set termines the exact range to each sa tellite by calculating the range to four sa tellites an exact 3d position is calculate d the nav set calculates speed by measuring the rate of change of the rf signals 313 r eceivertheoryofoperation the dagr collects and processes the gps satellite link one l1 and link two l2 signals to provide pvt

calculation is co mpleted the single receiver method offers simplicity and speed of setup th is method is performed with remote antenna submil gls dual receiver method the operator ﬁgures two dagrs with matching port settings and interconnects both dagrs using dagr to dagr cable one of the dagrs is designated the master and one is the slave the operator activates the gls calculation from the master receiver the s lave receiver must not be moved during the calculation when interconnected the dagr detects the opposite receiver and automa tically selects dual receiver gls operation after activation the operator disconnects the master receiver from the slave receive r and walks the master receiver to the second point and remains there until the preset walk time has expired walking in straight line between points is not required however the dagr mustmaintain clear view of the sky to track satellites after the wal k time is expired the operator returns the master receiver to the

loader is actually the port that the cable is plugged into on some computers serial port identi ﬁcation is difﬁcult when in doubt experiment and try each available port for gps map loader in turn another program is using the serial port normally this wil l cause an error message communication port is in use com munication t not present but there is possibility that it would not shut down any programs or utilities that may use serial port it is preferable to run gps map loader by itself to minimize the possibility of ﬂicts or timeouts 1710to 31r42psn131 if the mouse is on serial port it could be interfering w ith communications on most pcs com1 shares an interrupt request irq with com3 and com2 shares an irq with com4 irq is the mechanism to get the computers attention to have tasks don since mouse operates continuously it cant share an irq with anything else including the gps map toolkit software if your mouse is on com1 or com3 the gps map toolkit software must be on com2 or com4 if your mouse is on com2 or com4 the gps map loader software must be on com1 or com 3 if you only have one com port and the mouse is using it or if you only have com1 and com3 disable the mouse by disconnec ting it and rebooting your computer this will cause an error message when the mouse driver tries to load but otherwise the computer functions normally this frees up the serial port for use by the gps map toolkit software if the port selected is com3 or com4 there may be problem in the windows setup of this port try to verify the port is set up and working correctly by using another program to acces s that port windows terminal will do if the other program doesnt work either the problem is in the com port or its setup q what do i do when i receive an error message ai fg p sm pl

into the gps ue for purposes of generating rcvw or bcvm or acquiring rguv or bguv the daily key cvd the operational difference between t he rcvwbcvm and the red and black guv keys is the strategy and

acquire gps satellite signals i n minimal amount of time fast acquisiti on the bcvm functions equally with the rcvw however the bcv can be issued to much broader set of autho rized users due to the inherent security that stems from the fact that the bcvm is distributed black and can only be decrypte d red inside saasmbased gps user set operational red keys are cla ssiﬁed confidential and are
