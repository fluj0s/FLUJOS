however the us agri cultural economy is highly dependent upon exports at time when many foreign consumers are wary of the products of agricultural biotechnology as result us exporters often have encountered barriers to trade in these markets among the most controversial barriers is in the european union eu the eu the fourthlargest foreign market for us agricultural products since 1998 has maintained facto moratorium on approva ls of new ge crop varieties in may 2003 the united states launched formal ch allenge of the eu policy contending that it both violates international trade agreements and causes unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world the eu and other important us tr ading partners around the world have adopted widely divergent approaches to regulating biotechnology the wide range of approaches to ge product re gulation is in part due to th fact that an international consensus on how to regulate agricultural biotechnology is still evolving us officials say they are active globally to ensure that national and international standards for genetically modified organi sms gmos are consistent transparent based on scientific principles and compliant with in ternational trade rules eg those administered through the world trade organi zation for example they have been working to ensure that the socalled cartagena biosafety protocol multilateral agreement on the safe handling transfer and transboundary movement of living modified organisms does not present new obs tacles to us exports of such products another issue involves recent difficulties in moving us food aid to certain african countries due to what us offi cials said were unwarranted euprovoked concerns that such aids possible ge content could pose safety problems for recipients debate also revolves ar ound the potential benefits and problems of introducing ge crops to developing countries congress continues to follow these issues closely for example number of leading lawmakers pressed hard for the administration to aggressively challenge the eu moratorium following the administra tions decision to do so the senate and house passed resolutions sres 154 hres 252 in support of the action several house hearings have been held to review barriers to the adoption of and trade in ge agricultural products and to review challenges and opportunities for plant biotechnology development in africa additional hearings are possible whether the 108th congress will consider other legisla tion affecting agricultural biotechnology was

farmers are widely adopting biotechnology growing genetically engineered ge crops mainly corn soybean nd cotton varieties to lower production costs and reduce labor requirements1 in 2002 66 of an estimated 145 million acres planted to ge crops worldwide were in the united states according to the international service for the acquisition of agribiotech applications isaaa2 us crops where ge varieties are common are highly dependent upon export markets according to usda approximately 40 of all us soybeans 20 of all corn and 45 of all upland cotton producti on is exported these crops and their major products accounted for more than fourth 133 billion of the total annual average annual value of 526 billion for all us agricultural exports during calendar years cy 2000 to 2002 not all of these soy corn and cotton exports were ge varieties but the us marketing and regulatory systems do not distinguish between approved ge and nonge varieties commingling bulk commodity shipments provides an important cost competitive advantage for us handlers in domestic and world markets according to industry analysts these analysts observe that us adop tion of agricultural biotechnology has been facilitated by the current us regulatory system the basic federal guidance for regulating biotechnology products is the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology 51 fed reg 23302 published in 1986 by the white house office of science and technology policy ostp one of its key principles is that genetically engineered products should tinue to be regulated according to their characteristics and unique features not according to their method of production thus if food product produced throug h biotechnolog is determined to be substantially equivale nt to one produced by more c onventional means that food is subject to additional or different re gulatory processes once approved food products do not have to be beled as to whether or not they contain any genetically modified organisms gmos except to the ex tent ge food is s ubstantially differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31970crs2 3for details see crs report rl30198 food biotechnology in the united states science

truthful the framework maintains that new bi otechnology products are regulated under existing federal statutory authorities all of which were conceived and enacted before the advent of commercial agricultural biotechnology3 the problem for us agriculture is that many countries remain wary of agricultural biotechnology including thos in the european union eu where consumer and environmental organizations have been vocal in expressing concerns about the safety of ge crops and animals the eu and ot her important us trading partners have adopted widely divergent approaches to regulating biotechnology as result us exporters are encountering ba rriers to their products in these markets for example since 1998 the eu the four th largest foreign market for us agricultural products has main tained facto moratori um on approvals of new ge crop varieties in may 2003 the united states canada and argentina began formal challenge of the eu policy in the world trade organization wto contending that it violates international trade agreements and also has fueled unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world see page 7 the eu counters that it must protect its consumers by exercising the socalled precautionary approach which says that if scientific evidence is insufficient or inconclusive regarding practices or product s potential dangers to human or environmental health it should be more vigorously regulated or even prohibited if there are reasonable grounds for concern thus providing safeguard against future unforeseen problems unde r this approach which is also being emulated somewhat in other important us markets such as japan and south korea for example the products of biotechnology are deemed to be inherently different than their conventional counterparts even some countries that grow ge cr ops are imposing their own approval and labeling regulations for gmos for example china is planting its own ge cotton and other crops but has imposed tempor ary gmo import regime while it develops permanent new rules for approval and labe ling of gmo farm products this has created uncertainty about continuing access to this important us export market some us producers who otherwise generally have s upported biotechnology have expressed trepidation bout expansion to more ge va rieties due to such foreign market uncertainties their concerns have been evident as biotechnology companies work toward government approvals of ge wheat although some growers are eager to plant the new varieties when they become available others do not want commercialization appr ovals until there is wider global acceptance4 wheat growers too depend heavily on exports usda reports that 56 of production is

rent policy at all6 among those that do each has its own system although multilateral ttempts to harmonize gmo regulation have been under way for veral years internationally recognized standards still are evolving the disparity of national regulatory re sponses has been characterized as renationalization of agrifood safety regulation and sh arp break from the international food safety system that evolved over the past 100 years where importers tended to accept the food and envir onmental safety judgments of regulators from those countries developing and exporting the products7 others argue that scientific knowledge about biotechnologys effects on f ood and environmental safety is still incomplete in the meantime they ar gue countries have right and obligation to take the precautionary approach to regulation various countries national biotechnology regulation is occurring within two broad categories approval to commercialize new produ cts of agricultural biotechnology the united states canada japa n mexico argentina and south africa are among the countries where developers seeking approvals of ne w ge products have found relatively flexible regulatory environment to this list might be added india and china where considerable research has been conducted on agricultural biotechnology and domestic approvals appear to be increasing but where nonetheless imports of ge crops may

transparent policies with regard to ge approvals systems for labeling and traceability in argentina canada hong kong and the united states labeling products as to whether or not they are from gederived crops generally is voluntary however the eu and more than 20 countries have either adopted or announced plans for mandatory labeling of gmo products number of them for example australia brazil china indonesia japan new zealand saudi arabia south korea and the united kingdom an eu member have formally implemented their mandatory labeling regimes many others however have not fully outlined their proposals or i ndicated when they might take effect some also apparently lack implementing structures9 generally mandatory labeling also necessitates accompanying traceability require ments meaning that the marketing system must have documentable ability to trace the presence or absence of gmos through each step from farm to point of sale see also page 9 multinational oversight the wide range of national approaches to gmo regulation is in part due to the fact that an international consensus on how to regulate agricultural biotechnology is still evolving agricultural biotechnology and trade policy analysts throughout the world generally agree that an international consensus on how best to regulate agricultural biotechnology is not only desira ble but necessary attempts have been under way for some years in variety of multinational institutions to develop more harmonized standards for ensuring the safety of ge crops and foods and to establish ground rules for testing enforcement and dis pute resolution it is not yet clear which of these international bodies will have the greatest influence in resolving these questions although it appears likely that mo st if not all w ill have some role the ifpriphillips paper see footnote 5 observed that despite the substantial effort being undertaken there is co mmon view on the goal of international regulation while most agree that safety is the bottom line few can agree on what that means whose opinions should hold the mo st weight scientists or citizens or how to handle nonsafety issues such as social

negotia tions and therefore is not directly addressed in the 1994 uruguay round ur agreements however the us position has long been that the ur agreement on agriculture the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures and the technical barriers to trade tbt agreement provide adequate guidance for dealing with trade in gmos taken together these agreements seek to reduce or eliminate all unnecessary or arbitrary barriers to trade and ensure that sps or technical measures eg gmo labeling are transparent scie ntifically defensible and based on accepted

with international trade rules eg those administered through the wto however they face difficulties in reconciling the current us approach with the opposing pe rspectives of other influential countries like those in the eu and elsewhere following are discussions of selected issues in the international arena which have cha llenged us supporters of agricultural biotechnology the eus facto moratorium on gmo approvals12 on may 13 2003 the us trade representa tive ustr and the us secretary of agriculture announced that the united st ates canada argentina and egypt were filing case before the world trade organization against the eus facto 5year moratorium on approving new agricu ltural biotechnology products egypt subsequently decided against filing with the united states the administration was under increasing pressure from key members of congress and farm groups to launch such case us agricultural interests contend that not only have these policies blocked their exports to the eu but also fueled unwarranted concerns about the safety of agricultural biotechnology throughout the world eu officials say they have been moving as quickly as possible to reinstate biotechnology approvals while trying to r eassure their consumers regarding safety issues there is concern among some policymakers that the filing of wto casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31970crs8 will only escalate trade tensions between the united states and the eu where the value of twoway agricultural trade am ounts to more than 14 billion annually background with minor exceptions the eu has approved agricultural biotechnology products since 1998 even thoug h it has an elaborate approval process in place and in october 2002 implemented revisions to that process aimed at reassuring its member states and the public about the safety of its regulatory system approximately 13 products in early 2003 were awaiting pproval some for as long as 6 years majority of eu states has effectively blocked the release of any new ge crops into the environment these st ates france belgium luxembourg the netherlands germany austria italy ir eland greece spain po rtugal and finland say they will not implement the euwide legislation for approvals until new stricter regulations for labeling and tr acing gmcontaining products also are adopted although the european commission first approved these separate proposals in july 2001 the lengthy eu decisionmaki ng and implementati on process make it unlikely that these proposals will come into force any earlier than some time in 2004 in the 3 years before the facto ban us corn exports to the eu averaged approximately 300 milli on annually spain and portugal were the largest eu importers since then they have declined to less than onetenth of that value annually the result according to analysts of the eus moratorium on the approval of new corn varieties alr eady approved in the united st ates although one variety of biotech corn was approved by the eu prior to the moratorium other approved varieties are being grown in the united st ates making exports of any us corn which is not separated as to gm or nongm varieties to the eu impractical us soybean exports to the eu have declined too from an average value of approximately 22 billion in the 3 year s before the ban to about 12 billion annually 20002002 according to usda data unlike biotech corn only one variety of biotech soybeans has been widely grown in the united states the eu had approved this ge crop under its regulatory pr ocess prior to the moratorium the eu also had approved number of other gmos prior to the 1998 moratorium the wto case the usled case began with request for 60 days of formal consultations with the eu in addition to the three main filers australia chile colombia salvador honduras mexi co new zealand peru and uruguay expressed their support for the case on june 19 2003 ustr spokesman issued statement announcing that the consultations were not successful and that the wto will now be asked to establish dispute settlement panel the next step at any rate resolution of the dispute could take up to 18 months the united states and its allies argue in part that the eu moratorium violates the wto agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures the sps agreement permits countries to regulate crops and food products to protect health and the environment but th eir rules must be scientifically justified and approval procedures must be operated without undue delay us interests contend that there is scie ntific evidence that gmderived food and feed crops are substantially different from or any less safe than conventional va rieties conclusion they say even european scientific author ities have reached th moratorium has not only impacted us exports to the eu but also caused other countries particularly in the developing world to shun biot echnology which the united states

suspicion about food safety see us vs eu an examination of the trade issues surrounding genetically modified food argued holds great promise for vastly improving agricultural productivity and feeding growing populations see also page 11 eu officials counter that they have s hown good faith in moving as quickly as possible to restart the approval process in early april 2003 the ec threatened to take legal action at the european court of justice against the 12 member states if they fail to implement the ge approval legislation once the new labeling and tracing rules are approved nonetheless eu officials have told the united states that their cautious approach to regulating agricultura l biotechnology is necessary to restore confidence among european consumers w ho may be more wary of changes in how their food is produced due to seri of recent food safety crises13 it is unclear how wto dispute panel might rule on the useu case in part because agricultural gmos are not explicitly recognized in the uruguay round trade agreements which were concluded before the advent of widespread agricultural biotechnology if the united states wins it would validate the basic principles of the sps agreement and could discourage ot her countries from emulating the eu regulations the united states has pointed out that many eu farmers themselves would like to be planting and selling ge crops however win might not open eu markets to more ge imports the united states might simply have to settle for some form of alternate compensation some ve suggested that win could create backlash among the european public and governments who view the united states as forcing biotechnology on unwilling consumers labeling and traceab ility concerns as noted number of foreign market s for us farm products have been developing systems that will require most or all gederived pr oducts to be labeled as to their ge content in the use u biotechnology dispute the usled wto challenge to the eu

year now that the required 50 nations have ratified it the united states is not party to the 1992 cbd and therefore cannot be party to the protocol however it has actively participated in the negotiations over the protoc ol text and in countries preparations for implementation the protocol addresses major area of c oncern not resolved by the parent cbd in 1992 the safe handling transfer

for an international clearinghouse for th exchange of lmo information the protocol establishes the use of advance informed agreements aia between the importing and exporting par ties that cover the first transboundary movement of any gmo the purpose of aias is to ensure that recipient countries have the opportunity to asse ss environmental risks associ ated with the importation of biotechnology products the biosafety protocol creates the procedure by requiring exporters to seek consent from importers before the first shipment of gmo is introduced into the environment applies to seeds for planting fish for field release and microorganisms for envir onmental bioremediation in addition article 11 also requires that bulk shipments of gmo comm odities for food feed or processing be accompanied by declarations stating that such shipments may contain gmos and are not intended for intentional introduction into the environment one section of the protocol states that lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientif ic information and knowledge re garding the extent of the potential adverse effects of living modi fied organism on the conservation and sustainable use of biol ogical diversity in the party of import taking also into account risks to human health shall not preven t that party from taking decision as appropriate with regard to the import of that lmo in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects defenders of the application of this approach essentially the precautionary principle maintain that it is only temporary mechanism that gives time for scientific inquiry policymakers in europe recognize as do those in the united states the need for an assessment of risks based on accepted scientific facts however cr itics worry that adopting the precautionary principle in formal agreements like the protocol may create false public expectations of absolute safety and the demand for zero environmental risks further some critics maintain the precautionary approach can be used as disguised protectionism as they say already has occurred on the part of the eu in blocking us beef imports containing growth hormones and in delaying approvals of new gmos implementation of the aias and of pr ovisions on documentation that countries can require for gmos and gmcontaining sh ipments also are of major concern to the
