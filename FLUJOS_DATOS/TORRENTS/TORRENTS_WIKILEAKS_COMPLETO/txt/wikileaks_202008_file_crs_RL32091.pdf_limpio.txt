fundamentals updated december 8 2004 robert pirog specialist in energy economics and policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091natural gas prices and market fundamentals summary intermittently high volatile natural gas prices ce 2000 have raised concern among all types of consumers residential customers have seen gas bills increase dramatically during the heating season industrial consumers have seen costs increase which reduces their competitiveness because the price of natural gas at the consumer level is mixture of market forces and regu lation explaining the behavior of price can be difficult debate in the 108th congress concerning the energy bill hr 6 considered provisions which are intended to improve long term natural gas supplies in the united states other issues are lik ely to be brought before the 109th congress for consideration this paper analyzes the shor t term forces which influence the natural gas market the energy information administration has developed metric called the effective capacity utilization rate as fra mework for analyzing the economics of the natural gas market this measure has been shown to be correlated with the price of natural gas when as the effective capacity utilization rate attains high levels 90 and above it becomes increasingly likely that tight market conditions will yield high prices as result of the natural gas policy act of 1978 pl 95 621 and subsequent legislation in 1989 and 1992 pl 10160 nd pl 102486 the wellhead price of natural gas is market determined pipeline rates are federally monitored and distribution charges are regulated at the state level price variability centers on the wellhead price as well as the price determined in futures markets price spikes have occurred in two of the past three heating seasons whether severe weather causes price increases pends on the tightness of the market as measured by the effective capacity utilization rate the same level of demand could lead to very different price results if the effective capacity utilization rate is high or low variety of factors can affect the effective capacity utilization rate since short run supply adjusts to meet demand the w eather will be an im portant determinant the relationship between natural gas pr ices and investment in exploration development and production is an importa nt factor in termining productive capacity the availability of stored gas and imported gas become vital to price stability as the effective productive capacity exceeds 90 in the very short term there appears to be little that can be done from policy perspective to alter the fundamental econo mics of the natural gas market in the longer term policies that slow demand growth andor encourage the growth of supply either from domestic or fo reign sources could be effective this report will be update d as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091contents background 1 p r i c b h v i r 3f c t

the winter of 200304 prices averaged 497 per thousand cubic feet mcf for the year 2003 and rose to an average level of 541 for the first eight months of 2004 futures prices observed through november 2004 suggest that natural gas prices might remain high during the winter heating season of 200405 natura l gas price trends through 2003 suggested that the market might be experiencing greater volatility than in the past the sustained high prices observed in 2004 sugge st that the period of volatility might be over and prices might remain at levels over 500 per mcf fo r the next year or more the wellhead price of natural gas is market determined the result of complex interaction of forces which influence both the demand and supply of gas among those forces are such imponde rables as winter weather as well as the actual amount of surplus producible natural ga s if any and the availab ility of imported gas market dynamics are complicated because the same potentially destabilizing event may have very different effects on the price depending on the initial state of the market the energy information administration eia has developed metric to evaluate the effect of these complex inte ractive forces based on effective productive capacity called the effective capacity utilization rate ecur it establishes conceptual framework with which to an alyze the natural gas demand and supply balance and price this report analyzes the linkage between the concepts of effective productive capacity the ecur increases in the price of natural gas and the potential for higher prices in the 200405 heating season dditionally the repor t addresses policy options both in the short and longer term s that have been publicly discussed background the natural gas market is composed of three major components on the supply side producers pipelines and local distribu tion companies the price of natural gas paid by consumers is layered in the sens that the wellhead price paid to producers forms baseline pipeline transportation costs are then added which yields the city gate price finally local distribution co mpanies add additional charges to yield the prices actually paid by consumers cons umer markets themselves are divided into segments each of which tends to pay different in many cases significantly different price residential consum ers pay the highest prices followed

table 4 p8 in addition to multiple prices faced by c onsumers other prices are key variables for supply and policy decisions the wellhead price of natural gas as noted in this report is competitively determined by market forces this was not always the case the process of natural gas price deregula tion began in 1978 when the natural gas policy act pl 95621 became law under the natural gas policy act nearly all price controls were phase d out by the end of 19842 the spot price of natural gas is reco rded at transportation hub the largest in the united states being henry hub in loui siana and is generally somewhat higher than the wellhead price because it includes some processing and transportation costs natural gas futures contract trading on the nymex establishes forward prices for natural gas and allows market participants to hedge short and medium term price risk the nymex future price is determin ed by the interaction of traders who have business interests in the real physical natural gas market and financial traders who speculate on the market natural gas is so traded by numerous brokers and other entities for physical delivery at number of local marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091crs3 3 energy information administration natural gas productive capacity for the lower48 states 19852003 2003 p1 figure 1 lower48 states ffective capacity utilization and gas prices 19872001interstate pipeline rates are not directly regulated and their pricing structure largely reflects open access for shippers and market pricing the federal energy regulatory commission ferc monitors pipeline tariffs to assure just and reasonable pricing and has intervened in number of tariff situations the city gate price includes the addition of thes pipeline transportation charges residential and small commercial consumers buy gas from local distribution company which delivers gas from longhaul pipeline to the customers premises local distribution companies are regulated by state public service commissions who set distribution charges the price data in table 1 indicates that residential prices have recently been almost double city gate prices in 2004 the price premium paid by residential and commercial consumers reflects the high fixed cost associated with distribution of their supply as well as th added cost of small volume purchases price behavior the eia defines effective productiv capacity as the maximum production available from natural gas wells allowing for limitations in the pr oduction gathering and transportation systems3 the effective capacity utilization rate ecur is the ratio of actual production to effective productive capacity surplus capacity is the difference between effective produc tive capacity and actual production figure 1 shows for monthly data over th period 1987 to 2001 that the average wellhead price has stayed below 300 per mcf whenever the ecur was below 90 the data also show how upwardly volatile natural gas prices can be as the ecur rises above 90 the correlati on between high values of the ecur and high priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091crs4 4 energy information administration us natural gas markets midterm prospects for natural gas supply december 2001 pxiii figure 2 lower48 states monthly dry gas production rate and effective productive capacity and utilization 19852003suggests that when the ecur is above 90 conditions are in place that are consistent with high volatile natural gas prices figure 2 shows the history of the ecur capacity and production since 1985 several trends are noticeable in the data productive capacity has declined since the late 1980s but appears to ve remained stable ce 1993 actual production has trended up from 1985 to 1995 and has been rela tively stable since then these two trends taken together drove the ecur to 90 or higher levels for almost all of the past eight years an ecur in excess of 90 indicates th at available natural gas output is nearly fully allocated to meeting demand any fu rther increase in demand or disruption of supply can only be met through extraord inary draws on existing gas wells increased draws from storage or increased imports all of these alternatives suggest that prices for the consumer are likely to rise if these sources are unavailable for expansion the price could rise dramatically and supply disruption might occur as part of the market adjustment to higher prices increased development drilling could take place but explorati on and development does not immediately result in gas on the market the eia estimates that there is lag of between 6 and 18 months between an increase in natural gas prices and an increase in developmental drilling and ultimately higher production4 the declining productivity of us fields is also factor according to one i ndustry observer it ta kes approximately 25 times more active rig capacity to produce the same amount of gas as just eight yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091crs5 5 joseph p mathew lng what is it all about energy pulse november 27 2002 p4figure 3 wellhead price of natural gasago5 alternatively when the ecur is below 90 any requirement for additional supply can be quickly brought to the ma rket by increasing production from existing wells source us energy information administration derived from data available at httptontoeiadoegovdnavnghistn9190us3ahtm figure 3 shows the history of the wellhead price of natural gas from 1973 through 2003 again several tr ends are noticeable the first run up in prices from 1973 to the mid 1980s was the result of pri ce deregulation in market where supply was not abundant demanda fter years of regulated pri ceswas strong and oil prices were high as result of the arab oil embargo of the united states in 197374 and the iranian political upheaval of the late 1970s prices declined after 1985as did demandand the united states entered decad long period of relatively low stable prices during this period use of natura l gas as an abundant cheap clean fuel was promoted increasing demand in conjunc tion with the supply trends shown in figure 2 has resulted in the ecur remainin g at or above 90 since 1995 these conditions set the stage for the gas price increases and price volatility experienced since 2000 an interesting break in the pattern of the figure 2 data is associated with the sharp price increases of the winter of 2000 01 as can be seen in figure 2 the ecur achieved very high values during th is period when coupled with the low temperatures of that winter the result was high prices that set off boom in exploration and drilling while only 496 rotary drilling rigs on average were drilling for natural gas in 1999 that number increased to 720 in 2000 and rose to 939httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091crs6 6 data for drilling rigs searching for natura l gas was obtained from the energy information administration monthly energy review october2004 table 51 p83 7 ibidfor 2001 as the resulting production entere d the market in 2002 6 to 18 months later the ecur fell below 90 in 2002 and the price of natural gas fell6 the lower price however resulted in lower developmental drilling and set the stage for sharp price increases in the winter of 200203 as prices declined in 2002 as seen in figure 3 the drilling rig count also decline d to 691 the ecur reflecting the lower anticipated increments to producti on from reduced exploratory drilling again rose above 90 and price increases beginning during the winter of 200203 followed drilling activity may be responding to 2003s higher prices the eia reported that the average monthly drill rig count for 2003 was 872 with the count running over 900 per month from june to december the nine month average drilling rig count for 2004 is 1009 and has been on pa th of steady monthly increases since january 20047 whether the recent increase in dr illing activity results in large enough supply increases to allow the price of natu ral gas to fall depends on the exploration success rate the size of the fields found and the degree to which existing producing wells show output declines factors affecting ecur and price any factor that increases demand or decreases supply will increase the ecur when the ecur is below 90 extra pressure on the market is likely to result in higher production once the ecur rises to 90 or above timely increases in production are less available nd pressure on the market manifests itself as higher prices higher prices create incentives that eventually could cause price increases to moderate although new sources may require higher pri ces to satisfy investment criteria weather the demand for natural gas exhibits s easonal pattern even when the weather is normal figure 4 shows the typical pattern which is characterized by seasonal demand peaks since seasonal patterns are repetitive suppliers attempting to accommodate consumers accumu late quantities of gas in storage facilities in the traditional offpeak season for re lease during the heating seasonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091crs7 figure 4 natural gas seasonal demand source us energy information administration available at httpwwweiadoegovpuboil_gasnatural_gaspresentations 2004searucsearuc_files framehtm if the seasonal demand pattern is accentu ated by extreme weather conditions the stored quantities of natural gas might not be sufficient setting the stage for price increases if the ecur is high for exampl as we approached the heating season of 200203 stored gas was at nor mal level of appr oximately 3 trillion cubic feet tcf below average temperatures early in the winter quickly drove stored quantities down to low levels which set the stage for the price increases that followed if the ecur remains high as is likely and cold winter weather pattern repeats the limited amount of stored gas as well as the unresponsiveness of both supply and demand to real time price varia tions at the consumer level could well bring about another price spike in the winter of 200405 the seasonal pattern of natu ral gas demand is being altered by its growing use by electric power generators power gene rators expanded their demand for natural gas by 36 over the period 19972002 the eia expects that over the long term forecast period 80 of new electricity ge neration will be fueled by natural gas continuing the strong growth of the last veral years not only is electricity demand adding to total natural ga s demand but the pattern of peak demand might interfere with traditional gas demand cycles the demand for natural gas for electricity generation peaks in the months june through october when space heating demand from residential and commercial customers is low but when storage facilities replenish their stocks as result it mig ht be the case that the ecur is pushed to higher levels year round competition fo r summer supplies could cause short fallshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091crs8 8 long term forecast estimates are from the eia annual energy outlook 2003in storage quantities create price pressures that squeeze out pri ce sensitive industrial customers or force higher electricity rates or even shortages to the system8 investment and price as discussed earlier in this report wh the ecur is 90 or above the ability of the industry to respond to increased demand with expanded supply from existing wells is limited causing price to increase quickly however the higher prices do provide an incentive to begin the process of drilling new wells and exploring for new supplies the resulting supply increase will tend to cause price to fall as productive capacity is enhanced reducing the ecur the nature of this relationship in the natural gas industry can under some circumstances lead to cycle of unstable boom and bus t feared by those investing in gas production taken to its extreme th is could lead to chronic underinvestment in gas production and stagnant supply higher prices for natural gas justify investment in exploratory drilling by increasing the value of the expected cas h flow derived from the new production in an efficiently operating market sustaine d marginal increase in price is supposed to elicit marginal increase in production in natural gas when the price rises hundreds of extra rigs drill thousands of dditional wells historical averages suggest that about 80 of these efforts will be successful and yield some new production once well is brought into production th ere is little economic rationale for not producing at full capacity as result the market moves to condition of excess supply as new production begins causing fall in the price the reduced price brings disincentive to invest in exploratory drilling which leads to period of stable supply setting the stage for rising ecur tightening market balance and rising prices key factor in the ability of the rate of investment in exploration to affect the ecur is the degree to which existing wells deplete or yield declining output levels for example the eia exp ected that in 2003 the estimated effective productive capacity of the us natural gas industry would be approximately 57 billion cubic feet per day bcfd for 2003 production was ex pected to be approximately 514 bcfd leaving surplus of 56 bcfd or about 10 to demonstrate how this balance depends on new drilling and expansion of capacity the eia estimated that 25 of effective productive capacity co mes from wells one year old or less the two largest suppliers of us natural ga s texas and the gulf of mexico derive 30 of their production from wells one year ol d or less if drilling were to stop in the us all surplus capacity would disappear in less than one year in 2001 the incentive of high prices d to 22800 well completions that resulted in increased productive capacity only 17800 wells were completed in 2002 and productive capacity declined if as this recent data suggests the potential for boombust investment cycle may be developing in the natu ral gas industry the resulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32091crs9 9 energy information

seem unlikely that the current high futures prices observed on the nymex could be supported by uncertaintie s related to available stocks policy considerations the potential effects of high volatile natural gas prices on both the national economy as well as individual consumers is not insignificant high sustained levels of natural gas prices can act as drag on economic growth as with oil price shocks in the past high natural gas prices can constitute classic s upply side shock which reduces output and productivity growth if severe enough shock of this type can increase unemployment and cause inflation in the short term on the level of individual consuming sect ors high natural gas prices negatively affect specific industrial users who make h eavy use of natural gas in their production process which makes them uncompetitive residential users might have difficulty paying their winter heating bills forcin g them to choose between adequate home heating and other necessities in the very near term little can be done to affect natural gas prices except through market intervention in the form of price controls ma ndatory conservation and prioritized rationing the conditions
