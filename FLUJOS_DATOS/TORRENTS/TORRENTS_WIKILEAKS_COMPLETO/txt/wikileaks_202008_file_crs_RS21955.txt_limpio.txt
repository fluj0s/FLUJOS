following transportation security administration retained in the commerce committee federal law enforcement training center retained in the judiciary committee revenue and commercial functions of the bureau of customs and border protection and the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement including matters relating to trade facilitation and trade regulation retained in the finance committee issues relating to the us citizenship and immigration services the immigration functions of the us customs enforcement and the directorate of border and transportation security retained in the

including the functions of the federal emergency management agency fema relating to that program fema is currently in the environment and public works committee the new senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs would retain most of the jurisdiction of the current governmental affairs committee including crs4 its authority to study the efficiency economy and effectiveness of all agencies and departments of the government sres 445 as amended removes from the committees present rule xxv jurisdiction budget and accounting measures other than appropriations except as provided in the congressional budget act of 1974 sres 445 grants the senate committee on the budget exclusive jurisdiction over measures affecting the congressional budget process the resolution also gives the budget committee joint jurisdiction over the nominations of the director and deputy director of the office of management and budget nominations which previously resided solely in governmental affairs plan to combine authorization and appropriation power rejected during consideration of sres 445 an amendment was offered by senator john mccain to give appropriations authority for intelligence agencies and functions to the senate intelligence committee such consolidation of authorizing and appropriating authority in one panel for intelligence was one recommendation of the 911 commission1 the mccain amendment was rejected on october 7 2004 by vote of 23 to 74 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21955 potential impact of the reorganization the provisions of sres 445 go into effect with the convening of the 109th congress there remain however number of questions that are likely to have to be addressed in the future these topics are illustrative and noncomprehensive provisions of the resolution make an assignment to the intelligence committee permanent assignment would senators serving on the committee now be required to relinquish an existing category assignment in order to remain on the intelligence committee or would still additional senators require waivers from assignment limits in the future would senators with current assignments receive grandfather rights to keep their seats the resolution grants to the floor leaders the new right to designate the chair and vice chair of the intelligence committee because this would now be permanent committee assignment would it have been appropriate to retain the authority to designate chairs and vice chairs within the party conferences there seems to be discussion in the legislative history of sres 445 as to whether the floor leaders would have authority to remove committee member floor leaders would retain their authority to appoint rankandfile committee members would more information about the level of spending by the intelligence agencies be made public in the future especially through functional allocations in budget resolutions and allocations of spending totals among appropriations subcommittees the future operations of the congressional budget process are to be consolidated within the jurisdictions of the committees on budget and rules and administration and sres 445 is silent on the subject of making the total amount of the intelligence budget public 1 us national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states p 420 crs5 s 2845 legislation to reorganize the intelligence agencies which is pending in housesenate conference committee would necessarily also affect the jurisdiction of the intelligence committee especially in connection with the number of nominees to be referred to the committee in the future specifics of the jurisdictional boundaries between the reorganized senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and other senate committees would have to be determined in practice as bills are referred during the next congress in addition committees involved may undertake efforts to establish formal agreements clarifying their respective jurisdictions such questions would fall within the jurisdiction of the rules and administration committee the senate has never before established an appropriations subcommittee by resolution would the senate be required in the future to approve any further reorganization of appropriations committee subcommittees that affects the intelligence or defense appropriations subcommittees as above these questions involve the interpretation of senate rules and the relationship between senate rules and standing order processes established by resolution which does not formally amend the standing rules of the senate both matters fall in the purview of the senate committee on rules and administration httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21955 the resolution also authorizes new staffing arrangements for the senate intelligence committee the senate rules and administration committee is directly named in the amendment as being responsible for providing sufficient funds to the intelligence committee to permit the implementation of the staff designee system how such system would be implemented is unclear as noted senate resolution 445 is free standing resolution which does not formally amend the rules of the senate but does so indirectly by establishing standing order the resolution amendment similarly does not directly amend senate rules this approach to senate reorganization is understandable because invoking cloture on rules change normally requires 67 votes while invoking cloture on something that does not directly amend the rules normally requires only 60 failure to amend the rules directly however increases the potential for parliamentary error and might lead to future questions about the rules of the senate observations floor debate during consideration of sres 445 made clear that the senate acted to reorganize its committees in part because of perceived widespread public support for the recommendations of the 911 commission some recommendations of the 911 commission such as combining authorization and appropriations authority and to make the aggregate intelligence budget public were not adopted by the senate current press reports are noting that majority of the functions performed by the homeland security department will not be within the jurisdiction of the new homeland security and governmental affairs committee even after passage of sres 445 similarly some press reports have viewed the reorganization as only providing small additions to the authority of the intelligence committee committee system changes in the senate are rare and difficult to achieve and sres 445 is the most significant change in senate committee operations since 1977 it is not clear whether observers will see the senate reorganization as significant change on the order of magnitude of the intelligence reorganization congress is proposing for the executive branch senator mitch mcconnell summed it up on the floor in saying not crs6 every senator will be happy with the result of the senate working its will on this reorganization resolution some members will complain this reform goes too far others will complain it does not go far enough i believe we have struck an appropriate balance of reform that improves our ability to conduct oversight of intelligence and homeland security during very serious time for our country2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21955 2 senator mich mcconnell remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition 108th cong 2nd sess nov 9
