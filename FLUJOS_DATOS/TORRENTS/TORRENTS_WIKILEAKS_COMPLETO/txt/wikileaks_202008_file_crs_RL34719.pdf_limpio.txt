csc holdings inc remote storage digital video recorders and copyright law summary the timeshifting technologies that consumers use to record television programs as they are broadcast and to play them b ack later have long pr ompted allegations of copyright infringement from broadcast networ ks and movie studios however as the technologies have evolved and lawsuits against thei r manufacturers have been resolved the nature of the copyright cla ims has changed most recently broadcasters and studios sued cablevision over its proposed remotestorage digital video recording service which would allow consum ers to record and play back broadcast content using cablevisions facilities instead of inhome devices because the recordings were made at cablevisions facilities and the playbacks were transmitted from there content owners claimed dir ect infringement of their reproduction and public performance rights previously c opyright holders had claimed contributory or vicarious infringement by ma nufacturers of recording devices in 2007 federal district court in ne w york found for th plaintiffs and enjoined cablevision from operating its propos ed recording service holding that 1 the unauthorized buffer and playback c opies made when recording broadcast programming were infringing reproductions and 2 the unauthorized transmissions of playback copies to consumers were infringing public performances in 2008 the us court of appeals for th second circuit reve rsed the district court it found that neither buffer nor pl ayback copies infringed content owners reproduction rights according to the appe llate court the bu ffer copies were non infringing because they were embodied too briefly for fixation to occur and to count as copies under the copyright act the playback copies were similarly non infringing because cablevisions custom ers not cablevision created them additionally the second circuit found that cablevisions transmission of playback copies to consumers did not infringe cont ent owners public performance rights the transmissions were noninfringing because cablevision made individualized copies of every television show for each recording customer and customers could view only their copies beyond clarifying the nature of infringing reproductions and public performances under the copyrigh t act the second circuits cartoon network decision paves the way for cablevision to market the firstever remotestorage digital video recording service this effect of the cartoon network decision could potentially be undercut by the parties fa ilure to allege contributory infringement vicarious infringement or fair use as well as by the fact that the decision is binding precedent only within the second circuit and by the content owners appeal of the second

to transmit their copyrighted programs to the public but had not authorized or licensed sony or members of the general public to make copies of them7 universal and disney worried that consumers unauthorized unlicensed copying could harm them by diminishing the audience for original broadcasts and thereby decreasing ratings and advertising rates8 in their lawsuit against sony universal and disney argued 1 that consumers infringed the companies exclusive rights to reproduce their programming by recording tv programs with the betamax v cr and 2 that sony should be liable for consumers infringement because it made the betamax available to consumers9 the us supreme court disagreed however the court first found that consumer recording of broadcast television was noninfringing fair use because consumer timeshifting of television viewing did not demonstrably harm content owners whose shows were still watched albeit at differe nt times than their scheduled broadcast times10 the court further found that s ony was not liable for contributory infringement merely for manufacturing or selling the betamax b ecause the sale of copying equipment does not constitute c ontributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitima unobjectionable purposes11 stsdvrs and the replaytv litigation in the early 2000s stsdvrs began to replace vcrs stsdvrs resemble vcrs in that

to make unauthorized copies of plaintiffs s hows and 2 actively participated in consumers infringement by inducing causing or contribu ting to it by making stsdvrs available to consumers plaintiffs claim of vicarious infringement was similarly premised on the allegations that defendants 1 had direct fi nancial interests in consumers infringement because they sold stsdvrs to consumers and 2 were able to control consumers infringing recording even if they did not know of or directly participate in it because they determined the technological capabilities of the devices they manufactured 16

fixation and copies the copyright act grants copyright owners the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies33 the word reproduce is not defined within the act but the word copies is34 copies are material objects other than phonorecords in which work is fixed by any method now known or later developed and from which the work can be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated either directly or with the aid of machine or device35 the act further defines the term fix ed used within the defin ition of copies as follows work is fixed in tangible medi um of expression when its embodiment in copy or phonorecord by or under the au thority of the author is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated for period of more than transitory duration work consisting of sounds images or both that are bein g transmitted is fixed for purposes of this title if fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its

embodiment for more thantransitory duration and without fixation there ca nnot be copies under the copyright act or infringing reproduction the first claim of the cartoon network plaintiffs was that cablevision infringed their copyrights by reproducing their programs when making unauthorized unlicensed buffer copies prior to record ing content for cablevision customers38 embodiment was not at

district court which found for the plaintiffs relied upon case law suggesting that embodiment per suffices for fixation41 the plaintiffs and th district court further relied upon report from the us copyright office stating that any duration requirement for fixation is met unless reproduction manifests itself so fleetingly that it cannot be copied 42 cablevision in contrast argued that its buffer copies did not constitute copies under the copyright act because they were not fixed and thus were not embodied for sufficient time43 cablevision emphasized that its buffer copies existed for more than 12 seconds before being automatically overwritten44 cablevision further argued that even assuming fixation an copies were otherwise minimis because they involved more than 12 seconds of broadcast

becau embodiment was not for morethan transitory duration fixation occurred copies were made under the copyright act and cablevision engaged in infring ing reproduction with its buffer copies47 the second circuit thus gave its answer to question long discussed by copyright scholars how long must wo rk be embodied for fixation to occur48 however its answer may diverge from that of other federal

for very brief time in order to view system error logs and diagnose problems while repairing computer50 the second circuit attempted to distinguish cases such as mai systems by noting that copies in ram often exist for minutes as opposed to s econds and by reading prior cases to say that loading content into ram may but does not necessarily result in infringing reproduction51 to the degree that other circuits disagree with the second circuits inte rpretation of their cases here though cartoon network could presage split of opinion within the federal district courts on the duration requirement for fixation52 the second circuit did not reach cabl evisions suggestion that any copies produced by buffering data would be minimis53 its failure to do so leaves open the possibility that future courts could find that buffer copies lasting longer than 12 seconds meet the duration requirement for fixation without being infringing reproductions reproduction under the copyright ac t the

them on cablevision hard drives for future viewing by customers54 whether these copies violated broadcasters exclusive rights to reproduce their works was not at issue here55 rather the parties and the courts focused upon cablevisions role in creating the playback copies56 this focus resulted from the fact that the plaintiffs claimed direct infringement by cablevision and liability for direct

thus became whether cablevision or its customers made the playback copies the plaintiffs argued and the district court agreed that ca blevision made the copies and should be directly liable for infringement because the copies were unauthorized and unlicensed60 technological differences between vcrs sts dvrs and rsdvrs were key to this argument61 the plaintiffs claimed that rs dvrs differed from earlier timeshifting tec hnologies because they were not stand alone devices that consumers purchas ed and installed in their homes62 relatedly plaintiffs claimed that rsdvrs were different because cablevision had an ongoing participation in the reco rding process because custom ers repeatedly transmitted recording requests to cablevisions system s which made and st ored desired copies

access to systems that automati cally produce copies on command and 2 manually operating copying vices and selling products made using the devices in determining who actually makes copy significant difference exists between making request to human employee who then volitionally operates the copying system to make the copy and issuing command directly to system which automatically obeys commands and engages in volitional conduct70 public performance under the copyright act the agent of transmission with rsdvrs and the meaning of publicly in addition to their claim of infringing reproduction

picture or other audiovisual work means to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible72 the act further specifies that publicly when used in reference to performing

the transmissions resulted in the performan ce of plaintiffs copyrighted works76 rather it argued that cablevisions customers not cablevision initiated the performances because the rsdvr system only sent the recorded programs to consumers upon their request for playback77 cablevision also argued that any performance regardless of who initiated it was not public because each customer viewed distinct copy of program uniquely associated with one customers settop box and intended for that customers ex clusive viewing in his or her home78 the district court disagreed with cablevision on both who initiated the performance of playback copies transmitted to rsdvr customers and what makes performance public79 the district court held that cablevision was the agent of the performances because cablevis ion actively partic ipated in the playback process when its computerized system transmitte d the playback copies to consumers upon their request80 it further found that the customer s participation in the transmission of the playback copies their use of remo controls to select previously recorded content for viewing was too passive for them to be the agents of the performance81

whether cablevision or its customers initiated the performance84 rather the court held that the performance was not public because different rsdvr customers received individualized playback copies of the same television show85 the court found it significant that there was not si ngle playback copy transmitted to all subscribers who selected particular show for recording and replay86 t t h contrary cablevision ensured that each subscriber received copy of the show viewable only on his or her settop device87 this limitation according to the second circuit ensured that both factors used in determining whether performance is public were unmet here 1 the identity of the transmitter differed because the transmissions were made from different harddrive storage spaces in response to commands from different customer remo tecontrol devices and 2 the source material of the transmission differed because the system saved individual copies of program for each customer who requested recording of that program88 the second circuits focus on this limitation does howev er raise questions about whether rs dvrs must use cablevisions allegedly ine fficient method of recording content which entails making and stor ing potentially thousands of c opies of the same content in order to avoid infringing the reproduction right89 effects of the cartoon network decision the second circuits decision clears th way for cablevision to deploy its proposed rsdvr service commercially90 by doing so the decision protects the latest in line of technologies stretc hing from vcrs to stsdvrs to rsdvrs that allow consumers to timeshift thei r viewing of broadcast television few questions remain after the cartoon network decision first the cartoon network plaintiffs and defendants declined to pursue claims relating to contributory infringement vicarious in fringement or fair use91 had they done so the outcome on one or more of the three issues d ecided might have differed second the cartoon

different conclusions on the nature of infringing reproductions and public performances under the copyright act even when confronted with identical facts92 additionally the cartoon network plaintiffs have petitioned the supreme court for review of the second circuits decision93 that petition is pending despite these lingering questions however courts that find the logic of cartoon network persuasive may find as the second circuit did that consumer recording of broadcast televi sion using technologies outside the home is as protected as recording of broadcast levision using technologies inside the home is under sony conclusion the second circuits decision in cartoon network represents the latest in the continuing litigation between parties holding copyrights in broadcast programming and manufacturers of recording devices cartoon network involved rsdvrs and claims of direct infringement unlike ear lier cases involving vcrs or stsdvrs and claims of contributory or vi carious infringement alt hough the district court found for the plaintiffs and enjoined cabl evision from operating its proposed rsdvr service the second circuit reversed th second circuit held that 1 the buffer copies created prior to recording broadcast content in cablevisions rsdvr system were noninfringing because they did not ex ist long enough for fixation under the copyright act 2 the playback copies created on cablevisions computers in its rs dvr system did not make cablevision directly liable for infringement because cablevisions customers created them and 3 the transmission of playback copies to customers was noninfringing because it was not public performance the second circuits decision thus allows ca blevision to offer its proposed rsdvr system commercially and cl arifies the nature of in fringing reproduction and public performance under the copyright act
