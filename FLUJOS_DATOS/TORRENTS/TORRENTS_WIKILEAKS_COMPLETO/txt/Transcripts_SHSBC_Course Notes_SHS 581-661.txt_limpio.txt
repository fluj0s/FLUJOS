auditing work if you sat down at onehand electrode emeter you would be amazed at this fact you would get tone arm motion beyond perhaps brief residual flurry at the very start with another auditor you would get 175 ta divisions with yourself you would get two it works this way because the thetan in this universe has begun to consider himself mass so he is subject to the laws of physics consequently he cant asis much mass he has to have second terminal to discharge the mass or energy against if an auditor thinks he is mest he is apt to get the condition of the pc because he mocks up or envisions the pcs charge in himself making himself matched terminal but that is not what makes auditing work it is all consideration backflow actually hits the auditor 582 the ability to hold position in space or to hold two terminals apart is definition of power in the auditing situation there is an apparent exchange of energy from the pcs point of view which doesnt hit the auditor but because thetans think of themselves as terminals you get an exchange of energy going on nothing hits the auditor and it asises as far as the pc is concerned but you have set up twopole system and that will bring about an asising of mass it isnt burning the mass it is asising the mass that is why there is nothing hitting the auditor the magic of auditing is contained in the comm cycle of auditing you are concerned with the smooth interchange between these two poles which is necessary for as long as the pc considers himself to be matter and therefore considers that he must discharge against something eventually the pc will get up to point where he longer considers himself matter when lot half of the bank is gone the meter will longer read on sneeze when pc cognites that he is not mest the auditor cant knock any energy off and the meter goes dead running r6 the meter only reacts when the pc decides what something is you have to ask the pc if that is it when the pc looks and decides if that is it or not only then does the meter read the pc is advancing away from the automatic physical energy manifestations of the physical universe you get to point where you have intention gpm is just method of limiting the persons ability to intend that is the whole idea behind implanting to foul up intention by fixing it so that every time thetan intends positive he gets negative and vice versa so he cant decide if you talk to person and every time he says yes you say he will get to an indecisional state of mind where he can longer intend yes fully this wears him down it breaks his spirit this is the whole idea behind implanting to get being unable to effectively intend or determine anything successfully he intends to write but something is intending that he not write therefore he cant write all ideas of power of choice selfdeterminism etc stem from the ability to intend something the more enmested someone is the more trouble they have with intention with the twopole arrangement person can be influenced without his knowledge the difficulties of auditing are just the difficulties of the comm cycle you can hit the parts of the comm cycle as buttons the auditor must permit smooth flow between himself and the pc if matter is to be asised by the pc using the comm cycle when you dont permit smooth flow between yourself and the pc as terminals you get noasising of matter part of the trick is knowing what has to be asised but that is matter of technique if the auditor is capable of getting the pc to be willing to talk to him he wouldnt have to hit particular button in order to get ta action basic auditing and the comm cycle is senior to the technique the fundamental entrance to the case is not in tech but in the comm cycle in case supervision you can look at the points of the comm cycle that are missing in the pcs case and heal those points up there can be the comm cycle between the pc and the auditor and between the pc and the auditing room you can address the pcs comm between himself and the environment by looking at what he is worried about with an unconscious person pick up his hand and have him touch the pillow your arm etc giving the command at the same time you are just getting him in comm with the auditor and his surroundings but now you are into technique 583 communication is simply familiarization process based on reach and withdraw when the auditor speaks to the pc he is reaching when he ceases to speak he is withdrawing when the pc hears you he is bit withdrawn he reaches towards you with the answer he is in withdraw as he looks for the answer he reaches the answer and reaches the auditor it is communication exchange that asises energy and registers on the emeter meter action occurs in the absence of that exchange namely the comm cycle if the comm cycle isnt in the pc selfaudits and you get case gain and ta that is the fundamental discovery of dianetics and scientology it is so simple that everyone has overlooked it because mest is very complex stuff being composed of atoms molecules wavelengths etc it is so complex that nobody can understand it people who are ploughed into matter who think as matter think very complexly they cannot observe the simplest things with which they are confronted they observe none of this the ease with which you can handle comm cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training now all observation should focus on the pc the comm cycle you watch is the pcs the true touch of genius that makes an auditor that can crack any case is the auditors ability to observe the comm cycle of the pc and repair its various lacks this consists of asking question that the pc can answer observing that the pc has completed the answer to it acknowledging the pc and then giving the pc something else to do that is the auditing comm cycle see also p 450 above for an illustration this includes clearing the auditing command so that the pc can answer the question ask the question in such way that the pc can hear it and know whether the pc is answering that question you can tell when the pc is finishedit is piece of knowingness an instinct you should know without having to ask the pc if he is finished then knowing that he is finished you use the acknowledgment to tell him that he has said it using only the right amount of stop to stop that cycle not the whole session then you give him something else to answer when you dont see when he is finished and therefore fail to acknowledge he thinks he is not done and looks for more he even takes up humming if you dont give him something else to answer he will go on automatic he will selfaudit with ta action the degree of lack of ta action measures the degree of selfaudit that the pc is indulging in get your comm cycle good enough so that you dont have to pay attention to it and give your attention to the comm cycles of the pc spend your basic auditing doing nothing but repairing the basic communication inabilities of the pc and you will be genius you will crack 99 of the cases that walk in for instance the case that goes on and on with his comm you may think that you are acknowledging him but he never gets it it is up to you to get that communication acknowledged so he knows that it is heard or take the pc who takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question and then in that answering doesnt answer it the very smart auditor knows that he would have to do three processes because 1 the pc cannot have an auditing question he didnt answer it so he never got it this gives you the first process what auditing question wouldnt you mind beingshould you be asked 584 2 since he cant have auditing he is wasting it so after you have comm line going you can run wasting auditing run it as concept since you cant expect such case to recall anything you could use get the idea of you wasting auditingor what could you do here that would waste auditing or what could an auditor do here that would waste auditing and maybe get him to waste communication elementary havingness is the ability to do 3 run who would i have to be to audit you 4 after that perhaps you could work on his memory you would see the whole case change take pc who is sitting there not saying anything find what the pc is doing and dream up something accordingly eg what could you say to you get long comm lag then he says something build it up until youve got him in communication with you then inspect the rest of his comm cycle for other wrongnesses maybe now you have to find out whether he can have an auditor it is what the pc isnt doing that the auditor might be able to get him to do that determines the auditing question if you are alert you will see these little disabilities showing up for instance someone stammers obviously he is having trouble communicating dont ask the pc to do things the pc cant do for instance the auditor asks from where could you view catfish the pc says uh im sorry ive never viewed any catfish the auditor has asked the pc question he couldnt answer he is guilty of not having cleared the question clear questions beforehand to make sure the pc can do it before asking it always respect the pcs saying that there arent any more answers otherwise you give the pc loses your entrance point to the case is where the pc breaks down in his comm cycle with the auditor and with the environment for instance if the pc cant look at the auditor you could run if you looked over here what would or might you see these are the ways you crack cases there are tons of processes that you could use suppose you are running scs on pc who you find cant stand still dont ignore the disability take something else to remedy it eg stand stilldont stand still which gets rid of automaticities if the pc knows that he has the disability he can itsa about it because it is real to him but often what the person is worried about is not what he is bugged with you could still trigger the bank and run it out on an automaticity as in dianetics but then you would get pc who gets better and doesnt know about it pcs will run off total automaticity of what is wrong with them and they wont even listen to themselves talk an auditing session is highly artificial but it is only artificial because it approximates to such harsh staggering reality the exact points of contact with beings and existence like lycoming engine in model t ford auditing highlights the exact important points of communication here is capsule version of what is wrong with the mind the only thing really wrong with people is that they have withdrawn from communicating the individual has gone out of contact he has stopped looking the last time he looked there were three sabretooth tigers ready to bite him of course he believes that there are still three sabretooth tigers there he does this 585 throughout enough trilennia and hes got an awful big stack of tigers all of which have left but he doesnt know this fact he cant be sure that they have left person who withdraws from contact with tigers all the time and refuses to contact the area doesnt see whether the tiger is still there or not but keeps mocking it up just to be sure the tigers actually are gone but this individual is in condition of total withdrawal he is safeguarded with automatic bank with automatic beingness valence stands where he ought to be total withdrawal is capsule summary of aberration thetan has as his remedy for safety shortening his reach when he gets to the point of zero reach he inverts it into an inverted withdrawal and you get the cycle of the dynamics coming on down he comes away from actual reach to zero reach but he still has to reach so he figures out some other way to reach zero of what he is doing always has remedy that is lower so you can get an inversion of an inversion of an inversion of withdrawal this shows up in an auditing session right away in the pcs inability to talk to the auditor about pertinencies so you must remedy his communication by reaching him in order to get him to reach with person who is on compulsive outflow you have to get him there before you can run anything eg by touch that chair you have to have session before you can have technique this is how to get one you use observe and remedy the communication cycle and after you have remedied it notice that it has been remedied note that the pc is now able to communicate with the auditor and notice what else needs to be done sometimes the remedy of the outpoint happens so fast that you are astonished dont overrun it if things are going all right dont remedy them if things are going all wrong find what you can fix up and fix it up if the pc is fully in session you can run almost anything and he will sail but technique by itself will put the pc in session the auditor has to do it l ron hubbard type 3 idate25264 volnum2 issue6 rev0 rdate000 addition0

will find enough aberration to make powerful being unpowerful on the actual gpm line quantitatively and qualitatively the data of this lecture is valuable at all levels but it is vital at levels v and vi it is so simple that you may think that there is nothing there to grasp there is also confusion that blows off as one attempts to grasp it the following is pure piece of data that is incredibly difficult to tr3 over to somebody i am going to tell you 1 the difference between auditing and assessing 2 the difference between destimulating and erasing 3 the difference between ptp and an arc break 4 the targets of the auditor which are the pc b the bank 586 the auditor speaks either to the pc or to the bank auditing and the auditing cycle is addressed to the pc assessing is addressed to the bank when the auditor talks to the pc he often restimulates the bank he has an influence on it but he is still talking to the pc sometimes during an assessment the pc talks and the auditor must acknowledge the origination but these are separate actions auditing has only two products destimulation and erasure see also pp 486487 above for illustrations of destimulation and erasure or discharge you can get the pc out of it or you can use the pc to wipe it out the first is destimulation the second is erasure destimulation gets the dogs that are barking at the pc to lie down and be quiet and the pc to come away from there auditing wipes out the dogs dont try to erase ptp that requires auditing and ptps prevent auditing you destimulate ptps so that you can audit you can get the pc to dust himself off destimulation or you can use the pc like an ink eraser erasure some auditors specialize in trying to erase everything but never really get anything erased it is ok to erase anything as long as you complete your cycles of action but the lower levels of auditing are practically all destimulation not erasure if an auditor cant destimulate pc he can never take up his own cycle of action because the pcs restimulation takes charge if the pc is elsewhere when you start the session and the cycle of action you will never complete the cycle of action that you start destimulation is the only action that you can undertake to get pc located and oriented dont try to audit when all you should or can be doing is destimulation where did it happen where are you now is destimulation so is prepcheck since an auditor cant complete his cycle of action unless he first destimulates the pc destimulation is very important skill running engrams ris implant gpms etc are all erasure even in destimulation tiny amount of erasure takes place just the pcs attention on the subject for short time brings about erasure of bit of it the fact that certain amount of the incident runs out during destimulation is shown by the fact that pc experiences somatics during assists we just hit the keyin and erase that you can also destimulate something and then run out the incident you could use effort processing or run the engram cf running locks secondaries and engrams on subjects if you do this though complete the cycle of destimulating first or you will leave some attention stuck on what you were destimulating which in the course of destimulating you also restimulated somewhat not completing the destimulation cycle will make it that much harder to erase what you wanted to erase you dont want the pc to come out of destimulation attempt involving mata hari with his feet still all tangled up in silk stockings and old german documents complete cycles of actions once started if you start to erase something erase it dont abandon it in order to go erasing something else in level vi ideally when you get gpm you erase it this is complicated by the fact that that gpm is connected to the one above it and the one below it but you could erase the middle in practice you consider the whole first series of goals one action and erase that or half the first series then the rest of it see p 591 below for an explanation of the goals series 587 the heart of certainty is arrival at the end of cycle of action the anatomy of uncertainty is failure to complete cycle of action rapid methods of destimulation are necessary for instance sincemidruds are needed to keep incipient bpc cleaned up and out of the road for the rest of the session life is restimulative the purpose of ruds is destimulation when the pc brings up something that is not in the auditors main line of action the auditor destimulates it and goes back to his main action case analysis is the tech that destimulates unwanted resurgences of case its purpose is handling ptps as they arise the activity of figuring out where gpms fit which has been called case analysis we now call track analysis case analysis is widelevel activity that can be used at any level it is just finding what the pc is sitting in and getting his considerations so while you are working on one gpm if the pc gets his attention on another one destimulate it with case analysis and go back to the first action otherwise leaving him stuck in one mass you let him go to another mass and he will get overrestimulated the rule applies to all levels make up your mind about what you are doing and complete your cycle of action what is auditing auditing is the action of asking pc question which he can understand and answer getting an answer to that question and acknowledging him for that answer and then also when the person originates auditing involves understanding and handling that origination that is all auditing is it is tr0 1 2 3 and 4 when that occurs ta action occurs and sanity occurs auditing is not assessing auditing may have the purpose of making someone feel better but that has nothing to do with the definition of auditing or with what auditing is the fact that someone feels better after an assessment does not mean that it was auditing therefore from the above definition you cant have selfauditing the technique is scientology but auditing is this one action if you understand the above to apply to all auditing you will be fantastic as an auditor you will find gold at the end of the rainbow nothing is very difficult about getting result if you just do what is in that definition what makes the pc better is not the technique you use it is simply the auditing comm cycle auditing is cycle of action and that twoterminal aspect which is what this physical universe consists of is what gives you tone arm action and is what makes pc better its not technique that makes pc better and it never will be auditing is the carrier wave that handles anything and everything for the pc there is another activity an auditor can do besides auditing assessment auditing goes mainly to the pc assessment never goes to pc it goes to the bank therefore by definition it is not auditing you can never assess pc who thinks that he is being addressed if you are trying to assess and the pc is trying to communicate with you or if he thinks that you are trying to communicate with him you will get messed up when the auditing cycle is out assessment cannot occur in that the pc hasnt understood that it is not an auditing cycle that he is engaged in and he cant just sit there and be assessed he is nervous and restimulated and his mind is darting all over the place even so if you ask the question just where the mind is it reads through all his mental busywork 588 r2h is not really an assessment even though you go down prepared list because you are really asking the pc those questions and setting up 2wc about things that have occurred in the comm cycle if pc gets arc broken during an assessment it is because he has originated something which you havent acknowledged he does not get arc broken because you are assessing sometimes you sandwich auditing in with the assessment but they are still two separate activities the ta action that you get when you find an actual ri occurs when you have an auditing cycle going it does not occur without the auditing cycle an assessment even of correct ri is not what gives ta action it is the auditing comm cycle that gives ta that is why when you ask is that your item you get ta action in the form of big blowdown it is not because the pc contacts the item he is already in the middle of it so on solo auditing the pc would get needle actions but not ta action assessment doesnt give you ta action an arc break assessment is given when the pc has an arc break this assessment list has other uses but the arc break assessment simply consists of assessing the list getting the read and indicating it to the pc during an arc break you must not audit an arc break is when the auditing comm cycle cannot take place it isnt anything else the pc is upset and accusative he wont talk to you if you force comm cycle at that time you will only deepen the arc break at that point you do nothing else but an arc break assessment when you have real arc break you assess it always know your tools so that you can do the right assessment whether it be session arc break or an arc break from the particular action that you are on as long as you are addressing with auditing an area of disability in the pc you will get ta l ron hubbard type 3 idate3364 volnum2 issue7 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec7 auditing and assessment 6403c03 shspec7 auditing and assessment the most complete body of knowledge there is is at class vi it took fantastic amounts of auditing to get it and codify it fortunately it is codified unlike other levels for instance prehav levels are mostly items out of actual gpms or locks thereon you are used to regarding assessment as something you use to find something to audit more recently you have regarded assessment also as way to find the source of an arc break assessment is an activity which is totally independent of auditing as you move up from class iv you find that assessment commingles with auditing arc breaks can occur because of the auditors failure to recognize the difference between assessment and auditing and failing to shift his gears from one to the other or schizophrenically trying to do both at the same time you must keep them separate for instance if the pc originates during your assessment you must instantly shift into an auditing cycle to handle it then you return to the assessment assessment is addressed to the pcs bank it is not addressed to the pc when auditing occurs during the assessment it is because the pc got restimulated by something assessed so the pc is now in need of an auditor to duplicate it so that it can asis the auditor must really understand duplicate and acknowledge so that the pc knows that he has been understood all bad assessing where the meter isnt operating properly comes about because the auditor cant shift gears smoothly and rapidly enough between auditing and assessing 589 an auditor can get the idea that assessment is impossible if he has made mistakes in assessing that resulted in the needle tightening up the failure in this case is really an auditing failure eg the auditors inadvertent question of the pc is it all right if we assess this list an auditing question since it has not been fully handled will now get in the way of successful assessment in some cases the question went to the pc an analytical being the pc now expects to answer he may also be insufficiently indoctrinated not to think that he should answer the assessment questions too but if you dont complete the question cycle you tend to direct the rest of the assessment at the pc not the bank now the pc feels as though he should be answering each item assessed you will be assessing through the pcs withheld comm when the auditor starts to assess many pcs go on an automatically withholding state of mind they got into this state of mind because the auditor disobeyed certain tenets eg the rule that when you ask the pc question before you assess you should be sure that the pc has answered it to his satisfaction and that he gets acknowledged and that everything is handled first before you start the assessment and when you have assessed and have gotten an item and you ask the pc is that your item this is an auditing question which may take awhile for the pc to answer you have just put him into the middle of his longstanding whirlpool so dont be amazed if it takes awhile for him to complete the cycle he could be going yeah yeah thats why etc etc etc without having answered the question is it your item assessment must never interrupt the auditing cycle but the auditing cycle may at any time interrupt the assessment therefore the auditing cycle is the senior action that doesnt mean that you necessarily spend more time auditing than assessing in any given session especially in r6 auditing is senior because auditing errors can wreck assessment the auditor has two lines going out one to the pc and one to the bank when these lines cross you get sparks in assessing you might use the form is it which has the form of question but dont expect an answer during the assessment there is one home in the bank dont fool around with entities using questions in assessments can bother pc sometimes it works better to use statements so as not to make the pc think that he should answer you wont get any reaction from the bank if the pc intervenes but you dont want the pc on withhold or decision not to be involved or something that gets in the way the pc has to sit there with his ruds in and cooperative assistance and in good comm with the auditor if his bank is to be addressed keep in comm and keep your cycles complete if the pc is in good comm with the auditor you can then address the bank easily therefore the way to put yourself in good comm with the bank is to put yourself in comm with the pc but the pc being in good comm doesnt have to mean that the pc is talking the auditors who assess pcs well are those who are in good comm with the pcs repairing assessments when what is wrong is outcomm will make things far worse it invalidates things found on assessment etc if assessment goes out repair the comm cycle dont just look for bpc in general clean up the comm cycle 590 on any case there is always bpc to be found that doesnt mean that you should spend much time looking for it you could spent lot of time trying to clean the question have i misassigned the bypassed charge because the read you would keep getting is from your assigning the bpc to bank phenomena not session outnesses it could go on reading for twelve hours in the presence of session arc break you can go on finding other bpc continually without the pc feeling any better and you will invalidate and suppress all sorts of auditing work that was done so arc break assessments should begin with is it session arc break is it an r6 arc break or is it an r4 arc break it can be as crude as what list do i use presenttime upsets always seem more important to the pc than past events however tremendous the past events may be never use heavy steel electrodes ninetynine percent of your assessment trouble is really auditing cycle trouble assessment errors themselves can be so productive of upset that the fact that there can be another source of arc breaks can easily be ignored even with the comm cycle in perfectly with the auditor and the pc in complete rapport the session can go up in smoke because of an assessment error especially on wrong goal for instance if the pcs item has been bypassed all you should do if the pc arc breaks is to assess dont try to wc it with the pc you must not audit or address remarks to the pc in the presence of an arc break you never ask the pc single question nor do you acknowledge anything the pc says experience has taught that you cannot communicate with somebody who is out of communication dont audit in the presence of an arc break dont ask question dont acknowledge what the pc says you assess if you get confused and go into shock when the pc suddenly throws the cans at you take break that is better than sitting there slackjawed dont stay near the pc dont try to talk to the pc get your wits sorted out find where the arc break started and go assess find the bpc indicate it get back in comm with the pc and go on doing what you were doing the meter will read during an arc break but only on what is causing the arc break if you find some bpc on case arc break list and the pc doesnt go vgis know that there is something else there is session arc break or some different case arc break r2h can be done either as an arc break assessment or as an assessment for bpc where you stay in comm with the pc during the assessment everything from level iv on up depends on accurate assessment so the auditor must be able to shift rapidly and smoothly from assessment to auditing just because r6 is mostly assessing dont think that you can delete auditing from the session if you try you will have disaster you assess when you assess you audit when you audit dont ever do them both at the same time assessing is straight from auditor to bank 591 l ron hubbard type 3 idate5364 volnum2

some hearings in australia this is the ultimate tvd the legislators were very interested lrh has started running his goals plot the research activities have left holes in his bank there are about 350 different goals series in sets of 42 since the same things went in over and over if you run one too deeply you can drop through into the next series you also get awful somatics if you do this the goals series are consecutive and it just goes in over and over again with different gpms same line plot same goal series they just go on and on so if you run out one you are convinced that you couldnt possibly have run it out because it is sitting on one of the same gpms of an earlier series so it looks like all the goals are still alive there so if you run one too deep you fall through into an earlier goals series so you can leave bpc by going on to the earlier one which gives you bad somatics youve got 42 goals in series for total of 15000 gpms they get bigger and bigger as you go back early track ris are about the size of mountain if you dont get the first pt series right the pc will go into sad effect of great magnitude with great speed it will take only four or five seconds from where where you found the wrong gpm to start from to the toboggan this can happen because you may well not have completed the current series only some of the 42goal series closest to pt is formed because the current series has not yet been completed therefore it is easy to fall back into the next series also the pt gpm itself is truncated so you can get the first actual goal but it is hard to get the first actual gpm everyone has the same actual line plot in common we learned our lesson well before the track began the consequences of running these gpms out of order and with wrong line plots are pretty horrendous which is why we are not broadly releasing the line plots incidentally there are 2d goals on the actual gpm line plot as far as lrh has been able to tell there are plenty of implant goals on the 2d however case analysis tells you how to become healing wizard and upset the ama man has real tradition of healing there is lot of charlatanism the ama is into plumbing not healing anyway of course doctors are necessary like plumbers they never reveal their stats or not often enough you hear that 600 people have received kidney transplants what you dont hear is that all of them were dead within two years previous attempts to heal overts have consisted of things like calling for repentance this is not an adequate process man got healing closely associated with structure and became successful where structure is concerned he knew nothing of disease infection may or may not have to do with bacteria there are too many variables to say for sure the fact that you can see the bugs under microscope is insufficient lrh has found that infection many be the result of gpm healing is done by the body the doctor merely arranged the parts so that they could go back together and hoped that the individual would do the rest until you have solved the problem of how the individual influences his own healing process you can do nothing broadly about healing so the healing professions have tended to be monopolists or frauds the modern medicos and psychiatrists have gone towards monopoly they have also made research lucrative profession but they tend to keep the door shut on 592 real search into healing by others not part of their club authority has become fact in courtrooms we dont communicate with the medicos not so much because they are evil as because they have certain stylized ways of thinking into which we do not fit they use research as way of raising money which is another incomprehensible we would have been incomprehensible anyway because we have gone forward on the basis that there is such thing as truth and that using what we know of it we can help our fellow man our real goals as scientologists are unreal to the public so there has to be bridge we do want some way to bridge in to the fellow on the street healing can be part of the lower part of such bridge because it is real to people freedom from psychosomatic illness is something that we can produce easily at lower levels even though healing isnt our main interest this makes the monopolists attack us the second thing that we need to know about healing is if you are going to heal heal dont heal in order to _______ you would gain great acceptance in community if you worked on that avoiding or handling the attacks of the monopolists and escaping the wrath of the frauds if you do go in for healing someone make sure that you also teach him little and broaden his horizon beyond his goal of getting rid of his lumbosis you do have technology for healing any chronic disease or illness provided that you can read meter and keep the auditing comm cycle going chronic disease is disease that exceeds its expected duration but dont assume that because you can see that someone is sick from something you should heal it to say what someone is suffering from is very adventurous the persons mental mechanisms can bring about and perpetuate virtually anything actually all illness is psychosomatic even broken bones it shows poor judgement to put ones body in position where its bones can be broken after all the genus of psychosomatic illness is in suggestion the hypnotic variety and suggestion comes down to postulation nothing can be suggested to the individual with any effect that he has not earlier postulated himself thus an overt would be to key in something that the person had already postulated for himself the person must have willed the destruction of bodies before he could get his body in bad shape it really isnt what has happened to person that brings about psychosomatic illness it is what the person is willing to have happen eg to another but it is neither possible nor necessary to trace psychosomatic illness back to the individuals basic intention to have it to cure psychosomatic illness though all psychosomatic illnesses are selfcaused and stem from early thetan postulates the keyin of such an illness can be otherdetermined he doesnt have to have keyin to make his postulates come true but when one of his early postulates sometimes mysteriously materializes in the physical universe and he doesnt know anything about it it is necessary for something else around him to key it in he did it himself and knew he did but if it is happening and he doesnt now know that he did it himself it must be the result of keyin hypnotism for instance is merely keyin of persons earlier postulates cf hcob 10aug73 pts handling 593 to keep an environment calm you must be careful of what gets keyed in for instance war environment is restimulative enough to cause the keying in of lot of brutality thetan is unbelievably numerously prepostulated with 15000 gpms each containing 16 ris with locks galore there is lots to be keyed in so when you heal psychosomatics you are not dealing with the thetans basic postulations unless you are auditing at levels v and vi below level v basic postulates are out of reach of the thetan they are neither necessary nor possible to use in handling psychosomatic illness it is fortunate that you dont require them here are the steps in the formation of psychosomatic illness 1 the thetan postulates it ie he postulates that it could be done or that it could happen this was trillenia ago probably 2 then he did it to someone else 3 then he could and did have it keyed in on himself and he got the experience the keyin could be anything it could be something quite mild symbol for instance step 1would be taken up at level vi if anywhere but trying to handle illness at level vi is too restimulative someone who is sick is probably not up to any part of it and you dont do level vi partially anyway handling step 2 getting the basic overt on the track is equally matter of going way back and is therefore probably impossibly difficult to get at but you can easily handle step 3 picking up the keyin in pt which is some tiny motivator or small overt that keys in the big overt and you can make the person well by using it to cure somebody find the most recent keyin that you can get your hands on or the latest overt on that subject again cf hcob 10aug63 pts handling dont try to heal with heroic methods take care of the keyins even though you know correctly that there is far far more behind it you want the lightest keyin that you can approach by the nature of the case you wont be able to reach that big postulate until the case as whole is up to level vi try to pick up the keyin that is as close to present time as you can get not as far back as you get if the recent keyin is too heavy to confront eg if it is something three lifetimes ago you can even pick up the keyin of the keyin go easy use feather duster the lightest of methods is what succeeds in healing curing bunions is not the same game as restoring to being his full powers but it is useful skill and very lightlylightly one you are not trying to get to basic the heroic measures indulged in by desperate doctors are just physical dramatizations of needless search for basic cutting out the brain to handle things is the effort to arrive at prime postulate dramatized as physical action the mystery is how something can be keyed out but it can and it heals the pc to do so he is likely to get the somatic back when he gets up to level vi but there you will be running it out 594 l ron hubbard type 3 idate9364 volnum2 issue9 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec9 summary of lower levels 6403c09 shspec9 summary of lower levels there has to be bridge between level 0 and level v level v is becoming catchall level of everything necessary before level vi we are in danger of getting up to the esoteric levels of vi and leaving bridge resulting in thirty to forty ots and nothing else someone off the street is in position to recognize any part of an actual gpm scientology progresses on reality the lower levels are the contest of achieving reality you have to achieve reality before you can make anyone better there has to be bridge to clearing its done by gradients the pc must be walked from position of norecognition of reality through recognition of some reality eventually to an ultimate reality by gradients if you skip step in gradient you get an unreality unreality is associated with charge they are the same thing an ri that is too overburdened with charge inval suppress etc will be unrecognizable to the pc matter how obvious it may be to the auditor person with too much charge on his case cant understand or achieve reality he must have reality and understanding to go free understanding is related to reality per the arc triangle therefore understanding is related to charge which you have to get off case first in order to clear it someone who has got lots of charge will do very silly things stupidity comes about from charge ie unreleased unresolved stored masses of energy for this reason you cant get person to solve his problems by mere significance the significances dont enter into it it is persons overcharged environment that makes person too stupid to solve his problems the way out of the problem of not having bridge is to attain consistency of result it breaks an auditors heart for results to vary from pc to pc to get consistent result and to get reliable bridge to clear you have to attack the common denominator of aberration in all pcs not the particular quirks of particular pcs otherwise results wont be consistent and the least common denominator of all aberration is charge if charge is what causes stupidity then obviously what we should attack is charge so the lower levels levels 0 through iv have to be aimed at getting off charge in the absence of any ability on the part of the pc to face the actual source of the charge and erase it we cant get anything but trouble from trying to put the pc into the actual cause of the charge so at the lower levels you dont erase much charge you get the pc out of the charge destimulation is what we must aim for at levels 0iv so that the pc will be moved out of masses of charge we destimulate by attacking keyins we are not trying to get rid of the charge we are trying to pull the person out of it the person cant recognize the actual goal until he is separated from the keyins that stupefy him to get the pea under the mattresses ie the bank under the keyins and upsets you have to move the mattresses out of the way another analogy there is drain at the bottom of murky pool the pc cant see it or find it but he can drown trying what you have to do is to clean away most of the water and guck then the pc can find the drain and let the water and muck drain off 595 you have to understand an ri for it to blow since it is thought not the symbols that represent it in english that is why session arc breaks inval or whatever can prevent ris from blowing life is all jammed up for person with ris and gpms the guy with his attention gruesomely and howlingly concentrated on some little tiny piece of mattress ticking see above must be shown that he can do something about the mattresses he can do something about it and he gets big reality and hope factor and his confidence resurges on this basis if he could get his attention off just one piece of mattress ticking for few minutes it would make him feel so different and so interestingly alive compared to how he has felt that now he gets big upsurge in reality and you can get him to tackle lot more youve got gradient in some cases the environment is so charged that the person cant take any attention off of it in this case you have to give the person change of environment to nonrestimulative environment here is an analogy say you have lion tamer faced with four ferocious lions and all he has is weak chair and he is running out of blank cartridges you are trying to interest him in biteproof suit but he cant put any attention on it you have to handle the lions first lion by lion and then sell the overwhelmed trainer the lionproof suit this would be type 3 pts handling the next level up above total overwhelm level i is the person who is so engrossed in his ptps that he is obsessively solving everything solving his pt such person goes around with wild strings of sol5tis i hi1 haadann the time if i do i could and soandso wouldnt and then id and theyd etc his solutions are so pyramided that you dont dare touch any corner of the pyramid or the lot will collapse you can handle this pc by using your lowest level of actual processing with itsa on solutions which takes over the automaticity of it see also pp 576577 above on auditing problems and solutions as well as 6404c21 shspec17 problems and solutions pp 614618 below level ii is the first processing level it contains repetitive processes and objective processes here there is danger of restimulating gpms unless you use only things that are not in actual gpms is there something that isnt in an actual gpm and can therefore be processed with impunity yes nouns and most pronouns some pronouns are in goals but at level ii you are far enough from the gpm that pronouns are generally safe but farther along you had better avoid such pronouns as myself i appears as rare item in gpms also but nobody has goals in the form to be noun nowhere in gpms do you have noun terminals and oppterms there are only nesses ities and tions adjectival and adverbial forms so you can process noun terminals with impunity think of communication would perhaps lead you straight into gpm think of communicator would not that is the missing secret of why the twentieth acc made clears nouns were processed in brackets nouns can only be locks therefore when you process them you get keyouts you would key out actual gpms by keying out locks on ris adding pronoun or noun can make an unsafe process safe 596 what is an actual gpm or an actual ri it is mass with significance that is what you need to know at level iv therefore keyin is and will always be mass with significance almost anything in short that you could think of so masses with significances key in actual gpms which is why an environment is restimulative pt is one huge mass of restimulators present time is haunted area it is not the significance that keys in the gpm or the ri so to key one out you have to get masses plus significances if you have an actual ri with significance and someone keeps throwing the significance at you it will key you in so process like how could you helphow could i help would throw the pc into the ri to make it safe you have to put in help you or so that youve got mass plus significance running masses with significance is important because since masses with significance key in actual gpms running them keys out actual gpms at level i the mass with significance that the pc gets accustomed to is the auditor recall terminal would be good process arc straightwire works because and as long as you have terminal pronoun like someone or something in it and for the same reason you can prepcheck mass that has significance as long as its there and you are running it you can run it in brackets etc at level ii you have the pc do objective processes this fact plus the fact that control communication and havingness contain basic laws of life make 8c highlevel workable process the laws of life like control communication and havingness are senior to gpms but it is the wall that makes 8c workable it was the wall which since it was mass with significance had keyed in actual gpms so when you get the pc familiar with the wall the wall keys out and the gpm destimulates the auditing cycle itself is helpful and beneficial as well the auditing cycle is probably the basic process that makes level ii the pcs awareness of the auditor as friendly helpful mass with significance is also destimulative this awareness of the auditor tends to destimulate masses in general for the pc furthermore the auditor is not just mass with significance but also involves hope factor this is twopole universe as bucky fuller once taught lrh in elizabeth nj the twopole nature of communication showed up when lrh tried solo auditing himself on line plot he could go through it but there was ta one terminal gives ta one terminal plus thousandth of terminal gives bit of ta etc the auditor has to be real to the pc for there to be session and ta early on this isnt true so it is up to the auditor to remedy the unreality of the auditor to the pc ie to help the pc to find the auditor reality should increase with auditing new process introverts the pc enough so that at first the auditor is less real to the pc so at first you could get less ta than when the pc gets used to the process early on the pc is so charged up that he has reality on any other terminals and there is terminal for him to discharge against he is mobile standing wave such an only one gets ta since there is one else around charge has accumulated on this pc to the point where other terminal exists he is trapped in the standing wave of noflow this is an animated standing wave that blocks all incoming and outgoing flow the pc is stuck in series of wins or loses he has lost terminal that he could 597 talk to so he solves it by being in continuous communication with that terminal now if people arent that terminal they are nobody or he wasnt in comm with that one either he mustnt be there and he mustnt communicate there are tremendous keyins involved here to get ta we would have to rehabilitate otherterminalism at level ii we would do it with pronouns since we cant assess for terminals at level iii you would assess by observation discussing things on list with the pc and getting all his considerations you dont do much with the assessment this applies to r3sc slow assessment and r2c assessment by dynamics etc along with terminal we get period of time time is very important to the degree that you can destimulate somatic by dating it this works because all restimulation depends on mistake in time the pc thinks that the time something occurred is now his head hurts in 1964 because he got clobbered in 1944 the basic lesson that you are trying to teach about engrams is that the pcs time is awry the only thing that fouls you up in handling an incident by just dating the incident and having it blow is the fact that it has already been wrongly dated eg the pc already wrongly dated it you can find the date of the wrong dating you can find what the wrong date was there can be several wrong dates then you can find the actual date on which the incident occurred in view of the fact that you cannot easily run terminals that have not been accurately assessed we can use this time factor at level iii especially if an assessment has been done by higherlevel auditor to get something to run in problems intensives which involve getting the time of the incident terminals etc problems intensive is explained on pp 134 and 249 above and in hcob 9nov6l the problems intensive use of the prior confusion we have made class iv clearing level it is an assessmenttype process to make keyedout clear using prepchecks you use r3 do list of the pcs goals find one that stays in so what if it is an implant goal or wrong goal it stayed in do terminals list for that goal both goal and terminal lists should be short lists listed to clean needle you dont get somatics from wrong goals you get them from right goals that are suppressed or invalidated so you list for the terminal with who or what would have the goal find terminal that is noun then prepcheck it up to point of highlevel cognition or more ta then do another goals list and find another terminal this cycle repeated will give us clear by keying out the actual gpm keep the goals lists for later on you could use higherclassed auditors to do the assessment steps the only thing that can key in an actual gpm is mass with significance so prepchecking the mass plus significance tends to key out the locks that keep the gpm connected to pt keep it light in agreement with the pcs reality so that you dont get him protesting or invalidating the actual goal if you sum up the terminal into service fac you probably have another family of processes to use the terminal was what the pc was using as makeguilty mechanism this is cousin to ow so if the terminal wont prepcheck you could use service fac brackets on it how could you make yourself rightothers wrong about it however it is not likely that you will have to do this 598 you can key out actual gpms actual gpms are keyed in only by masses with significance and oddly enough there will be only one mass with significance in the environment that is really raising the devil with the pc when you get that one you can key him out you can fish him out of the bank so that he can go back and clean up the actual gpms l ron hubbard type 3 idate17364 volnum2 issue11 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec11 the road to perfection 6403c17 shspec11 the road to perfection lrh has had gamble on time going since january of 1963 the question was could he complete the job before the roof fell in he neglected organizations and scientologists until february of 1964 in order to research full time msh caught the brunt of it august marked the point at which he found out that it could be done the materials were there from then until january of 1964 the material was labelled codified and put together so that it could be communicated at the same time bridge had to be created from the man on the street up to reach for the upper levels one that would be real to the man on the street that was more difficult operation person has to be walked forward with wins at every step that are real to the person so that he will keep going forward and not get discouraged some pcs in fact most pcs cannot have win that amounts to anything at all the tiniest of wins is all that would be tolerable to such person at apathy there is low acceptance level of win eg nothing terrible happened to today would be the highest acceptable level of win to such person so you may have to rehabilitate the pcs ability to have win too for this reason it is more difficult to get someone from level 0 to level iv than to get him from level v on up he has certainty yet it is easier to climb mont blanc with an experienced mountaineer than it is to climb foothill with girl in tight dress and spike heels there is political problem in that we are faced with world that is getting more and more pessimistic and bent on giving people wins the acceptance level of win dwindles away to practically nothing anyway lrh did the job in time so now he is working out organization classification etc basic auditing has been put into good condition it has been rough but it has made seasoned individuals things dont have to be smooth if they are certain giving someone gradient series of wins can be interfered with by his having minor arc breaks and stopping auditing for awhile or there is someone who is openminded win isnt available and you get discouraged and give up seeing that win is available you dont create one dissemination hangs up on this one point the available win you write off someone if you see win available but that is monitored by your acceptance level of win you have to be able to accept level of win that is so low that it is real to the public person the scale of win is gradient scale it is important to anyone trying to get somewhere with scientology it has two sides an outward win of assisting someone and an inward win of being assisted it is win for someone if he assists and lose if he fails to assist based on his intention to assist if an auditor helps pc and the pc doesnt recognize the change in order to feel good about it the auditor must have certainty of observation that requires 599 agreement from the pc that something has been done you have to be able to see and be certain of having seen win in pc whose acceptance of wins is so low that he doesnt know that he has had one your certainty level has got to be high that is an almost impossible level to attain but if you dont attain it you will go into agreement with the pc on acceptability of wins comfort relaxed frame of mind and some serenity about things requires that you know the exact situation and know that it is the exact situation true selfconfidence and poise as opposed to the ability to endure or suffer depends on the ability to conceive the truth of any situation knowing the truth of the existing situation is the only thing that supports selfconfidence most departures from the truth come about as an effort to attain safety and selfsecurity from fear of what might happen to him mans civilization forces lies on him at many points by making telling the truth uncomfortable or even fatal it promulgates the idea that if you said nothing but the truth for 24 hours you would lose everything but if one fails to announce truth one is to that degree protecting lie at this point person begins to surround himself with lies so society brings the individual to tolerate lies it sees virtue in lies it aids lies recognition of the truth is therefore converted into enduring the truth this is downscale mockery of an upscale item recognition of the truth in situation is the only way to asis the situation however one can be confronted with so much truth that one cannot asis it and one gets swamped by it this discourages person from recognizing truth also it leads to notis of truth it is lack of gradient that brings person away from recognition of truth and makes him less clearsighted there is gradient and youve got to have one time enters into it since it is part of gradient for instance the french revolution was the result of ramming in couple of major truths too fast political freedom is ok people could be educated to advantage but there was gradient so the french people ended up more debased after the revolution than before the truth of the situation wasnt gradiently recognized or approached there was evolution from darkness to dazzle the true believer has real reality with the truth that he espouses truth requires reality which is the ability to assimilate truth if someone reaches with gradient with reality they wind up with reality on truth it is not ever assimilated assimilation depends on causedistanceeffect on communication and on an even balance of mind affinity while assimilating truth without arc is denied to the individual and can wrong and harm him truth must go hand in glove with understanding if there is understanding truth is not truth to anyone it is just truth all truths are attainable transcendentalism the notion that the truth transcends our ability to understand is lot of baloney there is point in studying the route to truth if you dont know what the truth is studying the truth when one has idea of what the truth is when one has idea of what one is looking for is like looking for memphis without having any idea that there are any towns called memphis or even that there are any towns it is an idiotic activity lets all sit down and study how we can get to gmpsxgrtz and then nobody ever asks what is gmpsxgrtz what do you mean how to get there is it road across space is it measured 600 by time is it spacetime journey that we are making what kind of journey is this to gmpsxgrtz the answer is we11 lets just discuss how to get to gmpsxgrtz the above totally bogs down philosophy kant solved it by saying that you could never find out what gmpsmgrtz is he cut off speculation the work of all current gurus adepts and of lao tze etc is all concerned with how you approach truth with idea of what truth is this is ridiculous lrh performed the flatworm experiment in 1938 and found that memory was transferable in monocell lrh points out that current experimenters in the area will quit soon because their results will shortly get bizarre enough as with the advent of past lives in the wichita foundation so that their appropriations will be cut off since their researches will be too unreal to their money sources we are in an optimum condition with regard to knowing what truth we are trying to approach since we can demonstrate by exteriorization separation between the person and the body we know that we are going towards the free individual we know that our road to truth is the creation of such an individual we know that there is difference in orders of life between man and vegetable we know what truth we are trying to attain everybody has some sympathetic harmonic with that truth what is their reaction to it it depends on their reality on the approach to this truth we know that life is right there where the pc is sitting so to get to truth journey across time and space is not really required the journey consists of undoing the lies by which the person has walled himself in all we have to do to recover the individual and his ability is to undo the turns for the worse that he has taken we are traveling road that has been followed only backwards the way the tao whatever we know what it is it is the road that the individual has followed from degree of perfection and beingness and selfness on down to disintegration forgettingness bluntingness until hes in the state you find him in all the auditor has to do is walk him back that road its all there its all metermarked we are taking each lie in turn that landmarked further degradation and undoing it we are recovering the individual and his potential so the road to truth adds up to 1 the individuals potential 2 the situations in which the persons potential got lessened and what has happened to this individual 3 how this individual is related to the rest of the universe 4 what we can do to restore the potential of that person that is all part of the truth truth from the viewpoint of the auditor is what actually happened or the situation that actually exists at any moment in the state of beingness of an individual it is not the ultimate that we are seeking to attain it is not something transcendental truth is that which exists the road to truth might be better called the road to perfection or to an ultimate truth truth is usually all hedged up in so many pitches and so many directions that people want you to go so many curves on the line that you cant separate the wheat from the chaff 601 we know where we are going and how to get there what it takes but we have not mastered an estimation of the individuals ability to conceive of truth you may be talking to grocer about scientology but actually you are talking to him about the road to perfection the composition of himself who are you what do you consist of what potentials do you have what potentials have you robbed yourself of where are you going what is life what is your relationship on any dynamic you may be using the word scientology but these are the things you have embarked upon to discuss and the unanswered question is what can he recognize we need to master the estimation of persons ability to assimilate truth it is not hard to overwhump someone with big chunk of truth eg by exteriorizing him you have had the experience of exteriorizing someone and then having him say omigawd im and its it and then two hours later what exteriorization i wasnt exteriorized well possibly something happened but i dont know youve shot the guy momentarily into the rarefied air of being able to see it but he couldnt have it so you can show people things they cant have and thats how you generate an unreality if we had gradient between wog and ot we would soon get very unreal to everybody but ourselves you can show people things they cant have thus generating an unreality the common denominator here is hit with too much truth the individual degrades you hit this guy he exteriorizes bang he says im im spirit i dont have mass body is body im different than it two hours later hes harder to process his ability to win has been exceeded and he has lost it puts you on withhold not to lay the truth before people so lay out the truth but provide the road by having levels of acceptable truths or realities that an individual can attain establish and rehabilitate his ability to win so that eventually he can have truth and that way you wont just throw the person into complete frothing ecstatic worshipping apathy this is the condition of the true believer in the past when people got some truth they built up secrecy about it but the route must exist and must be wide open not cloaked in secrecy training and skill do have to be there but there is other effort at secrecy the main point is to provide gradient scale to get people up to higher reality the route must exist wide open even if 100 of the people dont travel it l ron hubbard type 3 idate19364 volnum2 issue12 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec12 flattening process 6403c19 shspec12 flattening process an auditor can lay aside some basic fact do something else and then wonder why he is having trouble flattening process is such fact there are two aspects to ending process both having to do with what you are doing with the process 1 fixing the pc up so that he can be audited rudiments 2 auditing the pc this gives you two different endings in rudiments you are doing just enough to cure the elsewhereness of the pc you dont want any ptp to get in the road of auditing use the ruds kit to brush off pt hassles destimulate the pc and get on with what you started as major cycle not knowing this you will never complete cycle of action on pc you will keep on having to audit outruds never finishing cycle because you dont use tools of destimulation to push the outrud out of your road 602 the other extreme is to abandon prepcheck or some major action because the pc had little cognition about something dont use rudslike whisk broom on major action you dont end off in three minutes with little bitty cog you use the ta and you get action off the area you have to unflatten subject before you can flatten it running all the ta out of it that is mainbodyofthesession auditing mainsession auditing is all done with the ta never as with the rudiments if you use the wrong approach you will get the wrong ending and the pc will go nowhere you have to restimulate the pc to audit him you only leave major actions when the ta is off you dont chicken out and say oh it is seeming bit better now is it fine thats cog so we will end off now flunk auditing by list is like r2h you could use sec check list carefully not impinging on the pc not restimulating anything to audit but that is not the way to handle the body of the session where you really want to handle things the approach you use in the ruds is to restimulate nothing so that you can get in and audit something else later auditors who treat bodies of sessions like rudiments damage the pc because they leave processes unflat all sorts of charge will have been left bypassed if this happens the effect of this is dramatic and fastacting in r6 it is less so at lower levels but the long term result is the same you could run what process has been left unflat and get considerable gain what happens if you start prepcheck on one thing and shift to another thing before you finish for one thing the pcs ability to be prepchecked will suffer he will be harder to prepcheck also if you prepcheck with bad comm cycle the tool would get blunted you could even prepcheck prepchecking or prepcheck each prepcheck button the basic reason why prepcheck button goes out is an incomplete cycle of action thetans have bug on continuing they like to see cycles continue that gives the longevity and mass of the physical universe at low level any case is subject to the cycle of action fatalism is total subjugation of the individual by the cycle of action what will be will be the individual is at total effect people are in agreement with the cycle of action but not because it is ultimate truth however it only fades out way up there at higher levels you can widen your timespan and do various odd things with time everybody is used to and in agreement with the cycle of action so it is reality but not truth that you use in auditing violations of it bring about an unreality that is what happens if you start an auditing cycle with pc and dont finish it the pc is parked in the middle of some incompletely asised mass which he carries on into the next process and so on things start looking more and more complicated to the pc as these incomplete cycles stack up freedom is real to him as completing cycle of action so there is both the mass that he hasnt asised and the incompleteness of the cycle the idea of win usually goes along with the cycle of action one wins when one accomplishes something even if it is just the accomplishing of still being there the upper echelon of this comes under intention 603 intention is part of but senior to the comm cycle it has in it every power the thetan has including the power to throw lightning bolts to hold position to make something continue to do away with something strength accomplishment and wit when you are halfshot as thetan when you are pretty bad off but not yet in body when you are pretty gummed up with mass your intention is still quite good enough to intend the emeter across the desk or crayon into the air or the telephone receiver off the cradle the ability to intend is all there is to thetans power all you have to do to weaken thetan is to foul up his intentions which you can do by blunting or giving him loses on his intentions weakness is the only thing that traps the thetan that holds him down etc so the main thing we have to watch in auditing is that we dont weaken the pcs own intention never blunt the pcs own intentions to avoid doing this we must differentiate between the pcs intentions and his bank dramatizations dramatizations are not intended validate the pc not the bank you dont ruin pc by blunting his intentions but you can key in incidents where his intention was blunted if you interrupt cycle of action half way through failure to complete auditing cycles validates the bank and blunts the pcs intentions getting the pcs goals for the session if possible is important in this regard you should at least get them cared for as ruds before getting the body of the session going so that his gis are in and his attention is free so that he has had win in every ptp the pcs intention has been blunted person makes progress when he has ptp because his intentions are blunted he has an intention which something else counters with equal force so that it hangs up in time level v demonstrates this marvellously oppose was the way the power of the thetan was knocked out by taking his goals and intentions and implanting an automatic blunting mechanism the implant gpms themselves oppose each other opposition is the keynote of an implant and it is the only way in which they are aberrative they have too little mass to be really upsetting by themselves it is what has been done to intention that is upsetting children get spoiled not because the get all the want but because they get their reactive intentions validated eg they get rewarded for tantrums and they get their analytical intentions opposed ie the child is not allowed to do what he wants analytically the auditor who only pays attention to pc when he arc breaks is doing the same thing pcs dont turn nasty they get overwhumped by the bank when their own intentions are blunted and the bank dramatizes person who is weakened is unable to hold anything at distance so everything collapses on him if you dont so anything about the pcs intentions you get the pcs dramatizations the auditors intention is valuable to the session because he is less susceptible than the pc to dramatization in the pcs bank his intention is senior to the pcs but if the pcs intention is neglected it weakens and we get an increased chance of dramatization the pcs analytical intentions are also valuable to the session down deep the pc intends to get freedom and return of power ie return of intention he can now go all the way if he works along certain path the intention for him to arrive is sotto voce in the pc and more explicit in the auditor since the auditor isnt getting distracted by the bank the pc can mix up freedom and escape and not want to confront things person is weak to the degree that he has allowed his intention to be blunted and strong to the degree that his intention is free 604 thetans become worried about and hold back their intentions because they have been convinced that their intentions are out of their control and that they can cause bad effects as result if you asked pc what intentions do you have to keep under wraps you would get roaring automaticity scientology can get ahead partly because people attacking scientology have idea what our intentions are world of wars insanity etc is very unreal to them they think that couldnt be their real intention so they attack nonexistent intentions which is why they come off looking like asses if case is recovering he is really just removing his blunted intentions ie he is removing the obstacles that he has put there or agreed to doingness intention has time added to it therefore it is tied into the cycle of action pure intention doesnt necessarily involve time or cycle of action or space you could make an intention in the past present or future time and space are the result of intention which is senior to them as pc comes downscale to normal levels though his agreement with cycle of action results in the disappearance of his intention out of the cycle of action if you take someone who is having terrible time you can show him cycles of action with shortsessioning cchs etc eventually his own intentions start to free up out of the mestiness of it all the only way the auditor can foul this up is to leave his own cycles of action incomplete if we are going to have wins we must validate analytical intention knock out dramatizations and complete cycles of action by flattening processes within the reality of the process involved and in accordance with how much is there to be flattened if you can get an auditing cycle completed you will get win if you dont you will get lose it is that simple l ron hubbard type 3 idate24364 volnum2 issue13 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec13 international city 6403c24 shspec13 international city communication is necessary to stop fights as well as to start them the communications that start fights generally occur over distances that are quite great the distances set up high voltages and the terminals have to shout too loudly so the communication is imperfect great distance in communication enters confusion and misunderstoods they have to shout at each other so they consider that they are mad at each other the leaders have the illusion that they are far enough apart to shoot at each other with impunity one can blow up moscow without destroying washington it is an illusion of security lent by distance but this is longer true none of these national governments can really operate broadly for everyones benefit but they try to go out and influence areas beyond their borders the result is continual brushfire wars eg vietnam where washington and moscow fight by proxy the ultimate result is to bring about dangerous environment in its obsession with defense the government absorbs tax money and spends it on arms so we get economic upset and inflation because of shortage of goods peace doesnt pay literally if money wont buy things it inflates we are told that there are plenty of products in the us but the inflation continues because the us dollar has gone international and there is too little production elsewhere inflation leads to communism and 605 money it leads to slavery because one can keep up with it so everyone therefore has to turn to communism russia however has never succeeded in feeding its own people one reason for this fact is russias defense budget and the large army that they maintain another is the fact that the communistic worker is perpetually on strike because he gets reward for his labor politics has entered into economics where it doesnt belong national degradation results from things like draft laws which put people in choice scene being where they dont want to be and doing things that they dont want to do this leads to apathy the governments are at war not the individual american and russian farmers when in comm get along very well only when depersonalized as soldiers can people act for the organizations of earth and slaughter each other the planet is going to blow up or otherwise become very unpleasant unless some changes are made to bring about peace this has been long think this question of how to promote peace ever since egypt in political spheres perhaps impractical but interesting solution is based on the fact that the two sides of the body would perhaps be at war except for the fact that the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and vice versa so if washington governed the us from moscow and moscow governed russia from washington the chances of war would be immensely reduced advancing the cause of peace pays nobody as things stand now and war does pay the more trouble there is the more importance the political figure has man deifies what causes trouble marie of rumania had very peaceful prosperous government but she didnt get lots of publicity or admiration in the us the war presidents are the ones who get remembered not the peace presidents the common citizen however doesnt make his personal fortune out of such chaos if man is to make any real forward progress he must have peace the only way that government would lay off income tax for instance would be if it werent being faced with demands for military appropriations length of time since the last war determines the state of calm of country the easiest program for international sanity would be one of reducing strife and dissonance in the environment making less threatening environment with less fixation on an unconfrontable future person with future acts weird man is tied to the idea that he lives only once this gives him certain irresponsibility for the area he lives in cf neville chamberlain i bring you peace in our time man wont buy the idea that he will live again there is too much responsibility in this idea to have an effective world peace program the following problems have to be solved 1 the importance of the politician must be maintained he has to keep his importance or he wont support the program 2 continued activity for manufacturers and industry so that the economy wont collapse without war industries 3 shortening of the comm lines among the capitols of the world so that there is greater understanding 4 reduction of individual nations initiatives for waging war 5 reduction of the danger in the environment 6 offering some startling dramatic objective that is very complicated to bring about you need some attractive constructive and hardtoachieve goals 606 the solution would have to be big enough to make the problem of war seem soluble lrh put this together initially as an exercise on capacities of ots one of the things that we have to remember is that we have base called earth we dont want the base any more enturbulated than it has to be nor do we want the base so aware of itself as base that it will resent being one also there are exercises that one should be able to do to improve ones skill they should not be of hostile nature at least towards this planet i am being very vague purposefully so but i think you understand it takes long time to develop technology we have the assets of our technology so our interest in peaceful earth is not only altruistic but also first dynamic interest in its continuance so that our technology can survive earth also has value as base because for one thing it is in nice quiet backwater of the galaxy and likely to be overlooked by others in the galaxy so lrh dreamed up project on which thetans could work together its name became the international city project lrh reached the conclusion that if all the nations capitols were in one geographical area all the major problems mentioned earlier would be solved the governments would be far less prone to go to war they would be close enough to each other to communicate easily there would be false security from distance there would be pleasant social atmosphere with constant parties with heads of states not just diplomats the bombing of such city would become rather remote possibility particularly if you never let people who seemed to be angry at each other leave the capitol at the same time this would create problem of long comm line to the home country you would have to prevent the development of new capitol in the home territory by having the comm line go directly to separate states or counties the comm lines from the governments would not go on via to one major city or central point inside their countries but would go to all the states prefects counties or whatever this would also prevent revolution in the home country it would require building lots of comm lines also building the new capitols in new place would take an immense amount of building additionally you would have an international parliament of earth housed in completely bombproof bunker under mountain it would have appropriate representation based on population production etc there would be plenty of politicking to keep the politicians happy the oneworldtogetherness idea is popular one on earth if elementary steps are taken the rest might follow easily one preliminary step would be 1 all governments turn over nuclear weapons and supplies to the immediately 2 have the and all governments select site for and construct an international city preferably in north africa on the mediterranean coast where land reclamation can expand its area and its comm lines can be easily centered 3 persuade all governments to move their capitols to international city complete with heads of governments confesses and parliaments prohibit secondary capitol or even comm relay center within the country itself 607 4 secure comm lines and command lines from international city to each internal county or state regard each of these counties or states as an autonomous unit under control of the government in international city 5 reorganize the on formula recognizing land area population figures and production value remove all favored nations categories and the exercise of special privileged and the veto by few form the into judiciary division two houses and an executive branch key officials are to be popularly elected within the nations that they represent and by voting by both upper and lower houses for the head of the reform the charter into an instrument specifically engaged in governing the heads of nations and international affairs forbid in the charter all interference with individuals or smaller communities 6 forbid all warlike treaties of mutual assistance 7 create small effective military force for the abolishing all other war facilities 8 persuade international monetary activities to stabilize economics 9 limit what national government should be up to in the we go ahead with this plan on the basis that general agreement among scientologists would push all the individual efforts into coordinated activity so that they would count here is big plan that is sufficiently sloppy so that if it went pretty far awry if everybody were moving in that direction you would have some possibility of attaining the final objective it has good figurefigure value it is sufficiently interesting plan that it would cause lot of conversation it also has kind of lonely individuality in that one else is doing anything at all for world peace it coheres what could be lots of individual actions it is feasible because it doesnt have to be done perfectly to be done ideas from scientology occur and appear in the world to surprising degree so there is more chance of this plan coming to pass than one might think if scientologists were involved in bringing about what amounts to complete political revolution of earth there would be good dissemination in it scientologists would be available to handle personal upsets etc so their influence would get expanded keep the word scientology parked somewhere on the fringes of this thing and we would get monopoly on mental healing within the boundaries of international city the main virtue of this plan is that there has been complete void of ideas for world peace and this is an intriguing one it is something which if adopted would certainly make the planet less dangerous it has its liabilities but they are outweighed by its advantages someone could perhaps try to take over the central government and become dictator but this would be pretty hard to do hitler failed to take over the world true the international city arrangement does put all the political control in one place but it also puts into that place lot of wily guys not being able to attain their political objectives by war they will try to attain them by diplomacy and they would welcome the proximity of other capitols and large legislature to lobby in they are not about to give this up for dictatorship they wouldnt cooperate with such dictator 608 what about national revolts well that possibility would be equally apparent to the head of every state in international city and i think he would tend to govern in such way that it wouldnt happen the political government of international city itself would be independent of the it would have enough force to balance any house guards or bodyguards that might be around the product of this city government is the safety and security of individuals in international city it would be kept as itself by being made very profitable not political international city would originally be financed in such way that it itself becomes property which becomes very profitable to some people it doesnt matter who they would consider it governmental responsibility because it is profitable the russians would hate this last bit but then they are always goofing up in that area anyway the way to have calm international city is to make sure that the ownership of the land and property of international city brings in money to small group who sit as council in international city and make sure that things remain nice and peaceful and profitable politics would be involved this makes international city hell of piece of bait for some construction company after it has built its buildings it is going to draw rent on them from here on out member of that construction company is going to sit on the governing board of that city with government over its head and all it has to do is sit there and keep the peace in international city youve put very hard core of very hardheaded guys who want to make awful sure that they keep dragging down the rent you see from the white house you are also splitting up political control if you want to see lousy capital take look at capitol that is owned by the government governments take very bad care of things they own because theres profit in it for anybody our direct public interest in international city would be limited to acting as clearing house for information concerning it overtly it is something for scientologists to support help out on and talk about just like everybody else covertly it is training ground for the budding ot nice exercise for him it becomes very fruitful it gives him something useful to do perhaps the main thing that this plan offers is some hope for people it gives the scientologist town it puts piece of this planet into his hands to be interested in i chose the location i did because it is where the oldest comm lines on the planet were located there is lot of coast and country in the area between tunis and tripoli many old comm lines have gone through that area it should be fun for scientologists and ots it should create fantastic amount of new wealth in desert it is busy its broad fourth dynamic method of dedangerizing the environment as process just saying that feasible plan does exist puts in some hope and to that degree it dedangerizes the environment there is more future in it it is method of disseminating to the heads of nations in one small area all at once we have had trouble with governments recently they have been disrespectful we shouldnt stand for it the way you can really upset government is to move its capitol the fact that you are talking about moving all the earths capitols depowers the nations of earth with regard to scientology even if they agree that it 609 is good thing to do removing the nations capitols from their positions makes the nations weak terminal is as powerful as it can hold its position you are threatening them with not being able to hold their position it puts scientology in position of being of comparable magnitude the governments of earth rather then just being of comparable magnitude to single government since it would be controlling the positions of all the governments of earth they dont know the tech so they couldnt explain the odd feeling that they would get at the idea of moving they dont know that it is very important to hold position if you want power just espousing such plan would lead to shift of relative power between you and the government they would feel as though they were slipping if we hold to this as central agreement it will eventually come about it depends for its power on interest there is moneyed group behind this but there is huge vacuum provided that would pick up such people and put them into it but then they are not now ie wont then be in back of it behind it theyre in it we are in back of it l ron hubbard type 3 idate10464

scientology courses there are three zones of responsibility in course management 1 providing valuable subject materials scientology now embraces and culminates anything desirable in the fields of religion mysticism spiritualism or mental sciences so we have valuable subject materials 2 organizing and codifying the materials so they are highly effective and comprehensible lrh and msh have figured out the right form and organization of bulletin there are twelve headings 3 instructing the student in those materials to high level of competency and comprehension the largest potential randomity comes in 3 above students need individual handling to clarify their individual misunderstoods there are slow students there are only slow instructors fast course is well instructed slow course is poorly instructed bad course gets bad enrollments if you want full course give wellinstructed course we do have to develop methods of handling students who throw lots of complication and questions into learning the materials the instructors attitude should be very tough and very helpful he should be able to discriminate between student who is genuinely confused and is putting in some arbitrary of his own and student who is merely being an obstructionist the instructor must not be concerned with the students knowledge of inessentials but must be very tough about the students knowledge of essential material examine essentials only dont bother with inessentials instruction is fast to the degree that the instructor gets the essential data through to the student and gets the student off of his concern with bricabrac ill health depends on the broken dramatization of gpm 610 l ron hubbard type 3 idate14464 volnum2 issue15 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec15 the classification and gradation program 6404c14 shspec15 the classification and gradation program the classification program applies to auditors for pcs there is the gradation or levels program such program became necessary as it became evident that one was bringing people up the line from reality to higher levels the levels became necessary to bring the general public up the line on gradient what gave auditors trouble was that pcs didnt know anything about what they were doing or where they were going in the west there is tradition of philosophy in practical life the healing tradition is one of failed help since time immemorial members of the public have had nothing but failed help that is what the member of the public compares us to psychiatry etc so people have tradition of treatment healing improvement ability etc there is tradition of selfbetterment our biggest task is to define scientology to people where there is datum to compare it to gradient and common communication ground so they cant get their wits wrapped around scientology the pc just sits there in the midst of confusion getting processed without knowing what processing is so we have to create not only science but also communication eighty percent of untrained people will vanish because they never got out of earlier practices that they didnt like auditors were losing these pcs because of not getting the pcs educated to know what they were in furthermore the auditor in the field was upset about pcs having to take formal course to get up to class iv so there is compromise the pc must get educated as he gets processes but the training is done by the auditor and the pc must pass training requirements lrh proposes checksheet to go before each grade on which the pc will get checked out before going on to the next level the pc learns definitions he gets an idea that there is something here that aligns with his goals the pc failed in his goals long time ago and is in apathy unless someone else helps him going on up to level iv the pc would have to be trained on clay table this would never have been possible without line plots and goals plots even now the pc needs good training to understand gpms and to be able to follow commands about them whats more when he gets on up the line he wont be completely ignorant ot there are three routes to getting up the line 1 the pc route 2 the coauditor route 3 the classed professional auditor route on the pc route grade is something pc has that compares with the levels of scientology the pc is not welldisciplined lrh says that he has found it hard to audit someone right off the street or even to get him to answer sensible question such person reinterprets it etc this gets straightened out as he goes up the grades each grade has an ability that the pc attains the pcs conquest of the environment is the index of his grade this gives him measure of his advancement the grades are gradient scale of confront of the environment for instance at level iii the pc is not always dwelling on things that happened in the past he has relative freedom from the past there is difference between hurting and worrying about hurting at level iv the pc has stopped trying to make everybody wrong and himself right thus the levels are defined in terms of abilities regained processing improves confront of the environment so does training training gives the pc something to look forward towards instead of providing merely negative gain book can evaluate for pc without the auditor having to 611 an auditor can process pc up to the class that the auditor is trained to the second route is that of the coauditor on this route person isnt classified but receives certificate as coauditor he may not charge for his processing or call himself professional he has been through the training courses but he hasnt been classified the coauditor can get an hca certificate but not an hpa certificate someone who goes on through the academy and gets classed gets the hpa certificate he has been formally trained examined judged competent to audit pcs etc person can coaudit getting auditing in exchange for auditing sooner or later he will either get up to getting professional class vi auditing or he will get on class vi course at central organization and go up that way the professional or classed auditor gets his training gets his classification and now has some selectivity about his coaudit he probably gets audited by another pro he is likely to get more precise processing this way and any errors would be remedied quickly he would probably get up the levels rapidly furthermore pcs can help him get further trained by getting him more pcs there are points in training that are easily overlooked or forgotten matter how much they are emphasized and stressed these get straightened up when auditors come to saint hill the classifications for auditors are stiffened up changing the original issue to this degree someone can go to the academy and get his certificate but when he wants to be classed he has to be good at that level if someone has certificates up to level iv but classifications he would have to get classed up from class i on tough requirement for actual performance all training and all courses depend on 1 having valuable material or data to impart weve got that in scientology 2 the material must be codified in must be in condition in which it can be imparted to others so that it communicates 3 the material must be instructed because the questions that will arise will be individual to the student instruction consists of handling those questions by showing where the correct answer is the second point is being handled now to clarify codify and simplify the available material down to the necessary amount there are only about thirty operations that cover all of auditing at all levels instruction is the most random area since different levels of application and understanding may be demanded of the person being checked out on certain piece of data education should not be merely to keep someone occupied l ron hubbard type 3 idate16464 volnum2 issue16 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec16 auditing by lists 6404c16 shspec16 auditing by lists the auditor is success as magazine fred hare is the editor one of the goals series has turned out to be nonexistent why does it always take lrh to find these things it puts lot of responsibility on him this puts some extra strain on his case he is currently in zone of overcorrection looking so hard for things wrong that all he finds is invalidation of what is right 612 auditing by list is done at level iii the needle level lower levels are tone arm levels few auditors getting started in auditing are aware of the skill needed for good metering with the needle unlike the ta the needle can be upset by session events although the ta can show if the pc is not getting gain but the process has lot to do with the ta too the needle registers first the session and second the process or reaction of the pc ta is not direct representation of the reaction of the pc to the session the ta does not analyze the session beyond saying whether the pc is getting gain not so the needle which first and foremost registers the session and secondarily registers the process or reaction of the pc the only difficult manifestation of the needle for the auditor to learn to cope with is the dirty needle its source is always the auditor nothing else it traces back to the auditors failure to handle the auditing comm cycle or the larger auditing cycle the absolute of never having the pcs needle dirty is unattainable but it is the auditors reaction that produces the dirty needle by not accepting his answer not acknowledging cutting his comm cycle or whatever level iii is almost totally devoted to needle at this level if you follow the needle you will get ta action and if you dont you wont the pc may have charge on question he may have interest in it if so the needle will not register if you miss seeing the noreaction and give the question again you get read by virtue of the pcs considerations protest or whatever the first reaction of the needle is to the session the second reaction of the needle is to the process or question if the auditor overlooks this the pc goes out of session and the needle will never clean up on the question etc therefore you dont let auditors at level iii assess anything since if they dont realize the readonsessionfirst rule they can foul up arc break assessments repeatedly and worsen the arc break the mark v emeter is beautifully balanced to read maximally on thought and minimally on body motions it reads just below the pcs reality at level where the pc can have reality the meter has greater degree of workability than you will ever need so calls for improvement are passe bad meter wont give you needle response on thought when needle is moving fast you can miss reads because the inertia of the needle prevents manifestation if the needle is quiet it is more sensitive if someone can really handle meter at level iii he will have trouble with assessments at level iv at level iii you have to learn to keep the needle clean by keeping the session good so the session at time gets in the road of the needle reads that you ars getting as you audit cleaning clean causes the pc to go against the session the needle is now not reading his bank it is reading his reaction in the session the auditor must know first that this can happen and second what to do when it does and how it manifests lrh claims to have made all these errors with the additional difficulty of not knowing that they were mistakes 613 any change of pace of the needle is read it will be discoverable by the pc if it read on the meter on level vi there comes time when the pc stops reading well on the meter anyway because he doesnt have much reactive mind left and the pcs postulates in session are what give rocket reads if one has an ability with which one has lots of problems there is reactivity mixed up in it giving problems and taking the power out of the ability getting rid of the reactivity gives person the full scope of his ability the magnitude of his performance is then much greater pc who fears that he will lose his creative ability by getting rid of the bank needs to know this at level iii of course there isnt too much of problem the being is mostly reactive and the needle behaves pretty well on reactivity and doesnt get in your face too much on the session somebody can still be upset about the session and sometimes still even read bit on the needle at level iii the reactive read is larger than the analytical read but you have to be able to keep the needle clean by keeping the comm cycle straight and you have to be able to tell when the pc is running right and not in need of sessioncorrecting dont harass the pc when things are going all right and above all dont blame the pc for the strange behavior of the needle be aware that something has happened in the session that is showing up on the needle knowing these data you can do auditing by list auditing by lists has nothing to do with assessment on auditing by lists you are not interested in which level or item of the list reads best you are simply interested in going down the list and making sure that each one in turn is cleaned up if it reads youre not trying to go down list and find one of those levels assessment means reading down list to find which item reads best because that is the item auditing by list is effort to find the item it is just making sure that each question taken up in turn is longer reading which requires reading the question to find out if it reads and then continuing to get answers until the question longer reads noticing that the question is longer reading and passing on to the next differentiation between reads on the list question and session reads caused by the pcs reaction to something going on in session is necessary part of this action so you clean up the right things on the above cf method 3 and 5 list handling what if the needle gives one indication and the pc says something else for instance the pc may say and the meter reads then clean up possible session outnesses with protest inval and cleaning clean then recheck the question this keeps the pc from being invalidated by your insistence on somethings being there these lists by which you are auditing are nothing more than the plusminus misdemeanors and upsets that person could have an auditor should be able to make up list for particular pc only few prepared lists can be done over and over again l1 and l4 are the lists used for auditing by list with the questions asked for broad scope you can alternately clean l1 and l4 and keep getting different areas cleaned up rudiments and prepchecking are in fact kind of auditing by lists level iii is that level where you clean the list if one can get through that then he can assess at level iv you are using list in different way you are looking for the level to use in looking for service fac 614 the reads that you get at level iii are much tinier than what you will get at level vi so dont take little reads at level vi pc who has been arc breaky gets all his bpc cleaned up and will come up shining when audited by list on l1 and l4 l ron hubbard type 3 idate21464 volnum2 issue17 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec17 problems and solutions 6404c21 shspec17 problems and solutions there are some research maxims standing apart from and monitoring the body of scientology having to do with how you figure it out excalibur was whole bookfull some of these maxims are in dianetics the evolution of science these maxims give the rationale and the how of how you figure it out every once in awhile one of them gives you grip on existence for instance one maxim was take body of knowledge that has produced bad effects and results you move it out and pay further attention to it you can eventually corral the truth by elimination by this approach you use this all the time when analyzing cases you see what didnt work so you dont run the pc on that the reverse maxim doesnt happen to be workable something having been true in one instance doesnt prove that it has any wide workability auditors who dont realize this get stuck in win with some offbeat process or approach and wind up with failures in trying to pilot way through the goals plot when items read one day and not the next when they checked out and then turned out to be something else lrh had datum to cover the situation problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions it is the number of solutions not their complexity that determines the complexity of problem this defeats the idea of the one shot clear beautiful though the dream may be the problem of government must be terribly complex since it has had many many solutions it is not that big solution equals big problem it is that complex problem equals many solutions this could be the situation that you are faced with when pc doesnt respond well to processing it could be that you have complex case on your hands that will only be resolved by complexity of processes if persons problem in life has required many solutions then it must be very complex and will require complexity of processes to resolve simple solutions dont work on complex problems you dont resolve all political problems by voting democratic there is another maxim solution must be as complex as the potentials of the problem in this context potentials means threats along the dynamics here you are talking about dangerous problem for instance problem that has the potential of knocking out survival along various fronts is big problem you will get defeated if you offer simple solution if person has dangerous problem and you give him simple solution he will reject it problems that are simple dont become dangerous only complex ones do they require complex solutions if this were not the case the person would have solved the problem already problem wouldnt be dangerous if the problem hadnt been allowed to coast along pretty far the proper course of action in handling problem is to find out all aspects of the problem that must be solved there are bound to be some that are not apparent at first find how many solutions will be needed you could look it over by dynamics the procedure is 1 get what the immediate pressure is indicate that there has to be solution 2 get the situation differentiated out into its component problems indicate the necessity for solution for each 615 this takes the confusion out of the situation just getting the guy to sort it out makes him feel better because he can now at least see the area better also you have put the buffer of needed solution in front of every element of it the pc will be half way handled just by that action then you can find solutions on gradient he could start gradiently to see which problem could be solved now this makes level 0 breeze when it is usually rough level 0 is rough because most peoples problems are so big that they dont know they have them they dont look at the importances in their vicinity at all man is in this condition because solutions have been possible simple solutions to complex problems fail the international city idea is good and complicated it has to be because of the size of the problem that it is trying to solve the usual solution vote republican is utterly useless as you go up the levels it may appear that you are confronting more complex problems but actually both problems and solutions become simpler as you go up the levels as you go up you are actually confronted with fewer problems and fewer demanded solutions the psychologist and psychiatrist think that you go down through mans psyche to the bottom they are wrong you are there you have to go up to heightened awareness person on his way up has to get more and aware of kinds of awareness and of existence his only route is up psychiatrists think that you have to go down in mans psyche to get to rockbottom motivations etc through three or four subvolitional layers this is untrue you dont go down in mans psyche you are there there isnt any hidden deep motivation all you have left is the individual and he is motivated you have to go to higher levels this fellow hasnt got an unconscious to be probed he is unconscious the psychiatrists are looking for the wrong thing they are looking for the hidden depths below guys level of awareness those deeper levels of unconsciousness that they are looking for are sitting in the chair right in front of them it is not the recesses that are hidden you cant get the individual further down with drugs etc and learn anything in order to discover anything about the individual youve got to make the individual more aware not make him less aware in order to find out more about him psychiatrists are asking the fireman in ship to help them find the fireman and the fireman having lost his identity and beingness will willingly try to help out by looking for himself you are looking for mans spirit but he is the spirit thetans increasing awareness of his beingness his awareness of existence and the problems and solutions of life are what delineate the seven levels of processing you could draw up the levels just by asking people at various levels what is problem to you if persons awareness of his relationship to existence is increased you can bring about heightened condition of livingness performance ability etc and that is the only way to do it regardless of claims for drug enlightenment or high performance on drugs drugs reduce awareness people can think that they perform better when drunk or drugged that is because they are less aware of their condition 616 the logic that if we became little less conscious we would be lot better off has been extant since the beginning of this universe the final solution to problems has been to become unaware of them the penultimate solution is im doing right the assumption that whatever you are doing is right so if someone wants to improve himself he has two courses 1 to become more aware 2 to become less aware and hope that you dont get run over the latter is treacherous it is hoping that everything will be all right hope substitutes for control confront awareness and certainty ill just forget about it and hope that it doesnt bother ill become less aware is the idea for instance women in the 19th century fainted as solution this is like the black panther mechanism only worse because one is not simply ignoring the black panther one is becoming unaware people get somewhat terrified when you reverse the flow on them and get them to confront all the things of which they have become unaware the trick of becoming unaware is that you never actually get there this universe is progress towards less and less awareness its the route to total sleep and the trick is that its so rigged that you never get to sleep the lower you go the more problems youve got because now the littler problems seem bigger becoming unaware of the big problem brought the thetan less power or force it reduced his confront so now he is less able to confront little problems so the little problem now seems as big as the big problem seemed one stage back it seems far more threatening the power and threat of the big problem is vested now in the smaller one there was bigger problem of the same gradient that he had ceased to confront say gale he became unaware of it almost purposely and this put him into confront only of slight wind but the big problem was full of terror so the breeze is full of terror there is the trick of uncovering hidden memories occasionally you can uncover memory by trickery and increase the pcs awareness slightly and he will lose little fear but it doesnt improve his condition much he just shifts to another fear symptom substitution all little fears are irrational and are based on bigger fear freud pointed this out this happens because the individual solves the bigger fear by becoming less aware you can find the bigger fear that caused the lesser fear this is what freud was looking for but you can also throw the pc into the bigger fear and knock him for loop by not bailing him out you mustnt increase persons awareness beyond his ability to confront he has the choice either to cognite or to bolt he is very likely to bolt that is why analysands commit suicide in analysis when they do dont process by reaching into the deeper states to find the fears that motivate this individual there is deeper subconscious for the individual to go into if you exteriorize person without taking off the charge of why he was in his head if you take him out of his head and make him confront problems that he had gone into his head not to have to confront you will find that now you cant get him out again with can opener 617 you can put someone into higher level of awareness he now becomes aware of the problems that he has not handled this alone makes it necessary for him to progress by gradients you will make it as long as you let him sit down for awhile and enjoy the view he is victim of selfcreated charge great masses of it when he gets more aware he backs off from it you have to take charge off by getting ta action then he can easily move up to where you can get more charge off it is not spectacular activity as the pc moves up the line his problems look bigger but only because he can see more reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions this is the key to processing person at level 0 has dangerous problems and must have complex solutions how do we get around all this the old solution is what he is sick from cures cures cures it is use to solve somebodys problems for him what gets us away from this is that we arent giving people solutions the basic error is the most fundamental part of the problem that can be asised because of the chain of solutions as an auditor you are not giving the pc new solutions for his livingness you are taking out of existence old solutions which now exist in the form of problems youre asising what has been solved in the past and caused the person to become more unaware youre asising old problems you are asising past solvents you are backtracking the way he came down running solutions is running yesterdays problems you are taking out the old think that made him drop doing and be unaware on r1c and r1cm this is r1c with the meter you follow the bd after you complete the cycle of action you were on see p 623 below you are backing the pc through yesterdays problems by getting his solutions if you run such thing as problem you are running it below its proper level of awareness here is the trick problem by definition is something that you cant confront and solution is way by which you dont have to confront something so your effort to handle the problem is to solve it and if the way in which you solve it is to become less aware of it you have moved into lower awareness levels you are looking at yesterdays solutions whether you are running problems or solutions you are actually running solutions when you ask for problems you are asking for something that the pc couldnt confront when you ask for solutions you are asking for something that the pc could confront running problems requires you to confront only the pcs noconfront therefore you dont run problems you run solutions which latter really are problems but which can be confronted its the difference between running noconfront and confront though you are actually running the same thing from different point of view if you call them problems then you are saying the individual couldnt confront them if you call them solutions then you are saying he could so when you run solutions you get rid of the problems that he sets up to avoid confronting things by backtracking his solutions when you do this the pc becomes more aware and more capable of confronting up to the point where he can confront the problems that made him decide to become unaware in the first place and he finds that those in turn were solutions so he finds out what that was solution for etc and he is all set to move on out to freedom this way out is route 2 618 this principle holds true all the way up gpms were very complex solutions which must have had complex problems behind them the main problem was an unwillingness to confront so you dont ask the pc to confront it all at once you do it gradiently that is why levels are there they are there on the basis that the individual at any given time is at his lowest level of awareness you bring him up from there not down you reduce the complexity of the problem by reducing yesterdays solutions youve got to walk him back up into further awareness for him to hold his own in the environment he has now entered that is how to process someone that is why manic sometimes turns on where the pc gets boosted up bit too high for him at particular time so realize that you are getting off the charge that debars the individual from confronting the problems that he has the most complex being you will confront is the lowestlevel pc if you reduce the complexity of the problem by asising yesterdays complex solutions you can get charge off and the pc can act better now because his awareness level came up when you first ask for datum you wont get it but you will get off charge then when you ask for the datum again since you have gotten charge off the area you will get it this is how processing works the road into this universe is successive unawarenesses and the road out is successive awarenesses he got himself into trouble by solving himself into trouble there are lower levels of awareness for you to explore there are only upper levels the road out is not spectacular you take the pc out via the road he came in successive unawarenesses undone l ron hubbard type 3 idate28464 volnum2 issue18 rev0 rdate000 addition0

investigation by the australian government which should beware because when you cut theta comm line you will get an explosion this is because the secret of power is that truth is on theta line power is truth you can extend untruth in certain direction and derive power from it for certain time but what you are really deriving power from is the amount of truth in the situation censorship is cutting of theta line so is failure of the mail interruptions etc government ever survives war you get new regime at least the government that caused or allowed the war cuts the natural beingtobeing comm line and gets thrown out as result the violence of the war is secondary in effect to this the result of cutting the natural thetaline between people the effect of this is obscured because the same being or state may still be there the war itself is temporary the real effects of the war last much longer when the violence recoils upon those who started it this is the mechanism that gives people their almost pathetic belief in retribution you have to cut or interfere with flow before you get much of an explosion as result of flow the cutter of the arc will explode sooner or later 619 the whole auditing cycle is based on this and this is the mechanism that causes the arc break that results from cut comm line this can happen in auditing with rough auditing comm cycle cut theta line in session gives rise to an arc break it is always the auditor who started it and he usually started it much earlier than he would have thought the result is that you get dirty needle then stuck ta then an arc break maybe 1 12 hours after the first auditor mistake if the auditor doesnt realize what he has done he is confused and mystified about where this explosion came from that is why the auditor should tape his sessions and find the point where he cut the pcs comm line cut arc line is similar to cut itsa line the comm lag can be an hour which makes it hard to spot the first minor mistake is the starting point which permits further mistakes pc loss of arc etc the auditor can see it coming before the arc break hits his error there is to ignore it and hope it will go away this is the black panther mechanism you can make lot of mistakes but never be dishonest about your mistakes or you become unreal to others the mistake should be handled when the first signs of it show up in looking for the point of cut comm you can find all sorts of bypassed charge you could take someone and treat this as frontrank auditing problem by running when has your arc been cut this cant be run as the only process since it is an outofarc process you could knock pc to smithereens with process like look around here and tell something you could go out of arc with anything similar to that will do someone in because it cuts his comm line right and left look around here and tell something you dont have to have would be killer too the way the psychologist gets in trouble is in not knowing this datum nor the datum that thetan never gives up thetan never gives up he says he does and that fools people but he never really does the way to handle revolutionary is to channel his revolution slightly not to stop him in his tracks with force people get fooled because the guy will say he has given up but this is window dressing if you see nation that cant produce you know that it is composed of people who are unwilling to do or support what they are being required to do or support cf castro there can be communication but if there is reality or affinity and arc returned from people to government you would only get shadow of return flow from the people you can make tremendous number of mistakes but dont be dishonest about them that breeds unreality selfimmolation isnt the answer either complete ignorance results in great bravery and lots of opinions system of education based on noninspection like that of scholasticism results in something like the dark ages it cuts the arc of knowledge part of being wise individual is being able to perceive when and where ones arc is being cut this would be persons ability to exercise wisdom when there is problem with group wisdom consists of discovering what what r and what c is being cut between what terminals you could locate the problem in the group by finding the area of maximal confusion eg the area of maximal number of dispatches and minimal production there must be two terminals where one is trying to flow arc and the other is trying to cut it or both are trying to flow some arc and also cutting it get the terminals involved and find what is being cut by which it could be both locate the cut the cut r and the cut c then unblock the arc 620 all ptps are suspended and nondelivered communications you cant run out ptp by running undelivered communications because the person with the ptp went ahead and solved it which stuck it you cant solve the problem for him and have any beneficial result solving others problems doesnt work witness the poor results obtained in marital counselling give someone hand sure so how do you unravel messedup being you have to find what his arc for his environment is you will find that his c is to nobody it is at people his r is continually changing and full of doubt so it is shot and his is tossup between his hating everybody andor their hating him oneshot very limited process you could use to alter it is what communication have you been unable to deliver this is not repetitive question and it should not refer to the past because the guy wants to do it right now if you keep trying c without r and you spin in because of the incomplete cycle of communication this could have something to do with people getting spun in by prayer they cant locate the terminal god jc virgin mary saints etc so all the communications go undelivered how does q and failure to complete cycle of action tie in with cutting arc an incomplete cycle of action causes an undelivered communication which involves cut theta line thus it is inevitable that you will blow up as his auditor i have two different frames of reference by which to look at an auditors auditing one is teaching him how to do it and whether he is doing it the way he should be doing it and the other is what did he do that is making him do it wrong ie 1 what is he doing wrong 2 what is happening in the session that throws him off so that he errs under the second heading i always assume he knows perfectly how to do it but that something is disturbing him i start looking for something that has gone adrift in his auditing i dont immediately then go into the subject of dressing him up on the subject of drills you have to have two frames of reference critique of his ability to handle preclears and critique of his ability to handle drills if he knows how to do the drill he has fouled up on handling pc it could be as corny as giving the pc an undelivered communication with an rfactor that says we wont cover what we were on last time because we have finished that when the pc had more to say an overt act is the other side of the coin from the undelivered communication it is communication that one didnt want to deliver but did deliver what saves your bacon in auditing is that the overt act is worse than the undelivered communication in terms of aberrative value because you have now perverted the theta line by causing it to deliver harm this really mucks up thetaline our materials are not dramatization of parts of the bank luckily lrh has gone through moments of fear that such things as the tone scale were based on implants or gpms they are not we understand the situation that we are looking at so well that we sometimes err by injecting more into things than are there all the other data about problems are true but problem is still basically an undelivered communication an overt act actually withhold is not problem it is withdrawal from putting out an arc line because you know that you will abuse it it is selfdiscipline to prevent abuse of arc the basic withhold is dont cause harm this is more fundamental than 621 gpms it is complex reason for undelivered communication ow is an undelivered communication the thetan delivered it far too well so he had better not deliver any other comm along that line and he better not have delivered that one look at person with lot of ptps you could say the following about him 1 he is having an awful time for whatever reason because 2 he is braking himself because he might communicate and therefore he is withholding because these are all rationales basically 1 he is in that state 2 he is there because he hasnt delivered communication the arc break process depends on regretted communication the only way you can run an outofarc process is to make it an alternate process with positive side it is then barely workable it doesnt necessarily run well the only difficulties in this universe or out of it are based on these factors what comm arent you delivering because you have delivered lousy comm you may have to approach it through and r but you want to increase c l ron hubbard type 3 idate30464 volnum2 issue19 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000

check he got run on level vi material flipped out and went to court the legislature has been investigating upperlevel materials have been appearing in court document has turned up showing collusion and plans for how witnesses should testify the org is ignoring instructions to use the document because of their lawyers advice the lawyer is protecting the government of victoria and cables keep coming through begging for money this has interrupted research it shows what happens when an org goes offpolicy and you cant get orders executed policy has been developed out of past errors when it is ignored errors appear and trouble follows jane kember took two years to put johannesburg back together after they went offpolicy the effectiveness of processing and effective processing is you the auditor bringing about desired effect on the pc that is your one activity this applies also to your activities as an instructor lecturer or just to the way in which you produce an effect on someone you are talking to one can produce an effect through threat of destruction and by destruction that is fifty percent of existence fifty percent of all effects in this universe are produced by force if we study that fifty percent we will find that nearly all mental healing activities drift into it this includes electric shock etc it is the solid form of effect psychiatrists do not realize that they are trying to influence thought they have definition of thought they dont even think that anything is there thinking they are trying to influence matter man to them is matter and they are using matter to influence matter they are actually in the field of physics so an auditor runs danger in operating in the remaining fifty percent producing beneficial effects the danger is that the auditor will leave the other fifty percent on automatic and occasionally drift over into it thus everything may be fine for awhile then the auditor suddenly explodes 622 this may be the mechanism of failed help destroy an auditor in blowing up at pc never has and never will have good effect on the pc who provoked it what cures you of doing that is finding on level vi that you did have it all upside down and backwards and that you did actually skip whole code on the pc ultimately you keep to the auditors code for your own good as an auditor since violating it makes auditing much harder taken at random fifty percent of effects would be destructive fortunately by the laws of life it is the other fifty percent that has lasting benefits eradication has to be 100 percent to be effective purity of destruction would be notthereness but destruction doesnt go in that direction it leaves pile of rubble an asising of situation is not looked on as destruction it is seen as constructive beneficial action actually it is an ultimate in the fifty percentdestruction bracket if you want to free someone you dont just blow up the jail he is in and create shambles so the effect that you are trying to produce on the pc is simply to set him free by asising that which is keeping him caged without knocking him around or leaving rubble around it is actually pretty easy to do the way you would leave rubble around would be by giving advice but not asising anything you have launched an otherdetermined action you have set up conflict between two or more other terminals life could be handled by setting it into more violent countermotions as in war this leaves lots of debris those are the mechanics by which life handles its problems ie countermotions terminals vs terminals etc as an auditor you are being asked to decry and put aside the standard dramatizing actions that life is prone to you are asked to assume better more workable discipline you are asked to find out what the problem is what considerations they have had about the problem and what they have done to solve it we find that these are the building blocks of the prison 1 the problem itself 2 what they have said the problem was or what has caused it 3 solutions they have had that is all the cage is built of 1 conceive the problem was there 2 alteris it 3 keep on solving it there doesnt have to have been problem before someone conceived of it since thetan is always capable of postulating then he justifies it assigns it to someone other than himself and makes that person cause and then starts solving the wrong problem he will submerge the problem the solution now becomes problem to him so he solves that one etc etc eventually all he knows about it is that he is unhappy abstracted and cant concentrate that is the prison that he has built as an auditor your art is in asising these bits and pieces rather than adding to them by giving him new solutions if you give the pc command that would asis some problems and you fail to discover that the pc is doing something other than the command you gave him he wont improve you may then change processes still get improvement and end up mad at the pc you would thereby have slipped over into the other fifty percent of effectproduction 623 the only reason why an auditor would start this cycle would be from failing to understand that he is supposed to be knocking out aberration not letting the pc add to it another deficiency in delivering processing to the pc is where the auditor fails to realize that problem has gone green auditor may not know that things blow by asising just by the pcs inspecting things and communicating them to the auditor there could be too little horsepower in the problem for the pc even to cognite it is so insubstantial there is nothing more to it than its isness be on the lookout for the problems having blown on the comm cycle alone before you have chance to handle it the new auditor may never realize that this asising is what his training in trs comm cycle etc are for ideally you want the pc to blow by inspection remember on the other hand the auditor can get so used to things blowing fast that he gets shock when something doesnt he has run into one of lifes little problems that instead of floating free has roots problems come in two kinds 1 loose problems 2 problems that have roots some things that worry people dont have deep roots then there are fee subjects and items that are just little flags which turn out to be very deeply anchored indeed and which dont blow dont mistake the one for the other if you do you will get overrun or unflat processes r1cm is r1c with the meter follow the bd after you have completed your cycle of action it is mistake to take up something that has flag that goes all the way to china but gets needle reaction or ta bd only clean rise when it is mentioned although it is something that does bother the pc it may be an obvious condition like the pcs wife leaving him or his lumbosis but the more you talk about it the more trouble you have because as you force the pc into recognition of the reality of that condition you pin him to his most fundamental bank the condition will be something the auditor brought up it is an unreal subject to the pc the only cage that the pc can asis is the one that he is aware of you can force the pc into oddball modifications this is where testing deadends because you can read deeper into the psyche than the pc can asis lrh recounts papiermache incident the pcs head may be made of papiermache and this may be very obvious to the auditor but the auditor must not evaluate for the pc the pc cant asis anything that he isnt aware of and if he is not aware that his head is made out of papiermache and if it doesnt read on the meter dont try to handle it if you do you can restimulate the pc without any hope of destimulating him if it reads on the meter it has potential of being real to the pc the meter has the value of only reading on things that are real to the pc if it doesnt read it is unreal or it is well suppressed you can asis in pc what he has reality on this takes bit of cage away so he can see more and asis more you could do almost anything on pc if you audited him on what he could recognize things he had reality on that is the magical trick everybody has some level of reality on r and c so they can get something out of processes involving arc matter what level the pc is at stick to what is real to the pc 624 look around here and find something thats really real is probably one of the most nebulous commands ever given but the pc walks over and picks up that wire over there and he says that is very very very real i dont know what he means but it means he can recognize wire i dont know what he means i dont even know what he means when he says he can recognize it but it means to for the benefit of just the process itself that he can see it recognize it and direct his attention to it great thats all im asking i dont care what else he means what goes on in the pcs head when he answers that question wow who knows who cares the only time you would care is if the guy was being glib beware of the pc who runs glibly rattling off answers etc it is an automaticity of circuit answering for the person the pc may come up to awareness of somatics that he has had all along learn to look at pc from the viewpoint of what the pc can see the auditors ability to estimate what he has asised is part of his effectiveness in auditing youve got to know what youve already just taken care of and therefore you have to know how it is taken care of it is taken care of by being perceived and asised and thats the only way it is taken care of you ask the pc to look at something you know he can look at he looks at it and he asises it and thats the end product of all auditing it is all very well to have theories about what is wrong with the pc as long as you dont try to get the pc to asis your concept of what is wrong actually the division of the world into the destructive and the constructive is an artificial one at the top of the scale there is only the free since asisness is destruction paradoxically what at lower level is viewed as constructive asising is actually destructive and what at lower level is viewed as destructive force suppression is actually constructive in that notisness causes persistence auditing is simple because it evades the complexities of life by undermining them if auditing were solution to life it would have to be as complicated as life fortunately it isnt it is an asising of life l ron hubbard type 3 idate19564 volnum2 issue20 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec20 the pc and getting auditing to work 6405c19 shspec20 the pc and getting auditing to work any auditor who is having hard time making auditing work has mystery about how auditing can occur whether he knows it or not he has assigned some value to auditing that is different from and extraneous to the actual value of auditing he looks for something more complicated than what is there if student is having trouble third of the time it will resolve if you ask him why auditing doesnt work and remove that barrier to his understanding of why it does work the session will be unmanageable to the auditor if he has trouble with his comm cycle doesnt understand why auditing works and the pc introduces normal or extreme amounts of randomity into the session with his own outcommcycle as an instructor you have to get as much confusion out of this as possible person who cant get auditing to work is likely to have hidden standards you can ask why doesnt auditing work and why does auditing work and 2wc it person cant understand why it works because he understands why it doesnt work and he is caught in this discussing why auditing doesnt work is not quite auditing because 625 you are taking ta blowdowns on what he has told you and getting him to relate these blowdowns to the question of why auditing doesnt work you are steering him towards cognition that will straighten out his auditing another third of the time you can fix the erring auditor by getting him to discuss help you do rot get him to discuss failed help because you will run into the line plot he may spot some weird stable datum on help that impedes his ability to help or be helped take up whatever bds you get independently and clean them up so he will start using the comm cycle the comm cycle is almost too easy to use as long as the auditors intention towards the pc is good and he is trying to assist the pc the things that make person unable to use the comm cycle are those things that make person believe that he cannot or should not assist pcs who get ta action also have one of these buttons awry so this procedure works well on pcs too the third category is more esoteric it is very interesting it could be called life among the lowly this was the subtitle of uncle toms cabin people who are being hounded by life who are under duress tend to offer up supersympathy and grief at the same time that they are knocking someones head off there is mechanism here by which the lowly hold the lowly down which is pretty vicious it is the poor you mechanism how you he or they were wronged it is the victim syndrome you are victim this is the common denominator of sociology it is why someone can never get out of the slum it is how people get trapped we had this ourselves in the early days of dianetics lrh got away from it seeing that if you cant take responsibility for your own actions if you cant recognize the cause of your own difficulties then you are in trap and will continue in trap forevermore for any war against poverty to be effective it would have to contain an understanding of why people in groups remain poor an individual must accept his own responsibility and his own ability as cause before he can run off his overts you cant get off overts if you cant recognize yourself as cause you cant get out of rat race unless you recognize your overts you keep someone in rat race if you dont let him recognize his overts eg by saying poor you look how you have been wronged you are telling the person that he was incapable of cause you are directing his attention to moments when he was not at cause and pointing out to him that he doesnt cause things they just happen to him you put him into the dwindling spiral and hold him on the bottom of the heap forever by convincing him that he has been wronged and that he himself never wronged anybody you never had chance how does person become obsessed with problem obsessed with problem describes 90 of your pcs they are stuck in some problem via the om sequence they never recognize their own overt in the area so they get stuck in it there are several systems that can be used to unpin them chief among these is the ow system you cant get your hand cut off in buzzsaw without reaching for the buzzsaw and somehow putting yourself in the vicinity of the buzzsaw invented overts as in guilt complex that is just another alteris so watch out for this and be sure that the pc doesnt give you untruths all dwellingness on subject is associated with overts against that subject you cure it with one or another version of ow this is 626 something that is part and parcel of life which is senior in its power even to gpms you could be free of gpms and still be subject to the consequences of your overts so it is always safe and indicated to audit ow auditors do this industriously but not always well they can make complete mess of it chopping comm cycles buying trivia as overts having mutual outruds etc the reason tacit consent enters auditing when it does is because of the victim syndrome mentioned above it has entered the session to some degree when this happens there is some thread of poor you youve been wronged in the session if the auditor sits there and buys motivators he is not auditing the pc at cause he is auditing the pc at effect and so the pc will not get better nothing can hold onto thetan if he gets caught he must have grabbed hold and forgotten that he has grabbed hold to be trapped what he grabbed hold with is overts it is his own actual gpms that are holding him if you dont get him to spot his overts you are dramatizing life amongst the lowly the reason why people cannot get out of slums the victim syndrome slums operate on the basis of you cant do anything about it luck is all that can help how you have been wronged etc that is why you see numbers rackets and lucky charms in slums you cant do anything is the message of social welfare labor relations the war on poverty etc thetan basically doesnt want to commit overt acts when he does commit them he pulls himself back and withholds himself how does this affect the auditor who cant audit it is not as simple as they believe that they have been wronged so you have to get their overts off it is that this person has been so wronged that he has longer any concept of an overt the christian ran into this from another angle with the idea of repentance he wanted people to admit guilt which is an inversion people get off false overts in an effort to repent enough this doesnt free them the guilt complex leads to an inversion where the person isnt getting off actual overts but is really bragging about overts that he would never have the guts to commit dont let the pc do this check for untruths if guy is in victim valence you get him to define an overt act and then get him to tell you why it isnt an overt you will get an automaticity there is reality on it as an overt act so you have to follow the reality scale and find something possibly quite mild that he knows and feels is real overt act do this on discussion basis getting why it wasnt an overt act not as an auditing action once you get something the person really considers to have been an overt act you might run out his justifications for having done it see hcob 7ju164 scientology iii and iv justifications and hcob 8ju164 scientology iii and iv more justifications you then proceed on gradient

emeter 6406c09 shspec22 the cycle of action its interpretation on the emeter the most confused maligned area around is the auditor and the cycle of action it is difficult subject because it is all over the gpms it is not natural you scientologists being cut above the naturalness of normality of course see something slightly wrong in the whole idea of time and its forward progress in his auditing lrh found himself in an interesting state looking at zero or absence of time he found it not wholly pleasant because without time there is lot of other stuff missing he had pressure on the face that turned out to be not from something but from utter nothingness there this was very peculiar it was an escape from the timestream which at the same time was more natural than being in the timestream at one time thetan was quite capable of moving back in time to straighten out goofs then he slipped into the time stream and has been moving along with it ever since you therefore have natural antipathy for the idea that time is there or that something has beginning middle and an end because this cycle is an authoritative action laid down by time but you are processing in the physical universe through and across the agreement of the physical universe you are apparently going along with the timestream and processing bank that lays the timestream in with an axe you are trying to resolve subject the bank that is cycles of action to terrible degree mary baker eddy erred by shooting for too high gradient as long as you are processing through mest you must take account of the cycle of action even though it is not true at the highest levels unless you pay attention to this you jam the bank and the pc will get into horrible difficulties high ta etc the proper precise order of things is very important particularly at lower levels of things especially with regard to the bank the bank is fiendishly precise the pc has to come up through confusion to confront this much order one of the keynotes of order and the bank is that things have beginning continue and have an end there the cycle of action is violated in the pc the order of his bank is violated and therefore it doesnt asis so the road out follows the cycle of action where the auditor has nothing to do with the cycle of action he has trouble because he has thrown the pc below the fiendish demands of the bank we have found empirically that what you have to do is to parallel the cycle of action there is detriment involved in doing so every time you process pc without paying attention to the cycle of action you are processing the pc against the bank as result the bank will jam which will be manifested on the emeter as high ta and badlyacting needle pc who is not running well has first and foremost violated the cycle of action this is broad enough statement to be fairly meaningless unless you get more details you could also say that the reason case isnt living right is that the cycle of action is being violated there are two ways in which cycle of action can be violated in life 1 too slavish an obedience to it where the individual was out of agreement with it in the first place but is forced to follow it 2 ignoring it 628 all the blessings of the machine age lie in the first zone dont follow cycle of action to the extent of overwhelming someones power of choice oddly enough there is one zone where persons power of choice can be overthrown and he can be improved by following cycle of action repeatedly to point where the person is used to it you will then begin to asis enough bank to compensate for the loss of power of choice that you started with which will when return you could force pc through sop 8c against his power of choice but only so long as you repeated the cycle of action it isnt the persons power of choice that gives him reactivity power of choice and selfdeterminism get imprisoned in reactivity cycle of action is the prison so following and running and running out cycle of action will bring about nothing but freeing of power of choice whether the pc consents to it or not you have the determinism of the thetan his power of choice versus the fiendish cycle of action and precision of the bank and this universe the biggest overwhelm and loss of power of choice in this universe is in time this universe is trap because having started here you inevitably get to there that is an overwhelm because there is nothing that you can do about it the thetan knows that wherever he may be in space at 855 in ten minutes he will be at 905 matter how much he protests you can do something about being moved in space so space is less overwhelming hence movement in space from point to point b is smaller gradient you can approximate the action of time with the cycle of action progress through time is paralleled by the cycle of action it is very close to process you might call make some time this is very funny process you can start the pc at point and move him to point b and have him run into confusion between distance and time he has the illusion of moving through time in doing this drill one differentiates space from time and thus obtains new level of observation and freedom this improves the individuals power of choice at least to the degree that he has increased freedom to observe as person gets out of overwhelm relative to something he can perceive what is happening to it instead of what it is doing to him ow in its essence has never been understood ow is not lesson in morality it is lesson in causality it is really lesson in what power of choice have you exercised in life however it is hard to get someone to admit that he has done something wrong because society tries to get him to restrain admission of overts which is big overwhelm justifications refute the cause of the individual to justify is to state that one had power of choice and therefore not being responsible committed overt in running justifications you are getting the pc to own up to having been cause when you go for overts you are going up against the social mores as the point of overwhelm you just choose this as the point of overwhelm society tries to get the individual to withhold overts in an effort to suppress him in lower level processing youre choosing society as the point of overwhelm of the pc and you are running ow you want the individuals revolts against this overwhelm as an expression of his power of choice some point of agreement with society can be found in the course of running ow that will undo attention from society the mechanism is 1 one does things 2 one cant own up to them 3 one then gets caved in on because of this 629 you could ask what third dynamic activity have you gone along with weirdly enough this would eventually lead into overt acts the individual gets free to the degree that he can step back and look at the situation when we apply this sort of process to the sixth dynamic we get much more subtle level one that is much less easily perceived freedom from the timestream freedom from the cycle of action time and the cycle of action are so woven into the pc regradless of what level he is at that even your address to the third dynamic junior though it is to the sixth dynamic is involved with the sixth dynamic the pc is shooting someone across space standing on matter in an action across time there is sixth dynamic agreement that is overwhelming this is going on matter what the pc is doing so in processing person if you violate that to an enormous degree by outcyclesofaction the person wont know what it is that is being violated but his tolerance of that violation is terrible there are quits few cycles of action that you could violate one is the auditing comm cycle that is the first one that shows up on meter even on lowlevel pc the dirty needle you get expresses the jamup of energy in the pcs bank because of the violation of that cycle of action there is disagreement with the reactive bank when the cycle of action is violated the meter measures energy manifestations taking place in the pcs bank if the pc has one erg of attention or awareness and you are asking him to confront 8000 gallons of reality he wont be able to do it for instance if you take nonscientologist and tell him that he is the source of all his problems he cant confront it on the other hand if guy has tons of awareness or attention available and you ask him to confront one pint of reality he is going to view it as pretty unimportant just look at the horrible conflict between russia and the us yes well what about it so what when the individuals attention level and the reality to be perceived are more or less balanced cognitions occur you could violate some things which wouldnt be expressed on the meter because they would be above the pcs reality but violating the comm cycle will be real to the pc another cycle of action that you could violate is process cycle of action this one is expressed not on the needle but on the ta so 1 the auditing comm cycle is expressed on the needle 2 process cycle of action is expressed on the tone arm if you get ta motion on something you have found an overwhelm that the pc can potentially get on top of providing that you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm but complete the process cycle if you get ta going on some subject or area and keep on the subject until there is more ta action you have done completed cycle of action on the subject at that point the pc will longer be overwhelmed by the subject if the subject is real to him at all it will register on the ta at least slightly and the pc will be able to overcome the overwhelm that he has experienced in that area he will process to wins as long as you dont leave him in state of halfoverwhelm on the subject by failing to complete the cycle of action he will object to not being brought through it and the meter will react by freezing up it wont freeze up immediately but it will freeze up as you continue to leave unflat processes behind 630 you can go on past the point where ta action has ceased people dont usually err in this direction more often they take an hour to get the subject in full view and the ta well started and then they quit this goes against both the pcs selfdeterminism and the cycle of action of the bank which is what locks up the ta the trick is to find the point at which ta action ceases if the pc is stuck you can go back through his folder and complete the old cycles of action that were incomplete when you do this the bank will unjam dont ask yourself what will produce ta action on this pc that is an easy question what you should be asking is what has produced ta action process in the direction of arc let the pc tell you about his problems long enough to find something that moves the ta and then get into that with an inarc process or something about solutions always flatten what has moved the ta matter how long ago it happened flatten what you get ta motion on this cycle of action is the only zone or area where you can overwhelm the pcs power of choice legitimately dont evaluate for him but finish your cycles of action you can be smooth and slippy about it direct the pcs attention back into the area and run the process to flat point find out what is real to the pc before you start by getting him to itsa on anything and watching for ta eg on the white form if you are having trouble getting ta on new pc and you cant find any unflat processes from his earlier auditing you still want to know what has given ta action if it wasnt an earlier process or something in life suspect immediately that the pc was involved in some other practice analogous to scientology that did get ta but was left unflat now crank up the sensitivity to 128 and ask what other mental practice have you been in and watch the needle like hawk be specific ask all kinds of things and sort out what cycle was incomplete there flatten the earlier practice when you find it get the ta off of it all you have to do if you dont get ta action on the pc is find out what gave him ta action that wasnt completed if he is an old pc suspect not an earlier practice but objectivetype processes when looking over auditing for unflat processes you may find lot of them and have to choose which one to start with in this case you have to be careful especially if you are advising someone else what to audit case supervising where you have less control and ease of observation on the things you check you want to be more certain and take fewer risks under these circumstances and one thing that you can be certain of is that any objective process that gave ta will give ta if it is unflat the objective process is the one thats most likely to have stuck the guy because its right here in the physical universe and its closest to the sixth dynamic subjective processes are the least likely to have hungup ta the pc could have cognited later on subjective process in the course of running something else in advising auditors case supervising give advice that is very downthemiddle and certain and if the auditor tells you that it didnt work find out in what way he failed to take your advice 631 meter manifestations at level vi are different from the level iv ones you are used to ta action taking some time to occur or run out below level li but two to three sessions worth of ta at levels 0iv occurs in ten to fifteen seconds at level vi and thats all the ta action there is to be had you dont even see all the ta action that occurs some of it doesnt go through the meter the ta action flattens fast at higher levels dont overrun the guy you will drag in ta from somewhere else if you do if you let the pc go on and on you will get ta action from the next item or bank which violates the cycle of action all the bank objects to at level vi is overrun the cycle of action being extended beyond its end if you overflatten ta action you get an exaggeration of the dirty needle that looks like small rock slam sharpedged dirty needle tocky needle the dirty needle expresses ta action prevented from being completed the tocky needle results from taking more charge off an item then is really there it expresses the fact that the ta action is all completed if you continue you can finally drive it to stuck needle and stuck ta when you ask am i invalidating correct lineup the needle smooths out if you are dealing with the thing that enforces cycle of action on the pc and on life it objects to cycle being overrun it resists created cycle of action that isnt really there if an item has been left charged new item wont read properly until you clean it up suppose you havent left anything charged but the new item is suppressed or something in this case when you look for an earlier charged item the needle will go tocky all the bank objects to at level vi is the cycle of action being extended beyond its proper end the bank raises hell when you create cycle of action that wasnt there the needle will show you that this is happening by getting tocky and you can indicate the overrun and continue to the next cycle l ron hubbard type 3 idate16664 volnum2 issue23 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec23 communication overts and responsibility 6406c16 shspec23 communication overts and responsibility people who have been in processing for some time can forget the degree to which other people are wrapped up in and in contest with their environments this is the direct key to the case your first job as an auditor is to find out what the pcs environment is you should also be able to recognize that pcs can get down to the level of where their only concern is to handle some problem in their environment this pc is not going to ot just to sigh of relief contest is not necessarily fisticuffs it is just that there are different ways of reacting to the environment at lower levels anything the pc is doing is an effort to handle the environment this effort could even amount to catatonia or complete immobility the method is not necessarily smart but down to the lowest rung the person is still in contest with his environment and trying to handle it thetan never gives up the methods he uses are solutions their frailty is so great that you can unsettle them quite easily the more irrational the solution the more easily it is unstabilized it is amazing that this fact hasnt been realized much sooner by earlier practitioners an irrational solution has more points to it therefore it is harder to maintain madman works at staying mad the only requisite to unstabilizing this solution is communication there has to be contact to do it probable reason why 632 earlier practitioners didnt see how easy it was to unsettle the irrational solution was that the first step getting into communication was so difficult person could have so much trouble with this point that he forgets that if he could communicate would be simple to unsettle the aberrated solution psychotherapy parks on the subject of communication therapists get so frantic that their efforts to achieve communication get more and more frantic and brutal culminating eventually in electric shock and prefrontal lobotomies part of the trouble is that the psychotherapists think that they can reach the patient by doing something to his brain gestalt and touchiefeelie therapies satisfy this same need of the therapists to reach the patient in less destructive but equally ineffective way to do anything for person you must be in communication with that person you must be reaching him and receiving comm from him dont assume however that communication solves all communication is necessary but not sufficient condition for helping someone in the lower levels where scientology breaks down it is in the area of effort to communicate to the being that is why the auditor gets weird notions about what he should do to and for the person that is where every psychotherapy breaks down and it is true for scientology too you have to keep acknowledging the pc and giving the next auditing command that is what you have trouble getting across to lowerclassed auditors and that is why you work on keeping the comm cycle in you are working along communication channel in order to accomplish result with the pc so you must keep the channel in good repair what makes level in scientology is gradient scale of what communication can be entered in upon with the pc for instance at level 0 pc cant yet be talked to once you are reaching the pc and he is responding to you you can take up the goofiest solutions he has for his environment you are trying to alleviate his contest with his environment the fact that he is in contest with his environment barriers communication from his environment person solves his environment by withholding from it he will eventually solve the fact that he is being communicated to from his environment during auditing by moving you out of his environment the pc is having trouble with his environment he is not having trouble with you therefore you cant be part of his environment you are thus longer part of his normal environment hence he will talk to you even if to one else he says there are human beings and i dont want anything to do with them and then there are auditors they are different so the auditor takes on holy proportions this seems to be the real explanation of transference similarly attacks on scientology make scientology supernatural to justify their overts on us scientologists cant be considered normal people or the overts would not be justified the melbourne inquiry goes along this way the organization has taken on supernatural aura if you can reach and talk to people when others cant you will immediately assume some special status with the pc who is aware of this dont bother to deal with this issue with the pc unlike psychoanalysis which dwells on the transference once you have your communication line in use it to handle whatever contests the pc has going with the environment you can use whatever you know of the communication formula to get some communication established then gradiently improve it and move into other processes 633 just getting into comm with the pc is likely to give him some benefits but dont stop with that communication isnt the endall it is merely the channel now you are set up to do something for the case scientology is the only discipline that can uniformly 1 accomplish comm line 2 use it to increase communication and then 3 do something for the individual dont stop when you establish communication even though the mere establishment of comm line is beneficial the pc will look better around you because he is in arc with you so dont forget that he may still be batty around others if you dont do something for the pc you may find that while he is calm and sane in your vicinity he is just as nutty in his environment as ever you may feel that you have cured his battiness when it is only resolved around you so you dont believe him when he talks about how bad life is dont make the mistake of saying ive cured him because i can now talk to him all you have done is to set him up to now do something for him communication is the beginning not the end now after establishing communication you must find out what in his environment is dangerous and menacing and what means he is using to combat these elements you shouldnt use problems and solutions too long beyond the opening part of the case or you will restimulate the problems and solutions in his gpms problems and solutions isnt the basis of his activities with his environment at all it is what the pc does to solve his environment that keeps him obsessed and pinnedin against the hostile elements in his environment how do you know that you havent handled the pcs ptp he is going to do something about it so it is not handled that is the biggest index you have so you want to find what the individual is continuously doing in his environment this falls under the heading of ow not problems because the more he does about the problem he is stuck in the more he will be obsessed by it and the more he will be stuck what brings about an undue concentration on subject and conviction that person has tremendous conflict with his environment it is because he doing something about it all the time for instance person who is hung up on the must be doing something to or about the this lifetime persons way of fighting some part of the environment can take innumerable forms he feels that he had better not communicate with the environment because he is going to commit overts he is mucking up his communication with the environment therefore because his communication with the environment is series of overts so therefore he has to not communicate with the environment because it is an overt against the environment so he had better have some kind of wild solution so he wont have to communicate with his environment in summary 1 an individual keeps doing things to solve his environment this doingness amounts to continuous series of overts 2 so the individual considers that his communicating with the environment is an overt 3 therefore he has to stop communicating with the environment 4 so he develops wild solutions so that he wont have to communicate with the environment like not looking 634 this is not at the communication level it is just riding on the comm line the individual has put up screen against tigers so he cant see the tigers he just knows that he has to fight in that direction this may take different forms eg never looking in that direction someone who doesnt look at something has something there that he is doing something to or about he does lowlevel overts because he is afraid that he will do highlevel overts the bank is manufactured in such way that 1 the individual is forced to commit overts 2 he gets in trouble after committing those overts people are kept insane because the bank enforces commitment of overts and insures insanity if the individual does commit overts even if the individual didnt have bank he would get into trouble by committing overts because committing overts violates the communication formula this is above the bank there are two mechanisms above the bank 1 the communication formula cf axiom 51 2 ow that puts the auditor in the driver seat early on because he has two things that are superior to all the aberration that the pc can muster ow is one of the frail spots of auditors you would expect the perpetuators of any trap to talk lot about invasion of privacy and how people should keep their withholds so they seize emeters the most craziness is at the door to sanity auditors reticence in pulling withholds is based on fear of breaking down the communication channel they preserve communication so well that they never do anything with it an auditor can pussyfoot on getting overts from pc because he wants to preserve the comm line but he hasnt done anything with it the fact is that if the pc is pinned into something he must have originated something that got him connected to the thing then once he is pinned to it he gets into an obsessive do to straighten it all out this gives him more worries when person is pinned he thinks that he can unpin himself by more doing actually he can unpin himself by stopping obsessive doing anyone can get caught in this mechanism since it is the basic mechanism of entrapment what the individual originally did may not have been intentional but he starts having to do more and more to handle it sometimes the doingness in resisting thing is to blow having failed to handle it so if the person cant leave physically he may for instance get groggy or show people that he shouldnt be allowed to stay around there are innumerable ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically all the way down the neuroticpsychotic spiral for instance if one cannot leave marriage physically one may leave nonphysically complication stems from the number of ways in which thetan can leave without leaving physically for instance thetan can make others sorry they didnt let him leave he can appear nasty where he was happy before psychotherapy could be called study of ways of leaving without leaving physically so the sequence is 1 an individual commits overts asserted thereness 2 he commits more overts to get out of previous overts v 3 he invents solutions to not leaving asserted notthereness 635 all this occurs on comm channels being on comm line it is resolved by communication ow regretted reach or action and the communication formula are senior to the bank the bank boobytraps this the word withhold is in the bank so you shouldnt use it it is too restimulative and gives false ta ie ta unrelated to discharge by virtue of just moving banks around in running withholds therefore substitute for withhold what the pc didnt say use what havent you said one of the principal factors that you bat your head against in case is the inability of case to admit any action or take any responsibility for action if case can take responsibility for any action ever committed that case has had it thats any act not just an overt act lost soul thats being shredded between the worlds with soundless wail is the person who can take responsibility for any action he has ever done that is where case ceases to be in range of any assistance the case must be able to take some responsibility for some action in order to be salvageable this makes those things that you cant talk to pretty irresponsible doesnt it well they are i can imagine conversation if you could achieve one with spider the utter irresponsibility of any action ever undertaken by the spider would be amazing inability to communicate is an index of irresponsibility as the ability to communicate drops out responsibility for action as factor falls and vice versa they rise and fall together stutterer has some deteriorated area of communication and therefore deteriorated area of responsibility madman is as mad as you cant get into communication with him the biggest problem with the madman is how you can get in comm with him what gradient of comm to use and how you put it to him that you want to find out what part of his environment he can be responsible for you could get in comm with him one way or another he would eventually differentiate you from the rest of the environment then you would have to find out where guy is stuck and what he is stuck in then find what responsibility can he take for his own actions in that zone or area expand that perimeter and you would return his sanity all you are interested in at lower levels is responsibility for own actions or responsibility for lack of actions the real difficulty is the getting into comm and really finding what he would take responsibility for an undercut would be to get done by reason of placement where have you been that you know you have been even though communication is in the bank the formulas of communication are superior to the reactive bank responsibility is also superior to the bank it is the woof and warp of being thetan the questions are can you decide to do something and do it can you be somewhere at will can you be in or out of something on your own determinism the overtmotivator sequence is not an ultimate truth but it goes out as consideration higher than any other consideration it is still truth after other things have become lies before it becomes lie it gives you all levels of processing and cases from level iv on down if youve got those two factors communication and responsibility youve got all lower levels of processing 636 there is real reason for you to be in the dark about why you are not making progress with case whatever other factors are present these factors are more present there is one thing that gets in your road someone can have gpm keyed in to such degree that it is driving him round the bend at lower levels you had better leave it alone lrh has tried reading pc list of words that might be causing the condition if one read lrh told the pc that that word was an integral part of the reactive bank that was influencing him and the pc ceased to be obsessively worried this is bit dangerous though if person is glibly telling you what he has done in an area it may be that he is not really taking responsibility for that the rebuttal in this case is to get the pc to explain at length how he has not really done this thing eventually it begins to dawn on him how he did have something to do with it this is an indirect approach to lowerlevel case you cant run it too long because it is an outofarc process at little higher level you could run what reasons did you have for doing that as long as you dont let him get into inventing them l ron hubbard type 3 idate18664 volnum2 issue24 rev0

learn anything he will never know how to audit this is very fundamental but all great successes are built on fundamentals better than fifty percent of scientology consists of the discipline technology and knowhow of application you could give the commands of scientology processes to another group of mental technicians and they would get results failure to duplicate failure to understand failure to apply lrh and reg dreamed up course having to do with business and commerce with scientology applied to them reg executed the course and it has been very successful it is goodwill gesture the only trouble is that everybody tried to get into the act teaching their own courses to the same end reg wasnt worried about others duplicating the course people are aware even with perfect duplicate course that they are not taking the real course in salesmanship even on the copyist this enters enough in the way of an overt or something like this so that he then goes into an obsessive alteris and then it is true that they cant duplicate it professors in universities cause the loss of technology by writing their own books on their subjects instead of teaching the real source material which they alteris there were thirteen heavierthanair methods of flight the fixedwing configuration wasnt necessarily the best though it was one of the easier ones to manufacture the fixedwing system won out the other twelve have lost even though some were more efficient than the one that was easy to do in civilizations it is customary for body of knowledge to come into existence then for some part of it to be duplicated and developed and other parts of the tech to get lost civilizations die out because they lose their technology apart from one gimmick that has nothing to back it up 637 technology gets lost because people cant study civilizations tend to rise to peak then under stress of combat or whatever they lose their technology because one studies it for instance the technology of the british silversmiths got lost when the labor government taxed silver out of existence one problem with study is the amount of false knowledge around if person studied without any judgement of what he was studying or any evaluation of it he would study very poorly study has to do with one thing basically willingness to know in order to study one must first be willing to know without willingness to know you can get systems that add up to knowledge in scientology we have one thing that is not easy to put into texts the discipline of how you do it it is easy to transmit by example and is at least fifty percent of what we are doing this is frailty for the future success of what we are doing it is the most likely thing to get lost what needs to be learned is not the commands of processes it is how to apply them in scientology one is learning the doingness not the processes the processes wont work in the absence of the doingness trs comm cycle metering etc lrh decided to learn about study by doing course in photography he had done the course up to the third lesson already and wondered why he stopped there and why he occasionally bogged down eg in the parts about optics and chemistry he realized that he didnt know anything about photography despite having done it since age twelve he realized that he had entered the course in tolerant state of mind willing to learn few gimmicks and he realized that this attitude was incredibly arrogant he had always thought that the trouble he had had with photography was that they kept changing the methods he realized that the basics and fundamentals in the subject which he didnt know had been present in the subject since 1860 at that point knowing that there was something to learn he really started to study from three books in 3 12 years he sped up to eight books in two weeks arrogance and tolerance the attitude that i know all about it but im willing to learn few tricks prevents person from studying lrhs standards of criticism have shifted what he was willing to take pictures of changed utterly he mastered fundamentals and reached position of judgment and opinion on it previously he had had judgment only fixed ideas there is big difference between an opinion and fixed idea or prejudice one has fixed opinions when one lacks understanding of an area in the absence of knowledge judgment becomes fixed ideas lrhs former ideas on photography had not been resulting in finished picture also before this realization he was the victim of external conditions if there was sun he could not take picture after this realization knowing your tools and darkroom tech you are not monitored by conditions around you the breakthrough was there really is something there to learn this is prime condition necessary for study so the first barrier to learning is the consideration that you know all about it and you wont let your certainty that you know be affected by the fact that you are not getting result judgment depends in freedom from fixed opinions and on need to protect yourself from your lack of knowledge in some area judgment is impossible in the presence of fixed opinions to judge one must know what one knows and what one does not know judgment depends on knowledge it is not what person knows it is what he can do 638 an auditors ability to learn then depends first on his willingness to learn i know all there is to know and i get results shows lack of judgment on ones own skill it is silly statement status has lot to do with this one considers he must appear wise or clever or whatever and pretends knowingness to give this appearance but in the presence of genuine knowledge real esteem takes the place of false selfgenerated esteem it comes down to test of what person can do there is argument with competence psychiatry serves as wonderful example of this to be good critic of some area you would have to know what could and what couldnt be done in that area person who already knows something about an area can learn more about it without feeling challenged threatened or insulted by the suggestion that he learn it unlike someone who doesnt know all about it but wants to think that he does the only place our technology might break down is from unwillingness to learn it stemming from the belief that one already knows it all this is one of those stupid fundamentals that stays in because nobody bothers to asis it there is always first lesson to teach basic entry point to learning subject on the subject of study itself this datum is fundamental where you fail in instruction you always omitted the first datum to teach l ron hubbard type 3 idate30664 volnum2 issue25 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec25 cause level ot and the public 6406c30 shspec25 cause level ot and the public

confused that person doesnt even know which direction to go to get it youve got level and 99 of the human beings on the planet 639 they are following the pied piper of science the blind alley of science is that man is intelligent meat machine this leaves out the being himself according to this view man is thinking brain nothing more there are two kinds of sciences 1 classification or naming things 2 extrapolative science that derives answers modern science is just classification science eg biology is nothing but classification it doesnt let you learn anything to modern science the science of man is just another classification science when they dont know anything they name everything if you dont know the right name for the nonexistent parts of the brain then you know nothing about the mind they go on the basis that man never creates they try to understand the mind on the basis of the law of conservation of energy ie that nothing is ever created or destroyed from that viewpoint man doesnt make any sense something would have to be done to him before he could do anything to anybody else this isnt true so neither is stimulusresponse theory since man isnt really understandable on the basis of his never creating the stimulusresponse mechanism is likewise untrue after making wrong assumptions about the mind modern science cant understand it so they sweep it aside as an incomprehensible subject the humanities so we just classify and appoint authorities is it and say that it is an unworkable field then the scientologist comes along and says heresy man is not machine hes thetan being weve taken that as our basic assumption because we can demonstrate it this violates the idea that the scientist has that nothing is ever created or destroyed the fact is however that man mocks up his own mind this disagrees with the law of conservation of energy when you say mind the scientist receives brain when you say that you can run out troublesome part of the mind he thinks that it would be easier to cut out part of the brain he has already accepted two falsehoods 1 man is machine 2 man never creates anything you can prove the scientist wrong by getting result on preclear that is difference between us and the humanities form is more important to the nonscientologist than the result they have end results so theyve begun to believe there are end results in the field of the mind you say an end result can occur in the field of the mind you have to follow very exact discipline to get this end result and they dont believe that the end result is more important to us than how you arrive at it they lost interest in end results because they couldnt produce any they couldnt produce any end results because they couldnt accept these basic premises 1 man is being independent of his body 2 he is capable of creating his private universe including his mind complete with mass and spaces we cure leukemia case and the doctors say they couldnt have it must have been misdiagnosed in the first place you ask why couldnt he have had leukemia and the answer is he couldnt have had it because it is incurable ie leukemia is incurable by definition they are trying to protect authority in an unworkable rationale that they themselves down deep know has failed their question is how long can we put up the big bluff all analysts know that they arent getting results 640 to get workable results one must accept two things 1 being is an independent thing that can exist independent of body 2 being is capable of autocreation all by his lonesome by doing this he builds mind persons own universe or his bank is not stuck in his skull but is plastered all over the physical universe the scientific premises about the origin of man require at least as much assumption as our premises about mans nature the life springing from an electrified sea of ammonia bit is at least as bizarre as the virgin mary story science starts assuming that man is an inflow mechanism the reverse is actually true the former assumption wont cure anyone the latter assumption will always if you want to help man dont get him to inflow get him to outflow that is why scientists cannot make man well or solve the problems of the mind man is actually an outflow mechanism you solve his problems on the basis of outflow if you want to prove this watch what happens if you run someone on an inflow eg think of motivator this will give you high stuck ta and pc who feels worse and worse sicker and sicker fuzzy and foggy etc actually mans basic action is outflowing and his basic error was an outflow he is restraining himself from outflow because of his experience of causing bad outflows he learned not to outflow so he decided to inflow only then he thought he could only inflow then he caved in we get an end result by operating on this assumption we rehab the ability to outflow and win however society and religion train people to operate on this reverse basis we are really in the line of religion rather than science if science means conservation of energy science has only recently ie in the past hundred years presumed to have anything to do with the field of the mind in spaceopera of course science took over the mind but without comprehension so you got oddball damaging actions however spaceopera science was capable of more damage than modern science our assumptions about the nature of man are violently opposed to the assumptions of science that is the first ladder that you have to jump with people they have to get past the current belief that if you stuff something in the body something beneficial will occur this is something that has confronted us in the past few weeks wi h violence practically one comes to st hill who is low on causativeness since it takes outflow and causativeness to get here out in central organizations or in the world at large you run into more noncommunication than is comfortable if you flee the nonscientology world after standing it for just so long its the level of causation that gets on your nerves it isnt that they dont talk your language its their noncommunication its the fact that they dont seem to connect with anything people have to be gotten up to recognition of the world around them total introversion has to be changed to slight extroversion before there is any way that they can asis items guy cant go ot until he has been gotten out of his total introversion the grades enable the individual to break through to the environment they get person reaching causative to degree extroverted and able to asis person has to be able to cause slightly at least before he can asis something when person cant asis the bank he is the effect of it small percentage of the level iv coauditors were type b when they started they werent 641 really low on cause but only when they were spoton on the exact item with all ruds in could they asis it these were people who had had fair amount of auditing if you put green pc into gpm even spoton he would do nothing to the gpm the gpm would make him sick you can take type pc who can usually asis anything and if he is underfed run down or underslept so that his body is soaking up energy he will run poorly with packedup meter if someone cant asis his personal problems he wont be able to asis gpm this barriered lovely idea that lrh had which only works on him if he finds himself thinking too hard about something he can always skip down through the endwords and pick out the one that has gotten into restimulation and let it blow down this is bit heroic he thought that you could just take someone at level iv and assess the end words but you cant the meter packs up almost at once when person cannot asis his bank because his cause level is too low he will be the effect of his bank and he will get disappearance of that is worrying him so whatever process you use your whole task is to put the pc more at cause you run ow to raise someones cause level since ow is big barrier to his cause level in that he has done something he regrets and furthermore isnt communicating about it you run ow to raise his certainty of having done not just to asis regretted doingness you will find that it is probably that few of your pcs have been answering the auditing question since while you are looking for something they have done they are looking for an explanation of what happened to them some pcs go plunging madly into the bank searching madly for some answer that explains it all such pcs invent things or give things that they are not sure of in an effort to find the right answer a11 you have to do is be sure the pc is certain that he did the thing without alterises in other words you want an asising of doneness all you want is the answer to your question what have you done not what have you done that is bad antisocial etc i ate breakfast and that is probably why is not an answer to the auditing question as auditor all you have to do is police and make sure the person is certain he did do that it isnt the quality of the deed its just whether or not he has done it just make sure the pc is sure that he did that otherwise ow will not work so you build up the persons idea of what he can cause and what he can reach until he can reach the lowest rung of the upper ladder you can convert sop 8c and run it in such way that the pc is sure of doing it distance has to do with reach so on sop 8c you get wider perimeter of what person can reach then on subjective processing you get gradient of what the pc can asis in his mind the object of all lower level processing up to level vi is to raise the cause level of the individual dont expect recognition or appreciation from society around you when they dont even recognize themselves as existing we dont really have opponents except ourselves if we neglect the lower ladder that people need to climb before getting on the ladder to ot ow is the only thing that will key out gpm without the pcs having to pay attention to the gpm this is because ow is senior to the bank and can therefore make keyout clear then you can erase the bank to asis person must have done something promote the idea of raising cause level not so much the idea of going ot people could understand that 642 l ron hubbard type 3 idate2764 volnum2 issue26 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec26 ow modernized and revised 6407c02 shspec26 ow modernized and revised there are two stages to auditing 1 get into comm 2 do something for the pc it is notorious that few scientologists will inquire deeply into exactly what someone did this is because in order to do something for someone one must have comm line which is supported or made possible by reality and affinity and where person is too demanding the affinity tends to break down so the auditor doesnt want to break the affinity line hence he never gets into the second stage of processing the one after comm line has been established in which the auditor does something for the pc the pc may feel miraculously better just from having comm line established but the two stages are like walking up to the bus and driving off if you dont drive off you never arrive anywhere any upset the pc has is actually so delicately balanced that once you have gotten in communication with the pc it is easy to do something about the upset batty ideas and doingnesses are particularly easy to get rid of since they are based on very slippery logic you could have the guys case fall apart before your eyes just from your asking what are you doing that is sensible and why is it sensible once your comm line and auditing discipline are perfect so you dont disturb the comm line you can forage around amongst his aberrations to great effect comm line is only valuable to the extent that you can use it to move around in the morass which he calls his ideas if you used the process given above aberration would fall to pieces use perfect discipline to keep in the comm line audit well get your comm cycle in let your cycles of action be completed then you can do something for the pc the discipline of auditing is what makes it possible for you to do something for the pc unlike other therapies that is all it is for in fact this gets you up to the door now you have to go through it the magic of auditing and the difficult part is to get in comm with the pc once you have done that doing something for the pc is very easy since his aberrations are so delicately balanced if you are not in comm with the pc he presents himself as accused by you he justifies himself pc who is in comm with the auditor wont be trying to justify himself and uphold his status you can go out of comm with pc by not doing anything for him you lose the rfactor with the person and you go out of comm process is simply combination of mental mechanisms which when inspected will pass away all auditing is subtractive it consists of asising things on the case you can overaudit by trying to get more ta action from process when you have gotten it all you can underaudit by leaving off before getting all the ta action out it takes only observation of the pc when you have done something for the pc you will have gotten the ta action off the process if you have done something for the pc ta action will cease and it wont stop until then dont do something for the pc after you have already done something for him on particular process or in particular area if you go on in the area you will only restimulate something else in the pc if you are clever you will run process that cyclically runs out of ta and end it there at the end of cycle in r6 you develop 643 sensitivity for when an item is dead and you will leave it if you ask for it one more time you are dead you will get tocky needle and an arc breaky pc at lower levels you can get one thing run out acknowledge it very well and go on using the same process in way which makes it whole new minor cycle within your major process cycle auditors who cant do this have to run lots of different processes but they could get much more out of one process if they got slick at directing attention you dont necessarily change the process when the pc has cognited if it is general process that can apply to lots of areas get the cognition out of one area then find another area you dont have to change the process you can just change the subject of the process if you use this approach you have to ask yourself all along have i done something for the pc if you notice that the pcs answers are dodgy recognize that your comm line isnt established some processes such as what could you say to mewhat would you rather not say to do two things at once both getting into comm and doing something for the pc eg by getting off withholds all this is prelude to ow because ow is the greatest comm line wrecker that an auditor has to deal with withhold running is peculiar in that it can put in comm line but it is avoided for fear of breaking down comm line it can get confusing when the same process that puts in the comm line to the pc also does something for the pc this tends to cause confusion in which the difference between putting in comm line and doing something for the pc gets lost ow is senior to the bank that doesnt mean that when the bank is gone you will still have ow it means that ow keys out the bank handled rightly it puts in the comm line but if the auditor permits the pc to sit there with withholds in the session instead of protecting his comm line as is his intention he ends up destroying the comm line by missing the withhold and letting the pc arc break another thing that makes ow dicey is that the word withhold occurs in the bank furthermore withhold is an outofarc process and cannot be run by itself done fortunately does not appear in the bank so you can run donenot done however the common denominator of the bank is done done is high order of lock on all forms of reactivity done to is another part of the bank unless the auditor uses specific name with it that is not in the bank see p 595 above re use of nouns in processes ptp can be created by failure to complete comm cycle method of handling ptps would be to ask the pc at start of session are there any communications you have left incomplete the pc would then rattle off several and not register further on ptps the reason why he hasnt completed the communication is because of the overts he has against what he has the ptp with you never have ptp with something that you dont have an overt on so first ptp is based on or connected to an incomplete comm cycle then to done this follows the pattern of what to do in auditing see p 642 above that is the way the bank stacks up even psychosomatic illness is based on an incomplete communication in extremis you can handle psychosomatic illness as ptp you can handle it nonadventurously with what communication to or about the illness havent you delivered or you can ask what comm havent you completed to the blumjum the more adventurous 644 cycle is the done and notice that you have just got the same cycle as that of auditor to pc establish comm then do something the severity of the illness has nothing to do with the speed of release of it or the difficulty of handling it the what communication hasnt been completed is easy it requires nothing of your auditing discipline but it is the lickandapromise the done takes more skill knowledge and perseverance the session patter could go like this auditor ptp pc yes auditor any comm you havent completed pc blah blah if the ptp is then gone then there is need to continue if the ptp is not gone then get off the pcs overts there are seventeen ways to get off series of overts there are overts in chains recurring withholds recurring overts basicbasic of something etc etc you have to ask the proper questions to get the overts suppose the pc keeps giving you the same often minor overt it is part of chain you need to ask the right question and audit by chain you must also be prepared to find overt at the bottom of the chain but man is basically good despite his reactive bank the bank is only composed to make man commit overts which is against his better nature the bank is the perfect trap because having committed the overts the individual wont go on communicating you do not want to talk to people that you have wronged you withhold to prevent further overts that is the fundamental think of man before he goes so far downscale that he dramatizes obsessively what have you done has two branches 1 what have you done that is socially reprehensible and prevents you from communicating with others 2 just having done something both are valid but watch out for the pc using the process to look for an explanation of what has happened to him this pc will give suppositional answers which you dont want he will invent things he hasnt done to get rid of the consequences that he is experiencing he is trying to find good enough overt to explain what is occurring in his life he will often go far backtrack to find it steer this pc back to where he belongs all you want is what he is absolutely certain that he has done so you have to make sure that he is certain he did the thing if the auditor is asking and the pc is doing b the communication factor is out so the auditor wont do something for the pc you might ask what are you quite positive that you have done ow is likely to be the biggest area of recovery for the pc provided the auditor isnt too tender and will steer the pc you have to observe when the pc thinks that it wasnt an overt if the guy gives you something he did as an overt but obviously doesnt feel that it was an overt then you must ask why wasnt this an overt and get itsa then you might ask was this really an overt after all at this point you might get the glee of insanity then you might get long worry about this with ta action eventually he will realize that it was an overt meanwhile you are raising the cause level of the pc you could go into done in numerous other categories however you may fail in trying to direct somebody in these fields 645 l ron hubbard type 3 idate7764 volnum2 issue27 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec27 dissemination 6407c07 shspec27 dissemination lrh took

signed things rene lafayette ken martin kurt von rocken winchester remington colt etc there is easy way to do anything there are some ways that are not as hard as others being pro in any field takes work of one sort or another physical or otherwise you have to invest some of yourself in it you have to know how you are going to use the data you had better know all there is to know about your subject if you hope to be able to solve technical problem that may or may not have been covered in what you have been studying you may find that the problem is actually very simple even though you know that what you are studying is inapplicable to what you are going to be doing go ahead and learn it well if it is part of formal course finish studying it if you are in training because you are liable to find out that its principles do apply after all when you get round the corner after you have completed the study make your adaptions put some of yourself in it ask yourself how will i use this stuff how will it apply to study does you good whatever unless you go through this process students in many fields engineering courses economics etc dont consider what application they will put the data to which is one reason they have trouble learning it solutions are evolved not from inspiration but from observation inspection data and familiarity reach and withdraw runs off the barriers that prevent you from observing something you can overdo the studying by spending far too long gathering data this would indicate some defect in getting familiarity with what you are studying to gain knowledge or understanding of something you need to be in touch with it arc u you can get too concentrated on one line and get so withdrawn that you lose touch with other things that is why lrh periodically goes charging off into contact with different areas once in awhile you ought to go look and see how people operate so that they dont get unreal in building practice youve got to work at

assimilating data 1 nomenclature knowing what word means 2 the subject matter itself arrangement and understanding of the subject matter part of the issue of nomenclature is knowing what definition means we cant use psychiatric terms in scientology because the field of psychiatry has different basis and purpose than ours and their terms have implications that would give utterly unwanted twists to our knowledge if we used them it doesnt matter that they are the authorities an authority in fact is someone who can produce result the world has elected people as authorities on subjects when these people cant do the subjects so if you recognized these authorities you would get all crossed up with fields that had failed and that would enter degree of failure into scientology so we leave their technology and nomenclature alone we get results so we are the authorities the existing terminology is actually false since it is from field that gives result our terminology has evolved and has become fixed on the printed page we have to safeguard what weve got or knowledge gets wiped out we must first try to evolve nomenclature cleverly so that it wont conflict with earlier terms then we must carry it forward as standardized item to maintain constant another responsibility is to avoid developing too many new terms any technical field has specialized terminology they are all snob languages showing superior understanding you dont dare use carnival terminology in front of circus performer when referring to the same thing as one becomes more expert in field and gets more familiar with subject his terminology becomes less formal and serious it becomes more like slang having passed through phase of formal terms we shortcutted this process by leaving out the pompous formal nomenclature stage reverence for nomenclature is symptomatic of being at the novice stage of memorizing the terms knowledge is tremendously dependent on nomenclature this fact is almost never appreciated by teachers and students they are trying to talk and use language that they dont know this can get so bad that they think the subject is incomprehensible or that they are incapable of understanding it when in fact they just havent grasped the meaning of some symbols being used to designate things or their grasp is fumbly not instantaneous as person goes on studying past point of uncomprehended nomenclature he stacks up the opinion that he doesnt know about it carried on forward from the one term that he didnt totally grasp he thinks he doesnt know or cant know subject when in fact he only doesnt grasp the nomenclature the basic lie that makes incomprehension persist is that it is the subject that is not understood when it is word that is not understood person will develop an automatic comm lag at the point of the nonunderstood word he will misassign the lack of understanding to whatever area it appears in comprehension of the nomenclature used is vital in studying anything you put yourself in the soup as soon as you leave one word not understood behind you 647 besides the subject of nomenclature we have the subject matter itself the arrangement and understanding of it ie what is being named one should get very thorough grasp of the thing under discussion person can misunderstand something that he has read because it conflicts with the usual idea or he can even find it unbelievable if you dont agree with something that is true it is either misunderstood or there is button that you are running into when you find something unbelievable be sure you know what you are unbelieving first be sure that you have understood the words used then be sure that you have got the thing the phenomenon right ninety percent of the time you will find that you had something in crosswise in the other ten percent of the cases you can handle it by setting up examples of how it applies to you and to life get examples of how it is that way and how it isnt that way you will generally find then that some button was in the way of your grasping it following this sort of routine you will find yourself able to study former methods of study what few there have been have not been very successful when there is training available about the only reliable method of studying is to read everything you can find on the subject from cover to cover in studying scientology it is imperative to know how to study since we are studying that which we are studying with to classify students as fast or slow or bright or dull is to make false classification since this classification leads to improvement of anyones ability to study there are students who can memorize words and pages virtually at glance but this does not guarantee that they will be able to do anything with what they memorized you can find out by seeing whether they can define the words the direction and end purpose of study is understanding with an unknown word or phenomenon in the middle of subject you will have mystery and nonapplication one of the primary criticisms of modern education is that it doesnt immediately result in application you should be able to take any textbook direction and if you have understood it apply it directly and effectively without familiarity if you also have familiarity as in studying auditing while auditing you should be whiz l ron hubbard type

into the fields of organization and business your perimeter of action goes out wider than just processing people it includes the economic woof and warp that makes the trap that keeps civilizations interiorized into themselves it includes relationships on dynamics beyond the first dynamic we dont evaluate for the pc however outside of an auditing session advice can be valuable and nonevaluative the individual has eight dynamics you can handle his first dynamic in auditing but he has stresses and impacts reaching him from the second third and other dynamics only two things give you trouble 1 significance 2 mass when someone cant confront mass he goes into significance figurefigure etc and sometimes but not necessarily handling mass is substitute activity for one unable to handle significances also some people who can handle mass very well cant think but 648 there is reason why someone cant do both occupationally person could be in position where he mainly handles one or the other and considers that he mustnt do the other or that he cant society tells you that you mustnt confront certain things if you accept this dictum you can find yourself up some blind alley someplace when life offers person reward he will lose interest in playing the game anymore destruction of reward factor is more contributive to psychosis than punishment you could have conflict between fourth dynamics if terrans came into conflict with another race of beings the fifth dynamic tends to be out of comm with people so does the sixth man finds the seventh dynamic unreal one this planet the eighth dynamic is the subject of nuttiness up the line the common denominator is understanding and communication the only reason why you have trouble inside dynamic or one dynamic against another is lack of communication and understanding with it or of it the less communication and understanding is feasible the more trouble you would have in doing something with it the reward and punishment factors are out to the degree that the communication or understanding is out the english and germans keep having wars because of differences in culture slight those these differences are understanding can exist even in the absence of significant communication on the fifth dynamic or at least between men and the fifth dynamic there is not much mutual understanding within the fifth dynamic there is lot of mutual warfare this doesnt mean that the law of the jungle is senior or the only one operating there are also assistive factors in the fifth dynamic points of high understanding as in symbiosis we are in the field of looking over the dynamics and finding out how far communication is out and how far understanding is out the easiest way to square somebody around in life is to process him however sometimes you have to start out by approaching person with advice before he will even get processing you can advise someone who is going to get processed to move out of his normal environment for week and so on you may have to give him very complicated advice to match the complexity of his problems as you move up into dynamics besides the first you may find that you have things to handle that you cant handle by getting all involved into processing when you depart from handling first dynamic practically speaking you have advice or instruction as the main activity instruction is more directed advice you use this on the upper seven dynamics so training instilling cultural patterns etc becomes part of scientologists activities advice is casual undirected instruction basically it is what you use everywhere but on the first dynamic when people ask for advice go ahead and evaluate if advice is all you can get them to have it would be irresponsible not to give advice if the person cant get some processing within the reality youve got and the data youve got give the best and least partisan advice you can you only get into trouble when you move away from being pandetermined in the advice you give or for that matter in whom you will process remember though that advice that isnt partisan is unacceptable do give advice but dont spend whole lot of time mulling it over just dont pretend to be completely detached if guy wants you to get mad at his 649 motherinlaw you dont have to but you dont have to pretend that you are detached and part of the conflict either bleaugh look interested and give advice you can offer advice urging communication if that is not accepted realize that you dont know much about the situation and you might as well give the person something that he can and will apply and do estimate the degree of understanding that can occur in the situation and advise that presumably this would also apply to communication dont assume that you know very much about the situation or that you can give him the perfect solution if you had the perfect solution the person wouldnt take it he would only take as much as he could apply so give him what he can apply and do the equation is what is the best advice you can give him that will be taken when you know that person will take particular piece of advice put pressure on and put in the hope factor advice is anything that you can deal off the cuff that the person can do that is more beneficial to him than what he is doing the point is handle it you can do lot besides processing person hunt and punch around for what he will accept dont assume that everything you are told is true and dont get partisan the advice you give can be slightly destructive just dont give advice that is widely destructive 1 try to bring about auditing 2 if you cant bring about auditing try to bring about communication 3 if you cant bring about communication try to bring about understanding give the individual something practical give him something to do in this way you will lessen the amount of peoples troubles that you listen to even if people dont do what you say you will have catalyzed the situation and it will have smoothed out if they dont want to handle it they will stop talking to you anyway the fact that you are helping the people in your vicinity handle life does put you kingpin and aces up and you actually occupy role that you will increasingly occupy as scientology rolls along l ron hubbard type 3 idate28764 volnum2 issue31 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec31 campaign to handle psychosomatic ills 6407c28 shspec31 campaign to handle psychosomatic ills there will be small popular textbook on the handling of psychosomatic illnesses healing is nobodys monopoly if it becomes anyones monopoly it will be the monopoly of those who can produce results he who can do the job should be the authority there are three actually four aspects or types of illness 1 predisposition eg rats carrying disease impure water etc 2 precipitation 3 acuteness ie acute illness or injury 4 prolongation ie any illness that goes beyond its expected term when there is an acute injury or illness one that exists right now but is temporary then there is job for medico he is the authority in that field that is where he is trained we should grant him that beingness if someone gets cholera he is sick get the medico where the medico errs is in trying to take in terrain that is broader than the sphere of his authority 650 there are two other things that happen in illness the predisposition or cause of it the medico is just faintly into this it is more the province of the public health officer who is often an engineer not an md efforts to handle predisposition factors are put on physical level tb testing industrial health programs etc medicine cant often determine the length of time involved in predisposition it begins with an indeterminate point as far as medicine or doctors are concerned with physical cause eg germ or malarial mosquito or the alcohol that drunk driver who injured himself drank before he drove such things are what the medico attributes predisposition to they are physical things not mental ones the other area of illness is prolongation the perpetuation of an illness the failure to recover speedily by the expected term of the illness doctors know the expected duration of the acute phase of an illness they have way of estimating the period of predisposition unless they can establish disease contact even that is not really accurate since person can be predisposed to certain illness before contacting germs contact with the germ is really precipitation of the illness so medicos are only slightly involved in predisposition they have acute illness as their exclusive purview and they are totally ineffective in the area of prolongation prolongation is fuzzier area since the treatment of the illness can contribute to it the medicos whole idea of prolongation is 1 treatment not soon enough 2 improper treatment 3 complications but prolongation can only be co trolled to limited extent by medicine if an illness enters the stage of prolongation with complications setting in the medicos tend to go into apathy just like the patient because there are elements in the prolongation of the illness that they cant control medicos understand predisposition by physical means they understand the acute phase in physical terms in scientology we would say that the cycle of action would be from the first contact with the predisposing factor to the end of the expected normal term of the illness the doctor can handle this cycle but sometimes complications occur because of poor or absent treatment in his view again it is physical but the medico tends to be rather apathetic about it or to go into frantic activity eg repeated operations or heroic measures shock or postoperative shock is physical thing to doctor usually he can neither prevent it nor do anything about it he neglects any possible mental influence when you say illness and healing the md of course thinks of physical address to these since this is what he means by these terms however most doctors know that they are up against something else when they are dealing with psychosomatic illness if you say psychosomatic healing this is way out to the doctor how the doctor somes to recognize the existence of psychosomatic illness is puzzler since this type of illness is not started by physical contact the faults that the doctor finds with psychosomatic healing are only that 1 it encroaches on his field 2 he doesnt understand it the psychosomatic healer tends to overreach himself and to enter the field of physical healing in which he is not trained and he 651 tends to inhibit or prohibit treatment of physical illness when it exists for example doctor will therefore condemn chiropractor he will point out that the chiropractor adjusted the slipped disc of ten patients and of course nine of them felt better but he did the same thing with the tenth patient who was really suffering from tb which undiagnosed by the ignorant practitioner subsequently caused the death of the patient therefore chiropractor is dangerous to the doctor that is the professional mds professional objection in its entirety this argument is neatly handled by us if we send sick patients to an md before we handle them the md also recognizes that when he gets into the field of psychosomatic illness he is in nevernever land he knows not of because it is not purely physical an auditor cant do much with someone who is acutely physically ill such person has too much ptp and not enough ability to asis heavy acute illness is ptp and you cant audit over ptp so dont try get the ptp handled first by doctor if necessary then the field of prolongation of illness belongs to scientology dont audit over high temperature you could perhaps use very simple process reachwithdraw from the pillow perhaps and see if it works but thats all the proper approach is to try to put such pc in communication at very low level if you dont get sudden resurgence leave it there is point in trying to complete whatever action you were on because the pc is too distracted by his body problem to asis what you were on prolonged illness is in the field of psychosomatic healing ie scientology touch assist shifts the pcs attention off of the place where the pc decided to stop the shock wave and it discharges that part of the incident thus touch assist allows the incident to run through the places where the shock wave did go to can be run out if you continued the touch assist you would put the pc back at the beginning of the incident again then you would have to run the incident out again the reason why an engram persists is that it contains lie the pc has tried to stop the motion and with the stuck picture has apparently done so but actually the pc did not stop the incident or the movement of the shock wave through the body so it has to be run through to be asised so when accepting pc for auditing you would be wise to have him get good physical exam first so that any acute physical illness can be treated before you start auditing him however if the pc has an untreatable illness there is point in telling the doctor that you are going to heal him you are not talking about the same kind of healing so you will just get into big disagreement you can get into communication with the doctor on the basis of his expertise in his area get him to write report on his findings dont appear to challenge him in his field when you are in the field of psychosomatics you are in the field of prolongation of illness your argument with the md takes an interesting turn at this point there is nothing that he can do you can tell him this is question of psychosomatic illness there is probably some mental condition holding the illness in place he can agree with you in oversimplified terms you can tell him that it is more complicated than that and he will agree it is something that has exceeded his cycle of action so he has to become the effect of it 652 if you can do something about psychosomatic illness when the doctor cant he will be glad to send those patients to you because those are the patients he can do nothing about which makes him feel like fraud and gives him loses these are the patients whose illnesses go on longer than they should you can tell the doctor simplified version of what you will do as one specialist to another then you get your result and the doctor will look on you with awe the md knows that the psychiatrist is failure because among other things he cant handle never solved the problem of prolongation for the md if scientology made its position completely clear to the medical doctor namely that we are not interested in trying to heal obvious physical injury and illness our view would become much realer to the md and we would be seen as doing him service in handling the crocks just agree to the truth that skull fracture for example is nothing that psychosomatic healing should be practiced on that there is purview that belongs properly and exclusively to the md and surgeon and he will stop fighting you instantly psychosomatic healing actually has an old tradition older than the mds this includes witch doctoring magic etc naturally it is the oldest tradition it has truth behind it because it is the tradition of the spirit this is just small part of scientology but it is where we belong in the field

in scientology medical treatment lies in what they call psychic trauma within 24 hours of lrhs setting out program of helping the medicos they goofed with saint hill student bill websterjohnson they gave him the wrong bloodtype during transfusion and thereby possibly cost him his life thats pure damn foolishness in the first place they monkey around when they get outside their limited proper field this caused lrh to take sharp look at possible cooperation and made him question it legislatures pass laws about things that they know nothing about theres nothing in the constitution that says you have to be sane to be citizen and yet if you are pronounced insane you are longer citizen and have civil rights whatsoever the right to say who is insane is given to people with training in the field of the mind who think that the mind is the brain by law they do not have to be trained in anything but medicine anyway there is bill or law that says that psychiatrists can practice in the field of the mind only that one must be an md psychiatrists do not have to be licensed and the term psychiatrist has legal standing to train an animal you wait for the animal to do something and then say the command word and reward the animal association according to pavlov and thompson is concatenation of events by which one reaches conclusion freudian psychiatry is not currently practiced none of the current practitioners was trained by freud and the original system may have called for more intelligence on the part of the practitioner than seems to be used now freud probably used savvy and wordassociation to cone down on the problem free association is the lengthy procedure for contemporary freudians amassing enough data appears to be their system 653 but by the time one amasses enough data one is simply confused you need chance to apply the data technology is dicey stuff the more vias it goes through the more errors it becomes subject to lrh handles lots of tech queries from students instructors msh etc the right to practice depends ideally on the ability to do not on some state legislators decisions promoters and lobbyists determine what laws and appropriations shall be made anyway in order to get more money for their department or industry or whatever that is why there are periodic attacks on scientology it is being used as an example of how bad it all is over there if you hit someone mentally or physically with enough force duress or bad news you can make him give you something mass physical blow significance saying how bad it is eg is seepage troubling your loved ones this is mortuary bad news comeon for expensive caskets blackmail is based on the same principle so is taxation and the draft the medical doctor uses this technique in diseasefighting campaigns that scare people with how bad it is instead of getting their income from curing people they use the scare tactic as large source of funds if you understand how this law operates you can usually put together good defense or counterattack this scare tactic is also used by patients im so bad off youve got to give with the next bad news artist you run into ask him boldfacedly what am i expected to give you you will stop him cold in his tracks this completely discombobulates him you apply the second half of the law that he is operating on albeit unknowingly before he is ready for it you complete the cycle unexpectedly you may not get sensible answer to your question but you will change what he is doing his attention he may not doing this consciously he may have you misidentified and be dramatizing something he surely doesnt expect your response if you can make people laugh when theyre crying and cry when theyre laughing then you would know something about the human mind this is an interesting point but knowing the mind doesnt mean manipulating the mind the medical profession means something else by psychosomatic healing than what you mean by it they mean the minds influence on the body but they consider the mind to be the brain so psychosomatic means the brains or the nervous systems effect on the body this is like saying that the switchboard is the causative element of the phone company so psychosomatic has come to mean the bodys effect on the body thus the subject of psychosomatic illness has disappeared as meaningful subject the word psychosomatic actually means psyche soul plus soma body so proper definition of psychosomatic would be thetans influence on the body that is our definition but not the medicos the first downgrade was to translate psyche as mind the thetan had lost his identity and had become identified with the masses and machinery of the mind the second downgrade was to make mind mean brain and nervous system this makes psychosomatic mean about what the influence of the switchboards and telephone lines on the government would mean that is what the mds mean since the brain and nervous system are part of the body you are just dealing with the bodys influence on the body case has just fallen out of it 654 better term then might be spiritual healing or the spirits influence on the body you can educate or process someone to recognition of the effect he as being is having on his you could ask him for times in his life when he was ill following being upset he might comm lag long time but getting few of these out of the way will improve someones case we have advanced beyond the tradition of psychosomatic healing because we recognize three stages of influence the thetan psyche influencing the mind psycho which then influences the body soma we recognize that the mind is doing something to the body some retained memory has held pain or an experience in place keeping the body ill or predisposing the body to illness or injury you wouldnt have somatic body feeling of feeling good because it would be you that felt good dianetics was at the level of mind over the body but even here the mind was not totally causative we had to recognize that something was doing something that was not the mind we recognized that the thetan existed and could influence the mind to make it stop influencing the body for the worse and that makes us different we have found the thing that the thetan can influence the mind he may not be able to influence the body directly but he can influence the mind which in turn is influencing the body this is more effective than earlier healing practices because asking the thetan to influence the body directly is too great gap for him to jump scientology handles predisposition to illness and we are the only ones who can just as we are the only ones who can handle prolongation of illness l ron hubbard type 3 idate4864 volnum2 issue33 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec33 summary of study 6408c04 shspec33 summary of study there has not been technology of education or study there was school technology but it didnt have much to do with education education seldom has much to do with school education as opposed to schooling takes into account the relative importance ie the applicability of the data being taught schooling has real thought of applicability for instance there are people in art who think that knowing names and dates is knowing something about art when they couldnt tell you what picture was painted with in education mass and significance must be balanced dont get too much significance for the mass when you get into significance vs mass you get into action action could be defined as significance versus mass of some kind the reason why one engages in action is that one has purpose of achieving or avoiding something in education when the significance is never added to the mass you get jammed curriculum there is doingness significance that has nothing to do with the mass that you are now confronting is disrelated datum all it does is to throw you curve school is expert at doing this you could have school system that would teach but that wouldnt educate anyone or train anyone for anything because it failed to add any mass or doingness to the significance the data in such school system is all curiosa it is not of any use that is why you almost never turn an artist out of university universities separate significance from action so that the student gets introverted with confront of the subject you cant have education if you detach doingness from significance if you do this you get highly impractical person who never leaves school professor 655 for someone to teach who cannot do is terrible mistake instructors in scientology should be able to audit any trouble an instructor has in teaching has at least little to do with inability in the area person merely writing reports of people who can do is too far removed from the mass to write good textbook when you have thoroughly learned something you can use your textbook knowledge to think and you will get better result than the pure textbook approach would give lrh also found that the pure darkroom training that he had had wasnt enough in itself to make good photographer there is ample evidence of this fact in the daily newspaper pictures which are mostly by untrained photographers photography has the common denominator of the public taste it is new subject only little over century old it hasnt had time to get snobbish when subject is all mass and significance it also fails professionalism has to do with significance doingness and mass you need all three to get final result education would treat these three things equally this isnt new thought but the photography course confirmed it for lrh professionalism is sweated for professionals work hard dilettantes dont you dont have to have done everything that has been done to be pro you dont have to have made human mind to fix one up or to have built an emeter to know how to operate one this would be an overstress on doingness the way to keep things in balance is to design the course such that if someone isnt going to do something you strip the significance out of it doingnesses become converted to significances if one isnt going to perform them you should never thus convert doingnesses to only significances ie never take something that is never more to be performed and describe it far beyond necessity you can work it in the other direction and convert significance to doingness if you take something that has been done but isnt currently being done and teach someone to do it eg bromoil prints the doingness and mass of subject that should be taught are the currently applicable doingnesses and masses of the subject the significances that should be taught are enough background so that the individual doesnt get stuck in the doingness so that the doingness has framework and the principles behind it are clear and understood this is little more significance than you would expect that is why you show the student how the subject evolved what other doingnesses there have been and the principles behind the doingnesses then he can think as well as perform mechanical act that is the difference between pro and practical man when doingness changes the guy who has grounding in the subject can understand why and evaluate it properly professional therefore can advance where practical man without theoretical grounding would become antiquated or obsolete mere theoretician could be welltaught but he is seldom educated since his doingness would be missing he might have some other doingness that would be useful eg he could be an art expert who knows nothing about art but whose doingness is the detection of the age of canvasses or whatever most of the protest of the young is that they are being schooled not educated an instructor could think someone was doing simply because he was in motion but if the motion has nothing to do with what the student will be doing it reacts like significance and the student will feel bored and stuck as though he was up against something that he couldnt move through 656 education should be the activity of relaying an idea or an action from one being to another in such way as not to stultify or inhibit the use thereof it permits the recipient to think on and develop the subject and not to become antiquated on the subject the information is loose and flexible in his head not fixed in such way that it relates to only one thing the basic thing wrong with education has been that it never defined what it was trying to do it got confused with schooling education got in trouble the second it started to do something that it didnt define by starting with the thetan as the basis of our theory we exceed the reach of other subjects we have to process someone to get him to understand because the thetan is relatively incapable of understanding in degraded state there appears to be close relationship between miseducation and aberration you could get resurgences in many areas of case just by getting someone to find and define misunderstood words from life l ron hubbard type 3 idate6864 volnum2 issue34 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec34 study gradients and nomenclature 6408c06 shspec34 study gradients and nomenclature bulletins are now being written in form that is easier to understand since lrh started to study study scores on exams have gone from 5 in the gos to 60 in the 90s since this material started to be communicated the aim is to improve the ability of the student to learn by altering the methodology of teaching this is an unusual approach we are now handling the students subjective reaction to the subject by changing the method of teaching the usual way to change the students reaction to the subject was by punishment the normal physical universe method the grade system is punishment system on rare occasions the participation of the student has been invited by some teachers education is not normally very successful although educators dont often recognize or admit this fact in scientology we have the unusual situation of being able to see the end product of our education in action this makes it easy to see how well the students learned the material in studying study lrh avoided fields where the students ability to apply what he learned is readily observable we have instantaneous inspection of the results of our study this is quite rare most fields of study expect the student to be very amateurish in the field of photography you get results almost as rapidly as in studying auditing which made it good comparative field for studying auditing is complicated activity in teaching it we apply the principle of gradient scales which was discovered long since we have someone learn fairly simple basic action very well then we add second action etc modern universities usually err by entering the gradient at too high point and assuming that the students already know basics that they dont in fact modern education is the art of teaching on an outgradient our basic gradient on education is to start by getting someone there this is step that elementary school teachers overlook and that works very well when used for five or ten minutes day brief time though that is at the start of the day for instance you could run look at that wall etc the fact that body is there doesnt prove that the person is there nobody is smart where he is not so getting the person there raises iq 657 you always have to start with an action that is simple enough so that the student can get it rather easily otherwise he will feel spinny and confused as he goes on you could discover whether this had happened with person by checking on the emeter for early difficulties in studying dianetics or scientology if you got ta and continued reads as the person discussed it you would know that there was something there that bad never been resolved the difficulties that men have with their minds are those which have ridden forward with them into the present those are the ones that must be handled you can always get one read on difficulty or confusion that someone has had in the past simply because it is pictured on the track as having been difficulty but it wont keep reading if it hasnt ridden forward in time as an auditor you are only interested in the things that the person never resolved which are active now those things will read repetitively this applies to clearing up someones difficulty in studying because the confusions that the person had which are now cleared up have power to confuse him now arc must have preceded all misemotion and bad reaction the confusion that sticks the student in pt is never his basic confusion if student really cant learn something then there is lower point on the gradient that the student skipped at that point he had enough confusion to be overwhelmed that second point is the one that you will get on the meter you wont get the earliest point this follows the pattern of the mind person doesnt have trouble from what he knows is wrong what the student is very confused about which the instructor cant seem to teach is not the right point to try to clear up the way to handle this student is to go back and find the word in the earlier material that wasnt understood you can pinpoint within few words the exact spot at which student started to have trouble then look earlier and find the skipped gradient if there is some word that student doesnt understand with violence you look before that you go back as far as you need to the physiological manifestations will be feeling headachy spots in front of the eyes walls getting closer spinny weird feeling the skipped gradient can even be in an allied subject when word is misunderstood words right after it vanish teaching is relaying data to person that he can receive and understand in such way that he will be able to use the data that is the definition that was given the other day see p 656 above to fit in with this exact rationale that we are discussing now instruction would consist of guiding student along known gradient not dreaming up solutions to his confusions good instruction consists in backtracking to find the point where the student thought he understood when he didnt study is concatenation of certainties string of confidences and competences so before you help student out let him get in trouble never trouble trouble til trouble troubles you that is the difficulty of group study teachers have to make an average of trouble for the whole class dont ever help student before be runs into trouble it is interesting that it was in 1947 that lrh started investigating the effect of mislearned word on life following the data from commander thompson on wordassociations lrh established that when he cleared up some words what had been troubling person ceased to trouble him though he could well have new problems 658 another aspect of the misunderstood word phenomenon can be that the word or phrase used can be inadequate leading to omitted data one can get hung up by being deprived of some information eg by typographical error so it could be omitted data as well as misunderstood words that causes trouble for the student the fault could be in the text the common ingredient is that something is not understood l ron hubbard type 3 idate11864 volnum2 issue35 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec35 study evaluation of information 6408c11 shspec35 study evaluation of information psychologists are working for advertisers in order to find out what makes people tick motivational research but they are the wrong people to go to since they dont know what the real buttons are scientologist could be much more successful at motivational research degrading though the use of knowledge of the mind for such purposes would be in order to live calmly in the midst of confusion person must have the basic answers then the confusion doesnt bother him 90 of the time and the other 10 of the time he can do something about it knowledge is achieved by study the subject of words boobytraps persons efforts to find out about the world the individual generally assigns to the wrong part of the study material the reason why he cant study it because the right part is something that he isnt confronting and he feels he cant confront it so he disperses and confronts something else study could mean the same thing as inspection ie observation to find out something about something person can observe something directly or he can get knowledge on secondhand basis from the printed page the second system speeds up the amount that you can learn since you dont have to do all the basic legwork even when you have direct experience it is best to have some fruits of others observations and experience from which to profit illiterate cultures dont survive as well as literate ones those who do not know who do not understand get overwhelmed and tossed out between the two extremes of 1 observation necessary because one knows everything dying civilization or individual 2 observation possible because the words arent known lies the middle ground of knowing the words and staying alert never become complacent about what you know and you will survive nicely this applies especially to someone who knows more than those around him this danger of stultifying because of thinking that there is more need to observe faces scientology the person who survives is the one who can observe understand and do second hand observation in particular has to be very well understood the understanding has to increase in proportion to the directness of the observation understanding is substitute for mass in studying something there are two things to understand about second hand observation and understanding the understanding can be indirect because of 1 time 2 being relayed by someone else the difficulties of secondhand observation are innumerable so part of our understanding must be evaluation of the reliability of the information that we are being given that is where the bulk of beings get fouled up evaluating an information source is matter of experience among other things you must be able to go 659 on past something you know you dont understand being prepared for any misunderstood phenomena and knowing the source of these phenomena what person studies and the way in which he studies should depend on what he wishes to do with the information specialized words are used for specialized observations you can approach subject at various levels you can think that you know more than you do if you have had superficial contact with the subject but how much do you want or need to know about the subject do you want to be able to discuss it at parties or to use it for something and if the latter for what do you want to use it for instance art could be used as discussion topic as interior decoration as investment as something that one will teach others to appreciate or as something that one will create oneself study that winds up only in understanding with activity is ok there is lot of it around in society but dont make habit of it you can think that you know all about it when you cant do it that is not very prosurvival neither is the consideration that the subject is too complicated for you to ever use it doingness does require much more understanding than lookingness if you are studying for doingness study on gradient give the student series of doingnesses that he can do and have wins at doingness increases understanding as well as the other way around l ron hubbard type 3 idate13864 volnum2 issue36 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec36 study and education 6408c13 shspec36 study and education education is acquiring knowingness in subject and an ability to act in that area the whole subject of education has as its end the accomplishment of certain doingnesses study that doesnt have that intention is only directed towards acquaintance dilletantism or doodledaddling that is not really education education is to accomplish certain things with that subject if person is educated in subject he can accomplish the results of that subject because he knows that subject this is why education in schools isnt really education at all you cant really separate education from some role some professional doingness as the end in view that is the modern quarrel with education in schools much is spent to educate students but they dont get educated people dont get educated in arithmetic because it doesnt have an end product it could have an end product but the end product hasnt been defined or described in universities the student is expected to use higher mathematics to solve problems that could actually be solved with arithmetic if arithmetic hadnt been degraded by being thought of as nothing but groundwork for higher mathematics as the purpose of subject deteriorates or is purported to deteriorate the subject itself disappears if the individual learning the subject has purpose for the subject it will die away in him live study is one that has use dead study has use you can cause subject to die away either by making its use die away or by omitting its purpose as part of the educational process ie not telling students what the subject is for this brings to mind the dissemination formula this is related to the fact that you need purpose to study something getting persons ruin and applying the formula gives him purpose for looking at the subject of scientology 660 it is possible to become obsessive in the study of some subject that has use in talking about scientology people will think of it as subject only when they see that it has purpose that is real to them as an attainable purpose for an educational subject to continue to exist it must have purpose that can be seen to be an attainable action to the individual addressed in his view the value of subject depends upon the value of attaining its stated purpose culture is held together only by education the achievement of an education is remunerated to the degree that 1 its service is understood to be valuable this shows that some odd services are thought to be valuable eg undertaking which has survived as technical line for thousands of years 2 it is understood continuing need for subject will preserve the subject but its technology must be relayed which it will be if it is needed one could destroy subject by destroying its purpose or by destroying its technology or by adding things to its technology that are unnecessary in educating person in certain subject the longer it takes to get to the point of using the subject the more opportunities there are to fail at it this is is the reverse of the toosteep gradient cf the analogy of the runway if it is too short you cant take off but if it is too long you are likely to damage the plane on the ruts and stones before you can take off true knowledge gives correct emphasis merely theoretical knowledge will give wrong emphasis this can result in technology getting lost as would happen if for instance you studied three weeks on how to make emeter varnish and other such matters unrealities enter when you teach solutions to problems that dont exist or when you fail to solve problems that do exist by experience you learn where the problems are it is hard to teach subject with which you have immediate personal experience this is one reason why education gets bad name since most professors dont know what they are talking about those that can do those that cant teach all subjects wind up in finite doingness if subject doesnt wind up in finite doingness person cannot be educated in that subject anything that winds up in specific doingness can be educated education in the absence of the mass with which the technology will be involved is hard on people it makes them feel squashed bent sort of spinny bored exasperated sort of dead pictures of the mass would help you would expect the greatest incidence of suicide and illness where people were studying subject whose mass was absent too steep gradient gives different physiological reaction confusion and reelingness the bypassed definition gives blank washedout notthere feeling followed by nervous hysteria the eventual manifestation of this is blow from the subject for summary of these study manifestations see fig 27 below to remedy the absence of mass supply mass to remedy the toosteep gradient find the last point that was well understood and find the misunderstood right there or just after to remedy the misunderstood word get it defined and used 661 figure 27 manifestations of study problems absent mass 1 squashed feeling 2 bent feeling 3 feeling sort of spinny 4 boredom 5 flatness 6 peeling sort of dead 7 exasperation 8 headaches 9 stomach aches 10 eyes hurting 11 dizziness too steep gradient 1 confusion 2 reelingness bypassed definition 1 blank notthere washedout feeling 2 followed by nervous hysteria 3 followed by blow from the subject this is the final manifestation gradients are more involved with doingness though they do hang off in the subject of significance but it is the action that we are interested in the misunderstood word is the most important thing in establishing someones doingness the restoration of doingness depends only on getting the misunderstood word defined and understood though to do well or with talent may vary from person to person person say doesnt know word in psychology so he cant move over into scientology the misunderstood word opens the gate to education so it is the most important aspect of study tech l ron hubbard
