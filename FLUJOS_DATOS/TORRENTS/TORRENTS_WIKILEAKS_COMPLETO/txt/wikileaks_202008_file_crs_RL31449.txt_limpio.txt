considerations related to proposed department of homeland security june 10 2002 judy schneider specialist on the congress government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress house and senate committee organization and jurisdiction considerations related to proposed department of homeland security summary the creation of department of homeland security along the lines proposed by the administration would affect the jurisdiction of numerous house and senate committees in addition the expansiveness of the proposal may cause congress to consider using alternative procedures and structures to review the proposal and to monitor the implementation of such new department this report discusses the current legislative jurisdictions of house and senate committees with responsibility over terrorism homeland security and the agencies affected by the proposed new department it also examines alternative procedures and structures congress might employ in studying the proposal such as creating select committee finally it identifies options for committee organization to monitor department of homeland security after its creation contents house and senate

committees with rule x language and jurisdiction over issues and agencies related to homeland security 3 table 2 senate committees with rule xxv language and jurisdiction over issues and agencies related to homeland security 5 house and senate committee organization and jurisdiction considerations related to proposed department of homeland security decentralization is the most distinctive characteristic of the congressional committee system due to the high volume and complexity of its work congress divides it legislative oversight and internal administrative tasks among numerous standing and select committees the house and senate each have their own committees and related rules of procedure which are similar but not identical within their respective areas of responsibility committees generally operate rather independently of each other and of their parent chambers the difficult tasks of aggregating committees activities and of integrating policy in areas where jurisdiction is shared fall largely to the chambers party leadership determination of committee jurisdiction and referral rules and practice in considering jurisdiction distinction needs to be made between legislative and oversight jurisdiction the former denotes the authority to report measures to the full chamber the latter to review or investigate although oversight jurisdiction may be the product of specific legislative enactment it also accrues when committees accept responsibilities for broad topical areas hence there are more likely to be broader and more frequent overlaps in oversight jurisdiction than in legislative jurisdiction legislative jurisdiction however has occasioned the majority of open conflicts between committees senate senate rule xxv generally identifies broad issues handled by each standing committee although not all issues within committees purview are specified further these jurisdictional descriptions do not explicitly identify each committees jurisdiction over particular measures or over 1 executive branch departments and agencies 2 particular offices within these departments and agencies or 3 programs operated by these departments and agencies committees jurisdiction over an executive department or agency generally is implied by its jurisdiction over the issues the department or agency handles measures introduced in the senate or passed by the house and sent to the senate are referred to senate committees in accordance with rule xxv jurisdiction and with precedents established by prior referrals formal agreements between committees reached over time can supplement rule xxv and are regarded by the parliamentarian as setting precedent for future referrals an ad hoc agreement may be made to govern the consideration of particular measure but such an agreement is not binding on future referrals crs2 under senate rule xvii each measure is referred to single committee based on the subject matter which predominates in the legislation predominance is usually determined by the extent to which measure deals with subject however there are exceptions notably measure containing revenue provisions is likely to be referred to the finance committee even when the subject does not predominate senate rule xvii further allows measure to be referred to multiple committees for consideration the senate typically makes multiple referrals by unanimous consent after negotiations among interested parties measure may also be multiply referred by joint motion of the majority and minority leaders or their designees however this motion has never been used house paramount in determining committee jurisdiction in the house is house rule x the formal provisions of the rule are supplemented by an intricate series of precedents and formal and informal agreements governing the referral of legislation in general based on precedent once measure has been referred to given committee it remains within the jurisdiction of that committee if the measure is enacted into law amendments to the law are presumed to be within the originating committees jurisdiction bills that are more comprehensive than the measure they amend or supersede are presumed to be within the jurisdiction of the committee reporting the more comprehensive measure written agreements drafted among committees to stipulate their understanding of jurisdictional boundaries have been used in recent years if legislation is considered on the house floor such agreements are traditionally inserted into the congressional record house parliamentarians in advising the speaker have generally considered themselves bound by such an agreement when it is supported by all the committees concerned and when the house usually by unanimous consent has given its assent to the agreement in 1974 with the adoption of the committee reform amendments the house authorized the speaker to refer measures to more than one committee in joint split or sequential manner in 1995 with the rules changes adopted in the 104th congress the speakers authority to multiply refer measures was changed the speaker longer could refer measures jointly he was authorized instead to designate primary committee split and sequential referrals were still allowed further the speaker could impose time limitations on any committee receiving referral committees with jurisdiction over homeland security the following tables identify house and senate committee jurisdiction over homeland security issues included is language from the official chamber rules notation of

veterans affairs backup medical provider to the department of defense to consider proposals to create department of homeland security options for congressional organization dispersed responsibility over specific topics of public policy has identifiable benefits and costs when several committees in both chambers can claim some share of responsibility for policy area competition for legislative and oversight prominence serves to spur committee activity among all the panels asserting jurisdiction house and senate rules encourage such competition especially in the area of oversight by granting specified committees oversight jurisdiction that is far broader than their legislative authority such grants of power may encourage overlapping efforts among committees and may guarantee that specified policy area is not ignored by congressional committees dispersed policy responsibility conversely may also inhibit the development of comprehensive policy when single committee can claim exclusive legislative jurisdiction over specific subject it may be difficult or impossible to enact comprehensive legislation this section addresses ways the congress could organize itself to consider the proposal to create department of homeland security present system congress could decide to make alteration to its established procedures or to the established roles and jurisdictions of its current committees it could be argued that dispersed congressional authority over this broad subject assures that many different perspectives will be brought to bear on congressional action in this area the house committee with jurisdiction over executive organization the committee on government reform would presumably receive the primary referral of legislation to create new cabinet department in the crs7 senate the governmental affairs committee has predominant jurisdiction and has already reported related legislation on the subject1 informal task force task forces are normally used when committee jurisdiction is divided among several panels or when partisan intensity appears likely to delay or prevent committee action task forces have independent staffing resources nor do they have institutional powers granted to committees however task forces are able to work quickly because they can work informally party leaders or party caucuses typically create such task forces in appropriate circumstances bipartisan or bicameral task forces could be created but task forces typically have been singleparty and singlechamber organizations if task force were to be created to review the proposal to create cabinet department questions would exist about it for example would the task force have the authority to draft and report legislation would it be bipartisan bicameral would its work product need to be reviewed by one or more established committees with the authority to report legislation specialized subcommittee the house and senate have occasionally made use of special subcommittees with augmented authority to handle specific issues on shortterm basis although such subcommittees would have expanded authority they still must operate as part of their parent committees they lack the perceived authority that comes with being standalone committee select committee the house and senate have long made use of select committees to review policies that do not fit neatly into the jurisdictions of any single house or senate committee however it is rare for select committees to be granted legislative jurisdiction the senate most recently created select committee on y2k and the house created select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns with the peoples republic of china both panels were created by resolution with fixed termination date with the exception of the house and senate intelligence committees congress has been reluctant in recent years to establish permanently authorized select committees if select committee with legislative jurisdiction were to be established issues exist whether the chamber creating it would give the select committee exclusive jurisdiction to work on the proposal or whether the new panel would share jurisdiction with standing committees alternatively select committee could be established to study an issue and to submit its findings to the appropriate legislative committees of its parent chamber for further action ad hoc committee house rules permit the speaker to appoint an ad hoc committee to coordinate legislation on specified subjects typically the house 1 the measures to create the departments of transportation veterans affairs education hhs and hud all were referred to the house committee on government reform and the senate committee on governmental affairs the measure to create the department of energy was jointly referred to the committee on government reform and the committee on post office and civil service panel abolished in 1995 its jurisdiction was absorbed by the committee on government reform crs8 establishes such an ad hoc committee by resolution and draws committee members largely from the house standing committees having legislative jurisdiction over subject area such ad hoc committees typically review legislation reported from standing committees before such bills are considered by the house this allows the ad hoc committee to enforce some degree of policy coherence on subject that falls within the jurisdiction of number of house panels the house used such ad hoc committees twice in the 1970s the ad hoc committee on the outer continental shelf and the ad hoc committee on energy the senate has never established an ad hoc panel but nothing in its rules would prohibit it from doing so joint committee the house and senate could agree typically by concurrent resolution or bill to establish joint committee joint committees typically are named to study or coordinate policy review only one joint committee in recent years has been granted legislative jurisdiction the joint committee on atomic energy 19471977 joint committees have the advantage of establishing one focal point within congress on specific subject area however unless legislative jurisdiction were granted to joint committee its ability to streamline legislative action would likely be minimal alternatively the house and senate could establish their own individual select committees which could conduct joint hearings or other activities 2 standing committee new either or both chambers could create new standing committee with legislative jurisdiction over the proposal such an action would require change in chamber rules and possibly realignment of existing legislative jurisdictions among the standing committees congress has historically found it difficult to reapportion committee jurisdictions especially in the middle of congress or in the midst of intense policy concern the committee might not absorb jurisdiction from existing committees but could comprise members from relevant committees options for congressional organization and for legislative and oversight jurisdiction over new cabinet department of homeland security if new department is created regardless of how the proposal was handled to establish the new department congress might still need to address the issue of which house and senate committees would have legislative and oversight responsibility over its activities several outside groups have recently provided recommendations on the appropriate organization of house and senate committees over issues related to terrorism and homeland security 2 in the absence of formal action by either chamber house and senate standing committees could be encouraged by chamber leaders to conduct studies and hold hearings jointly in the interest of efficiency crs9 the national commission on terrorism bremer commission recommended congressional reform and found that congress should develop mechanism for reviewing the presidents counterterrorism policy and budget as whole3 the center for strategic and international studies working group on homeland defense stated the objective would be for each legislative body to have only one authorization and one appropriations committee for cyber threats chemical biological radiological and nuclear terrorism and critical infrastructure protection4 the us commission on national security21st century hartrudman commission recommended that congress form special select committee for homeland security to provide congressional support and oversight5 the advisory panel to assess the domestic response capabilities for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction gilmore commission stated we recommend the establishment of special committee for combating terrorism either joint committee between the houses or separate committee in each house to address authority and funding and to provide congressional oversight for federal programs and authority for combating terrorism6 retain current structure congress could decide that the current system is sufficient to monitor the work of the new department changes would be made in either jurisdiction or referral procedures the programs activities and units of the department of energy for example are within the jurisdiction of more than one committee in each chamber retaining the current committee structure in either or both chambers could create jurisdiction struggles among committees claiming to be the primary house or predominant senate committee reorganize entire system either or both chambers could undertake an extensive reorganization of the committee system both chambers have done so in recent years although in varying degrees the joint committee on the organization of congress in the 103rd congress considered numerous options for such 3 national commission on terrorism countering the changing threat of international terrorism report of the national

strategy for combating terrorism crs10 reorganization 7 either chamber could reorganize without the approval of the other one option would be for parallel committee structure between the chambers 8 realign committee jurisdiction within the existing system either or both chambers could choose to realign their committee jurisdictions within the existing structure this would entail changing chamber rules past experience indicates that members generally have been loathe to overhaul the committee system especially in the middle of congress however rules changes are traditionally adopted at the beginning of new congress and changes could be drafted after the adjournment of the 107th congress and included in the package of rules changes voted on at the convening of the108th congress change referral system both chambers generally refer measures to single committee by determining primary jurisdiction in the house and predominant jurisdiction in the senate in the house sequential referrals do occur in the house especially joint simultaneous referrals were allowed until 1995 changing the referral system could enable all interested committees to maintain legislative and oversight jurisdiction for example the speaker of the house who has the authority to impose time limits on referrals could be required to impose them on all committees involved in multiple referral in addition for legislation on homeland security the house could allow joint referrals in the senate which generally requires unanimous consent for multiple referral absent formal agreement the party leadership could invoke its authority to make joint referrals create new standing committee over homeland security new standing committee could be created in either or both chambers such panel could have legislative responsibility over all aspects of new department of homeland security questions regarding whether the new committee would absorb jurisdiction from existing panels or overlap with them would need to be decided would special oversight authority be granted to new committee creating new standing committee would require change in chamber rules create select committee over homeland security members in both the house and senate have introduced resolutions to create select committees in the house representative jc watts rok introduced hres 52 which states that congress should establish panel to examine the adequacy of its committee structure to deal with issues related to domestic terrorism and to consider the creation of more effective structures including select committee on domestic terrorism senator pat roberts rks introduced s res 165 to create select committee on homeland security and terrorism with the panel having primary and preeminent jurisdiction over homeland security and terrorism 7 joint committee on the organization of congress background materials supplemental information provided to members of the joint committee on the organization of congress 103rd cong 1st sess pp 608788 8 such restructuring would enable the chambers to also address other committee jurisdiction and organization issues for example reports have indicated the possibility of recreating house committee on merchant marine and fisheries crs11 select committees generally are not granted legislative jurisdiction if such new panel were created would it have legislative authority if so would other committees receive sequential referrals of their legislative product if such select committee were created without legislative jurisdiction its finding and recommendations would need to be transferred to standing committee realign appropriations committees subcommittees the only panels in congress with closely parallel structures are the house and senate appropriations committees each could create 14th subcommittee on homeland defense which would have responsibility over the funding for the new department and the entities transferred to it this subcommittee could be created irrespective of any legislative or oversight jurisdictional changes create joint committee on homeland security the house and senate could create joint committee to oversee the work of new department however only one joint committee in the last halfcentury has been granted legislative jurisdiction if such joint panel were created the question of sequential referrals to existing standing committees could still be raised for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31449
