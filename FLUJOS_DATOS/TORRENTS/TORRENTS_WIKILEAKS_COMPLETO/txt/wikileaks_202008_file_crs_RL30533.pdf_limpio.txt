related entities that possess legal characteristics of both the governmental and private sectors th hybrid organizations eg fannie mae national park foundation inqtel collectively referred to in this report as the quasi government have grown in number size and importance in recent decades brief review of executive branch organizational history is followed by description of entities with ties to the executive branch although they are not agencies of the united states as defined in title 5 of the us code several categories of quasi governmental entities are defined and discussed 1 quasi official agencies 2 governmentsponsored enterprises gse 3 federally funded research and development corporations 4 agencyrelated nonprofit organizations 5 venture capital funds 6 congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations and 7 instrumentalities of indeterminate character the quasi government not surprisingly is controversial subject to supporters of this trend toward greater reliance upon hybrid organizations the proper objective of governmental management is to maximize performance and results however defined in their view the private and governmental sectors are alike in their essentials and thus subject to the same economically derived behavioral norms they tend to welcome this trend toward greater use of quasi governmental entities critics of the quasi government on the other hand tend to view hybrid organizations as contributing to weakened capacity of government to perform its fundamental constitutional duties and to an erosion in political accountability crucial element in democratic governance they tend to consider the governmental and private sectors as being legally distinct with relatively little overlap in behavioral norms congress is increasingly engaged with the quasi government the issues run the gamut from enacting legislation to encourage the creation of nonprofit organizations to promote individual national parks to proposals to strengthen regulation of governmentsponsored enterprises such as fannie mae to oversight hearings respecting national security issues at alamos laboratory there is nothing modest about the size scope and impact of the quasi government time will tell whether the emergence of the quasi government is to be viewed as symptom of decline in our democratic government or harbinger of new creative management era where the purportedly artificial barriers between the governmental and private sectors are breached as matter of principle this report will be updated at the beginning of each congress

president have increasingly used hybrid organizations for the implementation of public policy functions traditionally assigned to executive departments and agencies1 instead their preference has often been to assign administrative responsibilities to newly created independent agencies or to hybrid organizations possessing legal characteristics of both the governmental and private sectors hy brid organizations attract both support and criticism there are today associated with the federal government alone hundreds of hybrid entities that have collectively been called the quasi government2 the relationship of this burgeoning quasi government to elected and appointed officials is subject of growing concern as it touches the very heart of democratic governance to whom are these hybrids accountable and how is the public interest being protected over and against the interest of private parties the scope and consequences of these hybrid organizations have not been extensively studied basic definitional issues resist resolution even the language to be used in discussing the quasi government is in dispute should government manage ment be discussed in the language of law of economic theory or of the business school the traditional tools for holding executive agencies accountable such as the budget and general management laws are inapplicable in most instances often leaving these hybrids with the freedom to pursue their own institutional interests which may or may not conform to the public interest as defined by the nations elected leadership the current popularity of the quasi government option can be traced to at least four major factors at work in the political realm 1 the current controls on the federal budget process that encourage agencies to develop new sources of revenues 2 the desire by advocates of agencies and programs to be exempt from central management laws especially statutory ceilings on personnel and compensation 3 the contemporary appeal of generic economicfocused values as the basis for new public management and 4 the belief that management flexibility requires entityspecific laws and regulations even at the cost of less accountability to representative institutions this report introduces the reader to the quasi government suggests categories of entities within this sector and examines their legal characteristics behavior and possible policy consequences the report will be revised and updated as new information and analyses become available 1 this report was originally written by ronald c moe who retired from crs it has been revised number of times by the current author readers with questions about quasi governmental organizations may contact kevin r kosar 2 harold seidman the quasi world of the federal government

governmental and private sectors is not easily defined in general the term is used in two ways to refer to entities that have some legal relation or association however tenuous to the federal government or to the terrain that putatively exis ts between the governmental and private sectors for the most part this report will use the term quasi government in the former context referring to entities with some legal relationship to the federal government the one common characteristic to this melange of entities in the quasi government is that they are not agencies of the united states as that term is defined in title 5 of the us code if quasi governmental entity is not an agency of government what is it for this reports purposes it is hybrid organization that has been assigned by law or by general practice some of the legal characteristics of both the governmental and private sectors while different categories of quasi governmental organizations can be descri bed and found useful as an analytic tool such categories are artificial with porous lines of distinction and differentiation and tend to be imposed upon the disparate entities after the fact

model where the existence of quasi government between the governmental and private sectors is designated nd categories of organizations eg government sponsored enterprises and their relationship to the executive branch and congress are described on descending scale from closest to the most distant second there is the categoric organization model involving in this instance the suggestion of four categories pure government organization quasi governmental organization quago quasi nongovernmental organization quango and pure private quago is essentially government organization that is assigned some or many of the attributes normally associated with the private sector quango on the other hand is essentially private organization that is assigned some or many of the attributes normally associated with the governmental sector3 under this schema the legal services corporation for example would be quago while the red cross would be quango whatever the value of the quagoquango designations especially in the comparative international literature on corporate organizations it shall not be used here this report follows the linear spectrum approach in describing the elements within the quasi government it is possible to begin 3 there is burgeoning comparative international literature on the quasi government as it functions today in various countries in many instances the

agencies those entities arguably closest to the executive branch and move on to the other end of the spectrum congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations those entities arguably the furthest

organization of the executive branch be as much as possible unified under the president and that congress be the source to which accountability was rendered this theoretical proposition was put into practice when the first congress convened in 1789 one of the first orders of business was the establishment of executive departments three organic statutes were enacted creating three great departments treasury state and war 4 the heads of these departments were directly responsible to the president and were his agents and thus the agency chiefs were removable by him but ultimately accountable for policy purposes to congress all the particular functions of the newly created executive branch save that of delivering the mails were entrusted to these departments with respect to fundamental authorities and lines of accountability however the executive branch has never been pristine unity from the decision in the first congress to give the comptroller in the department of the treasury substantial degree of legal autonomy within the department5 down to the more recent independent counsels functioning in an uneasy relationship with the executive branch6 not all officers have been directly accountable to the president7 these exceptions notwithstanding the prevailing organizational norm has historically been toward an executive accountable to the president8 reinforcing the hierarchical concept of the account able executive has been the view that authority ought to be assigned by delegation from the president or department heads to subordinate officers rather than being assigned directly by congress to nondepartment head9 the first 4 discussion of the acts creating the three great departments may be found in james hart the american presidency in action 1789 study in

of the civil service commission in 1883 and the interstate commerce commission in 1887 subsequently more independent regulatory commissions would be added in the 20th century an increasing number of independent agencies were established the term independent meaning that an agency was not established within department eg tennessee valley authority national aeronautic and space administration nonetheless the independent agencies generally remained full government agencies operating under all the general management laws 10 except where exempted the view that all government activities should be accountable in some manner to politically responsible officials received its most forceful iteration in the 20th century in the hoover commission report of 1949 the organization and administration of the government must establish clear line of control from the president to these department and agency heads and from them to their subordinates with correlative responsibility from these officials to the president cutting through the barriers which in many cases made bureaus and agencies partially independent of the chief executive 11 through the 1950s the organization and management of the executive branch generally followed some basic rules if an entity was established by congress to accomplish public purpose the probability was that it was an agency of the united states operating under the general management laws enforced by the president these values originating with the founding fathers as reinterpreted by the progressives featured the centrality of public law departmental integration and political accountability the president was viewed as the chief manager of the administrative system 12 the governmental and private sectors cooperated but were kept legally distinct in the interests of protecting citizens rights against potentially arbitrary government these values began to be challenged in the 1960s as evidenced in the establishment of the communications satellite corporation comsat in 1962 congress in this instance created private forprofit corporation indicating more flexible attitude towards organizational innovation additional organizations appeared that were intentionally mixed in their legal characteristics the term quasi governmental began to appear in legislation and unusual structures would be constructed to promote flexibility even when flexibility sometimes resulted in less accountability this was one of the arguments made for creating the corporation for public broadcasting in 1967 81 stat 365 47 usc 396 13 other factors began to further erode the accountable executive model such as greater dependence upon third parties usually private contractors for the performance of governmental functions14 the number of fulltime civil continued comprised within some one of the departments of the government the chief of which only should be responsible to the chief executive magistrate of the nation the establishment of inferior independent departments the heads of which are not and ought not be members of the administration appears to to be liable to many serious objections which will doubtless occur to you 2 american state

what was to become substantial decline decline accelerated in recent years15 in the late 1980s the concept of legally distinctive governmental and private sectors began to be seriously questioned16 in its place new public management concept emerged that argued that the governmental and private sectors were essentially alike and subject to the same economic based behavioral norms and practices internationally the new public management npm17 movement coupled with the movement toward privatization of governmental agencies and programs became the reigning orthodoxy many elements of npm were to be found in vice president gores national performance review npr18 which sought to reinvent some executive branch units and create corporate style entrepreneurial structures19 the purported and often realized strength of entrepreneurial management lies in the flexibility it provides managers to improve the performance of their agencies performance in the entrepreneurial context is usually measured in output or results terms rather than in conformance to process regulations hence risktaking by managers to achieve improved performance is to some degree accepted and encouraged the evidence thus far available suggests that the new entrepreneurial management has resulted in improved management in many executive agencies on the other hand simply improving performance as was the case with the internal revenue service in the early 1990s has occasionally proven politically counterproductive to the agency if the improved performance in this case increased tax collections came at the apparent expense of other values such as due process of law the rapid ascendency of these new values in the united states has not been without challenge 20 and has continued the new governance new york oxford

executive branch the united states government manual 20062007 contains section titled quasi official agencies listing some four entities legal services corporation the smithsonian institution state justice institute and the united states institute of peace in prior years other entities have been accorded this designation for example the national railroad passenger corporation amtrak the national consumer cooperative bank and the national academy of sciences the category is something of catchall designation to include entities the national archives and records administration nara compilers of the manual find difficult to comfortably fit elsewhere insofar as nara provides defining characteristic for quasi official agencies it is that they are not agencies under the definition of 5 usc 105

be related to their legal status because they occupy realm between the private and the public quasi governmental entity may find it in its interest to assert its private or governmental status quasi official agencies like other elements of the quasi government may exist in wh at has been called the twilight zone between the governmental and private sectors22 this status while presumably permitting considerable autonomy from regular lines of accountability to managerial agencies eg the government accountability office is not as is often argued in their defense protection from political influences quasi official agencies like other forms of quasi governmental institutions may sometimes be highly political and subject to pressures not dissimilar to that encountered by regular executive agencies 23 continued public law management paradigm occupies good deal of the current public management literature see for example david osborne and ted gaebler reinventing

especially blurred with respect to category of organization known as government sponsored enterprises gse there is established criteria defining standards to be met prior to the establishment of gse nor is there listing of gses in the us code each gse is created sui generis with its attributes defined by congress in its enabling legislation for the purpose of budgetary treatment congress has defined the term governmentsponsored enterprise in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1990 to refer to corporate entity created by law of the united states that i has federal charter authorized by law ii is privately owned as evidenced by capital stock owned by private entities or individuals iii is under the direction of board of directors majority of which is elected by private owners iv is financial institution with power to i make loans or loan guarantees for limited purposes such as to provide credit for specific borrowers or one sector and ii raise funds by borrowing which does not carry the full faith and credit of the federal government or to guarantee the debt of others in unlimited amounts and b i does not exercise powers that are reserved to the government as sovereign such as the power to tax or to regulate interstate commerce ii does not have the power to commit the government financially but it may be recipient of loan guarantee commitment made by the government and iii has employees whose salaries and expenses are paid by the enterprise and are not federal employees subject to title 524 few scholars of public administration and finance are likely to argue that this definition is incorrect however some have argued that the above definition omits an essential characteristica gse benefits from an implicit federal guarantee to enhance its ability to borrow

enterprises on an equity basis there were some early instances of the federal government participating in otherwise private corporate enterprises on shared ownership basis most notably the first and second bank of the united states26 this practice came into question however as consequence of supreme court ruling in 181927 from that time to the present the federal government with few exceptions has consciously avoided shar ed ownership involvement with private nongovernmental entities congress created gses to help make credit more readily available to sectors of the economy believed to be disadvantaged in the credit markets28 there are presently five gses properly defined three of the gsesfederal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the federal agricultural mortgage corporation farmer macare investor owned the two othersthe federal home loan bank system and the farm credit systemare owned cooperatively by their borrowers in addition two institutionsthe financing corporation and the resolution funding corporationare governmental bodies that were given gse status so that their funding would not appear to be federal borrowing for purposes of the federal budget finally one wellknown gse sallie mae student loan marketing association has recently shed its gse status and become wholly private firm 29 defenders of the current gses and the economic concepts upon which they are based argue that gses continue to meet national need that would not otherwise be met or be met poorly by corporations fully in the private sector further they contend that the current gses are generally well managed financially sound and assist lessadvantaged mortgage borrowers they maintain that the subsidy retained from the presence of th federal implied guarantee of gse obligations is passed on to the consumer in the form of lower mortgage rates fannie mae in its national advertising campaign suggests that its special gse status is worth quarter of percent in mortgage interest and thus 400000 families are provided mortgages that would not otherwise be qualified to do so at fannie mae we have one job one mission one purpose to do whatever we can to lower the cost of home ownership30 contemporary gses are part of tradition of rcantilist financial institutions in that the government assigns them benefits and privileges in their charters that are not available to fully private corporations31 in return the government is able to limit the activities and lines of business 26 bray hammond banks and politics in america from the

the present gses are traceable in concept to several enterprises created during the great depression32 gses provide financial services such as issuing capital stock and short and long term debt instruments guaranteeing mortgagebacked securities mbs purchasing loans and holding them in their own portfolio funding activities eg subsidized mortgages in selected areas and collecting fees for guarantees and other services33 while the details may vary from one instance to th next congress provides that gses typically have four characteristics private ownership implicit federal guarantee of obligations activities limited by congressional charter and limited competition the economic rationale for gses is the belief that without such government sponsored institution critical area of necessary debt fina ncing would go unserved or would be serviced at an expensive or inefficient level government according to this rationale should use some of its sovereign powers eg full faith and credit of the us treasury to encourage the development of private financial intermediaries to serve selected markets in terms of meeting their original congressional objective that was to liquify the mortgage credit markets on national rather than regional or state basis the gses have been remarkably successful but with this success have come reservations and questions there is nothing modest about the size and scope of gses due to the implicit federal backing for their notes 34 gses have become some of the largest financial institutions in the united states in 2005 freddie mac reported outstanding debt of nearly 749 billion in 2003 fannie mae reported outstanding debt of approximately 962 billion35 meanwhile the federal home loan bank system reported 816 billion in consolidated debt outstanding in mid200436 two issues stand out when discussing the finances of gses safety and soundness and the utility and accountability resulting from their status as government instrumentality

earnings are exempt from state and local income taxes the latter practice attracting particular controversy38 they may borrow virtually unlimited amounts of money in the federal agency credit market on favorable terms and directly from the treasury at the latters discretion most importantly the credit market perceives this federal sponsorship as an implied federal guarantee of their corporate debt and obligations these factors enable gses to borrow monies at significantly lower interest rate than competitors reviewing these special privileges subsidies it is not surprising that some argue that gses grow rapidly at the expense of wouldbe competitors 39 despite their successes gses have faced operational turbulence in 1988 the federal government thought it prudent to authorize 8 billion of financial assistance for one insolvent gse the farm credit system also fannie mae was in trouble in the early 1980s when its capitalization dropped until the corporation had negative net worth of 11 billion these instances plus the sheer size and growth of putative unfunded liability upon the treasury has prompted some to be concerned about the risks gses pose to the political as well as economic system as early as 1991 thomas stanton voiced the opinion that such huge institutions represent an uncomforta ble concentration of risk if anything happens to management quality or prudence for example if fannie mae is again tempted to play the interestrate yield curve or if lowerquality management team took control of one of the enterprises the financial consequences could rival those of the thrift industry the federal government is clearly better protected if it diversifies this kind of risk 40 gses also have been accused of mission creep gao has questioned the housing gses for

significant accounting irregularities were discovered at both freddie mac and fannie mae both companies had to restate their earnings43 in response the 108th and 109th congresses held hearings and considered legislation that would fundamentally alter the regulations and regulatory agencies for overseeing gses44 the political accountability issues raised by gses hybrid character resist generalization gses are instrumentalities not agencies of the united states and this distinction is both legally and administratively important the federal governments control over an institution differs significantly depending upon whether that institution is an agency or instrumentality an agency as defined in title 5 is managed directly through the federal management hierarchy as general rule an agency is subject to all general management laws and regulations provided in the us code unless exempted from such coverage in either its enabling statute or by virtue of being part of an exempted class of agency thus an agency is subject to federal appointment of its senior officers often requiring senate confirmation to civil service and federal procurement laws and to the federal budget and other direct federal management controls unless exempted an instrumentality of government on the other nd is privatelyowned institution not subject to any of the general management laws and regulation unless so indicated in its enabling legislation charter an instrumentality is assigned in its charter limited prerogatives eg immunity from state taxation normally associated with the governments sovereign authority in return for this limited assignment of governmental powers an instrumentality cannot on its own authority alter the charter or conduct activities co ntrary to the intent of the charter gse is supervised but not directly managed by the federal government primary accountability of gse management is not to the federal government or to the borrowers but to the corporations shareholders investors come first as sallie maes thenchief executive officer told senate oversight subcommittee some years ago we are private corporation and as such with stockholders and bondholders we have fiduciary responsibility to those individuals we are not charged with subsidizing the guaranteed student loan program or subsidizing the students 45 the accountability issue for

one category of organization in the quasi government is largely world war ii and immediate postwar phenomenon the federally funded research and development center ffrdc 47 the ffrdc is hybrid

and put to work national laboratories such as those at oak ridge and alamos were created to be government owned but operated by nonfederal organizations which were not fettered by civil service rules or most general management laws under wartime conditions these governmentowned contractor operated goco facilities worked quite well immediately after the war th new department of defense and particularly the air force was reluctant to part with this talent base they had assembled and sought ways and means to keep them in service to the government the decision was to establish some private nonprofit corporations to do contract work for the armed services these corporations would be solely or largely dependent upon the federal government contracted projects the first ffrdc was rand created by the air force in california in 194748 this pioneer was followed over the years by such wellknown ff rdcs as mitre corporation aerospace and the institute for defense analyses of the 37

activities that inappropriately mix public funds and private interests critics see favoritism when ffrdcs receive large contracts without competitive bidding critics have also pointed to the interflow of personnel between government agencies ffrdcs and companies that work for ffrdcs critics say there is revolving door between these entities and they decry interlocking directorships that arise such as when former secretary of defens took board positions at rand and general dynamics corp52 this latter charge is particularly significant because ffrdcs are supposed to be expertisebased organizations that are to impartially oversee the use of federal funds that are to advance governmental purpose the great strength of ffrdcs appears to lie in th eir flexibility to assemble teams of technical experts on project basis high on the list of positive results supporters claim for ffrdcs is their ability to promote technology transfers between the governmental and private sectors the knowledge base created by the agencies use of ffrdcs often serves as foundation for commercially relevant efforts in the private sector the us many contend is not as effective as other nations in taking the results of basic research and transforming them into commercially viable products to be sold in world markets 53 ffrdcs are intended to promote and facilitate this transfer and development process congress has been interested in ffrdcs almost from their inception some in congress have viewed the ffrdcs as means to circumvent civ il service hiring practices and salary limitations while they operate as nonprofit entities ffrdcs can be substantial source of revenue for associations and contractors and there have been problems with conflict of interest issues54 ffrdcs are often difficult to hold accountable they can have an advantage in competing with private firms for contracts as nonprofit corporations they are exempt from most taxation their facilities and equipment are owned or financed for the most part by the federal government and they receive fees for operating expenses without having to assume business risks or costs associated with competing for most federal work questions by congress have led to hearings warnings and some changes in law eg competition in contracting act of 1984 98 stat 1175 that reduced the scope of contract work available to ffrdcs making more outsourced work available to competitive contracting also congress has limited the power of the secretaries of defense army navy airforce and the heads of some other agencies to create ffrdcs 10 usc 2367 unusual and sensitive issues of conflict of inte rest may be present with ffrdcs particularly when ffrdc is an affiliate of nonffrdc co rporation ffrdcs often have privileged access to government information plans data employees and facilities which may be difficult to insulate from private partners involved in forprofit activities critics maintain that unbiased advice may also be difficult to provide when the future or fate of the advising ffrdc may be adversely affected 52 steven pearlstein reining in pentagons think tanks washington post july 28 1991 p h1 53 crs report

represents an attempt to classify under one heading number of different types of organizations that share one characteristic legal relationship with department or agency of the federal government these relations may differ greatly from one situation and organization to the next to assist our review however nonprofit organizations with legal relationships to departments and agencies will be considered under three categories 1 adjunct organizations under the control of department or agency 2 organizations independent of but dependent upon departments and agencies and 3 nonprofit organizations voluntarily affiliated with departments and agencies generally the latter category of organizations are established under state or district of columbia law these three categories are not pure by any means while these distinctions have an arbitrary character imposed after the fact there is nonetheless some utility in beginning the review of the agencyrelated nonprofit organization category within the quasi government as being of three essential types

there are at this point an indeterminate number of organizations under the control of department or agency this review must therefore be illustrative rather than comprehensive nonetheless survey of several such departmental or agency controlled organizations facilitates an understanding of the scope and nature of such organizations the department of agriculture makes extensive use of adjunct organizations congress has chartered through statute at least 17 agricultural commodity organizations eg national pork board national dairy promo tion and research board 55 these entities engage in the generic promotion of research on and information activities for agricultural commodities thereby it is hoped increasing the total market for commodity separate from the promotion of any specific brand name of that commodity the secretary of agriculture is assigned varying degrees of authority over these boards individually in an effort to make uniform the oversight of such boards and the processes for creating additional boards congress passed the commodity promotion research and information ac t of 1996 pl 104127 7 usc 7411 the law permits the secretary to establish new commodity organizations usually referred to as boards or councils under departmental or ders the commodity promotion act of 1996 is similar to general incorporation act containing specific provisions to be included in the individual charters approved by the secretary the provisions in the act respecting the annual activities and budget of the boards illustrate the type and level of secretarial and agency involvement with the boards 55 crs report 95353 federal farm promotion checkoff programs by geoffrey s becker

fiscal year b reimbursement of secretaryeach order shall require that the secretary be reimbursed for all expenses incurred by the secretary in the implementation administration and supervision of the order including all referenda costs incurred in connection with the order the concept behind these independent boards and councils is to encourage the commodity interests themselves to organize and propose to the secretary that such an organization be chartered to promote product eg milk generically rather then by brandname these boards and councils are authorized by law to finance their activities by collecting assessments from members according to rate structure that has received the approval of the secretary once producer is in one of the commodity promotion orga nizations however it is difficult to withdraw or ignore the assessments 56 the element of private influence and ultimate participation in these hybrid organizations resides in an elaborate process of referenda as practical matter the commodity promotion organizations are under the supervision of the agricultural marketing service ams relatively small unit within the department the referendum provisions of the 1996 act are detailed the boards are not established in perpetuity but must be subject to renewal referenda later than seven years after assessments first begin even the definition of majority is complex for instance the referendum majority provides secretarial order may provide for its approval in referendum1 by majority of those persons voting 2 by persons voting for approval who represent majority of the volume of the agricultural commodity or 3 by majority of those persons voting for approval who also represent majority of the volume of the agricultural commodity advance registration procedures are spelled out in the law thereby requiring subsequent changes to also be made by law finally it is the ams that is charged with helping the boards administer the referendum process

report issued in december 1999 called for implementation of 21 recommendations all of which thensecretary dan glickman endorsed proposed changes were submitted to the federal register for public comment on december 17 1999 but as of spring 2005 have not been formally adopted59 some of the agricultural advertising checkoff programs have also faced court challenges small farmers providing boutique products have sued the department of agriculture claiming the fees were government compelled speecha violation of the first amendment of the us constitution in some of these cases the plaintiffs have won60 over the years departments and agencies have fo und it useful and advantageous to ask congress to create or authorize department to create nonprofit organizations to perform functions that the department itself finds difficult to integrate into its regular policy and financial processes this is true for example when department or agency receives gifts of real property and monetary gifts the national park foundation is the most prominent example of such an organization but there are others such as the national fish and wildlife foundation the department of the interior and especially the national park service received gifts of land and monies from time to time to promote the programs of the department with respect to the national park service nps national park trust fund was established by congress in 1935 to receive and hold such gifts in 1967 the trust was superseded by the national park foundation npf established pursuant to law 81 stat 656 16 usc 19e19n the npf is congressionally chartered nonprofit corporation organized to accept and administer gifts given to the nps the board of the npf has as its members the secretary of the interior the director of the nps exofficio and less than six private citizens appointed by the secretary in recent years the board has had more than 20 members the term for private citizens on the board is six years the secretary of the interior is chairman of the board and the director of nps is secretary to the board the board elects president of the foundation who serves at its pleasure membership on the board is not deemed to be an office of the united states the npf has perpetual succession funding for the npf comes from private gifts one of the main initial purposes of the foundation was to permit the nps to have means whereby it might receive gifts and invest these funds in something other than federal government securities the foundation is not onbudget and its employees are not federal employees in 2005 the npf provided over 29 million in cash and in kind support to the national park service 61 58 sharon walsh government oversight usda asks the promotion programs have been criticized for

finally the situation of the securities and exchange commission sec and its two adjunct organizations is worth noting congress established the securities investor protection corporation sipc in 1970

nonprofit act which provides that it shall not be an agency or establishment of the united states government of the sevenmember board of directors one is appointed by the secretary of the treasury from among the departments officers and employees one is appointed by members of the federal reserve board from among its officers and employees five directors are appointed by the president subject to the advice and consent of the senate the president designates the chairman who is also the corporations chief executive officer although the sipc is nonprofit corporation under th dc law it is effectively subsidiary of the sec the corporations bylaws are subject to the secs adoption amendment or rejection the hybrid nature of the sipc is revealed by various legal characteristics the sipc is not under any of the general management laws including the government corporation control act 31 usc 9102 however to the extent that the bylaws and rules of the sipc are approved or disapproved by the sec they are subject to the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq the corporation also has borrowing authority and line of credit from the treasury congress in 2002 established the public co mpany accounting oversight board pcaob 116 stat 745 to oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to securities laws the board is also nonprofit corporation under the dc nonprofit corporation act officers of the board are not officers of the united states yet the board is required under supervision of the sec to establish or adopt or both by rule auditing quality control ethics independence and other standards relating to the preparation of audit reports by issuers the sec appoints the five members of the fulltime board after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the secretary of the treasury the commission may remove members of the board for good cause the rules of the board are subject to the approval of the commission some observers were tr oubled that at the organizing meeting of this private board on january 9 2003 the board voted themselves annual salaries of 452000 or 52000 more than the president of the united states and 207000 more than the chairman of the sec similar private sector salaries were set for staff 62 the stories of the sipc and the pcaob illustra how the government can create hybrid organization in these instances organizations with predominately privatesector legal characteristics to implement government policies and regulations ultimately the spic and the pcaob are agents of and accountable to the government through the sec the wisdom and for some the legality of this practice of delegating governmental functions to ostensibly private parties is legitimate subject of

private sources the foundation serves vital function by facilitating collaborative relationships between private industry academia and military medicine one way we do this is securing private funding

to include in its program encouraging the creation of park partners 1 standard adaptable organizational design format to establish and sustain responsible management of local nonprofit support

encompasses more narrowly defined enterprise funds and investment funds71 the fall of communism in eastern europe and elsewhere in 1989 prompted interest by the united states and especially congress in assisting those nations committed to transition from centrally planned to market economy the support for eastern european democracy act of 1990 seed pl 101179 22 usc 5401 authoriz ed the establishment of two enterprise funds one in poland and the other in hungary later the legislation was amended to authorize the creation of enterprise funds in other eastern european countries including the republics of the former soviet union and the southern africa region by the end of 1995 there were 11 such funds the impetus for the enterprise fund concept came about from the belief that nongovernmental entity was needed to implement this kind of pr ogram the intent of congress in seed was to create venture capital funds that would be design ed along private sector lines managed by private sector executives and be free of most government administrative constraints the enterprise funds are chartered as private nonprofit corporations under the laws of the state of delaware but are funded by government appropriations their purpose is to develop the respective national private sectors through loans grants equity investments feasibility studies technical assistance training insurance guarantees and other measures further the act states that funding for the enterprises shall be made available and used for the purposes of this section notwithstanding any other provision of law 22 usca 5421ac the seed coordinator in the department of state and aids general counsel and inspector general interpreted this notwithstanding clause as exempting the funds from customary us assistance program regulations at the same time as the enterprise funds were being established the overseas private investment corporation opic wholly owne d federal government corporation 72 was itself becoming involved in promoting private investments throug h investment funds established in the former communist states opics principal mission is to provide political risk insurance and loan guarantees to us corporations that make investments in selected developing countries although opic is prohibited from making direct equity investments it may achieve approximately the same results by

committed as of fy2005 over 26 billion in funding to 32 private equity funds 73 in the case of both the enterprise funds and opics investment funds the intent was to have pool of money to be assigned

it was the intention of congress that executive branch oversight of the funds be limited hands off policy initially state department and aid oversight of the enterprise funds consisted principally of an annual review by the aid ig audits performed by certified public accounting firms selected by the enterprises monthly reports on grant cash balances semiannual reviews of the investment portfolios and brief visits to both the us and overseas fund offices various news accounts of alleged excesses and failures of the funds prompted both congress and the executive branch however to subsequently strengthen the oversight of aid although the funds still retain most of their autonomy 75 enterprise funds are chartered as nonprofit corporations under the laws of the state of delaware and are governed by board of directors designated by the president of the united states and elected by the existing board members they are not officers of the united states and hence are not subject to senate confirmation the directors must be citizens of the united states or of the host country or countries and can be designated only after consulting with the leaders of each house of congress 22 usc 5421a1 although congress and the existing directors have role to play in the selection process the reality is that this process has largely become presidential prerogative and according to critics involves certain amount of presidential patronage contractors are selected to manage the funds in the name of the boards thus the determination of which firm ultimately receives the capital is made by third and occasionally fourth parties in the latter instances the enterprise fund establishes subsidiary to make the final loan or grant determinations the key element for protecting the governments inte rests in the enterprise funds is to be found in the provisions agreed to in the loan or grant once in operation it is difficult for aid to alter the course of the enterprise fund although there remain several negative controls available such as suspension of funds in practice however such controls may be difficult to implement 76 the opic investment funds are not in the business of directly providing capital themselves rather they provide guarantees to private lenders who in turn lend money to recipients opic is government corporation enumerated in the government corporation control act and as such is regular agency of the united states subject to the general management laws except where exempted it is governed by 15member board of directors number that includes in an ex officio capacity various senior presidential appointees as well as seven direct presidential appointees 22 usc 2193b the board is chaired by the administrator of aid it is the president who appoints opics president subject to senate confirmation congress requires opic to undergo annual budgetary review and the office is sometimes criticized on the basis that its insurance programs amount to subsidy to

able to keep relatively close oversight of its investment funds through its active role in selecting fund management and in negotiating terms of the loan guaranty agreements terms that generally provide for favorable returns to opic the objective of opics investment fund oversight is to insure compliance with the loan agreement not necessarily to review or evaluate the funds investments in terms of good economic returns thus compliance rather than performance is the primary focus of opics fund oversight in reviewing the comparative experience of enterprise and investment funds as part of larger national venture capital promotion exercise koppell concludes that the federal government has the best opportunity to maintain modicum of accountability over these institutions through enforcement of regulatory practices rather th an attempting to run these quasi governmental bodies through direct administrative means koppel does not award the board of directors concept high marks as an effective method to promote accountability 78 the issue of tenure is pertinent to venture capital funds are they intended to be permanent or temporary although congress did not address this question directly with respect to enterprise funds it was generally viewed that they would be temporary arrangement the length of time that each venture fund exists would depend on the specific country circumstances for example in september 2001 the polishamerican enterprise fund paef returned 120 million of its assets to the us treasury and transferred 180 million of its assets to the newly created polish american freedom foundationan entity which had previously received 80 million from paef the funds are to be used to provide grants to promote economic reform leadership development

within the quasi government category of entities can be collectively identified as congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations also referred to popularly as title 36 corporations 83 the chartering by congress of private organizations with patriotic charitable historical or educational purpose is essentially 20th century practice there are 92 organizations listed under subtitle ii patriotic and national organizations84 typical among these chartered organizations is the agricultural hall of fame big brothers and sisters of america and the american legion congress has authority to establish organizations within both the governmental and private sectors in the governmental sector the authority and responsibility to establish all agencies and all offices to be filled by appointed officers of the united states is clear the actions of all agencies and officers of the united states are determined by public law congress also has authority to charter establish new private corporations both forprofit and nonprofit while congress has exercised its prerogatives to charter forprofit corporations infrequently there have nevertheless been several important instances such as the establishment of the fully private stockholderowned communications satellite corporation comsat in 1962 76 stat 419 47 usc 701 much more frequently congress has chartered nonprofit organizations either in the first instance or as rechartering of an existing state chartered nonprofit organization title 36 corporations can and generally do function simultaneously under both federal and state charters indeed in most instances organizations were chartered and functioned under state laws before often long before receiving federal charters congressional authority with respect to organizations functioning essentially under state law however has not been free of controversy the basis of the controversy often comes down to fundamental issues of managerial accountability fiduciary

and credit of the united states treasury85 in chartering patriotic charitable and professional organizations under subtitle ii such as the national academy of public administration 36 usc 1501 congress does not make these organizations agencies of the united states nor does it confer any powers of governmental character or assign any benefits these organizations do not receive direct appropriations they exercise federal powers their debts are not covered by the full faith and credit of the united states and they do not enjoy original jurisdiction in the federal courts in effect the federal chartering process is honorific in character this honorific character may be misleading to the public however when such organizations feature statements or display logos that they are chartered by congress thus implying direct relationship to the federal government that does not in fact exist in addition there may be an implication that congress approves of the organizations and is somehow overseeing their activities which is not the case recently the nonagency character of title 36 corporations may have been breached the privatization of the defense departments civilian marksmanship program and its assignment to newly created title 36 corporation the corporation for the promotion of rifle practice and firearms safety 36 usc 407 raises questions about the limits if any to congress authority to assign private label to functions of governmental character 86 while the corporation has some admittedly governmental attributes eg upon the dissolution of the corporation its assets would be sold and the proceeds revert to the us treasury congress has declared in its enabling statute that the corporation is private corpora tion not department agency or instrumentality

states government and thus is not subject to constitutional provisions governing freedom of speech the court decided that while congress can determine amtraks governmental status for purposes within

title 36 presumably perceive value behind such charters and indeed such may be the case less apparent however are possible risks that might result from private nonprofit organizations of having such charter chartered private organization may lose some of its private rights and be made subject to management laws and regulations generally applicable only to agencies of the united states such situation came about in 1997 when congress amended the federal advisory committee act 5 usc appendix 86 stat 700 so as to include two title 36 corporations the national academy of public administration and the national academy of sciences under specific provisions involving the appointment permissible activities and reports of corporation committees doing work for executive agencies pl 105153 this is the first instance in which congress has made title 36 subtitle ii corporations subject to the provisions of general management law and while the action may be supportable on public policy grounds it does to the extent of applicable provisions diminish the private character of the affected organizations as such it constitutes precedent with implications congress and the president have raised questions in the past about the consequences of granting charters to private organizations in vetoing corporate charter in 1965 the president raised several questions about the wisdom of continuing to grant charters on casebycase basis without the benefit of clearly established criteria as to eligibility 88 congress in 1969 responded to this presidential concern by setting out five minimum standards to be met by private organization seeking federal charter from congress89 these standards however did not resolve all of the questions concern the process of granting charter or of overseeing nonprofit organizations at present federal supervision of congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations is limited90 all private corporations established under federal law as defined and listed in subtitle ii are required to have independent audits annually and to have the reports of the audits submitted to congress 36 usc 1010191 in practice the house subcommittee on immigration and claims receives the audit reports of listed corporations and where corporations have not submitted reports in timely manner makes every effort to communicate with said organizations and remind them of their legal responsibility the house judiciary committee refers all received audits to the government accountability office for review 92 the committees current role is strictly ministerial

it the senate judiciary committee has tended to defer to the house committee on these matters it is not the intention of the judiciary committees of congress or the general accounting office to look over the shoulder of these organizations or to conduct audits on their own authority congress is understandably ambivalent with respect to chartered organizations it attempts to protect the public interest against abuse by these corporate bodies while simultaneously seeking to limit its involvement in the internal affairs of these private organizations thus far in instance has the charter of title 36 organization been revoked or placed at serious risk through noncompliance with reporting requirements hearings held by subcommittees of the respective judiciary committees of the house and senate in the early 1970s raised number of questions by members of congress respecting the intent and practice of congressional chartering of private nonprofit organizations more organizations through sympathetic members of congress were requesting charters and the requesting organizations were often extending the definition of congressional chartered corporations beyond that typically associated with patriotic and service organizations in april 1992 house subcommittee on immigration and claims chairman barney frank announced that the subcommittee would longer consider requests for charters the reason frank reportedly said was that the charters were nuisance meaningless act granting charters implied that congress was exercising some sort of supervision over the groups and it was not when i first raised the issue what is federal charter the answer was federal charter is federal charter is federal charter you could make up an organization for the preservation of albert salvo the boston strangler wed have way of checking into it 93 continuing to review applications on the basis of merit with the possibility of rejection it was asserted was subjecting the subcommittee to pressures and the potential for embarrassment to both the requester and congress by indicating an end altogether of the practice of chartering it was hoped the subcommittee would be leveling the playing field among worthy organizations this view was formalized in the 104th congress when the subcommittee issued an internal policy directive that it would longer consider any legislation to grant new federal charters because such charters were unnecessary for the operations of any charitable nonprofit organization and falsely implied to the public that chartered organization and its activities somehow enjoyed congressional approval this subcommittee moratorium did not however stop all requests for or consideration of charter requests notably it remains possible for another committee or for the full congress in its plenary capacity to charter nonprofit organizations and have them listed in title 36 this has happened in at least six instances in recent years nonetheless in the 109 th congress the subcommittee on immigration borders and claims reasserted the moratorium on march 10 200594 it remains to be seen however how effective this moratorium will be against the many attractions of the

1983 the reagan administration requested congress to pass legislation for project democracy to promote and support the building of democratic institutions abroad especially in countries newly emergent from totalitarian or dictatorial rule although the specific administration proposal was not adopted congress did enact legislation that included approval for creating national endowment for democr acy ned or endowment the ned proposal was included in title v of the state department authorization act fy1984 and fy1985 pl 98 164 22 usc 4411 the national endowment for democracy act reads the congress finds that there has been established in the district of columbia private nonprofit corporation known as the national endowment for democracy which is not an agency or establishment of the united states 4411a the purpose of ned is to encourag the development of free and democratic institutions throughout the world using the two major american political parties and labor and business organizations as the tools for promoting this policy although the law did not specify the creation of grantee organizations it was generally understood at the time that four core organizations representing the two major political parties american labor organizations and american busi ness organizations would be created as private nonprofit organizations the ned would not conduct democracy programs itself but would rely on core grantees grantees include the national democratic institute of international affairs ndi the international republican institute iri the american center for international labor solidarity acils 98 and the center for international private enterprise cipe which is affiliated with the us chamber of commerce the rationale given for creating hybrid status for the endowment was that for ned to support democracy building programs especially in inhospitable countries countries where the us is banned by law from providing direct foreign aid such as the peoples republic of china and myanmar burma it must not be viewed as an arm of the us government additionally the core grantee organizations are one step further removed from the government and thus provide fourthparty administration of the infrastructure promotion system the endowment was envisioned principally as conduit for funds to the grantee organizations but has developed on its own network for funding of other private organizations under the bylaws of the organization as registered in the district of columbia ned has board of officers and directors which has ranged over time between 13 and 30 members the number 98 the american council for international labor solidarity an organization created in 1997 was the result of the merger of the free trade union institute and three othe r aflcio

endowment in 1983 the current chairman of the board of directors is vin weber former member of congress funding of ned is provided by an earmarked appropriation in the commerce justice state appropriations act whereby the department of state awards these funds to ned the total ned appropriation for fy2006 was 75 million pl 109108 title iv 119 stat 2325 while the ned considers itself to be private it must be managed under requirements of several general management laws for instance the endowme nt must comply with the provisions of the freedom of information act 100 also while the accounts of the endowment are audited by independent firms they are subject to review and may be audited by the government accountability office there has been debate in congress over whether the united states government should be funding these types of organizations to promote democracy the arguments pro and necessarily impact ned as well as its core grantee organizations from the perspective of the quasi government ned is classic example of hy brid organization functioning under both private and public law there is range of opinion as to whether such hybrid arrangement is necessary to achieve the results intended by the lawmakers 101 furthermore critics have accused ned of mission creep and asserted that ned has been associated with efforts to influence the outcomes of ostensibly democratic elections102 g23g495g21g495g561g11g151g159g142g156g157g146g144g138g157g146g152g151g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g156g561 as part of vice president gores reinvention program substantial downsizing of the civil service was ordered103 agencies were expected to be creative in making sure the work continued to be done but with less personnel and less funds cuts in the mission capacity funding and personnel of the central manageme nt agencies ie office of management and budget general services administration and office of personnel management were particularly significant at opm the security and investigations unit of the agency was potential target for downsizing because its securities clearance workload was declining due to the end of the cold war and because there were fewer new hires generally throughout the executive branch the director of opm james king created first the establishment by the government of private corporation whose employ ees would be persons transferred from federal agency the federal investigations division of opm to private firm to be eventually owned by its 99 website of the national endowment for democracy available at

stated rationale was that it would save the jobs of the approximately 700 investigators who would longer be needed and that it would save the federal government money by contracting with this new corporate body the investigations formerly performed inhouse director king of opm let contract to esop advisors inc for feasibility study of the concept study that reported that the privatization process culminating in an esop was feasible king then announced his intention to move forward rapidly two hearings were held by congressional committees 105 the principal points argued by the opposition dealt with civil rights and privacy issues associated with private parties conducting and storing sensitive investigatory reports and the propriety and legality of having government agencies creating privately owned corporations with special financially advantageous relations with the sponsoring agency to the surprise of some opm however determined to move on its own initiative and without explicit statutory authority 106 to launch the corporation opm choose american capital strategies acs to develop business plan acs selected marine midland bank of new york as financial trustee and together with washington law firm arnold and porter began to recruit management team they selected with kings agreement philip harper former security industry official to take the first step incorporating the company to be known as the us investigation service usis under the laws of the state of delaware in april 1996 the corporation at this point had single share and single employeeharper107 the corporation was reincorporated in august 1996 at which time the 700 former office of federal investigations employees were separated from the government and became private employees in april 1997 it was reported the 700 employeeshareholders own about 91 percent of company valued at 282 million harper and the other 11 company officers who together put up an initial sevenfigure investment hold the remaining shares der the terms of its corporate charter usis is governed by ninemember board of directors the boards five inside members include harper and two others elected by employees the three of them in turn nominate the two remaining members however as with most private companies the boards role is limited it does not run usisthats harpers job along with his immediate staffinstead concerning itself strictly with ownership issues like ov ersight for example it ensures that company resources are allocated in the best interests of employee shareholders and

you begin business with the federal government as guaranteed customer108 opm then awarded usis noncompetitive threeyear contract under public interest exemption in federal contracting law109 it was reported that the opm employees would not have moved to the new private corporation without guaranteed solesource contract providing modicum of security usis has free access to government computer databases not otherwise available to the public or possible competing corporations by any account this government sponsored private corporation was given advantages and incentives not available to other private startup corporations110 critics of usis and the privatization process followed in its creation tend to argue that background investigations are an inherently governmental function to be conducted by regular federal employees operating under all government management and security protection laws they believe that legal accountability should be direct up through the agency departmental and central management agency line to the president and through the president to congress from their point of view policy considerations such as seeking to find jobs for otherwise underutilized or redundant employees seeking lower unit costs and the desirability of profitability for governmental activities while of academic and political interest are essentially not relevant as justifications for creating and supporting this hybrid organization the critics argue that not all personnel investigations are alike and assert that the needs and requirements of the government and indirectly of the public giving information to the government are distinctive in legal terms from those applicable in the private sector in their view the issues are not economic in their fundamentals but constitutional and legal moreover the question arises if opm is free to transfer portion of its workload and employees to the private sector may other agencies do likewise the clinton administration and supporters of opms decision to privatize this activity saw on the other hand in the usis experience creative response to changing situation regarding government agency and its activities this perspective views usis as successful exercise one with lessons to be applied in other situations usiss moves into the private sector market including extensive contracts with the casino industry were seen as the logical progression of generic activity personnel investigations the more recent activities of usis have raised new questions as to the appropriateness of the privatization process and the mixing of the governmental and private sectors exactly which assets were transferred to the usis in the first place is not clear but whatever they were was deemed to be worth 28 million the inadequacy of this figure became apparent as the carlyle group soon was able to purchase substantial block of shares its purchase of shares in usis appears to have been wise timely and fortuitous because the now private corporation underwent an incredible surge in business in 1999 alone the share value increased 702 percent 111 108 ibid 109 stephen barr opm in first acts to convert an operation into private

stowe purchased the stock owned by original esop employees for reported 545 million112 this brief description of usis concludes this selective review of entities within the quasi government each category and entry has certain general characteristics worth noting as well as distinctive features what is evident from this review is that certain basic philosophical issues are being debated occasionally in direct terms but more often indirectly through the process of reorganization of the executive branch this process is taking two forms the reorganization of departments into agencies with agencyspecific management laws 113 and the assignment of agencies and functions both new and existing to entities outside the executive branch to the quasi government discussed in this report this process has not been without its consequences for both the institutional presidency and congress

government organizational option can be traced to an innate desire of or ganizational leadership both governmental and private sector to seek maximum autonomy in matters of policy and operations 114 with respect to the governmental sector however this natural centrifugal thrust of organizational management has been historically held in check by set of strong counter or centralizing forces the constitutional paradigm model of manageme nt was and remains based on laws and accountability structures the president is chief manager of the executive branch and manages through the appointment of officers the administration of general management laws and the budgetary process the highest value in this public law model of management is political accountability for the exercise of governmental power 115 unitary executive structure coupled with hierarchical lines of authority and accountability was theoretical product of the founding fathers the president was viewed as the chief manager of the administrative system the governmental and pr ivate sector cooperated but were kept legally distinct in the interests of protecting citizens rights against potentially arbitrary government116 institutions not in the executive branch but partaking of the attributes of governmental status were looked upon with suspicion as aberrations breaching the constitutional wall between the governmental and private sectors these management values however were challenged in the 112 stephen barr for oncefederal background investigator privatization leads to its own kind of check washington post apr 24 2003 p b2 113 an example of the disaggregation of the management authorities in the executive branch is provided by the current exercise of excluding the department of defense department of homeland security and other select agencies eg federal aviation administration from most elements of title v government organization and employees of the us code 114 there is persistent universal drive in the executive establishment for freedom from managerial control and policy direction the desire for autonomy characterizes the operating administration and bureaus as one observer has remarked every agency wishes to be outside departmental structure or in the executive office of the president this desire for independence is an apparently innate characteristic of administrative

academia and found expression in the election of political leaders here and abroad committed to market principles the underlying premise of the entrepreneurial management paradigm is that the governmental and private sectors are essentially alike in the fundamentals and thus subject to many of the same economically derived behavioral norms117 the supporters of this position promoted their values and concepts of management internationally under the rubric of new public management npm and domestically as part of the national performance review npr 118 skeptics of the new entrepreneurial management paradigm say the centrality of public law is displaced by the centrality of economic axioms the focus of management once the citizen is now the customer and departmental integration as the norm is replaced by agency dispersion and managerial autonomy they see political accountability and due process being superseded by the primacy of performance and results however defined critics believe that the historic wall between the governmental and private sectors is being breached not merely as managerial convenience but as matter of policy so rather than wall government entrepreneurs are forging web of publicprivate partnerships given the great differences between the basic prem ises guiding the two schools of thought those favoring traditional public law principles versus those favoring entrepreneurial approaches it is not surprising that their attitudes towards the quasi government are also at odds those advocating entrepreneurial management tend to place high value on managerial flexibility and the setting of numerical performance standards many are opposed in principle to hierarchical leadership structures and emphasize the desirability of change and managerial risktaking this set of values with respect to governmental management makes the hybrid organization within the quasi government an attractive option those favoring the public law approach to management on the other hand argue that the purpose of government management is to implement the laws passed by congress not necessarily to maximize performance or to satisfy customers while accountability and effective performance are generally compatible objectives in those unusual instances where these values come into conflict they believe that the democratic value of political accountability should take precedence over the managerial value of maximizing effi ciency and outcomes many of the public law advocates not unexpectedly tend to see quasi governmental entities as instruments of relatively small constituencies whose interests are promoted over the interests of the whole people as represented in their democratic institutions thus they often oppose such quasi governmental hybrid entities as gses because they believe those who benefit shareholders and management are separate and apart from those who stand at risk the taxpayers supporters of performance based criteria for government management stress the need for flexibility competition and performance as desirable goals the preeminence of these values in their view provides the critical elements in developing creative and successful management in this respect therefore many believe that the quasi government is where much of the future lies away from what they characterize as the stulti fying impact of alleged micromanagement both congressional and executive general management laws eg personnel regulations and 117 barry bozeman ed public management the state of the art san francisco

can do whatever is not forbidden to do by law thus providing the basis for innovation and partnerships accountability will be for performance however it may be defined and measured rather than to strict conformance to law in the new entrepreneurial management paradigm success proponents say will be measured by polling the customers on their trust and satisfaction of the delivery of governmental services thus the emergence and growth of the quasi government can be viewed as either symptom of decline in our democratic system of governance or as harbinger of new creative management era where the principles of market behavior are harnessed for the general wellbeing of the nation119 one thing is for sure however debate between the competing management paradigms is over important issues such as the legitimacy and utility of the quasi government and is likely to continue into the foreseeable future
