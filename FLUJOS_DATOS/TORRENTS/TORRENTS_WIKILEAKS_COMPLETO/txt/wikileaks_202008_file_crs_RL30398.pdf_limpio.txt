treaty organization nato launched operation allied force the first combined military action in the alliances 50year history in an effort to halt the yugoslav governments brutal monthslong ethnic cleansing campaign against ethnic albanians in kosovo province nato aircraft struck military targets in all regions of the countryserbia kosovo voivodina and montenegro1 when belgrade finally capitulated and the air war was halted 78 days later nato aircraft had flown more than 37000 sorties of which 23000 or 62 were made by american aircraft the us department of defense also stated that us planes flew the majority of intelligence 79 and support 65 missions for the kosovo operation2 nato as an organization did not pay for operation allied force that is the costs incurred were not financed by the alliances three common budgets3 as has been the case in nato exercises over the past five decades each country that participated in operation allied force was responsible for the expense of equipping and employing its own armed forces in other words those costs were paid for by the national budgets of member states operati on allied force was predominately an air operation with some naval support because the alliance wished to minimize civilian casualties nato preferred to use hightech precisionguided ordnance including cruise missiles and socalled smart bombs since the united states is the only alliance nation that possesses significant stockpiles of such weapons most of which are far more expensive than conventional gravity bombs us aircraft conducted the majority of the attack sortieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30398crs2 4some analysts argue that this imbalance in technological capabilities is result of the large disparity between the amount of funds that the united states and europe devote to research and development and are concern ed that it may lead to or in effect already constitutes twotiered alliance of powers of greater and lesser capabilities for

information gleaned from us intelligence sources4 given this extensive use of us military resources many us policymakers have raised the issue of allied burdensharing indeed some observers speculate that the manner in which the allies shares costs for the kosovo operation in its entirety may affect future european security issues such as the next round of nato enlargement5 the purpose of the air attacks in the former yugoslavia was not simply to inflict unacceptable losses on the enemy and compel surrender instead the cessation of hostilities was made contingent upon serbian agreement to several interrelated political conditions in early may while the bombing campaign was still underway the g8 group of leading industrial states canada france germany italy japan the united kingdom and the united states plus russia agreed upon several objectives an end to serb military actions in kosovo the withdrawal of serb forces from kosovo the insertion of unapproved peacekeeping contingent unapproved interim international administration of the province refugee repatriation and safe access for aid organizations and economic redevelopm ent as well as degree of autonomy for kosovo within the former yugoslavia the kosovo crisis therefore has had several components both military and non military in addition to allied force allied armed forces participated in two other major efforts operation allied harbor aid to kosovar refugees in macedonia and albania and operation joint guardian peacekeeping operations in kosovo also known by the acronym kfor nonmilitary undertakings also have encompassed wide range of activities including humanitarian aid refugee assistance institution building training in the general areas of justice and governance and reconstruction some members of congress have voiced concern that the large us outlays for kosovo are diverting funding from armed forces readiness and equipment procurement many have adamantly stated that europe should assume greater share of costs for subsequent operations the clinton administration has announced its agreement with this principle secretary of state madeleine albright indicated in early june that europe should pay the majority of reconstruction costs and in speech on june 10 president clinton said that our european partners must provide most of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30398crs3 6address to the

to the united states congress by the secretary of defense march 1999 httpwwwdefenselinkmilpubsallied_contrib99tochtmlresources for restoring peace in kosovo6 and the nato allies appear to concur the washington post in june reported that european leaders embarrassed by us domination of the air war and the fact that the united states again took the lead in quelling european conflict vowed to carry their share of the burden in bringing program of reconstruction to kosovo and the rest of the balkans7 this crs report accordingly examines the question of burdensharing based upon total contributions to meeting the international communitys policy objectives in kosovo it considers not only outlays for military actions but also expenditures for humanitarian and redevelop ment assistance this is consonant with recent approaches to defense burdensharing over the past decade the term security has been redefined to encompass more than simply military matters many policymakers now accept the thesis that national and regional security may be enhanced through economic and humanitarian assistance as well as through the deployment of armed forces8 the defense departments annual burdensharing report notes for the last three years congress has recognized that there are multiple and diverse ways in which allies may share the responsibility for achieving mutual security objectives9 methodology the data in this report are based primarily upon information that crs gathered over threemonth period from the washington embassies of nato member states several embassies did not respond to crs request for information in compiling and attempting to correlate these numbers some difficulties have arisen for example changes in exchange rates may play role in many cases countries provided crs their kosovo contributions in us dollars some submissions however were reported in foreign currencies and have been converted into us dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing shortly before this report was published there may therefore be relatively small discrepancies or variations among contributions based upon exchange rate fluctuations differences in national accounting practices may constitute more significant source of uncertainty there is great deal of variety in the structures and time periods of the budgets of nato members this has created certain problems for making direct comparisons for example httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30398crs4 some nato members have combined military especially peacekeeping operations and nonmilitary especially humanitarian assistance some governments have provided the estimated amounts that they spent up to the date of submission while other governments have given estimates for entire calendar years some countries have specifically identified incremental costs that is costs over and above the normal operational and maintenance expenditures for their militaries however the criteria used to define such expenditures may differ from country to country some governments have not separated their bilateral assistance to kosovo from assistance provided through international organizations such as the eu or various united nations agencies in some cases funding refers to regional aid including not only for kosovo but for the rest of yugoslavia and for neighboring countries such as macedonia and albania differenc arising from these factors might alter somewhat the relative contributions of the member states accounting differences notwithstanding these figures may provide useful snapshot of the costs incurred by nato allies in respondin g to the latest balkan crisis the following sections describe the military and nonmilitary support that has been provided andor pledged by members of the alliance costs of military operations according to estimate s provided by the department of defense dod comptroller on december 3 1999 us costs of the air campaign the kfor peacekeeping operation and refugee assistance through

nature others identified the costs of specific operations hungary and greece did not contribute military forces to the nato air offensive but provided logistical support airbases and port facilities for which there are cost estimates the timeframe covered by these estimates also varies for example the united kingdoms estimate included expenditures only through july 1999 and made projection for continuing peacekeeping operations italy projected peacekeeping costs through december 1999 but did not provide costs for allied force and france provided per annum projection for peacekeeping

often uncertain and changeable request for particular supplies may be rescinded on closer needs assessment or changed circumstances or crisis may develop requiring new assistance quickly there is single timely source for reporting all humanitarian contributions in recent years humanitarian assistance agencies instituted joint appeals for funds which allowed donors to report their contributions through the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha but this information is several months out of date and does not include bilateral aid for variety of reasons pledges are not always matched by actual contributions expenditures for humanitarian aid may extend to countries far from the disaster some european countries channeled much of their assistance through international organizations such as the or eu contributions to kosovo from those bodies may not be broken out by individual countries as noted above data on nato member humanitarian aid expenditures for kosovo were provided to crs by the governments of those countries the responses have different levels of comprehensiveness many for example did not include costs for hosting kosovar refugees in addition not all of the responses clearly separated humanitarian contributions from reconstruction or military expenditures therefore the following information provides only very rough estimate of the amounts and

reconstruction and development the war caused severe damage and disruption to kosovos housing transport power and other public works infrastructure it also eliminated the legal and institutional structures that provided law and order tax revenues and the like reconstruction assistance seeks to restore the essential functions of government and vital infrastructure but it also encompasses the creation of governmental and private sector structures that may not have existed previously in the same form these would include efforts to assist kosovo in establishing non corrupt free market economy and an equitable system of governance early efforts at reconstruction have sought to meet immediate needsto support the civil administration including restoring essential services such as garbage collection and public transport training the police force and instituting customs collection funds are also expected to meet urgent housing repair needs an estimated half million people face insufficient shelter this winter and promote peace the media and democratization some of these efforts are difficult to separate from the pure humanitarian programs that feed returning refugees and provide minimal preparation for winter as result there may be some overlap in counting donor contributions for one purpose or the other on july 28 1999 donors met in brussels to discuss humanitarian aid and this first effort at reconstruction short term assistance providing for basic human needs and pledge contributions following submission of detailed assessments of long term needs by the european commission and the world bank among others second conference was held in brussels on november 17 1999 to discuss strictly longterm reconstruction and development needs the first donor conference was attended by more than 100 countries and international organizations only one third of the pledge total of 22 billion ie 756 million was for reconstruction assistance including support for civil administration the remainder was for humanitarian aid further of the total 475 million in funds had already been expended or was firmly pledged for the first half of 1999 the us contribution of 557 million of which 278 million could be characterized as reconstruction aid was based according to the special adviser to the president on kosovo ambassador james dobbins on the assumption that others also contribute proportionately with regard to the pending reconstruction and development effort the ambassador said that the united states expected europe to do more than their normal share

had fallen to 542 million at the second donor conference in november total of 11 billion was pledged almost all for reconstruction and developmentrelated purposes of this amount the united states

the european community and its individual members together pledged 7593 million in addition to efforts directed at kosovo the allies and others including russia are seeking to invigorate the whole of the balkans through balkan stability pact that will address security democracy and economic development issues although the launching of this pact at conference held in sarajevo on july 30 1999 was not donors conference the united states used the occasion to announce its contribution to the regions economic development the us effort would emphasize trade and investment programs providing 50 million in grants for technical assistance and an unspecified amount in guarantees and credit to leverage several hundreds of millions of dollars in the face value of private sector investment the united states already has provided about 100 million in balance of payments assistance to frontline states hit hard by the war although the european union and its 15 individual member countries of which 11 are also nato members are likely to announce their own regional initiatives during the next several months assistance in 1999 from the eu alone has amounted to roughly 761 million humanitarian aid accounts for little more than third of this sum and the remainder 488 million is balanceof payments support and technical assistance conclusions the above summaries demonstrate that nearly all of the nato member states have made significant contributions to alleviating the crisis in kosovo the summaries indicate wide variety of activities aimed at helping kosovars particularly in non military matters as noted above statistics for humanitarian aid refugee relief and reconstruction assistance are particularly difficult to collect and compare because the numbers change frequently because countries gather different data and because the majority of nonus assistance is funneled through international organizations such as the united nations and the european union table 2 below

rather than those provided to crs by the embassies have been used in this table because they represent the amounts that the countries reported to common source using roughly the same definitional criteria and including funds expected to be spent in 2000 the amounts in this column include bilateral humanitarian reconstruction and administration contributions they do not include individual countries contributions to the european union separate line has been provided for the european union as it is impossible to disaggregate contributions to the eu by the nato countries finally it should be emphasized that the numbers in this table should be regarded only as rough guide to contributions until more complete information becomes available these numbers should not simply be added together to reach total as they often cover different time periods table 2 estimated nato member state contributions to kosovo crisis state membermilitary expenditures humanitarian reconstruction assistance
