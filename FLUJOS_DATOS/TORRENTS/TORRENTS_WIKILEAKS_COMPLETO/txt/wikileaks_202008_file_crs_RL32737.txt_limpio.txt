affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress military aviation issues and options for combating terrorism summary by all accounts the us military dominates stateonstate conflict in the past nonstate actors terrorists guerrillas drug traffickers appeared to be less threatening to us national security than the well funded well organized and potent armed forces of an enemy nationstate the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 illustrate however that small groups of nonstate actors can exploit relatively inexpensive and commercially available technology to conduct very destructive attacks over great distances todays us armed forces were developed principally with stateonstate conflict in mind combating nonstate actors however presents number of distinct challenges in terms of operations cost and mindset nonstate actors generally strive to hide within civilian populations while us policy makers typically seek quick and decisive victories nonstate actors seek protracted war nonstate actors often employ cheap commercially available weapons that often result in expensive responses by the united states many of the weapons and methods employed today by us armed forces can be used against nonstate actors some however are more directly applicable than others us experience in conducting close air support cas employing special operations forces sof and advising friendly governments in using aviation to defend themselves from insurgents and terrorists may form basis for building capabilities against nonstate actors pursuing objectives against nonstate actors while winning the hearts and minds of local populations or at least not alienating them appears to be key consideration recent military action has killed or captured prominent terrorists but it is unclear whether this action actually degraded the terrorist organizations capabilities in some cases these actions may have even strengthened them there is consensus view that airpower is one of the united states great military advantages some are increasingly concerned however that military aviation is focused too much on the demands of fighting conventional foes to the detriment of irregular warfare also called mootwa military operations other than war and that the department of defense dod must reshape its aviation forces to increase their relevance in small wars while maintaining the capability to win major conflicts determination of dod needs for combating nonstate actors and fielding more relevant forces raises number of acquisition issues some argue that dods overall acquisition priorities are still too oriented toward large high tech acquisition programs most applicable to fighting or deterring peer competitor in stateonstate conflict equally important however are the mindset changes that may be required to transition to force equally adept at fighting conventional and non conventional foes these mindset changes could include changes to training doctrine planning and organization this report will be updated as events warrant contents introduction 1 background 2 challenges of combating nonstate actors 2 operational challenges 3

terrorism introduction by all accounts the us military dominates stateonstate conflict the united states has not faced true peer military competitor since the soviet union disintegrated recent conflicts such as panama libya iraq desert storm bosnia kosovo afghanistan and iraq iraqi freedom illustrate that us armed forces have proven very effective at achieving classic military objectives against other countries armed forces in variety of circumstances achieving politically significant military objectives against nonstate actors including terrorists and insurgents has proven more difficult1 in the past combating nonstate actors was seen by many to be lesser included case nonstate actors appeared to be less threatening to national security than the well funded well organized and much more militarily potent armed forces of an enemy nationstate if for example the us military was deemed adequate to deter or defeat the soviet military then it was also deemed adequate to combat non state actors the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 graphically illustrate however that small groups of nonstate actors can exploit relatively inexpensive and commercially available technology to conduct very destructive attacks over great distances few observers today consider nonstate actors to be lesser included case increasingly it is recognized that in many cases combating nonstate actors presents different and in many cases greater set of challenges than combating conventional military foe senior decision makers have number of tools at their disposal to attempt to find identify track capture neutralize or kill terrorists and other nonstate actors survey of recent antiterrorism efforts indicates that military aviation plays prominent role in performing these tasks the issues for congress include whether us military aviation forces are appropriately funded trained equipped employed and organized to effectively combat nonstate actors 1 nonstate actors is an umbrella term that refers to number of armed groups such as political terrorists narcotraffickers paramilitary insurgents and even international organized criminal organizations these terms are not mutually exclusive paramilitary groups can for example engage in narcotrafficking terrorism and crime for example international terrorism is known to be linked closely with the drug trade and criminal organizations lt gen gennadiy m yevstafyev unmanned aerial vehicles in classic and terrorist wars moscow yadernyy kontrol july 5 2004 pp 7782 crs2 as the department of defense dod endeavors to revamp itself for the different demands of the war in iraq and the global war on terror gwot friction will likely ensue over funding will the military services divert funding from major weapons programs such as combat aircraft and aircraft carriers to fund more terrorismrelevant technologies or will major programs continue as planned or be given additional funding to increase their abilities against nonstate actors the next section provides background on terrorism and nonstate actor challenges and how military aviation may contribute to operations against these actors the following section will address issues associated with the use of military aviation against nonstate actors and potential options for consideration background the us armed forces that are fielded today were organized trained and equipped principally with conventional stateonstate warfare in mind senior leaders in the department of defense dod appear to appreciate the distinct challenges that combating nonstate actors present however and are taking steps to ensure that these challenges are reflected in longterm military plans programs and policies in the spring of 2004 dods 2006 strategic planning guidance found that the us is well positioned to deal with conventional military adversary increasingly however the us may find itself facing nonconventional foes for which it is not well prepared2 further it has been reported that dod leadership has instructed regional combatant commanders to develop and maintain new war plans designed to reduce the chance of postwar instability like the situation in iraq3 based on these plans some predicted that the 2005 quadrennial defense review qdr could upend us military procurement plans as pentagon officials shift their focus from waging conventional warfare to developing new ways to counter catastrophic disruptive and irregular threats in word terrorism4 challenges of combating nonstate actors5 us military forces may be employed against country that sponsors terrorism or that harbors terrorists it is generally agreed that conventional us military forces are adequately trained and equipped to meet the challenge of defeating conventional forces of states that sponsor terrorism the focus of this report is on number of challenges associated with uses of military aviation in combating terrorists and other 2 building toplevel capabilities framework

perl crs3 nonstate actors directly these challenges can be divided into three categories operational challenges mindset challenges and cost challenges operational challenges compared to the armed forces of nation state nonstate actors are easy to defeat in direct combat nonstate actors typically lack the equipment training and discipline that define military service actually engaging in direct combat with nonstate actors is the core operational challenge nonstate actors typically dont wear uniforms indeed they generally strive to integrate themselves into the local civilian population thus target identification is very challenging nonstate actors rarely mass into easily recognizable formations they typically lack large infrastructure or obvious logistics processes therefore nonstate actors present few high value targets for us forces this challenge has not been lost on dod leadership for example for many years though theres been concern that intelligence collection capability basically rested in the ability to find tank or an artillery piece hiding in grove of trees the problem now becomes how to find individuals hiding in groups of peoplethis presents huge problem for us6 the leadership and structure of nonstate organizations such as qaeda are opaque such organizations might be diffuse and operate over long distances qaeda for example often operates through partner organizations which might be small and have fluid leadership one dod leader has said when we kill or capture one of these leaders another one steps in and quickly takes their place7 therefore even characterizing the nonstate actor target can be difficult for military planners once identified nonstate actors are often difficult to engage due to concerns over collateral damage even conventional stateonstate conflict presents collateral damage concerns when one party is actively trying to shield itself behind non combatants however delivering weapons effects with extreme precision takes on increased importance rand study summed up the operational challenges ferreting out individuals or small groups of terrorists positively identifying them and engaging them without harming nearby civilians is an extremely demanding task substantial improvements will be needed in several areas before the air force can be confident of being able to provide this capability to combatant commanders8 mindset challenges successfully combating nonstate actors will likely require different training tactics doctrine political strategies and potentially rules of engagement than are optimal for conventional military warfare collectively these 6 ltgen michael w wooley commander air force special operations command application of special operations forces in the global war on terror air space conference 2004 washington dc september 14 2004 7 ibid 8 david ochmanek military operations against terrorist groups abroad rand santa monica ca 2003 crs4 changes may combine to require different politicomilitary mindset for senior decision makers the us military policy makers and the general population desire short conflicts with clear success criteria exit strategies and decisive victories in conventional setting victory typically entailed an adversarys unconditional surrender but nonstate actors may define victory as not losing their continued existence is victory this mindset characterizes several palestinian terrorist groups that fought israels occupation of palestinian territories in most cases they themselves cannot achieve rapid decisive victory so they follow strategy of protracted war according to one scholar insurgent terrorist and criminal organizations consciously design themselves so that our military and police forces cannot rapidly and decisively defeat them9 others note that even dying for their cause intentionally or voluntarily is perceived as victory for terrorists its different paradigm than the traditional military concern for limiting casualties10 this is characteristic of groups such as hamas and qaeda that employ suicide tactics the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 may require and may have already initiated change in mindset regarding what level of threat should trigger us military action fear that terrorists or other nonstate actors may acquire weapon of mass destruction nuclear biological or chemical weapon has engendered debate on preemptive or preventative employment of us armed forces while many would support preemptive attack to obviate an imminent attack on us interests the definition of what qualifies as imminent is highly debatable11 further preventing insurgent victory over friendly government may not be enough to prevent this threat instead the united states will likely desire to prevent nonstate actors from taking over large portions of nationstates because these territories could be used to train terrorists and initiate attacks at global distances the recent reported discovery of an insurgent chemical weapons lab in fallujah iraq exemplifies this threat in conventional warfare setting armed forces typically attempt to avoid civilians or shield them from the wars consequences when combating nonstate actors however civilians may need to be engaged at an unprecedented level winning the hearts and minds of the local population or at least not alienating them could become large part of the overall counter insurgent or counter terrorist strategy terrorists and insurgents require at least tacit if not active support from the local population to operate effectively in the words of one british general responsible for counterinsurgency operations the shooting side of the business is 9 thomas r searle making airpower effective against guerrillas air space power journal fall 2004 10 wooley op cit 11 see crs report rs21311 us use of preemptive military force by richard f grimmett for more indepth discussion of this topic crs5 only 25 percent of the trouble the other 75 percent is getting the people of this country behind us12 however the military activities at which todays armed forces excel such as precisely destroying buildings or vehicles may work counter to this hearts and minds strategy according to one study counter terrorist military attacks against elusive terrorists may serve only to radicalize large sectors of the muslim population and damage the us image worldwide13 cost challenges almost by definition nonstate actors employ weapons and methods that are inexpensive when compared to training equipping and employing military force however the cost to defend against nonstate actors or to combat them can be high for example terrorists can acquire manportable air defense systems manpads for as little as 5000 if terrorist succeeded in shooting down commercial airliner with this shoulderfired missile the immediate cost of losing the airplane would be over 100 million and the indirect costs much higher further fielding technologies on commercial aircraft to defend against this threat could cost the united states 10 billion in acquisition costs alone14 identifying and fielding systems and methods that can combat terrorists cost effectively will likely be an important challenge to overcome aviation activities highly applicable to combating nonstate actors given the right context virtually every military aviation asset or activity can be used to combat nonstate actors yet some are more directly applicable than others close air support cas close air support cas is military aviation mission that appears highly relevant to the nonstate actor challenge dod defines cas as air action by fixed and rotarywing aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and that require detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces15 many of the functions inherent in cas such as tracking enemy forces differentiating friendly forces from foes quickly delivering weapons against moving targets and closely controlling and coordinating air and ground forces to reduce the chances of fratricide or collateral damage are applicable to airactions against non state actors therefore assessing how the cas mission is evolving what key challenges are inherent in the mission and how these challenges are currently being 12 lt gen sir gerald templer the british high commissioner to

useful framework for assessing how military aviation may be applied against nonstate actors cas is mission that many believe has been historically neglected in favor of more glamorous missions such as airtoair combat according to the leader of dods joint close air support joint test team close air support is not mission of primary emphasis for the air force and the army treats it largely as an afterthought not primary objective16 recent activity within dod however suggests that cas is receiving increased attention and that it is growing mission area this may be due to changes in the nature of adversaries the emergence of new technologies and evolving airpower strategy17 operation desert storm the 1991 war with iraq can be considered traditional stateonstate conflict the airpower strategy during this war has been subsequently described as one of shock and awe military aviation conducted 38day air campaign against iraqs strategic targets including air defenses power grid roads bridges and political and military command control and communications c3 the ground campaign followed this initial air attack cas accounted for 8 of all combat sorties flown during operation desert storm18 operation allied force the 1999 nato airstrikes against serbian military police and paramilitary forces engaged in ethnic violence in kosovo was less traditional conflict nato ground forces were employed in the conflict and cas missions supporting friendly forces accounted for 26 of the 21111 combat sorties flown much higher percentage than in iraq19 although dod has not released official figures on sorties flown during operation enduring freedom the war in afghanistan the effectiveness and ubiquity of cas missions against taliban and qaeda forces was widely reported in the press20 particularly noteworthy was how cas was conducted during this conflict contrary to the typical method of flying tactical aircraft such as the a10 f16 or ac130 at low altitude the air force attacked numerous taliban and 16 amy butler joint close air support team finds air force army training lacking inside the air force july 4 2003 17 the statistics in the following paragraphs were compiled from different sources within the department of defense the sortie counting rules and definitions of cas and other missions such as battlefield air interdiction are not necessarily uniform

precision guided munitions pgms operation iraqi freedom witnessed another leap in the relative number of cas sorties flown by the declared end of stateonstate hostilities in may 2003 79 of all combat sorties were cas sorties almost 10 times the ratio of cas to noncas combat sorties flown in 199121 many believe that this heavy reliance on cas was planned us ground forces advanced through iraq quickly because military aviation replaced to great degree the fire support normally supplied by heavy artillery22 many have praised the apparent increase in dods attention to cas and the successes witnessed in recent operations against both state and nonstate actors the contemporary prosecution of cas missions has revealed however shortcomings that have resulted in fratricide and slow responses to ground forces requests for fire many have attributed these shortcomings to lack of training lack of appropriate personnel or suboptimal adherence to operational processes equipment shortcomings may also be to blame23 special operations forces sof germane to air operations us special operations forces sof are small military units with special training and equipment specialized training may include for example foreign languages psychological operations advanced piloting skills and terminal air control specialized equipment includes for example mh53jm pave low helicopters and mc130eh combat talon iii aircraft sof forces are found in all four military services and number approximately 40000 soldiers sailors airmen and marines24 sof can take both direct and indirect action against nonstate actors direct sof aviationrelated action can include collecting intelligence clandestinely inserting forces in close proximity to nonstate actors rescuing sof and other forces pursued by or

foreign internal defense fid fid is one of the primary sof missions designated by the 1986 goldwaternichols act which created the us special operations command25 dod defines fid as participation by civilian and military agencies of government in any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion lawlessness and insurgency26 according to the air force special operations command the aviation aspect of fid aviationfid or afid is essentially one of training and advising foreign aviation forces in the sustained use of airpower supporting their own internal defense and development strategies aviationfid is employed as complement to other sof component operations within various theaters of operation and includes such activities as support for counterinsurgency counter narcotics antiterrorism and counter poaching27 the air forces 6th special operations squadron 6sos is the sole dod organization tasked with performing afid the 6sos was created in 1994 and currently is composed of 110 air force personnel the 6sos is based at hurlburt field fl its budget for both fy2004 and fy2005 was 56 million the fy2006 budget request was 54 million since september 11 2001 the 6sos has advised 26 different foreign countries in how to better use airpower against terrorists insurgents and other nonstate actors28 the 6sos does not perform basic pilot training instead it attempts to convey specific combat and combat support skills that are most relevant to fid examples of combat skills include for example night

air forces closer to us standards providing to the us commanders clear understanding of the foreign air forces capabilities and limitations and by establishing key personal relationships within the foreign air forces leadership and flight personnel military air operations against nonstate actors the use of air assets against suspected terrorist or insurgent leaders has gained public prominence since the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states although their use did not necessarily originate with september 11 or with the united states since the september 11 attacks us forces appear to be making increased use of air power in antiterrorist missions us forces have conducted several successful strikes on senior figures or allies of the qaeda organization on the other hand the effectiveness of airpower in an antiterrorism anti insurgent mission is not unquestioned and it is difficult to compare the effect of air strikes in comparison to other antiterrorist methods for example several senior qaeda operatives have not been killed in us air strikes but have instead been captured in police or intelligence operations by allied law enforcement services the most prominent of such captures was the arrest of senior qaeda operative khalid shaykh mohammad by pakistani officers reportedly working with us intelligence in march 2003 some might argue that the arrest of khalid shaykh the organizations most senior terrorist planner and the reputed architect of the september 11 attacks damaged qaedas operating ability more than any air strike against any other qaeda leader another senior operative reputed to be khalid shayks replacement abu faraj allibi was captured in small town mardan about 70 miles northwest of pakistans capital islamabad in march 2005 other qaeda fighters and operatives were reportedly captured in us ground operations in afghanistan an example is of the egyptian cleric umar abd rahman convicted of terrorist plots related to the 1993 bombing of the world trade center the ahmed abd alrahman reportedly was killed fighting alongside taliban forces in battle against us troops in november 2001 during the major combat phase of operation enduring freedom30 another major question is to what to attribute the success of any given anti terrorist air operation the success of air strikes on terrorist leaders and groups appears to depend in large measure on the development and timely exploitation of precise intelligence on the location and movements of these individuals as noted in the examples below those strikes that have been successful have generally been 29 httpwwwspecialoperationscomusafunits16thsow6thsoshtm 30 of omar abdelrahman reported captured or killed in afghanistan associated press november 18 2001 crs10 characterized by the acquisition of precise actionable intelligence on terrorist individuals whereabouts broader question is whether or not successful attack on an individual terrorist leader whether by air power or any other means contributes to the overarching goal of reducing terrorist operations by the targeted group that broader question is significant but difficult to measure terrorist organizations effectiveness might be reduced by many different variables reduction in popular commitment to its cause deaths of its leaders due to other causes including arrests or natural causes splits within the organization economic improvement in the areas where the group operates the availability of senior operatives to replace those killed and an almost infinite number of other variables it could be argued that if other variables remain constant the effect of targeted strike on an individual terrorist or insurgent group appears to depend in some measure on the breadth of terroristinsurgent organizations leadership and the capabilities of its less senior operatives some experts say that ethnic or territorial based groups are somewhat more resilient to the deaths of key leaders than are ideologybased organizations31 another argument is that some us strikes cause collateral damage causing some civilians to resent us operations and perhaps give aid and comfort to the terrorist or insurgent organizations the following represent specific us or allied country use of air power in anti terrorist or antiinsurgent missions and analysis of the effect of those strikes on the group to which the target individual belonged one of the first uses of us air power in an antiterrorism mission was the april 1980 attempt to rescue the us diplomats and other americans held hostage by the revolutionary government in iran32 the mission involved six fuel and equipmentcarrying c130 aircraft meeting up with eight carrierlaunched sea stallion helicopters at remote iranian desert landing strip called desert one the plan was for the helicopters to fly us commandos to tehran where they would raid facilities holding the us hostages free them and return to desert one for evacuation however three sea stallions developed mechanical problems at desert one possibly due to the intake of sand into the engines and the mission was aborted there before flying to tehran the hasty abortion of the mission in the iranian desert resulted in collision among aircraft that killed eight us military personnel hostages were rescued the failure of the mission caused the joint chiefs of staff and other defense department and government organs to assign higher priority to the study and implementation of unconventional warfare and the strengthening of special operations forces spanning all us military services 31 hanley charles targeting leaders may not end terrorism experts say st louis post dispatch january 22 2006 p 10 32 detailed account of the hostage rescue mission is found in ryan paul the iranian rescue missionwhy it failed naval institute press 1985 crs11 another early use of us use of airpower in an antiterrorism mission not targeted strike on terrorist leader but an anti terrorism operation nonetheless came in october 1985 in connection with the hijacking of the cruise ship achille lauro by gunmen of the palestine liberation front plf headed by abu abbas aka mohammad zaydun the twoday hijacking in which the plf terrorists killed 69year old disabled american passenger leon klinghoffer ended with the four plf hijackers ending the seizure in egypt in exchange for safe passage us navy f14 aircraft intercepted an egypt air 737 airliner on which the hijackers and abbas were flying to tunisia the us aircraft forced the egypt air plane to land in italy where the terrorists were taken into custody by italian authorities abbas was released by italian authorities due to lack of evidence but in 1986 he was tried in absentia in italy convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment he later threw his support behind israelipalestinian negotiations and lived out his life mostly in baghdad where he was captured by us invasion forces in april 2003 while in us custody he died ostensibly of natural causes in march 2004 in probably the most widely noted air strike connected with the september 11 attacks in november 2001 an armed us predator drone supplemented by us combat aircraft killed mohammad atef the number three leader of qaeda behind osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri his location was pinpointed when taliban defector told us special forces in afghanistan where he would be33 and the site was surveyed by the circling predator immediately before and after the strike34 atefs death almost certainly represented blow to the qaeda leadership structure he had been associated with bin laden for the prior ten years his daughter married bin ladens in early 2001 and atef was allegedly responsible for planning antius operations in somalia in 1993 and possibly the two bombings of us embassies in kenya and tanzania in august 1998 however it is difficult to fix precisely the degradation in qaedas capabilities that resulted from atefs death in comparison with the other us and allied operations against qaeda and with other factors such as the loss of afghanistan as base of operations in another major use of air power us warplanes dropping targeted munitions killed an qaeda ally near the northern afghan city of konduz in late november 2001 juma namangani military leader 33 damon johnston osamas man in deadly betrayal deputy killed in

november 23 2001 crs12 of the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu was widely regarded as an organization allied to qaeda and most active in central asia in this case us forces apparently were targeting taliban fighters in that battle generally and might not necessarily have been targeting namangani specifically35 most experts appear to agree that namanganis death set back imu operations significantlyand it is only now three years later that the group is beginning to resume operations inside uzbekistan36 the surviving cofounder of the group tahir yuldashev is considered more political philosopher than militia commander or operational planner and by most accounts he has had difficulty keeping the imu cohesive and active following namanganis death on november 3 2002 an armed us predator drone killed qaedas leader in yemen ali qaed sinan alharithi and five other qaeda suspects driving with him in car harithi was key suspect in the october 2002 bombing of the uss cole in aden harbor the government of yemen virtually admitted that it had provided information on harithis movements through the yemeni desert to us intelligence enabling the successful predator targeting and strike37 the effect of the strike on qaeda as whole is difficult to quantify but qaeda operations in yemen apparently have diminished significantly since harithis death another suspected cole plotter

actionable intelligence acquired on the ground appeared to succeed again in june 2004 strike on proal qaeda pakistani militant nek mohammad his location was reportedly pinpointed based on information

strike on january 13 2006 us authorities launched predatorbased missiles at compound in damadola northwest pakistan in an attempt to kill bin ladens top associate ayman zawahiri us officials have acknowledged he was the target and that the strike was based on intelligence that he would be attending dinner in the compound at that time after several days pakistani authorities said that four or five qaeda figures were hit in the strike based on their intelligence from villagers including qaedas top chemical weaponry expert abu khabab almasri zawahiris soninlaw and at least two other egyptian qaeda figures responsible for operations in afghanistan39 zawahiri has not appeared in contemporaneous audio or video tape since he did appear in an apparently rereleased video but most press accounts quoting pakistani and us intelligence say zawahiri did not attend the event and was not hit however at least dozen non combatants were killed in the strike and it provoked several days of protests in pakistan against the united states and its policies on january 23 2006 pakistans prime minister shaukat aziz said pakistan was not informed in advance of the strike and condemned it although numerous press accounts said that the intelligence for the strike was provided at least in part by pakistani intelligence the air strikes discussed above generally depended on the acquisition of precise intelligence from sources mostly allied intelligence and military forces on the ground in key cases strikes were not conducted by air power because timely actionable intelligence was not available according to press accounts about year before the september 11 attacks predator drones at the time unarmed sighted qaeda training camps and figures that could have included bin laden himself air assets warplanes and cruise missiles were not in position to strike quickly enough and strike was ordered40 an airstrike against qaeda camps in afghanistan in august 1998 about two weeks after the

bin laden as is widely known remains at large and appeared in video released few days after the january 13 2006 strike targeting zawahiri discussed above the use of air power against terrorist leaders is relatively recent post september 11 development but us planners are reportedly building on the experiences of at least one us ally israel that has used this method for many years as analyzed below the effects of israels use of air power against militants even when its strikes have struck the intended targets have produced mixed outcomes in february 1992 israel used hellfire missile launched from an ah64 apache helicopter to kill then leader of lebanese hizballah abbas musawi as he drove in motorcade through south lebanon hizballah shiite islamist militia backed by iran and syria had become the most active opponent of israels military presence in south lebanon which began with israels invasion of lebanon in 1982 and ended with israels unilateral withdrawal in may 2000 it was believed responsible for the october 1983 bombing of the us marine barracks in beirut as well as the holding of us civilian hostages in lebanon during 19841991 and is classified as terrorist organization by the united states however the killing of abbas musawi did not materially diminish hizballahs capabilities and the strike on him apparently provoked significant retaliation in the march 1992 bombing allegedly by hizballah of israels embassy in buenos aires us report on terrorism state department patterns of global terrorism 2003 states that hizballah was behind the july 1994 bombing of an argentinejewish cultural center in buenos aires which killed 86 persons in early 2004 israeli helicopters fired missiles and killed two major leaders of hamas the most active of the palestinian groups opposed to israels occupation of palestinian territory hamas is palestinian islamist movement that has claimed responsibility for many of the suicide bombings against israeli civilian and military targets that have taken place over the past decade the two hamas leaders killed in early 2004 were shaykh ahmad yassin the physically disabled founder and spiritual leader of hamas killed march 22 2004 and abd alaziz alrantisi the political leader of hamas appointed after yassins death killed april 17 2004 lower level hamas operative adnan ghoul was killed by an armed israeli drone on

uses against israel42 the effect of these strikes on hamas is not precisely known but hamas is relatively large organization patterns 2003 says it has tens of thousands of supporters and sympathizers and new leaders khalid mishal musa abu marzuq mahmoud zohar have been readily available to assume the places of those killed although hamas suicide bombings against israelis appear to have diminished during 2004 many attribute that observation not to israels targeted killings but to fence structure israel has been building which makes it difficult for hamas and other militants to cross from the occupied territories into israel proper although hamas institutional capabilities apparently have not been crippled by these targeted strikes neither did the strikes produce large sustained popular palestinian unrest against israel one of israels early uses of targeted killing incorporated air power in support role in april 1988 an israeli commando team conducted seaborne raid on tunis beachfront villa inhabited by senior plo military commander khalil wazir abu jihad he was killed in the raid according to detailed published accounts of the operation43 two boeing 707s outfitted with advanced electronic gear flew overhead during the raid to conduct electronic warfare and to keep the commando team in communication with the israeli defense ministry in tel aviv other israeli aircraft protected the israeli sea craft during the four day voyage to tunis and then back in addition israeli helicopters were aboard larger ship off the tunisian coast to assist the raiding party if need be they reportedly were not used the implications of the operation against khalil wazir are matter of speculation some might argue that at the time of this killing the plo was already undergoing reassessment that would lead plo leader yasir arafat in december 1988 to renounce terrorism and recognize israels right to exist shift that led five years later to mutual recognition between the plo and israel and to negotiations to resolve their outstanding conflicts some might argue that arafat was shaken by israels ability to strike the senior plo leadership in an operation so far from israels borders and that the raid might have prompted arafat to more quickly abandon the plos use of terrorism and opposition to negotiations with israel others believe that khalil wazir was highly energetic and effective plo commander who had he not been assassinated could have forestalled or prevented the rise of more militant challengers to the plo such as hamas and palestinian islamic jihad pij 42

battle with the hijackers and ugandan security forces issues and options introduction there is consensus view in defense circles that airpower is one of the united states great military advantages some are increasingly concerned however that military aviation is focused too much on the demands of fighting conventional foes to the detriment of irregular warfare and that the challenge for the air force is to reshape its forces to increase their relevance in small wars while maintaining the capability to win major conflicts45 some argue that dods overall acquisition priorities are still too oriented toward large high tech acquisition programs most applicable to fighting or deterring peer competitor in stateonstate conflict within aviation systems might include advanced fighter aircraft or highly specialized aircraft such as radar jammers others argue that these kind of platforms are still required for stateonstate conflict despite us preeminence in this area and that new concepts of operation new organizational schema or technology upgrades may increase these systems applicability to nonstate actor challenges in worst case scenario this underfocus on employing airpower against non state actors is not conscious decision but caused by fundamental shortfall in airpower training doctrine planning and strategy as point of reference the air 44 detailed account of the israeli operation can be found in stevenson william 90 minutes at entebbe bantam books 1976 45 thomas mccarthy national security for the 21st century the air force and foreign internal defense school of advanced air and space studies air university maxwell afb june 2004 p 67 and thomas r searle making airpower effective against guerrillas air space power journal fall 2004 crs17 forces primary doctrine document guiding actions against nonstate actors contains less than two pages on combating terrorism46 certain events in the recent iraq war lend some traction to the argument that many in dod lack clear understanding of how airpower can contribute to irregular warfare for example soon after the armys 3rd infantry division captured baghdad the division released its air force air support operations squadron to redeploy believing that the airliaison element had nothing to offer at that point worse yet the airmen left because they were not sure how airpower and space power could contribute47 this apparently premature dismantling of formal airground coordination appears to have been mirrored at higher levels as the war in iraq appeared increasingly likely the air force created new headquarters organization called the air component coordination element acce by all accounts the acce functioned effectively and was largely responsible for smooth coordination of ground and aviation forces but the acce was dissolved in late april 2003 as major combat operations drew to close48 it appears that the experiences in afghanistan and iraq are stimulating military leaders to reexamine how ground combat is conducted it was reported in november 2004 that for the first time in decades the army has issued field guide to counterinsurgency warfare an acknowledgment that the kind of fighting under way in iraq may become more common in the years ahead49 in 2004 the marine corps appended its small wars manual which was published in 1940 reexamination of dods airpower mindset appears timely and may be critical to successfully combating nonstate actors in the future policy makers face the questions of the desirability of helping dod reorient its airpower activities toward greater emphasis on combating nonstate actors and the means of accomplishing this reorientation this report explores these questions by evaluating potential changes to dod acquisition priorities and mindset eg training doctrine planning and organization acquisition priorities if military aviation acquisition priorities are to be changed to equip us air forces engaged in combating nonstate actors the systems that may be considered 46 military operations other than war air force doctrine document 23 july 3 2000 p1617 47 searle op cit 48 elaine grossman general wartested airland

airborne sensors intelligence and battle management also called command control and communications that might most effectively improve us capabilities against non state actors may best be described through generic and overlapping functions these functions include detection discrimination and decision making detecting small groups of combatants can be difficult especially in cluttered environments like cities dod already operates number of aerial sensor platforms that can be used to detect nonstate actors these include aircraft such as the u2 e8 jstars rc135 rivet joint rc12 guardrail and number of uavs these assets are already heavily used for conventional military missions and are often described as high demandlow density hdld platforms to denote their frequent use and few numbers in addition to their heavy tasking and few numbers it is not clear that these sensor platforms adequately satisfy the long onstation time low observability low cost ease of use and high survivability that are attractive for non state actor missions much has been made of the recent operational use of predator global hawk pioneer shadow and other uavs as both sensor platforms and weapon platforms50 perhaps more relevant effort to the nonstate actor problem is the development fielding of smaller uavs to be operated by small groups eg squad platoon company of ground forces some types of uavs appear ideally suited for use by sof and in some cases peacekeeping actions in urban and rural areas51 us marines are reportedly very satisfied with the backpackable dragon eye surveillance uav that they use daily in iraq52 the air force special operations command afsoc is the lead proponent of these small uavs the air force fields approximately 150 of its smallest uavs called the batcam used by tactical air controllers to detect and target enemy forces53 the defense advanced research projects agency darpa and other research organizations are developing even smaller microuavs mavs eg silenteyes wasp organic air vehicle oav that could aid small ground units trying to navigate and survive in urban anti terrorist operations or contribute to locating and capturing bin laden and other qaeda leaders54 50 see crs report rl31872 unmanned aerial vehicles background and issues for congress by harlan geer and christopher bolkcom for more information on uavs 51 lt gen

appear to offer attributes attractive to surveillance missions against nonstate actors55 by elevating sensors thousands of feet above the ground for months on end us forces appear to have surveillance tool that levels the playing field to some extent against small irregular forces which depend on concealment for protection and to prosecute their attacks aerostats may also help alleviate some of the well known deficiencies of satellites such as predictable flight schedules and weather limitations aerostats have been deployed for this purpose albeit in what appears to be limited numbers one key question for dod is how much effort and funding is being put on small tactical level uavs like batcam or pointer compared to more expensive and technologically challenging uavs like predator or global hawk the top budgeted dod uav programs fy2004fy2009 are jucas joint unmanned combat aerial system at 42 billion global hawk at 41 billion and predator at 13 billion56 it appears that these expensive and technologically sophisticated uav programs are taking the lions share of uav funding these systems also tend to be used or are intentioned for use by higher level theater commanders not tacticallevel ground forces second question for dod is how much effort and funding is being put on fielding cost effective unmanned aerostats for surveillance and communications compared to more expensive manned aircraft or satellite systems new generations of sensors may be needed to fly on these sensor platforms to improve the ability of us forces to detect and monitor the activities of small groups of enemy combatants for example new synthetic aperture radar sar that operates simultaneously in uhf and vhf to detect stationary targets under trees or camouflage would clearly be useful57 if they are to survive however nonstate actors know that they must not remain stationary therefore us radars with ground moving target indicators gmti are valuable gmti radars have been used in by us forces in combat since 1991 and against nonstate actors in afghanistan and iraq while gmti radars have proven useful in detecting and targeting small groups of irregulars some shortcomings have been noted for example the number of gmti assets was insufficient to provide desired coverage also lack of optimal base access reduced the availability of gmti assets finally it was observed that terrain foliage and opportunities for enemy ground forces to disperse or avoid maneuver can hinder detection and tracking by gmti58 55 see crs report rs21886 potential military use of airships and

crs20 improved electro optical eo and infrared ir sensors will also be useful in detecting nonstate actors in all environments although most applicably it may be argued in remote environments for all sensors mentioned thus far improvement to acuity may be useful but miniaturization likely more important59 miniaturization should enable greater application of aerial sensors easier deployment to remote areas and less onerous employment by small forces trying to keep kit to minimum the army for example is developing miniature ir cameras it hopes will weigh only three ounces and cost under 50060 some question how much effort is being spent to develop and field these small and comparatively simple sensors with direct application to antiterrorism activities compared to larger more sophisticated and expensive sensors detecting small groups of people can be difficult but distinguishing enemy combatants from noncombatants can in many scenarios be extremely difficult gathering and exploiting actionable intelligence is key part of this challenge some have argued that the us militarys intelligence training and collection must concentrate more on understanding criminal terrorist and insurgent networks even if this means putting less emphasis on the traditional strengths of our military intelligence such as determining the conventional ground order of battle and targeting power grids and transportation networks61 it has been reported that dod has initiated major program to develop new intelligence devices for tagging tracking and locating potential insurgent leaders and terrorists62 the details of this effort are currently unclear however it is likely that any effort to improve the ability to differentiate terrorists from civilians track them and target them will employ multiple airborne sensor and intelligence assets these techniques could be exploited to more effectively attack small groups or individuals or in law enforcement capture and arrest operations as mentioned earlier one criticism that has been levied on those in dod responsible for acquisition decisions has been that they overly emphasize large cold warstyle programs or try to apply these programs to the antiterrorism mission when less hightech solutions may suffice in the intelligence milieu one caution may be made against overreliance on traditional us strength signals intelligence sigint while sigint may likely be one tool to identify and track terrorists it may be ill advised to make it primary tool 59 lightweight versionssit atop the gun barrels of rifles and heavy machine

and exploit radio and cellular phone communications is well known osama bin ladin for example is reported to avoid cell phones at all cost yet the air force for instance appears to emphasize using sigint against nonstate actors experiments in the nevada desert are using unmanned aircraft to find the exact location of enemy electronic emissions such as the mobile phone of terrorist in fastmoving auto63 human intelligence humint is also tool to identify and track terrorists unlike sigint however humint is not recognized us strength humint may however in many cases prove the only way to identify terrorist leaders while most humint is the domain of the intelligence community dods sof can contribute by questioning captured terrorists and searching their equipment and facilities64 these activities can reveal both the weapons available to terrorists and insight into imminent terrorist operations in the words of one sof leader the ability to question some of the terrorists is invaluable its this ability that we have in the special operations that helps us determine and eradicate terrorist organizations leadership65 when conducting humintoriented operations military sof and cia clandestine paramilitary forces frequently exploit military airpower for situational awareness and stealthy infiltration and extraction in sum there appears to be need to oversee dod sensor and sensor platform acquisition plans to ensure it is adequately pursuing systems most applicable to the nonstate actor threat in the words of one observer in the counter guerrilla fight the threat is not ballistic missiles but rockets mortars rpgs and manpads we need to bring our spacebased concept down to the counter guerrilla level by deploying persistent aerial isr platforms that provide similar widearea coverage focused on the specific signatures of these weapons the air platforms could take the form of tethered blimps uavs or manned aircraft66 most nonstate actors will present fleeting or timesensitive targets while fleeting targets are often difficult to detect they typically present greater challenges to decision making and battle management targets are detected but disappear before decision to attack can be made or weapon can be brought to bear dod has recognized the challenge associated with attacking fleeting targets and it is not clear 63 david fulghum jefx 04 reveals new weapons for the war on terrorism aviation week space technology august 16 2004 64 the central intelligence agency cia conducts paramilitary operations that can contribute to the development and

for the conventional military mission acquisition priorities may include programs that more effectively distribute sensor information to make tactical decisions about fleeting targets and maintaining accurate knowledge of the position of friendly ground forces us air forces have succeeded in locating and attacking small groups of non state actors particularly when terminal air controllers have identified targets and supplied target coordinates to attack platforms at least three acquisition issues pertain to better enabling these personnel first the gao and others say that lack of uniformity in laser range finders and communications equipment has limited the effectiveness of terminal controllers to direct aircraft from different services 67 second the battlefield air operations bao kits that these personnel use typically composed of navigation equipment computers communication gear night vision goggles laser range finders and batteries weigh on the order of 160 lbs reducing the weight of this equipment would do much to increase terminal controller mobility with potential benefits for survivability and maintainability68 third move away from voice only communications to machinetomachine datalinks may allow terminal air controllers to pass target coordinates directly from handheld target designators to strike aircraft some assert that this improvement alone could reduce the required time to attack fleeting targets from an average of 30 minutes to less than five minutes69 while these improvements to sof and terminal air controllers equipment could potentially increase their effectiveness they will likely remain relatively specialized and scarce resources increasing the priority of many battle management programs that fall under the rubric of network centric warfare ncw may prove beneficial to detecting identifying tracking and targeting fleeting groups of nonstate actors70 many of these programs such as the affordable moving surface target engagement amste or the advanced tactical targeting technology at3 programs seek to distribute sensing and targeting functions among network of multi mission aircraft rather than centralizing these functions on highly specialized and expensive aircraft71 emphasizing these kinds of battle management technologies may speed up decision making against fleeting targets and may also reduce the cost of defeating nonstate actors relative to the costs they incur to operate also known as the cost exchange ratio 67 general accounting office military readiness lingering training and equipment issues

the location of us or friendly forces especially ground forces is in doubt thus investment in programs such as the armys blue force tracker appear directly applicable to better combating nonstate actors these investments may be especially prudent if the air forces continue to explore conducting close air support missions from high altitudes with gpsguided munitions these weapons are quite precise by historical standards however they are only as accurate as the geographical coordinates that operators input and operators make mistakes72 some say that pilot flying at low altitude although more vulnerable to ground fire has better situational awareness of what is transpiring on the battlefield than pilot flying at 30000 feet and can use this awareness to avoid making mistakes that could result in fratricide the implementation of blue force tracker and similar systems might reclaim ground situational awareness lost due to high altitude73 blue force tracker may also be useful to special operations helicopters attempting to insert or rescue ground forces pursuing or fleeing from nonstate actors74 aircraft the military services have proposed several procurement and modification efforts to improve aviation capabilities against nonstate actors these programs can be found in the strike insertionextraction airlift and command and control domains75 strike while many combat aircraft can be used to attack nonstate actors the air forces a10 warthogs and ac130 gunships are the aircraft that specialize most in this mission area the increased use of unmanned combat aerial vehicles ucavs in this mission area also appears likely the air force currently operates an inventory of approximately 354 a10s and oa10s76 the current modernization plan is to spend approximately 600000 per aircraft to improve the warthogs targeting capabilities77 the precision engagement pe upgrade will include an advanced targeting pod improved cockpit displays new data link integration and

stovl variant of the f35 joint strike fighter jsf in 2003 air force leaders said that some a10s would be retired in order to pay for modernizing the remaining operational aircraft it is not clear if this remains the current plan or how many a10 retirements would be required this strategy of reducing the force structure to pay for planned upgrades has been pursued with other aircraft such as the b1 bomber that particular force reduction proved unpopular with congress which forced the air force to unretire many of the retired b1s at cost of 17 million78 the marine corps plans to procure stovl variants of the f35 to replace its av8b harrier fa18 aircraft and to conduct close air support missions cas the air force also plans to procure some currently undetermined number of stovl f 35s to replace the a10 air force leaders also say that the f22 will be valuable strike platform for cas missions and attacking moving ground targets79 it appears likely that these aircraft will have many attributes that will make them effective in these roles such as precision targeting capability and in the case of the jsf the ability to operate from short runways and austere air facilities it is not clear however that either aircraft will be cost effective both aircraft but especially the f 22 appear to have many costly attributes that may not be required in cas platform such as high degree of maneuverability high speed and low radar cross sections todays cas platforms suggest that modern avionics and targeting capabilities are essential to effectively attacking small groups of moving targets but modern advances in stealth maneuverability and speed may not be required or even attractive the basic design and aeronautical capabilities of the a10 for example date from the 1960s with upgrades to avionics and targeting however the air force believes the aircraft will remain effective until almost 2030 the air force special operations command afsoc currently operates eight ac130h

as when ground troops were fighting to gain control of fallujah iraq the ac130s were not flown during daylight hours81 the air force could address this shortcoming in at least three general ways improve the ac130s survivability develop new gunship based on more capable aircraft or combine manned or unmanned aircraft working in concert to provide close air support options to increase the ac130s survivability include developing more effective defensive countermeasures and decoys fielding new weapons that could maintain the ac130s precision and fire power but at greater distance and increased collaboration with uavs to enable increased situational awareness for ac 130 crews some techniques to reduce the ac130s infrared ir electro optical eo and acoustic signature may also be pursued but the benefits of these techniques is questionable due to the ac130s large size and slow speed which make the aircraft highly visible new and more capable aircraft upon which future gunship could conceivably be based include the c17 an ac17 could fly faster and higher than the ac130 and its larger size could accommodate more and different types of weapons whether this option would be cost effective is unclear air force estimates put the cost of the standard c130j hercules transport at approximately 50 million82 however the ac130u which includes weapons targeting systems and other upgrades is priced at 190 million per aircraft83 the c17 without any modifications for weapons or targeting systems costs approximately 191 million each84 using the same rough cost difference between the c130 and the ac130 suggests that an ac17 could cost 340 million each 140 million more than the c17 replacing the ac130 with some number of uavs appears the most radical potential program but perhaps most compatible with other air force and dod efforts to develop network centric approaches to warfare the number and capabilities of these uavs are being studied and will likely be driven much by the maturation of technologies that will give uavs more autonomy than they currently possess or allow single remote operator to control multiple aircraft85 final issue pertains to who should operate the ac130 and its replacement and how many are required currently the ac130 is operated by afsoc allowing conventional air force units to fly the spooky gunship could expand its use and

fy200988 it was widely reported in 2002 and 2003 that the army had already deployed two weaponized hunter uavs but recent press reports quote army spokesmen denying this and saying that classification issues prohibited any further elaboration89 at issue is whether these armed uavs will simply replicate the same capabilities provided by existing uavs such as predator or whether by virtue of being controlled by ground forces directly involved in operations with nonstate actors might provide improved levels of availability and responsiveness another issue for armed uavs may be the effectiveness of their program management especially for the larger and more technologically aggressive programs in their fy2005 conference report congressional appropriators expressed their concern that the joint

aircraft transport has proven indispensable for small wars operations the lack of railroads improved motor roads and navigable waterways in some of our probable theaters of operation makes the supply and transportation of troops by air more or less mandatory93 in addition to poor roads us armed forces fighting nonstate actors are likely to encounter dangerous roads as has been demonstrated in iraq insurgents will likely attempt to increase the risk and the expense of ground transportation by employing ambushes driveby shootings and improvised exploding devices ieds in mid december 2004 it was widely reported that senior dod leaders responded to an increasingly dangerous situation on the ground by significantly increasing the amount of military cargo hauled by intratheater aircraft94 air transportation it was reasoned is more expensive and less efficient than ground transportation over these distances but was deemed necessary to protect the lives of civilians and military personnel number of helicopter losses in late 2005 and early 2006 due to enemy action may merit reexamination of this assertion the air force currently operates over 500 c130 hercules airlifters these aircraft are the militarys workhorse for intratheater lift and can typically operate from runways shorter than the air forces longrange airlift aircraft however it does not appear that the c130 is best suited to deliver supplies and reinforcements to us ground forces operating in remote areas the c130 requires approximately 5000 feet of runway to operate95 in south america and central america for instance c 130s can operate from approximately 5 of all airstrips 540 of the 10400 airstrips in africa the c130 can land on approximately15 of all airstrips96 the us transportation command transcom has

called the future cargo aircraft fca to replace its aging c23 sherpa and some of its c12 huron aircraft the leading contenders for the contract appear to be from european manufacturers the alenia aeronautica c27j and the casa c295 at issue is which aircraft to procure and whether usmanufactured aircraft might not better satisfy this requirement this potentially large procurement of the fca appears to have exacerbated an ongoing roles and missions tension between the air force and the army the air force air mobility command amc has responsibility for strategic and tactical airlift missions but the army flies many approximately 47 c23s and 46 c12s intratheater aircraft99 in january 2006 it was reported that the two services were negotiating memorandum of understanding on procurement of this aircraft100 increased use of small intratheater airlifters to support ground troops engaged with nonstate actors suggests two additional cautionary issues first while aiming to improve the distribution of men and materiel increased use of small airlifters could create its own logistical challenges the marine corps notes that where small air units are maintained and operated on outlying auxiliary fields the problem of supplying fuel ammunition bombs and other supplies becomes considerable task101 second because intra theater airlifters will increasingly find themselves in harms way increased effort will likely be required to protect the aircraft and to create airlift warriors two examples include making the airlift aircraft more difficult to target or more survivable against manportable air defense systems manpads102 and providing increased survival escape resistance and evasion sere training for airlift personnel these two potential concerns may be mitigated to

issues appear to intersect with the acquisition of aircraft for stealthy transportation of troops engaged in antiterrorism or counterinsurgency operations cost and need as described earlier the specialized equipment on these aircraft tend to make them expensive to procure and operate unless coordinated closely however modernizing sof aircraft could incur increased om as well as new procurement costs the air forces csarx for example is expected to cost 6 billion to procure 194 new aircraft om costs are not known because the csarx is still notional the hh60g that it will replace however is 87 common with army h60 helicopters dod achieves or should achieve important economies of scale savings in operating large fleets of highly common systems such as h60 helicopters replacing the hh60 with new helicopter might not just incur 6 billion in new spending but could also increase om costs if new aircraft are unnecessarily dissimilar to others in the inventory another cost issue is what impact these relatively expensive programs may have on dods top line budget might they become targets for budget cutters in the fy2006 budget process in december electronic media outlets made available an internal dod program budget decision pbd 753 that recommended termination of the air forces c130j program and trimming 20 aircraft from the navys planned purchase over the future years defense plan fydp the pbd 753 obtained by the press also recommended cutting 22 aircraft from the planned purchase of v22s over the same time period107 such recommendations may be an indication that the upcoming budget cycle will be contentious also if implemented such recommendations could have direct impact on sofrelated insertionextraction aircraft by reducing funds driving up costs or potentially cancelling programs proponents justify many of the programs described above by the perception that todays aircraft are increasingly vulnerable to growing threats the air force and outside analysts often point out that many countries have access to surfacetoair missiles sams and information technologies that can be combined to form integrated air defense systems iads the potential proliferation of iads is one of the primary justifications put forth for developing and fielding advanced combat aircraft like the fa22 raptor108 it is not clear to others however that iads will be as threatening to lowflying helicopters already fielding selfprotection equipment as they will be to high flying fixedwing aircraft prior to operation desert storm for example iraq was thought to have robust and sophisticated iads the first shots in that war however were fired by ah64 apache helicopters 106 mx aircraft request for information august 2003 supplied to crs by usaf llw via email

operations mh53 helicopters109 in this case helicopters were deemed more survivable than fixedwing aircraft and were used to degrade iraqs iads so other aircraft could more freely operate it also appears that there may be different perspectives among the services regarding the vulnerability of todays helicopters the air force for example seeks the csarx in part because it is said to be more survivable than the hh60 helicopters it will replace110 however army special operations forces initiated service life extension program slep in 2004 for all their h60 aircraft this suggests that army leaders believe that h60 helicopters are sufficiently survivable albeit with upgrades and dont require near term replacement advanced integrated air defense systems iads will be fielded exclusively by nation states not nonstate actors nonstate actors will likely rely instead on man portable or vehiclemounted and easily transportable air defense systems nonstate actors will also tend to field those systems that they can easily access not necessarily the most advanced systems thus if iads are sufficiently threatening to justify new sof helicopters it may only be in the context of conflicts with states that sponsor terrorism rather than in conflicts with terrorists or insurgents themselves command control and communications c3 attacking nonstate actors may take us air forces to regions far from established military infrastructure or into conditions where ground forces are moving rapidly and out run their lineof sight communications employing air assets in these scenarios could be facilitated by command and control aircraft dedicated to matching ground forces requests for air support including the attack of fleeting targets with nearby air assets currently the air force has commandandcontrol aircraft dedicated to this mission owing to the retirement in 2002 of the ec130e airborne battlefield command and control center abccc during operation iraqi freedom the e3c awacs assumed many of the abccc tasks but reportedly they were at times unable to cope with the level of communications traffic as result there were times when the groundbased aircontrol staff in kuwait at the v corps headquarters were out of communication range of attack aircraft operating in the baghdad region111 air force officers experienced certain comfort in knowing that an ec130e was pushed forward and its sole mission was supporting cas and combat search and rescue csar communications while these officers say they were unsure whether awacs could satisfy the abcccs role in combat they

the e10 program in dods fy2007 budget while the air force appears to have taken recent steps that have decreased its airborne command and control capabilities the marine corps and army the services most directly engaged in combating nonstate actors on the ground appear to be taking steps to increase their airborne command and control capabilities the marine corps operates limited number of direct air support center airborne dasca terminals based on kc130 aircraft dedicated to this mission the aircraft were reportedly used in operation iraqi freedom much more than in previous conflicts however these assets may require upgrades to increase their effectiveness reportedly for example dasca crew used paper copies of the daily air tasking order ato to help direct aircraft and track their missions to date the system cannot maintain an electronic version of the ato or receive electronic updates117 this deficiency will likely limit the dascas capabilities in rapidly changing operational circumstances and appears in need of remedy the army has been using prototypes of its army airborne command and control system a2c2s in iraq for approximately one year the a2c2s is based on uh60l blackhawk helicopters and works as flying command post by allowing commanders at the brigade level and above to maintain digital command control and communications of ground forces engaged in warfighting and peacekeeping low rate initial production of the a2c2s began in december 2004 and as many as 120 systems could be fielded118 112 crs telephone conversation with representatives of

creating networkcentric approaches to warfighting that will improve current platformcentric capabilities depending on the specific capabilities desired the nodes of these various networks could be composed of numerous types of aircraft ships or ground vehicles uavs appear to be likely platform for increasing airborne communications and networking for forces operating in remote or austere environments in december 2004 the boeing company announced that it had demonstrated highspeed secure wireless communications relay on its scaneagle uav119 c3 in general and airborne c3 specifically could take on new prominence in operations against nonstate actors as more and more uavs are fielded and as aircraft take on roles eg scouting medical resupply often satisfied by ground forces dods top acquisition official for uavs asserted that dod has well over 400 uavs supporting current combat operations around the globe marked increase in number and capability from only two years ago120 in congressional testimony air force chief of staff general john jumper said that approximately 450 uavs were operating in iraq and that there may be need to better organize such large fleet121 weapons nonstate actors tend to offer smaller softer targets than military actors and they often shield themselves behind civilians or civilian infrastructure eg hospitals schools religious and cultural sites the applicability of smaller less destructive ordnance against nonstate actors has been recognized for 50 years the us marine corps small wars manual notes the bombing squadrons will find more use for their lighter bombs and offensive machine guns than they will for their major weapon the heavy demolition bomb122 in the more recent words of one high ranking israeli general in the past the more lethal something was the more effective it was now sometimes it is the exact opposite123 expanding dod capabilities against nonstate actors suggests increasing the ability to deliver weapons effects precisely many dod efforts to field aircraft targeting pods or to increase the precision of weapon guidance are likely applicable to targeting nonstate actors developing smaller ordnance increasing the aerial employment of guns developing retargetable munitions and fielding airborne non lethal weapons may have even greater application to the fight against nonstate actors than to conventional foes the air force is developing the small diameter bomb sdb which is half the weight of the smallest bomb the air force uses today the 500pound mark 82 improvements in targeting accuracy is hoped to

perception defense daily september 30 2004 crs34 as the 500 lb weapon yet even 250 lb weapon may be unnecessarily large for many nonstate actor targets risking unintended damage to noncombatants or friendly troops some argue that the 16 lb warhead on the agm114 hellfire anti armor munition is better suited for soft terrorist targets in close proximity to civilians and friendly forces inert warhead practice bombs may also be worth exploring these weapons have been used in recent conflicts where collateral damage was concern however because the nonexploding bomb would often ricochet and skip far from the target it was often not effective either at destroying the target or in limiting collateral damage124 some suggest that some sort of nonexplosive disintegrated kinetic device that would hit the target like 50lb sandbag at terminal velocity killing an individualbut leaving only cloud of dust as collateral damage would be worth investigation125 better or more pervasive employment of aircraft guns may offer the accuracy and low yield that operational planners desire when attacking nonstate actors current aircraft guns range from relatively modest 50 caliber machine guns to very powerful 105mm cannons these weapons can destroy vehicles and cause serious damage to buildings but do not produce the blast and fragmentation of aerial bombs that contribute to collateral damage two improvements may be considered to increase the applicability of using aerial guns against nonstate actors the first effort would be to reduce the chances of bullets ricocheting which could cause unintended damage to illustrate the potential effects of ricochet when combat aircraft train in airtoground strafing safety officers anticipate potential ricochets in an area as large as 50 square kilometers these effects could cause considerable collateral damage in an urban setting inert aircraft rounds are being developed that are said to reduce the chances of ricochet by 90 percent and the range of rounds that do ricochet to 10 square kilometers126 currently aerial guns are most effective against ground targets when the aircraft flies at relatively low altitudes where the aircraft is vulnerable to ground fire another improvement would be to develop firecontrol software that would provide accurate fire solutions for strafing at safe altitudes127 ground forces anticipating engagement with nonstate actors have been developing nonlethal weapons for many years many nonlethal weapons such as rubber bullets and tear gas are natural extrapolations from law enforcement experience the exploration of basing nonlethal weapons on military aircraft is less mature than ground forces employment but appears to be gaining momentum one 124 tim ripley close air support closing

airpower thinker has suggested some of the toughest decisions confronting our commanders arise from the fact that airpower can kill but cannot capture if we could detain individuals from the air until ground elements take custody of them many of these difficulties would subside128 number of airdelivered nonlethal weapons could be employed that would disperse crowds hold crowds in place provide means to track the movement of people or temporarily incapacitate small vehicles for example the air force and navy are developing nonlethal directedenergy weapons designed to control crowds in urban areas such as mobile version of raytheons active denial system ads millimeterwave beams of energy are being designed that induce an intolerable heating sensation on contact with the skin and might be used to disperse crowds 129 israel has developed nonlethal acoustic weapon designed for riot control called the shout this weapon can reportedly incapacitate crowds at 100m without causing permanent physical damage130 acoustic weapons such as this and flash bang grenades used to stun people could potentially also be air delivered several different devices could potentially be employed on aircraft that would electronically incapacitate vehicles also air delivered sticky slimes and foams have the effect of slowing down any sort of movement the coast guard is developing boat trap propellerfouling device deployed from helicopters this net could be applicable to stopping boats such as that used to attack the uss cole currently the coast guard stops boats with shots from helicopterborne 50 cal machine gun to boats engine which is deemed sub optimal solution131 air delivered dyes some invisible except to an ultra violet lens could be used to identify people or vehicles that had participated in terrorist or insurgency act those dyed could be allowed to leave crowded areas and be attacked or captured later when they were in more isolated areas similarly artificial snow could be sprayed on the ground immediately following terrorist attack in the hope that retreating terrorists would leave behind footprints at issue is whether these potential munitions improvements most relevant to the nonstate actor threat are being adequately funded and pursued also would more aggressive fielding of inert weapons and nonlethal devices carry risk what complications might fielding these less lethal weapons pose for military planners and logisticians who have to equip and deploy weapons useful against both conventional foes and nonstate actors some of these potential weapons may have high power requirements and may generate considerable heat which would limit the size and type of aircraft on which they could be employed some dyes and gases may have to 128 ibid 129 michael sirak us air force

priorities to more effectively combat nonstate actors may be difficult it may be far more difficult however to identify and implement changes to airpower planning doctrine coordination strategy and tactics required to better combat nonstate actors as described in the introduction to this paper these functions are described in aggregate as mindset changes in conjunction with the potential changes in acquisition priorities described in the previous section of this paper there appear to be at least two over arching mindset changes that merit consideration they are 1 decentralization vs centralization and 2 indirect vs direct action decentralization vs centralization the employment of airpower against modern conventional enemies focuses to great degree on getting inside the enemys ooda loop the ooda loop which stands for observe orient decide and act is generic construct for describing an enemys military decision making process by moving faster than the enemy can complete these decision making functions or by impairing these functions eg interdicting communications destroying radars and other sensors isolating c2 elements airpower planners hope to achieve rapid and decisive strategic effect on the adversary one observer notes however that unfortunately guerrillas follow strategy of protracted war like criminals they assume they cannot achieve rapid decisive effects and do not attempt to do so instead insurgent terrorist and criminal organizations consciously design themselves so that our military and police forces cannot rapidly and decisively defeat them132 organizations like qaeda have highly distributed command and control c2 systems they make strategic decisions and execute operational plans in decentralized ways on the other hand the tactical ooda loopin suicide bomber or guerrilla ambush as just two examples is instantaneous because the sensor the decision maker and the shooter are centralized in the same person key set of questions for policy makers focuses on whether current dod airpower doctrine is adequately suited for dealing with nonstate actors which operate in highly decentralized ways do currently planned joint experiments and exercises focus on combating such terrorists and guerrillas if not how will dod develop new operational concepts and strategies for defeating such non traditional foes currently the air force and army do not conduct exercises dedicated to close air support cas instituting such exercises could be considered133 132 searle op cit 133 michael sirak us air force eyes better integration with army janes defence weekly november 10 2004 crs37 just as nonstate actors decentralize their planning and execution the us military when fighting such enemies could adopt more decentralized planning and command and control of airpower however this approach may be viewed as anathema by some aviation leaders and may require determined oversight to explore fully this is because classic air doctrine calls for operations that are planned and controlled centrally but executed in decentralized manner this golden rule seeks to maintain unity of command while allowing improvisation by those directly engaged in combat air force doctrine dictates that air force assets be centrally commanded and controlled even when fighting terrorists and irregular forces134 centralized planning and control of airpower engaged in fighting distributed decentralized foe however may prove disadvantageous over 60 years ago the marine corps small wars manual identified the need to match the enemys decentralization with similar fluidity of command and independence of action the employment of small striking units will be frequent and independent missions for the division the rule rather than the exceptionthe air observer in small wars operations must be given greater latitude in estimating situation on the ground than he would be given in comparable position in major operations often the rapidly moving situation will not permit delay in the transmission of information to headquarters but requires immediate positive action on the part of the air patrol commander135 more contemporary analysts assert that combating nonstate actors is analogous to fighting decentralized and distributed criminal organizations and that airpower should more closely emulate law enforcement activities which are locally planned and executed136 one approach to decentralizing air operations against nonstate actors particularly in the area of close air support cas would be to coordinate air and ground forces at lower levels of organization than is currently practiced coordination at lowers levels can take place both within and between services it appears that steps are being taken by the army for instance to coordinate air and ground operations at lower command levels traditionally much of the armys aviation was found at the corps level according to army leaders however aircraft and aviation personnel are being moved from the corps to the division level and brigade aviation element will be attached to all army ground brigades137 while this may be step in the right direction questions remain army platoons 1640 soldiers and companies 100200 soldiers tend to be directly engaged with nonstate actors yet platoons and companies are far down the organizational ladder from 134 military operations

corps to the division level make an appreciable difference in the timeliness and effectiveness of aviation support to these small army organizations also some army ground units eg elements within the 82nd airborne 101st air assault 10th mountain divisions will likely require more air support than others have provisions been made to better coordinate air and ground operations at lower organizational levels within the army based on anticipated mission needs the increased fielding of army uavs may be one method of boosting airpower in support of ground troops and decentralizing airpower planning and control as part of its future combat system fcs program the army plans to field three classes of uavs the smallest system is intended to be manportable and used at the platoon level 1640 soldiers138 pervasively deploying uavs among the armys or the marine corps smallest ground units could facilitate the detection and targeting of nonstate actors as well as communication with larger ground units army or marine corps uavs could also potentially replace or augment manned aviation performing such roles as tactical airlift or medical resupply by owing and controlling these resources themselves small ground units may be able to employ them more fluidly and responsively to the anticipated tactical situation than would aircraft controlled by higher echelons of forces much operational air and ground coordination between the services such as between the army and the air force tends to occur at the battalion level and higher tactical air control parties tacps are typically composed of an air force officer who coordinates with the army battalions operations officer and three airmen three of the four have received extensive training to coordinate and control air strikes in support of ground forces many have suggested that tacps be embedded in army units smaller than the battalion such as companies or perhaps even platoons regularly integrating air controllers into lower levels or army organizations would require additional personnel than currently are trained for this mission while this integration could help decentralize airtoground coordination and facilitate airground forces coordination which service would provide these additional air controllers is not clear the army is reportedly interested in increasing the training its artillery fire support officers receive to enable them to also control aircraft joint force air controller program with standardized training and procedures might be part of this process according to some army leaders the army needs to be able to train its own soldiers to call in air strikes to supplement what the air force provides having just one person with critical skill in any directfire ground combat unit is recipe for disaster139 138 lisa troshnisky fcs uav technology will be ready when funding is official says aerospace daily defense report november 2 2004 139 greg jaffe getting us forces together poses challenge for war plan wall street journal february 11 2003 crs39 the air force has reportedly resisted this idea and would prefer to satisfy the armys need for additional controllers by increasing the number of air force air controllers140 according to press reports air force officials are skeptical about turning over the mission to army troops air force controllers who get five years of training have to juggle as many as dozen planes each carrying different kinds of bombs with different capabilities air force officials question whether there are enough planes in their arsenal to train more army controllers141 some air force air controllers point out that profound cultural differences exist between how the army and the air force perceives airpower and that army air controllers may not employ aircraft as effectively as air force air controllers even if trained to the same standards142 the marine corps appears to be facing similar problem shortage of air controllers to meet the needs of companysized and smaller units to increase the number of air controllers the marine corps allowed nonaviators to train for this mission143 in october 2004 the air force announced the creation of joint airground operations jago office that would serve as focal point for this mission area while this appears welcome step the jagos stated goals for both the near and medium time frame were technology improvements not the more difficult but potentially equally valuable doctrinal considerations described above144 speedy resolution of how best to increase the number of air controllers or otherwise encourage the decentralization of airground operations may require oversight from senior decision makers direct action vs supporting or advisory activities the question confronting policy makers is how much emphasis should be placed on involving airpower directly against nonstate actors compared to advising and supporting allied airpower activities or allocating resources mainly to ground units and security personnel searching for terrorist leaders exploring and resolving this question could have profound impact on procurement training and om budgets one challenge for air forces engaged in direct action against nonstate actors is that they often operate in politically charged environments where their presence can exacerbate tensions between governments friendly toward the united states and local populations that may be sympathetic to terrorists in its field manual on 140 elizabeth rees army official air force resisting joint fire

converting the conflict into usonly war that combat role can also further alienate cultures that are hostile to the us145 another consideration is that directly engaging nonstate actors in many cases requires highly specialized equipment such as mh53j pave low helicopters as just one example this equipment tends to be expensive and currently of limited quantity personnel also tend to be highly trained and in limited quantity the marine corps notes for example that due to adverse operational conditions and the need to often act independently fighting nonstate actors requires large percentage of seasoned and highly trained pilots146 these specialized forces are required in some number for action against conventional foes but growing need to combat nonstate actors might stress the current force structure or demand that it be increased the need for indirect involvement of military aviation such as aviation foreign internal defense afid in conflicts with nonstate actors is widely accepted one observer asserts that one of the most important roles that us forces can play in the fight against terrorist groups is to train advise and assist the forces of other nations in counterinsurgency and counterterrorist operations147 also strengthening friendlynation airpower eg philippine military air forces engaged in conflicts with muslim insurgents could reduce the chances that us forces would have to get directly involved further if us forces do have to get directly involved good afid will likely increase the options available us commanders by providing more competent coalition partners148 some argue that dod already overemphasizes direct action against nonstate actors for example one observer writes that the specialization of afsof aircraft such as the ac130 mc130 mh53j and now the cv22 reflects the emphasis on directaction making them particularly expensive complex and logistically demanding if it is the tendency for conventional aviators to think in terms of hightech conventional platforms then it should come as surprise that special operations aviators similarly think almost exclusively in terms of their own specialized platforms149 those that advocate increasing supporting airpower functions such as advising allies in aviation foreign internal defense argue that afid is consistent with underlying national strategy for example when the 6th special operations squadron was being established the goal was to create unit capable of supporting then defense secretary dick cheneys contention that our role is not to shoulder the burden 145 as reported

149 ibid crs41 ourselves but to assist others in defending themselves150 these sentiments have been echoed by senior bush administration officials regarding the ongoing conflict in iraq afid advocates argue that the need to assist others in defending themselves is even greater today than it was in 1991 for example the changes brought about by 911 in the international environment and the direction taken by the 2003 national security strategy seems to make forces capable of fid operations not conventional warfare the most likely force jour for the us armed forces151 aviation foreign internal defense afid advocates also say that afid allows the united states to influence the shape and capabilities of foreign air forces in ways that can not only combat insurgents but also promote stability visavis neighboring countries by helping the pakistani air force improve its counter guerrilla capabilities for example afid advisors could also attempt to lead pakistan away from an air force capable of conducting deep offensive air strikes that might threaten india in essence us afid advisors could help pakistan build coast guard rather than navy152 finally while afid advisors could still risk alienating local populations hostile to us activity in given country the afid footprint would likely be much smaller than direct involvement of us airpower and could reduce the chances of alienating the population the air force special operations command afsoc describes afid as complement to direct action policy makers wishing to elevate afid from complement to an activity equal in scope to afsocs direct action may consider increasing the 6sos resources the 6sos annual budget of approximately 56 million is small fraction of the special operations commands roughly 2 billion budget for procurement rdte and om153 historically the 6sos has encountered difficulties acquiring the types of fixed and rotarywing aircraft it needs to advise developingworld air forces scholars suggest that purchasing these relatively low tech aircraft runs counter to air force cultural bias toward acquiring technologically advanced aircraft154 further 6sos personnel require specialized training that allows them to operate independently in austere and foreign environments advocates maintain that augmenting the 6sos budget would sustain or improve this training and allow the 6sos to increase its personnel on the other hand advancing the air forces afid activities may require more than increased resources several observers have noted that the 6sos unique mission and practices have made it something of redheaded stepchild within the 150 afsoc foreign internal defense hurlburt field hq afsoc july 1991 p 8 as cited in johnson the 6th special operations squadron and the icarus syndrome p 7

air force leaders155 some say that finding ways to give the 6sos more traction within the air force bureaucracy may be another way to foster increased afid capabilities they cite requesting annual reports on afid or elevating the rank of the squadrons commander currently lieutenant colonel or making this joint organization as three potential approaches in november 2005 it was announced that 2660 marines would join the special operations command in addition to two battalions of trigger pullers approximately 800 of the marines will be specialists in intelligence logistics and foreign internal defense156 supporters of improving afid capabilities could see this as an opportunity if the marine corps is now willing to place its troops under the control of socom some might argue that the timing is right to augment the 6sos with detachment of marine aviators adding marines to the 6sos would not just increase the squadrons manpower but would also likely improve knowledge and processes among all parties as marine corps experience with close air support and fid is introduced to the air force creating joint capability in afid could also raise the bureaucratic prominence of the 6sos some might argue others might argue that such joint marriages tend to take time to implement and that the cultural melding of air force and marine corps aviation assets wont likely happen in the near future 155 mccarthy op cit p28 156 bradley graham elite marine unit to help fight terrorism washington post november 2 2005 for other versions of this document see
