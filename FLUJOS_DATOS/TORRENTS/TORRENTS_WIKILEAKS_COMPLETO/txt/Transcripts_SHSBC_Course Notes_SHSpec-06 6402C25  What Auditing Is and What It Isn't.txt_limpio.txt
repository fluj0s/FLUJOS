6402c25 shspec6 what auditing is and what it isnt lrh is the first survivor of the battle of the goals plot gpms contain trickery and treachery that is why one hitherto has figured them out routine 3 didnt bite deep even running oppose didnt get much depth of bite when you move it into solve you are beginning to get into dangerous areas the tiger can bite your head off but you cant get back at him in r6 you are handling pure starving tigers for definition of r6 see p 568 above someone who could handle the oppose line easily will find enough aberration to make powerful being unpowerful on the actual gpm line quantitatively and qualitatively the data of this lecture is valuable at all levels but it is vital at levels v and vi it is so simple that you may think that there is nothing there to grasp there is also confusion that blows off as one attempts to grasp it the following is pure piece of data that is incredibly difficult to tr3 over to somebody i am going to tell you 1 the difference between auditing and assessing 2 the difference between destimulating and erasing 3 the difference between ptp and an arc break 4 the targets of the auditor which are the pc b the bank the auditor speaks either to the pc or to the bank auditing and the auditing cycle is addressed to the pc assessing is addressed to the bank when the auditor talks to the pc he often restimulates the bank he has an influence on it but he is still talking to the pc sometimes during an assessment the pc talks and the auditor must acknowledge the origination but these are separate actions auditing has only two products destimulation and erasure see also pp 486487 above for illustrations of destimulation and erasure or discharge you can get the pc out of it or you can use the pc to wipe it out the first is destimulation the second is erasure destimulation gets the dogs that are barking at the pc to lie down and be quiet and the pc to come away from there auditing wipes out the dogs dont try to erase ptp that requires auditing and ptps prevent auditing you destimulate ptps so that you can audit you can get the pc to dust himself off destimulation or you can use the pc like an ink eraser erasure some auditors specialize in trying to erase everything but never really get anything erased it is ok to erase anything as long as you complete your cycles of action but the lower levels of auditing are practically all destimulation not erasure if an auditor cant destimulate pc he can never take up his own cycle of action because the pcs restimulation takes charge if the pc is elsewhere when you start the session and the cycle of action you will never complete the cycle of action that you start destimulation is the only action that you can undertake to get pc located and oriented dont try to audit when all you should or can be doing is destimulation where did it happen where are you now is destimulation so is prepcheck since an auditor cant complete his cycle of action unless he first destimulates the pc destimulation is very important skill running engrams ris implant gpms etc are all erasure even in destimulation tiny amount of erasure takes place just the pcs attention on the subject for short time brings about erasure of bit of it the fact that certain amount of the incident runs out during destimulation is shown by the fact that pc experiences somatics during assists we just hit the keyin and erase that you can also destimulate something and then run out the incident you could use effort processing or run the engram cf running locks secondaries and engrams on subjects if you do this though complete the cycle of destimulating first or you will leave some attention stuck on what you were destimulating which in the course of destimulating you also restimulated somewhat not completing the destimulation cycle will make it that much harder to erase what you wanted to erase you dont want the pc to come out of destimulation attempt involving mata hari with his feet still all tangled up in silk stockings and old german documents complete cycles of actions once started if you start to erase something erase it dont abandon it in order to go erasing something else in level vi ideally when you get gpm you erase it this is complicated by the fact that that gpm is connected to the one above it and the one below it but you could erase the middle in practice you consider the whole first series of goals one action and erase that or half the first series then the rest of it see p 591 below for an explanation of the goals series the heart of certainty is arrival at the end of cycle of action the anatomy of uncertainty is failure to complete cycle of action rapid methods of destimulation are necessary for instance sincemidruds are needed to keep incipient bpc cleaned up and out of the road for the rest of the session life is restimulative the purpose of ruds is destimulation when the pc brings up something that is not in the auditors main line of action the auditor destimulates it and goes back to his main action case analysis is the tech that destimulates unwanted resurgences of case its purpose is handling ptps as they arise the activity of figuring out where gpms fit which has been called case analysis we now call track analysis case analysis is widelevel activity that can be used at any level it is just finding what the pc is sitting in and getting his considerations so while you are working on one gpm if the pc gets his attention on another one destimulate it with case analysis and go back to the first action otherwise leaving him stuck in one mass you let him go to another mass and he will get overrestimulated the rule applies to all levels make up your mind about what you are doing and complete your cycle of action what is auditing auditing is the action of asking pc question which he can understand and answer getting an answer to that question and acknowledging him for that answer and then also when the person originates auditing involves understanding and handling that origination that is all auditing is it is tr0 1 2 3 and 4 when that occurs ta action occurs and sanity occurs auditing is not assessing auditing may have the purpose of making someone feel better but that has nothing to do with the definition of auditing or with what auditing is the fact that someone feels better after an assessment does not mean that it was auditing therefore from the above definition you cant have selfauditing the technique is scientology but auditing is this one action if you understand the above to apply to all auditing you will be fantastic as an auditor you will find gold at the end of the rainbow nothing is very difficult about getting result if you just do what is in that definition what makes the pc better is not the technique you use it is simply the auditing comm cycle auditing is cycle of action and that twoterminal aspect which is what this physical universe consists of is what gives you tone arm action and is what makes pc better its not technique that makes pc better and it never will be auditing is the carrier wave that handles anything and everything for the pc there is another activity an auditor can do besides auditing assessment auditing goes mainly to the pc assessment never goes to pc it goes to the bank therefore by definition it is not auditing you can never assess pc who thinks that he is being addressed if you are trying to assess and the pc is trying to communicate with you or if he thinks that you are trying to communicate with him you will get messed up when the auditing cycle is out assessment cannot occur in that the pc hasnt understood that it is not an auditing cycle that he is engaged in and he cant just sit there and be assessed he is nervous and restimulated and his mind is darting all over the place even so if you ask the question just where the mind is it reads through all his mental busywork r2h is not really an assessment even though you go down prepared list because you are really asking the pc those questions and setting up 2wc about things that have occurred in the comm cycle if pc gets arc broken during an assessment it is because he has originated something which you havent acknowledged he does not get arc broken because you are assessing sometimes you sandwich auditing in with the assessment but they are still two separate activities the ta action that you get when you find an actual ri occurs when you have an auditing cycle going it does not occur without the auditing cycle an assessment even of correct ri is not what gives ta action it is the auditing comm cycle that gives ta that is why when you ask is that your item you get ta action in the form of big blowdown it is not because the pc contacts the item he is already in the middle of it so on solo auditing the pc would get needle actions but not ta action assessment doesnt give you ta action an arc break assessment is given when the pc has an arc break this assessment list has other uses but the arc break assessment simply consists of assessing the list getting the read and indicating it to the pc during an arc break you must not audit an arc break is when the auditing comm cycle cannot take place it isnt anything else the pc is upset and accusative he wont talk to you if you force comm cycle at that time you will only deepen the arc break at that point you do nothing else but an arc break assessment when you have real arc break you assess it always know your tools so that you can do the right assessment whether it be session arc break or an arc break from the particular action that you are on as long as you are addressing with auditing an area of disability in the pc you will get ta
