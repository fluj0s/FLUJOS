6108c17 shspec41 rudiments and valences an emeter ceases to register in the presence of an outrudiment this may fool you into thinking process is flat if you get the rudiments in the process will again move the ta and needle keeping rudiments in is the most important part of auditing you can find the rudiment because only the out rud will move the meter details on goals running valence is synthetic beingness or beingness which pc is not but thinks he is it can be duplicate of any existing beingness or synthetic beingness created by what others have said about the other beingness there is such thing really as ones own valence his own valence is just himself hes either himself or in valence valence is package graph is picture of valence and any change you got was because you shifted his valence this is very important datum the pc will not gain in any way through any effort to alter the characteristics of valence hes in the pc will only change if you change the valence as whole package because the pc takes responsibility for any of the nowimsupposedtos or the package of characteristics which is the valence all the person can reach is knowingness of the identity of the valence what does the pc use the valence for survival the road out surmounted by knowingness valence is solid knowingness body is solid knowingness valence is an effort to get someone to know you are there to get someone to recognize something therefore they are road out of unwanted areas say soldier gets hit with mortar shell he doesnt want to be there hes in the wrong valence that knowingness valence is now invalidated and becomes notknowingness so he exteriorizes and decides that the only way to fight war is to be general or war correspondent if he cant be that hell keep on trying war after war life after life finally he gets it together and becomes very successful at it then he finds all war correspondents being shot for fomenting war as he is shot he decides hell be mata hari he gets female body moves on up the line becomes mata hari in war after war then eventually he gets executed for that etc these are all efforts to solve the problem of what to do in war every valence picked up is an effort to solve problem valences are antiquated solutions so you can say these identities are antiquated solutions to confusions the goals which go towards beingness are the more definite goals they are the more profitable ones in auditing because they go toward identity person is not himself he is in different knowingness as soon as hes in valence you can fix up valences broken leg as long as its valence that isnt supposed to have broken leg which is why you can do assists on almost anyone the only person it will fail on is someone who has nowimsupposedto of valence the pc has control over this any pc is being dominatedly in given valence but may be tortured or upset by other valences which are only really the concern of the valence he is mainly in so any pcs troubles are only the troubles of the valence hes in the troubles are part of the nowimsupposedtos of this valence so theres way to remedy the difficulties on the valence because they are outside the power of the pc to touch here you get the oddity of please audit but youd better not make well thats what it looks like the valence may have somatics turning on and off as part of the package which keep the valence from becoming something else the pc will keep the somatics to prevent himself from becoming an unworkable solution to future problem dont try to take that solution away from the pc so long as it seems vital that it be solution what youve got to do is to get the pc to face up to the various factors that make that valence you cant make valence well you can move valence so any process run at random on pc has very small chance of success this preselects our bag of tricks to small bag you must ask yourself is this process going to change familiarize accustom the person to identity or is it going to handle environments which make identities vital or is it going to alter valences if so it will work and stay working if not it wont what makes valence stick the way it sticks lets newly define psychotic as someone who doesnt know whats going on in his environment and who doesnt know what is going on inside himself its all unknown and unobserved neurosis is when hes got some idea of whats happening in his environment and where he is but this is overbalanced by unknowingness upscale from that you know whats happening where you are but not whats happening inside someone else few feet away you dont always know whats going on with everybody that makes slight unknowingness the stuck parts of your track are the points where you knew what was going on where you were but not what was going on around you because there are points of disagreement there was know facing an unknow the unknow can get so overwhelming that one adopts valence to solve it you pick up valence which knows about these things many scientists are solely being valences of scientists theyve got it confused with the whole track beingness of technician when you see the level of pretense of valence it becomes spotted for you it seems artificial anyone whos identified himself by some set of tricks has thereby put himself in valence the fact that hes in body is an obvious valence but its the valence that hes using the body to be thats the auditing target just having body isnt necessarily valence if hes aware of having body not ploughed in below his level of consciousness as an auditing target valence is the mip package person has composed to solve the problems of existence which he knows nothing about its always easier to pick up weaker valence than stronger one so your logical target in auditing is the weaker one if your pc has bunch of chronic somatics theyre part of the valence picture not part of the pc hes got to have two counteropposed identities in order to feel pain 1957 was when this was worked out to have experience hed have to survive to survive he has to be something other than himself otherwise he cant survive experience and live you havent chance in handling this person until he realizes that he can live without the valence hes been in games condition as valence against some environment which probably longer exists women are particularly confused here because at the present time the society is in flux and has really clear idea of where women fit in so women have more problems finding the valence to solve the problem of situations theyre not really in anyway identity crisis to straighten out case youve got to move valence say fellow has toothache youve got to find out who had toothache c 1950 tech and split the valences this is more effective than putting him in comm with the tooth since its not his tooth whatever his difficulties find out who had it or would do it cf xdn wants handled rundown you could say what beingness would be good solution for tough environment you process whos valences if you want to cure toothache run it back and forth with who would want to cure toothache who would have toothache and get terminal to cure the toothache you already have the goal of course you can also use this technique for the hidden standard for long time we had the question should we handle solids or significances the answer is solids but the further answer is that you shouldnt handle conditions of valence handle the valence this is the limitation of touch assist always handle the terminal this brings prehav 13 into the limelight prehav 13 process which takes list of charged terminals and combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets on levels assessed out see 6106c21 shspec17 or p 42 these notes prehav 13 will also fix up rudiments
