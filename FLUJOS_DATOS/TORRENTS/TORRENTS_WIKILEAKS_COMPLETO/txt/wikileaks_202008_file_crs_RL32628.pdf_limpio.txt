both medicaid and schip provi access to an array of visionrelated services including vision screening services that can help children in low to moderateincome families overcome these difficulties medicaids mandatory early and periodi c screening diagnosis and treatment epsdt benefit ensures access to vision sc reening services for children however there are several other medi caid benefit categories where vision screening services may be delivered often such services are billed as part of wellchild visit under schip statespecific benefit packages must provide wellbaby and wellchild care which includes vision screening compone nt as with medicaid the wellchild coverage requirement is not the only service category where children could receive vision screening under schip children ma also receive visi on screening services under other schipcovered services such as physician services june 2000 crs benefits survey provide s some clues as to access to vision services under schip medicaid expansion and separate state progra ms at that time nearly all medicaid and schi p programs covered vision services for children and most also covered eye glasses the survey data indicates that the breadth of vision related benefits ava ilable under these two programs lik ely differs within and across states coverage policies and benefit limits for the lowestincome children as described in state medicaid plans are seldom absolute because of epsdt for nearly all medicaid children states are required to pr ovide all federally allowed treatment to correct identified problems even if the specific treatment needed is not otherwise covered under states medicaid plan as result when medicaid agency reports that specific benefit is not covered for children that means the service is available only when delivery of that serv ice meets the epsdt requirement services for higheri ncome children under schip are sometimes more restrictive unlike medicaid but consistent with federal statute separate schip programs are modeled after private sect or commercial insurance products the requirement to use benchmark plans or act uarial equivalents of those plans most of which are state employee health plan s or commercial hmo plans provides the framework for defining benefit limits under commercial insurance products benefits are always limited by medical n ecessity but other limits may apply and will vary by insurance product as do proce dures to monitor for medical need and appropriateness payments to providers participating in these plans may be altered based on the outcome of such service utilization reviews which can in turn affect access to care this re port will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32628contents background 1 what are vision services nd what types of

are treatable but the potential for correction that will lead to normal visual development diminishes with age thus early detection and treatment are necessary to ensure the best possibl outcome common vision disorders or abnormalities in visual velopment among children include the following2 amblyopia amblyopia or lazy eye is diminished vision in one eye resulting from altered visual development where the part of the brain that controls vision favors one eye ove r the other if the weaker eye is untreated eyesight will progressively worsen this disorder is the most common cause of vision loss in children in the united states affecting approxima tely 5 of the child population3 treatment for amblyopia includes corrective lenses eye surgery miotic eye drops or other therapies including occl usion ie covering of the opposite eye or optical blurring amblyopia is often caused by strabismus misalignment of the eyes resulting in one eye being used less than the

providers that generally offer such services vision screening services vision screening servi ces include procedures to detect poor vision or risk factors th at interfere with vi sion and normal visual development such services may be provi ded in variety of settings eg schools health clinics child care settings optometri sts office etc and may be conducted by variety of qualified health servi ce providers eg sc hool nurses parent volunteers medical practitioners optometrists etc primary vision care and related services optometrists provide most primary vision care primary vision care includes eye exams to diagnose vision problems and eye diseases and to test patients visual acuity depth and color perception and ability to focus and coordinate the eyes in general an optometrists role is to analyze test results and develop treatment plan optometrists prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses and provide vision therapy and lowvision rehabilitation they are qualified to admin ister drugs to patients to aid in the diagnosis of vision problems and to prescr ibe drugs to treat some eye diseases optometrists often provide preoperative and postoperativ care to patients who have vision correction or other eye surgery they also diagnose conditions due to systemic diseases such as di abetes and high blood pressure re ferring patients to other health practitioners as needed ophthalmologists are physicians who specialize in eye care like optometrists they provide primary vision care serv ices like those listed above however in addition they diagnose and tr eat eye diseases deformities and injuries that require surgery eye surgery eye surgery includes procedures performed by ophthalmologists to correct physical deformities or to repair tissue after injuries or preventive surgeries on patients with debilitating diseases or disorders eye glasses and corrective contact lenses eyeglasses and contact lenses are aids to vision prescribed by physician skilled in diseases of the eye or by an optometrist opticians fit eye glasses and in some states may fit contact lenses according to prescriptions written by ophthalmologists or optometrists some opticians

and by geographic region8 1999 vision screening policies and procedures survey among the 50 states and the district of columbia showed that 34 states had guidelines for preschool age vision screening even though consensus among vision care experts recomme nds that eye screenings occur as early as childbirth two additional states ie virginia and washington had preschool vision screening guidelines but only for children with disabilities further in most states mandatory vision screening did not occur until the children entered kindergarten the survey also indicated that there was little consensus across states on the ages at which children should be sc reened the areas of vision that should be evaluated the appropria tests to administer or th types of personnel that should administer the screening eg school nur ses aides teachers volunteer parent assistants medical practitioners trained technicians etc the authors concluded that even among states with wellestablished vision screening policies there is guarantee that the procedures in place would effectively identify children who require further examination by trained ey care specialist i optometrist or ophthalmologist9 in april 2003 four prof essional organizations10 concerned with childrens eye care developed guidelines to be used by physicians nurses educational institutions public health departments and other professionals w ho perform vision screening services for infants children and young dults the guidelines establish that eye examinations and vision screening should be performed on newborns at birth and at all wellchild visits in addition visual acuity measurement tests eg picture tests snellen numbers or the tumbling test s hould be performed as early as possible usually at 3 years of age the guidelines also establish criteria for appropriate number timing and ageappropr iate procedures for each eye evaluation finally the guidelines recommend that children found to have an ocular bnormality or who fail vision screening should be referred to pediatric ophthalmologist or an eye care specialist appropriately traine d to treat pediatric patients11 many of the public health programs lis ted above eg head start medicaids epsdt program and mch with mandatory vision sc reening requirements rely instead on the recommendations for preventive pediatric health care periodicity

some states classified as separate stat program states have more than one such program program totals include the outlying areasmentioned above the aaps recommendations are far less detailed in that they do not identify specific ageappropriate proce dures for each eye evaluation or the level of training required by individuals who perfo rm the screenings instead they indicate ages for which vision screening should be performed either subjectively based on the childs medical history or objectivel based on standa rd testing method the schip program background schip was established in 1997 under ne w title xxi of the social security act and provides health insurance to certain uninsured children in families with modest income total of 397 billion has been appropriated for schip for fy1998 through fy2007 approximately 58 million children were enrolled in schip during fy2003 nationally throug h fy2003 137 billion in federal dollars had been spent under the program in general title xxi defines targeted lowincome child as one who is under the age of 19 years with health insuran ce and who would not have been eligible for medicaid under the rules in effect in the state on march 31 1997 states may set the upper income level for targeted lowin come children up to 200 of the federal poverty level fpl13 or if the applicable medicaid income level for children is at or above 200 fpl prior to schip the upper income limit may be ra ised an additional 50 percentage points above that level as of fy2002 the upper inco eligibility limit under schip had reached 350 fpl in ne w jersey nearly onehalf 24 of the states and the district of columbia had established upper income limits at 200 fpl another 13 states exceeded 200 fpl the remaining 13 states set maximum income limits below 200 fpl within these general rules states may provide child health assistance to qualifying children in two basic ways th ey may cover children under their medicaid programs andor they may create sepa rate schip program more details on available benefits under each approach are described in the next section when states provide medicaid coverage to targ eted lowincome children medicaid rules typically apply when states provide coverage to targeted lowincome children through separate schip programs title xxi rules typically apply in both cases the federal share of program co sts comes from federal schip appropriations as of july 2004 17 states had medicaid expansions 18 had separate state programs and 21 used combination approach14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32628crs6 15 the two broad eligibility categories descri bed in medicaid statute include categorically needy and medically needy categorically need refers to lowincome families and children aged or individuals who are blind or have disability and certain pregnant women who are eligible for medicaid medically needy indivi duals are persons who fall into one of the categorically needy groups but whose income and resources are too high to qualify as categorically needy 42 cfr 4354 special benefits rules apply if states choose to cover medically needy populations states may offer more restricted benefit pa ckage for those enrollees but are required at minimum to offer the following prenatal and delivery services for pregnant women ambulatory services for individuals under 18 and those entitled to institutional services and home health services for individuals entitled to nursing facility services broader requirements apply if state has chosen to provide coverage for medically needy persons in institutions for mental disease and intermed iate care facilities for the mentally retarded if so the state is required to cover either all of the mandatory services or alternatively the optional services listed in any seven of the categories of care and services in medicaid law defining covered benefitstitle xxi does not establish an individual entitlement to benefits instead title xxi entitles states with approved state plans for medicaid coverage or separate schip programs to predetermined federal allotments based on distribution formula set in the law however targeted wincome children cove red under medicaid are entitled to the benefits offere d under that program as dict ated by medicaid law such individual entitlement exists for targeted lowincome children covered in separate schip programs visionrelated benefits under schip medicaid expansion programs under medicaid including schip dicaid expansion programs some benefits are mandatory and ot hers may be covered at stat option states that choose to expand medicaid to new eligibles under schip authority must provide the full range of mandatory medicaid benefits for the categorically needy as well as all optional services covered15 some categories of service have an obvious connection to vision screening while others do not this is in part due to the fact that many of the benefit categories listed in statute identify type of provider or care setting rather than type of service for example as discussed above wide variety of qualified providers may deliver vision screening services under medicaid including physicians optometrists and other qualified providers and enrollees may access visionrelated services in variety of settings such as hospital or rural health clinic the medicaid mandatory categories of service that all states must offer to their categorically needy groups and that are likely to include vi sionrelated benefits such as vision screenings eye exams and treatment of eye diseases or visual impairments eg eye surgery or eye glasses are inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32628crs7 16 doctor of optometry though not an md is considered physician for all the covered vision care services heshe is legally authorized to perform in the state in which heshe performs them social security act 1861r and 42 cfr 41020b 17 epsdt is not mandatory benefit for the dically needy although states that choose to extend epsdt to their medically needy population must make the benefit available to all individuals under age 21 18 social security act 1905rphysician services eg

benefits that can include vision care are eye glasses clinic services certain diagnostic screening preventive and rehabilitative services certain nurse practitioner services certain targeted case management services and prescription drugs finally under medicaid states can apply for waivers to modify virtually all aspects of their programs without cong ressional review under the section 1115 waiver authority states may test major restructuring of their medicaid program states have the flexibility to experiment with different approaches for the delivery of health care services or to adapt their programs to the special needs of particular geographic areas or groups of recipients as of the fall of 2003 there were 53 operational medicaid section 1115 waiver programs in 32 st ates and the district of columbia while none of these waivers sp ecifically focus on visi onrelated benefits some provide access to such services th rough redefined bene fit packages andor provide visionrelated services for popula tion groups that would not otherwise be covered such as parent s and childless adults medicaids epsdt service category coverage polic ies and benefit limits for children under medicaid are seldom absolute in part because of special provisions in the law requiring that children receive all medically necessary services authorized in federal statute through the epsdt program the epsdt program provides screening and preventive care to n early all groups of dicaid beneficiaries under 21 years of age17 furthermore under epsdt states are required to provide all federallyallowed treatment to corr ect problems identified through screenings even if the specific treatment need ed is not otherwise covered under states medicaid plan 18 thus states may be required to cover some services for children that would be optional or not covered at all for adults this guarantee does not exist in schip instead schip children have access to benefit packages modeled afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32628crs8 19 section 1905r of the social security act spec ifies that each state must develop its own periodicity schedule for screening vision he aring and dental services after appropriate consultation with medical and dental organizati ons involved in child health care by law the cms may not require states to use any pa rticular periodicity schedule for the

part of their schip state plan nor except in the case of immunizations has cms endorsed specific professional standard ie periodicity schedule for wellbaby and wellchild car coverage under schip plans apart from immunizations and dental services cms allows states to define wellbaby and wellchild care for coverage purposes finally as with medicaid states may apply for section 1115 waivers to modify program rules that establish special programs or demons tration projects to accommodate unique needs currently 12 states have such waivers under schip while none of these waivers specifically focus on

in 2000 the congressional research service crs contracted with the national academy for state health policy nashp to collect data from medicaid and schip state agencies on limits placed on selected benefits fo r children under each program two parallel survey instruments25 were developed with ex tensive input from state officials one for medicaid programs and one for separa state schip programs

medicaid agency will not reimburse the provider for that service examples of other common utilization controls include 1 concurrent review which means an authorized entity eg state medicaid agency or contractor reviews services while they are being provided to given beneficiary for example hospital stays may be subject to concurrent review when they exceed specified length of stay and 2 utilization review which is generic term encompassing all reviews of service provision whether they happen prospectively concurrently or retrospectively 27 the amount duration and scope of physician services was not captured on the medicaid portion of the benefits survey because coverage of physician services is mandatory under medicaid when medically necessary for children all benefits mandatory or optional are essentially unlimited due to epsdt 28 personal communication with cindy ruff cms may 4 2004 29 the state medicaid manual does not require st ates to break out vision services from other screening services under epsdt also as discussed above the cms form 416 longer captures vision screening services sepa rately from other screening servicescontinued services was necessary the benefit was identified as unlimited state officials could also indicate that limits for specific benefit were absolute meaning that children could not receive more than the specified amounts even with

and wy contracted with one or more managed care plans to deliver care to schip children ca for example contracted with 23 comprehensive health plans 31 faced with declining state revenues and increasing medical care expenses states implemented number of cost containment strategies for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 according to the national associa tion of state budget officers medicaid and other state healthcare issues current trends june 2003 majority of the medicaid cutbacks focused on containing prescription dr ug costs reducing provider reimbursement rates and eliminating or reducing optional services and populations eg eliminating coverage for certain qualified alien children and eliminating optional services such as dental optometry and podiatry services under schip ab out one third of states implemented cost containment measures in fy2003 or planned to do so in fy2004 examples of such containment strategies include capping prog ram enrollment increasing beneficiary cost sharing requirements and reducing provider payment rateseyeglasses and other aids to vision prescribed by physician skilled in diseases of the eye or an optometrist are often c overed under medicaids eye glasses service category or epsdt but may be cove red under different benefit category depending on the state like medicaid schip has more than one benefit category listed in statute that would encompass vision screening services several could apply here eg physician services clinic services and other ambul atory health care services and any other medical diagnostic screening preventive restorative remedial therapeutic or rehabilitative services in sum each of the four categories of service used in the surveys likely corresponds to multiple benef its listed in both medicaid and schip statute this is an important problem for the survey desi gn because very different limits may apply to vision screening services as incl uded on the surveys when delivered as physician service versus medical diag nostic screening preventive restorative remedial therapeutic or rehabilitative serv ice for example for this reason the survey data are imprecise to further complicate the picture bot h medicaid and schip programs rely on managed care organizations mcos to liver services to most beneficiaries especially for children without disabilities30 there are likely to be variations in coverage of and limits placed on specific benefits across medi caid andor schip managed care plans in given state detailed data on variations in benefit limits specific to individual managed care cont racts under each state program which can differ from the general criteria delineated in schip state plans as reported here were not captured also these data date from 2000 while th survey data serve as baseline documenting general coverage policies in place during strong economic period when many states were expanding their medicaid and schip programs states may have changed coverage policies since that time31 the results from the two surveys represent general statewide benefit limit policies for broad classifications of vision related services for children under

must be done with care because the term limits does not have the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32628crs21 meaning across these two programs for example state medicaid plans may indicate that children are limited to one eye exam per year but children who need more than one such visit in year can obtain additiona l visits as long as the provider of care demonstrates the medical necessity for mo re visits stated limits on benefits under medicaid reflect what providers can generally expect to be paid for in the absence of official clearance for more services rather than absolute limits on what beneficiaries may receive although additional c onditions governing provider reimbursement eg prior authorization may eff ectively alter receipt of serv ices in addition as noted above when medically necessary for children all benefits manda tory or optional are essentially unlimited due to epsdt by contrast separate schip programs are modeled after private sector commercia l insurance products under commercial insurance products benefits are always limited by medical necessity but other limits may apply as well for this reason under schip quality limits are sometimes more restrictive conclusion small but significant proportion of ch ildren have visual impairments when detected early many childhood vision abnor malities are treatable but the potential for correction and normal visual development diminishes with age medicaid and schip provide access to an array of visionrelated services including screening that can help children in low to moderateincome families overcome these difficulties medicaids mandatory epsd t benefit ensures acce ss to vision screening services for children under epsdt stat especific periodicity schedules for vision screening services are often in accordance with the aap recommendations however cms does not require states to summit such schedules as part of their state plans for approval in addition in fy1998 the last year in which data on vision screening services under epsdt were coll ected just over 14 of epsdteligible children received vision screen this measure is somewhat misleading however because there are several other medicaid be nefit categories eg wellchild care and physician services where vision screening services may be delivered often such services are billed as part of wellchild visit under schip statespecific benefit pack ages must provide wellbaby and well child care which includes vision scr eening component like medicaid cms does not require states to submit their wellbaby and wellchild or vision screening periodicity schedules as part of their schip state plan nor except in the case of immunizations has cms endorsed specific professional standard ie periodicity schedules for wellbaby and wellchild car coverage under schip plans as with medicaid the wellchild covera ge requirement is not the only service category where children could receive vision screening under schip children may also receive vision screening services under other schi p covered services such as physician services and other medical di agnostic screening preventive restorative remedial therapeutic or rehabilitative services june 2000 crs benefits survey gives us some clues about access to vision screening services under schip medicaid expansion programs and separate statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32628crs22 programs at that time nearly all medicaid and schip programs covered vision services eg vision screenings eye exams treatment of eye diseases or visual impairments such as eye surgery or eye glasses for children and most also covered eye glasses either as part of their eye glass coverage or as part of their vision services except in few states wh ere visionbenefit limits under schip were defined in terms of the aap or statespeci fic periodicity schedule these survey data do not answer the question how many scr eenings are covered and at what ages do the screenings occur however the survey data do indicate that the breadth of visionrelated benefits ava ilable under these two programs likely differs within and across states coverage policies and benefit limits for the lowestincome children as described in state medicaid plans are seldom absolute because of epsdt for nearly all medicaid children states are required to provide all federallyallowed treatment to correct identified problems even if the specific treatment needed is not otherwise covered under states medicaid plan as result when medicaid agency reports that specific benefit is not covered for children that means the service is available only when delivery of that service meets the epsdt requirement in these circumstances providers typically go throug h prior authorization process to receive payment for what are sometimes called epsdt extended benefits services for higherincome child ren under schip are sometimes more restrictive unlike medicaid but consistent with federal statute separate schip programs are modeled after private sect or commercial insurance products the requirement to use benchmark plans or act uarial equivalents of those plans most of which are state employee health plan s or commercial hmo plans provides the framework for defining benefit limits under commercial insurance pr oducts benefits are always limited by medical n ecessity but other limits may apply and will vary by insurance product as do proce dures to monitor for medical need and appropriateness payments to providers participating in these plans may be
