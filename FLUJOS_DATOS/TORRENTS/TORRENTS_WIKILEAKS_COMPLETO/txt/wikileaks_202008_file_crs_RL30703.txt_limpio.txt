refinement bills introduction medicaid is joint federalstate entitlement program that pays for medical assistance primarily for lowincome persons who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent children and certain other pregnant women and children within broad federal guidelines each state designs and administers its own program total program outlays in fy1999 were 1809 billion federal outlays were 1025 billion and state outlays were approximately 784 billion the federal government shares in states medicaid costs by means of statutory formula designed to provide higher federal matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes in fy1999 federal matching rates ranged from 50 to 76 of states expenditures for medicaid items and services overall the federal government finances about 57 of all medicaid costs the state childrens health insurance program schip enacted in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 is targeted at uninsured children who live in families with income below twice the federal poverty level and who would not otherwise be eligible for medicaid states may use schip funds to provide coverage through health insurance that meets specific standards for benefits and costsharing known as separate state programs or through expansions of eligibility under medicaid or through combination of both options schip entitles states with approved schip plans to predetermined annual federal allotments based on distribution formula set in law each state has flexibility to define the group of targeted lowincome children who are eligible for its schip eligibility criteria may include for example geography age income and resources residency disability status access to other health insurance and duration of eligibility for schip as of october 4 2000 all 50 states the district of columbia and all five territories had approved schip plans among these 23 are medicaid expansions 15 are new or expanded separate state
