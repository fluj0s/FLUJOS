had led georgia since 1972 except for 1985 1992 during which he primarily served as the prowestern foreign minister of the soviet union shevardnadzes constitutional limit of two terms in office expired in 2005 which made the november 2 2003 legislative election critical bellweather of who might succeed him nine party blocs and twelve parties contested 150 legislative seats in party list vote and another 75 seats were contested in single constituencies shevardnadzes party the citizens union of georgia cug had become deeply unpopular as economic conditions failed to noticeably improve to

center for strategic and international studies caucasus election watch oct 27 the proshevardnadze and opposition camps both appealed to nationalism by accusing each other of selling out georgias sovereignty to russia postelection crisis the observer mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce reported on november 3 that the electoral processes appeared somewhat more democratic than in the past but still did not meet the standards of free and fair election it mainly focused on problems with voters lists but also mentioned ballot boxstuffing in ajaria and some districts it also raised concerns that progovernment party members dominated district and precinct electoral commissions and that ajaria carried out its own electoral processes virtually independently and blocked most opposition party campaigning in the region ajarias announcement on november 6 of its large vote for revival seemed to overwhelm and marginalize the partial vote counts being announced for the opposition httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21685 parties galvanizing their resistance to shevardnadze voter turnout in ajaria was reportedly 98 of whom 95 endorsed the revival party these results meant that revival would be major force in the legislature which was unacceptable to those who felt that ajarias vote tally was sham the dutch ambassador to the osce reportedly stated later that the gross manipulation of the vote in ajaria was the worst of the irregularities in the election ap nov 26 opposition leaders broke off negotiations with shevardnadze on november 9 after he refused their demand to hold new election to display supposed mass support for the election results the next day he traveled to ajaria to address an assembled crowd of ostensible supporters and abashidze sent hundreds of police and other supporters to tbilisi to march in support of the election final electoral results were announced on november 20 the fng bloc won the highest percentage of the party list vote 213 and revival the second highest 188 prospectively giving the proshevardnadze forces the largest share of seats the national movement received 188 of the party list vote the labor party 12 the united democrats 88 and the new right 78 of the vote in single constituencies fng affiliated or independent but probably propresidential candidates won the largest number of seats unlike the other opposition parties new right did not challenge the electoral returns and did not join opposition street protests the crisis deepened in georgia following the announcement of final vote counts with major demonstrations in the capital by propresidential ajarian police and opposition supporters prominently led by saakishvili who demanded shevardnadzes resignation and new elections protestors were galvanized by polls before and during the election conducted with the guidance of us and british ngos that indicated that the national movement and the united democrats could each expect over 20 of the vote georgians also were motivated by extensive coverage of the election by the independent rustavi2 television station saakashvili eschewed violence urging his followers to emulate the peaceful protesters who helped oust former yugoslav dictator slobodan milosevic in 2000 georgian activists over the past few months had closely conferred with democracy advocates in serbia on campaign and demonstration tactics washington post nov 25 crs3 although many in georgia at first viewed shevardnadzes role in the suspect vote count as uncertain they saw his bid for support from abashidze and defense of the results as indicating that he at least condoned if not orchestrated the suspect tally fbis nov 22 doc cep16 shevardnadze hurriedly convened the rump legislature on november 22 national movement and the united democrats boycotted the session but he was chased from the podium when demonstrators broke into the chamber burjanadze announced that she was assuming the presidency pending elections shevardnadze declared emergency rule but cautioned his security forces not to use force in an ultimatum delivered to the protestors the next day shevardnadze insisted that the new legislature had convened replacing the old and was now the supreme representative body however he seemingly offered to discuss moving up the date for new legislative and presidential elections shevardnadzes ouster russian foreign minister igor ivanov mediated between opposition leaders and shevardnadze on the evening of november 23 in the face of saakashvilis threat to storm the presidents residence reportedly with us concurrence ivanov stressed to shevardnadze that he should not risk civil war by resorting to force against the opposition but should negotiate settlement presumably httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21685 to include new legislative elections washington post nov 25 see below for an alternative explanation also critical to shevardnadzes decision to resign were reports that top defense security and internal police officials whom shevardnadze stated he would rely on to suppress the protests told him that they would not accept such orders faced with this lack of support shevardnadze and the opposition leaders reached agreement on his resignation saakashvili hailed this coup rose revolution to signify that it had not been violent in speech to the country on november 24 acting president burjanadze called for order to be reestablished and for presidential elections within constitutionallymandated 45 days she directed that the prorogued 1999 legislature would resume its work until new legislative elections could be held she quickly met with security officials and tedo japaridze who broke with shevardnadze during the crisis was confirmed as secretary of the presidential security council composed of the heads of the security ministries he later was named foreign minister she also declared that georgia would continue its existing foreign policy aimed at integration with europe and nato the georgian constitutional court the next day lent some legitimacy to the coup and plans for new elections by ruling that the november 2 election was fraud on november 26 the three opposition leaders announced their plans for sharing power with burjanadze stating that her party would back saakashvili for president she appointed zhvania the minister of state the top executive branch office under the president but recommended that the constitution be changed to give the office more power saakashvili in turn stated that the opposition hoped to sweep both the presidential and legislative elections and that burjanadze would top the party list perhaps assuring that she would become the speaker of new legislature perhaps to alleviate some concerns raised among many of shevardnadzes supporters by statement by burjanadze that investigations were being opened into electoral irregularities and that the guilty would be punished saakashvili called for unity government that would include all progressive georgians of all parties and pledged that one in the old government would be prosecuted he called for the police to maintain order and for the military to

election osce foreign ministers met in early december and pledged up to 6 million to help administer presidential and legislative elections osce press release dec 2 implications for georgia according to most observers the legislative race marked an extraordinarily determined struggle for power as prelude to the presidential election in 2005 ensconced and corrupt officials were determined to gain dominant legislative influence in order to maintain their power and to control the prospective presidential race and the opposition parties were determined to block these efforts in this view fbis nov 25 doc cep274 transitions online nov 3 it was anticipated that the new pro presidential legislature would elect kindred politician as speaker crucial post in the runup to the 2005 presidential race the speaker becomes the interim head of state in case the president resigns or dies according to this speculation abashidze with tacit russian military backing aimed to assume the speakership and perhaps later the presidency httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21685 all the political players in the crisis seemed intent on avoiding repeat of the bloody 1992 coup that toppled independent georgias first president the three principal opposition leaders agreed on powersharing and quickly moved to reaffirm or appoint able individuals to the critical finance foreign and defense ministries nonetheless some observers warn that there is preeminent political figure behind which the country can rally so factional disputes could eventually lead to violence some observers argue that saakashvilis personal volatility may not make him president able to unify and bring stability to georgia institute for advanced strategic and political studies policy briefings nov 19 the daily telegraph nov 24 some observers warn that independent georgia has witnessed frequent violence and uprisings by military and paramilitary groups saakashvili concerned about rumors that reactionary groups might be mobilizing

expected at the polls it may receive the legitimacy and time it needs to implement changes that might otherwise tax an impatient populace the prospective government faces widespread poverty official corruption and separatism in its abkhazia and south ossetia regions among the immediate domestic problems it must address are budget deficit and rising crime the new government also will need to carry out confidencebuilding with ajaria abkhazia and south ossetia abashidze has asserted that ajaria will not accept orders from the interim government at the same time however he has firmly stated that ajaria will not formally secede south ossetia has reemphasized that it wants to join russia the prospective government must also reassure its neighbors azerbaijans president ilkham aliyev who had just won controversial election himself supported shevardnadze during the crisis and has appeared cool toward the interim leadership japaridze met with aliyev in late november to pledge that existing cooperation would continue armenia which depends on energy from russia that transits georgia called for peaceful elections and economic reforms that would bolster regional trade russias ivanov made clear that russia was not happy that the coup had occurred but accepted it crs5 and would pursue close strategic ties with georgia he also stated that russia was concerned that outside pressure had contributed to the coup itartass nov 25 nov 26 according to some observers putin was critical of the coup because it appeared to negate the added influence that russia would have gained through abashidzes increased power but he also accused shevardnadze of bringing on his own downfall by failing to maintain traditional close ties to russia or to protect he seemed to imply the legacy of sovietstyle economic and political rule fbis nov 24 doc cep252 nov 25 doc cep141 ivanov met with several cis foreign ministers on november 25 and they seemed to accept the change of government in georgia but pointedly called for noninterference by outside powers seemingly referring to us interests in georgias domestic affairs itartass nov 25 implications for us interests according to the state

remain on duty with nato in kosovo and with the usled coalition in iraq the backgrounds of several of the new officials including saakashvili who was educated in the united states and japaridze the former ambassador to the united states also appeared reassuring to many us observers many oppositionists in georgia hailed the us censure of the november election as major contribution to shevardnadzes decision to resign others criticized the united states for not sending top emissary to georgia and instead depending on russia to defuse the crisis some also were critical of what they viewed as longterm us efforts to prop up shevardnadzes rule some proshevardnadze supporters were highly critical httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21685 of what they viewed as us indifference to if not active support for shevardnadzes ouster shevardnadze lent credence to this view on november 26 when he ruefully questioned the us role stating that i was one of the biggest supporters of us policy the daily

influence in georgia some viewed shevardnadzes putative tilt toward russia as feint to spur the united states to rush to his aid one advocate of this view stated that the coup amounted to the replacement of one prous government by another that would be even more proamerican fbis nov 25 doc cep259 such government could press harder for more us aid and for integration into western institutions including admission into nato alexander rahr fbis nov 24 doc cep287 others argued that shevardnadzes alliance with abashidze threatened strategic tilt toward russia center for strategic

hamburg financial times nov 25 third view is expressed by those who suggest that both us and russian interests in georgia could suffer if it becomes harbor for terrorism or otherwise becomes more unstable so that usrussian cooperation there is essential dmitriy trenin fbis nov 24 doc cep287 on november 27 saakashvili appeared to endorse this perspective arguing that georgia should seek
