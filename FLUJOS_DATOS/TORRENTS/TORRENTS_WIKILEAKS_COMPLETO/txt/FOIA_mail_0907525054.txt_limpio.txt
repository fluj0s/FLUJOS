ehhalt ksiebenfzjuelichde subject tarsres urgent use scenarios date sun 04 oct 1998 141734 0700 prathers comments on sres emissions regarding the four wgi chapters on radiative forcing this addresses only the urgent need to get the climate scenarios started overall it is critical that the wgi chapters are involved in and make decisions regarding the mapping of emission scenarios onto tracegasrf scenarios to then be used in generating climate scenarios this is needed so that the eventual chapters will back these preliminary and hurried approaches and present consistent but updated and more complete set of similar rf calculations in the tar we should not be adding new volunteers to calculate these forcings as has been suggested by last weeks notes until we clearly agree on the rulesalgorithms co2 wgich3 i have not heard from colleagues on ch 3 regarding carboncycle models for these scenarios that would be consistent with their pending chapter nonco2 gases wgich4 we need to make sure that the combination of adopted atmospheric chemistry and emissions is consistent with recent observations it does not mean the total burden is on emissions once having chosen the chemistry ie 120 year lifetime for n2o today however the current emissions are tied by observations so we will do as already stated make emissions match observations but must be careful in the chapter to note this i see obvious need to change the oh lifetimes ch4 hfcs and the n2o lifetimes from the sar the debate over trend in oh is important for later analysis in the chapter the key here is for consistency with the past decade the budget of 560 tgch4 is thus balanced steadystate budget to match abundances of about 1710 ppb and the current increase of about 12 ppby would then add about 35 tg to this amount thus the rate of growth of ch4 emissions in the sres in one concern but the absolute level in the late 1990s is the most critical the ipcc97 mosier kroeze n2o budget stands natural 90 tgny and anthrop 72 tgny thus all of the n2o scenarios need to be scaled is this by timeindependent offset eg 55 tgny for b2 or do we multiply the anthropogenic by constant factor eg 3 for b2 hfcs cannot be included as bulk emission values since their lifetimes are so varied what could be done is to focus on single one as surrogate eg hfc134a is the dominant rf from the is92a options calculated in the sar is this still so we need to look at the projected hfc industry as in the last wmo report o3 as part of the ipccaviation assessment under sar now in final government review we spent considerable effort in calculating the changes in o3 and the associated rf this included both changes due to aircraft alone and that due to increases in ch4 co nox voc described in is92a the 3d tropospheric chemistry models generally agreed upon the o3 changes and it looks as though we shall be able to take the sar to the next step and predict changes in tropospheric ozone with community consensus the results were only for is92a 2015 and 2050 atmospheres rfs not fully analyzed for background of order 02 wm2 for 2050 for the aogcm scenarios i propose that we use these 2050 deltao3 scenarios to deliver zonal annual mean o3 rf as simple function of latitude it would be easier that transmitting the perturbed o3 patterns to the aogcms and would accomplish the primary goal of including the o3 rf the is92a 2050 pattern would be scaled to the amount of nox emitted and ch4 concentration maybe this is probably ok for now but of course the correlation of nox and co emissions in generating o3 and oh changes is current science that needs to be evaluated in the chapter also the regional aspects of co and nox emissions affect the o3 perturbation i would propose that wgich4 define the algorithms eg ch4 lifetime 1700 ppb plus feedback factor and how to implement it along with the constraints of the 1990s and then let the sres scenario builders come up with consistent set and send these on to the aogcms sulfur other aerosols wgich5 the aogcms should not use their own sulfur cycle for the first of the climate scenarios there is little doubt that all will produce vastly different negative rfs and hence different regional climate response as i remember listening to the arguments for preparing these climate scenarios the primary goal is to assess how wellconsistently we can predict future climate and especially regional changes given set of forcings likewise we do not want these scenarios generated from different time lines for co2 ch4 and o3 because the models have different cycle for these gases so why s while many of these models may have scientifically excellent s cycles and include indirect impacts on cloud formation this task ie comparison of s models in gcms should be the second tier of experiments given the primary goals of these climate simulations by the aogcms it would seem best to specify simple albedorf by lat long one that chapter 5 of the new tar would advocate and support in its chapter eg what is suggested by chapter 4 for o3 above for example the current geographic pattern of direct sulfate forcing has been studied and will obviously be reviewedsummarized by wgi chapter 5 this could be scaled to total s emissions especially since they are dropping in most of the sres emission scenarios it would still provide basic test of our predictions of regional climate across the aogcms there is nothing here to develop scenarios for other anthropogenic aerosol forcings that appear to be important ie organics and soot summary rf wgich6 potential issue here is the ability to deconvolve the emissions and rfs per sector michael j prather prof mpratheruciedu earth system science dept 19498245838fax3256 uc irvine ca 926973100
