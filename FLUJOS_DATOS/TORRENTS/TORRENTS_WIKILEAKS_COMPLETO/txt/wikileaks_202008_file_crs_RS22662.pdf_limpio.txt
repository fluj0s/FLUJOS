and update the national housing act and enable the federal housing administration to use riskbased pricing to more effectively reach underserved borrowers and for other purposes specifically the bill would make reforms to the federal housing administration fha program federally operated mortgage insurance program primarily serving less creditworthy borrowers that would make it more viable option for borrowers unable to access it under current regulations hr 1852 was passed and agreed to in the house of representatives on september 18 2007 and referred to senate committee on september 19 2007 among the many reforms proposed in the bill fha s premium pricing structure would be modified fha would be allo wed to riskbase price or charge different premium rates to borrowers based on their levels of credit risk in addition because collection of annual premiums is common in the mortgage insurance industry modification of fhas pricing structure could allow the program to rely less on the option to charge upfront premiums and instead rely solely upon fee collection via annual premiums as introduced the bill proposed giving fha more annual premium pricing discretion than it currently has the bill as passed by the house however would allow fha to charge higher upfront premium but retain the same amount of annual premium pricing flexibility this would limit the ability of fha to operate using an annual premium structure as its primary collection tool this report briefly summarizes hr 1852 and the current and proposed changes to the fha premium pricing structure after discussing the utility of pricing flexibility brief analysis follows that indicates lowerincome borrowers might be unlikely to pay higher rates relative to highincome borrowers since creditworthiness exhibits much variability this report will be updated as significant legislative developments occur for an introduction to the fha program please see crs report rs20530 fhainsured home loans an

on march 29 2007 by representative maxine waters and representative barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee the bill was reported amended by the house financial services committee and placed on the union calendar calendar 133 on june 28 2007 the bill would provide reforms intended to allow fha to better respond to recent changes in the mortgage market for example the bill would raise singlefamily mortgage loan limits in particular in high cost areas so that more borrowers would be eligible for fha insurance new homebuyers would be able to purchase their homes with little or downpayment and still be eligible to obtain fhainsured mortgages hr 1852 would also establish national housing trust fund where excess proceeds generated from the program could be used to finance borrower counseling and other affordable housing initiatives hr 1852 would also modify fhas premium pricing structure legislation was introduced in the previous congress addressing the issue of greater premium pricing flexibility for fha in hr 5121 109 th congress which passed the house but was not voted on in the senate the upfront premium was increased to 30 from 15 and the annual premium was increased to 20 from 055 this pricing structure would have provided fha with greater pricing flexibility than it currently has under existing law in the current congress hr 1852 as introduced would increase the upfront premium to 30 but the annual premium would be increased to 075 hr 1852 as amended would maintain the current annual premium at 055 if this bill were enacted into public law then fha would be able to charge up to twice as much for the upfront premium but would see change in the flexibility over its annual premium furthermore hr 1852 would require fha to rebate some portion of the upfront premium charged to its riskiest borrowers after they have made five years of timely mortgage payments hence under the pricing structure proposed by hr 1852 as passed by the house fha would not gain appreciably greater flexibility over its current premium structure

insurance is usually required for borrowers lacking either downpayment or home equity that equals 20 of the property value prime or conventional as well as subprime homebuyers may purchase private mortgage in surance and fha homebuyers buy mortgage insurance from fha should the borrower default on mortgage loan obligation mortgage insurance will reimburse the lender for the loss over the past several years the mortgage insurance industry along with fha saw business decline with the increased use of piggyback or second mortgages to cover the 20 requirement many borrowers avoided mortgage insurance since insurance premiums were not tax deductible unlike mortgage interest during the 109 th congress however new law making mortgage insurance temporarily tax deductible was enacted in addition the migration away from fha may have been due in large part to rising house prices between 2001 and 2005 which put home prices above the fha maximum loan limits in many regional markets hr 1852 proposes increasing the fha loan limits and relaxing the downpayment requirements so more borrowers may be eligible for fha insurance currently borrower obtaining an fhainsure d mortgage would pay an upfront mortgage insurance premium of 15 of the mortgage loan amount and then pay subsequent annual insurance premiums the amount of the annual premium is inversely related to the size of the downpayment assuming standard 30year fixe drate mortgage if the borrower makes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22662g10g495g20g495g561g343g350 g347g344g561 g138g151g141

for only the first 11 years of the loan if downpayment between 5 and 10 is made the annual premium charged will cost 05 per year for all 30 years of the loan if downpayment of less than 5 is made the annual premium charged will cost 055 per year for all 30 years of the loan all of these premiums are capped by law the fha is selffinancing program under which premiums must be sufficient to cover its costs and potential losses the current annual premium structure could be considered form of riskbased pricing where different prices are charged to borrowers based upon the amount of downpayment or loanto value which acts as proxy for their credit risk this pricing authority was given to fha at time when borrowers were expected to make some financial commitment in the form of downpayment upfront insurance premiums at that time were not considered burdensome because mortgages with little or downpayment were not as commonplace as they are today in contrast to fhas near onesizefitsall pricing structure the private sector charges borrowers different rates depending upon their combination of credit scores and downpayment size mortgage insurance premiums in the private sector are typically collected annually rather than with large upfront premium fee hence fha would require congressional authority to update its premium pricing structure to reflect current mortgage insurance industry practices in order to estimate how high annual premiums w ould need to be to replace the current upfront premium the equivalent annual premium rate can be computed from fhas current premium structure of 15 upfront and 05 annual premium assuming an average mortgage life of six years the equivalent annual premium would be 075 per year with upfront premium charge if fha in an attempt to be more consistent with the private mortgage industry wanted to collect insurance fees primarily using only its annual premium mechanism it would be at cost disadvantage fha may not collect 075 under the current annual limit caps when compared with private insurers 075 per year would still be insufficient to cover highrisk borrowers with very low credit scores borrowers with 5 downpayment and credit score above 620 pay approximately 096 for standard 30year fixed loan in the private sector consequently increases in the annual premium w ould allow fha to adequately cover the higher risk should more aminus and subprime borrowers migrate back to fha with an annual premium of 15 and upfront premium charges fha could support loan with 540 credit score and 5 downpayment loan with 550 credit score with 3 downpayment or loan with 640 credit score with 0 downpayment fh borrowers with higher credit scores and downpayments would pay less than 15 for mortga ge insurance since they would pose less risk fha insurance rates for all borrowers of all risk levels would be less expensive when compared to private insurers since the insurance has the backing of the us government the lack of annual premium pricing flexibility however would make it difficult for fha to mimic present industry premium collection practices this suggests fha would still have to rely heavily on upfront premiums to collect its insurance fees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22662g10g495g20g495g561g343g350 g347g344g561 g138g151g141 g561g20g142g159g146g156g146g157g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g8

collection of insurance fees via an annual premium mechanism can reduce financial burdens on homeowners under certain circumstances if the borrower lacks sufficient cash to cover an upfront premium charge rolling the fee into the mortgage increases the interest costs of the mortgage since the principal amount has been increased by the upfront fee furthermore the additional balance must be paid back to the insurance company should homeowner decide to sell before the upfront premium has been completely amortized if borrowers home has not appreciated in value enough to cover the upfront fees when he or she is ready to sell the borrower may either attempt to raise the selling price or repay the premium in lump sum amount when mortgage insurance charges are paid annually however the borrower neither pays additional interest nor has to worry about recouping the upfront charges in the case of an early sell higher annual premiums coupled with little or upfront premium charges are therefore arguably less burdensome on most borrowers greater flexibility over the annual premium would potentially allow fha to reduce or eliminate upfront premium charges fha could also make cost adjustments via the annual premium easier than by calculating fair or correct rebate to an upfront premium charge if for example borrower who was charged an upfront premium be came eligible for an fha rebate the borrower would still pay mortgage interest on any rebated amount that was initially used to compute the borrowers monthly mortgage payment this woul d raise the question of whether fha also owes interest on the rebated portion of the loan hence flexibility over the annual premium would make it easier to compute rebates or appropriate annual premium reductions

upfront premium charges might be advantageous for borrowers planning to reside in their homes for more than the average time of six or seven years the monthly payment with an upfront premium amortized over longer time frame may provide more cash flow to the borrower over longer time horizons depending upon downpayment sizes and mortgage rates hence even if fha wanted to use an annual premium pricing structure as the primary means to collect its fees it could still be advantageous for fha to have th ability to offer borrowers an upfront premium option borrowers may prefer having options and the flexibility to use either tool or some combination may be useful to fha for various circumstances

credit score information is proprietary and difficult to obtain however severe delinquency information can be useful proxy income and delinquency data can be foun d in the 2004 survey of consumer finances scf the scf asks respondents were you ever behind in your loan payments by two months or more in the past year table 1 shows the percentage of households selfreporting being delinquent by

inverse relationship between income and delinquency would be expected the relationship is less evident especially when focusing on the first three income categories the first three income categories include households earning 65000 or less which was approximately the median income in this sample the majority of fha loans have traditionally been made to households at or below area median incomes for white households the delinquency rate does not fall dramatically from the 2000035000 group to the 50001 65000 group the fall in delinquency over the large income range is slightly over 1 for black and hispanic households the delinquency rates actually increase between the 2000035000 and 3500150000 groups minority households with incomes above the median have lower delinquency rates than white households hence creditworthiness exhibits much variability in particular for incomes at or below the median the tenuous inverse relationship between income and delinquency described in table 1 for households is likely to be even less pronounced in the fha portfolio of borrowers the sample in table 1 is representative of all us households and fhas portfolio of borrowers might bear similar pattern if it contained similar proportion of creditworthy borrowers fhas portfolio of borrowers however is more likely to consist of disproportionate amount of creditimpaired borrowers unable to get conventional loans reserved for prime borrowers which could consist of more higherincome borrowers consequently an inverse pattern between income and delinquency is arguably even less likely to be observed when larger percentage of the sample consists of relatively higherrisk borrowers from lowtomedian income groups in fact high income borrower choosing to obtain an fhainsured mortgage rather than less expensive conventional loan is more likely to have credit problems hence flexible premium pricing structure for fha would not necessarily result in lowerincome fha borrowers on average
