speed lecture given on 21 june 1961 thank you thank you well your auditing has improved so ill wear jacket all right what is this the 21st or what audience 21st yeah june 1961 saint hill saint hill sussex uk england earth solar system this place all right well i havent anything bright to tell you today ive shot the bolt now now you know everything there is to know and im certainly glad of that im certainly glad of that certainly you know everything there is to know because i dont theres couple of bugs kicking around of one character or another and i dont know yet if youve got them totally licked or not theyre basically just slow assessment slow slow slow assessment slow slow slow security checking slow slow slow sop goals and nobodys trying to make you unthorough and nobodys telling you that you should uniformly and routinely rush your auditing through but theres difference between getting something done and wasting time and thats all ive got my eye on and i think ive spotted the bugs of whats making it go slow but i actually havent got all the returns back that is to say i dont know if its going faster for you now or not but it wouldnt make any difference to if it took seventyfive hours to get somebodys goal that youll find is the slowest haul i think we speeded that up with instant needle read i wouldnt care if it took that long but its kind of nonsense but for it to take very long to do security check this is whats weird because all you do is read the question and then dont wait for the strains of dixie make sure that that thing is didnt fall when you read the question and then go tearing off to the next question and when they fall you probe them by compartmentation of the question something that frank aloysius george q sullivan should have done before he started blasting around about pdh he by the way has got very suspicious now because theres now been big on the part of the california mounties i think thats what they call the police in california isnt it mounties well theyre always on everybodys back and they have corralled some poor guy up in eureka and theyre accusing him because hes scientologist of practicing brainwashing and pdh on people so it doesnt look like mr sullivan was quite as innocent as it seems because he forecasted attack which was also duplicated on the oh practically the same day in detroit interesting isnt it of course according to you according to you in general everybody is reasonable and all actions are good and theres nothing youve ever plotted but we hear about scientologists are pdhing people in australia then we hear about it in south africa then we get magazine that he cannot afford to publish being published saying so in the united states and then simultaneously in two different parts of the country two thousand miles apart the police suddenly swoop down on scientologist and accuse him of pdhing people and then simultaneously pinkerton swoops down on the police sent by the organization and it all blows over but its hard on the people when its happening and you can say its all for the best in this best of all possible worlds but the panglossism doesnt go down with and i usually say well ready on the right ready on the left ready on the firing line fire somebody at the other end says goddamn we cant fool this guy thats fact so dont feel surrounded because youre the only people that have the weapons but please for the sake of my morale dont be so reasonable dont leave standing there all by myself you know dont start telling well ron its just human nature yeah its human nature to get itself in such stew but thats reason theres also some political nature back of it too you see were actually not just stewing around in the bullpen you know because we are so happy about peoples aberrations you know and its not their fault and people are leading unhappy lives and so on thats really not what were doing were also doing that and that is fine but let tell you something that if we werent here the lights of earths civilization would be out in another twentyfive years if we werent here and people know who is sitting baying at them but you see the great ease it would be to scoop up or shoot down or do something to you might ask why is it that this has never really happened its come close to happening couple of times theres been an airplane out on landing field warming up waiting to kidnap and couple of hoods standing by real tough mugs only they couldnt handle 45 and i could this in the confines of angeles the war cooled off as far as i was concerned many many years ago and i dont expect it to hot up at all i dont even bother to lock the doors and its not case as far as im concerned im just pointing that out to you as matter of record because if i had men number of overts here or if i had bugginess going here the attack on you and the attack on would be fantastic but you see if you havent got tremendous motivators they cant get big enough overt going against you because you just dont suck it in thats all you see and that mechanism alone is why were still alive and there isnt anything going to happen to us just around the fringes just around the fringes here and there why therell be little popgun down in perth all of sudden why somebody swoops down and picks up some auditor they and it works out this way he himself has got some kind of wild series of motivators that has nothing to do with us and listen we cant even help him in this perth affair we tried hard to help this person and they wouldnt even accept an attorney from us nothing much happened to them they went down and paid small fine and that was it but wouldnt even permit an investigation weve got backflash going right now in australia which is actually it went weve been on the winning side of this picture in australia now for many months weve had tremendously effective people there these people are awful fast on the draw they remind you of what the western movies would like to believe the old western bad men were all about or the police marshals because boy those guys are awful quick on the draw in australia you shoot in their direction and the enemy long before the trigger actually gets pulled the air just begins to hum all around their ears theres guy down there who wishes to god hed never been elected as the head of the bma of australia every night when he goes to bed at night he says and dear lord and all of sudden why the wolves came off and there hasnt been anything happening down there since and now the other day one of the leading trade union papers published very congratulatory article on the emeter and that sort of thing well thats gaining ground well the australian knows hes under fire so he cooperates in the united states they dont know theyre under fire they think its all for the best in this best of all possible worlds and its all so reasonable and ron is you know got well hes little bit aberrated on this subject and so on hes fighting shadow you know and it doesnt work and so forth actually its ron thats pdhing everybody and you know reasonable stupid kind of action and its getting knocked off one of these days one of these days people more and more month by month youll watch it will start coming up and backing us up and backing us up more and more and backing us up more and more and more and all of sudden therell be splash in the pacific and splash in the atlantic and that will be the end of subversion in the united states you watch it happen i promise you its going to happen but its only going to happen because im quick on the trigger keep my eye open and everybody in hco is very very fast on the ball along this line when you want them to act they act consequently within hours private detectives will be swarming around eureka asking questions we have only one weapon we investigate loudly investigate very loudly thats the only weapon but well make it to the degree that our technology is good sound and fast were on wave of the future and if anything we are the wave of the future there is technology that can approach anything we are doing and youll find if you study great civilizations that they roll forward with new technology the sweep of the romans resounded with the clash of arms but basically england was conquered by rome as much as century before the first roman soldier ever put his foot on english soil look up history and youll find out its true roman culture and knowhow had invaded england it was coming over from the channel ports and everybody thought it was very nice to be able to grow crop that was pretty good and instead of finding out about this the roman military intelligence didnt find out that they probably would have got roses in the street they landed an expeditionary force thats something like you after youve cleared pc decide hes aberrated and attack him not quite as extreme as this but that was kind of what happened but every new civilization is forecast and is new technology and that is all it is and philosophic technologies are far more prone to the founding of new civilizations than otherwise so youre working on more than you know and the eyes of the future upon you and all that so you better find out something about it huh the caliber of what you are doing improves with such rapidity as soon as you land here that you can almost tell how many days youve been here this is from the reports i get so there is right way to do things and nothing actually does better than knowing just exactly how it is done being able to ask questions immediately and directly to find out if youre doing something wrong about it because it develops certainty and i want you to develop this certainty i want you to whenever you think up dumb question or think youre astraddle of some kind of riddleraddle or something of the sort well for heavens sakes speak up now jan has been speaking up quite interestingly last night asked on this prehav 13 do you ask all of the names over and over or do you do assessment by elimination she brings up point there which very well might go terribly crosswise somewhere on your terminal assessment for prehav 13 youre not doing an assessment by elimination you are doing simply runover and as person gets his overts off of course against all the people that he knows the people you have already passed over and found null on your scale all of sudden live up it actually doesnt matter much who you choose to get the overt off as long as there was some immediate action on the emeter so what you do is make terminal assessment sort of thing you collect all the guys terminals that he everybody he knows in present time you see and you write all these people down on piece of paper and you start down the list and every time you get fall well you see if you cant clear the fall by twoway comm and if you cant clear the fall by twoway comm you run the action out of the needle and then go on to the next person and see if you cant do that and its more security check than an assessment have you got it now you find somebody you dont clear with you say well how do you feel about that person what have you done to that person or something like that and it doesnt clear the needle keeps reacting all right assess the person on that terminal on the prehav scale and run enough twoway commands to clean the needle now youre not going to get too many of them to the prehav scale probably most of these terminals are going to clear just on glance now you go back to the beginning of the list and you can keep adding new people he keeps thinking of new people and so forth well just put them down and go on about your orderly affair but now go back to the beginning of this long list of terminals and go over the thing again and youre all of agoing to sudden find that terminals that werent hot are now hot see youre raising his responsibility for the people in his environment and as you do this of course you raise his ability to see what he has done its just list that you go over and over this is not necessarily something you would have to do as fulltime activity you could do this for half session and run whatever else youre running for another half of the session i call to your attention that the girl who went clear on the south african acc had heres missing item for you had fifty hours of formula 13 immediately before that acc it was almost impossible you see for her to have arc breaks so forth she had all these people in her environment pretty well cleaned up and in view of the fact that they were pretty well cleaned up what did this leave this left the fact that most of her auditing session was devoted to getting clear not to patching up the environment and rudiments didnt suddenly go out on her all the time you understand all right now that is somewhat imperfect statement of how you do prehav 13 i see it still leaves you just little bit puzzled about it but i will go over these steps just rapidly here now very rapidly the way you do it is in model session form you clean your rudiments and then you clean them rather indifferently because youre certainly going to do nothing but clean rudiments on this prehav 13 you see and you just take list you say to the person now im going to make list of everybody that you know you can say intimately or something like this or everybody that youre associated with whatever wording in present time everybody that you know in present time theyll ring in lot of dead people on you and stuff like this well put them down who cares its not precision activity anyhow and you make this long list see and itll go two three pages well while theyre thinking about this theyre actually exteriorizing and theyre getting their bank straightened out so that itself is auditing because theyre doing differentiation its differentiation exercise and if you just did it as differentiation exercise youd find it was quite unusually therapeutic for people because they have all these people crossed up with people and youll find out as theyre doing this theyll separate these people out and they become individuals instead of masses and so forth all right you get this long list all right now you go over this thing and i frankly dont care what approach you use in order to straighten this up or ask this ask the person well what have you done to what have you withheld from these people but id say done to is probably more productive than anything else because they often add up done to as withheld from and you say well now all right now were going to take these people and were going to cover your relationships with them and this is all right with the pc and you start in at the beginning of the list and you say all right now heres joe and heres bill you know youre watching for that instant reaction see and heres pete and heres oswald pang of course fellow with name like oswald should get pang and so any similarity to persons living or dead is purely intentional so anyhow bang this word goes oswald all right your next approach is well what have you done to oswald and the person says wellioh soandso and so on and so on and you get big rocking needle on the thing and you pull an overt and you say well how do you feel about oswald now and you get big rock on the needle again and you say well weve had it now we are going to take this person and we take out our remove it from its lawrence leather scabbard the prehav scale and lay it out here on the emeter board and say now is oswald now dont be surprised if by the time you start to run the thing that oswald has vanished from the face of earth because you say is oswald faith or would you have faith in oswald and just go on down the line and find the prehav scale as applied to oswald see and youre trying to find the level to run oswald that is your intention you want to find level and you honestly and sincerely are not sitting there hoping he will just vanish youd like to find level for oswald and this isnt going to happen very often itll take somebody like oh i dont know theyve been married to somebody and in business with them and eventually wound up with law suit with them and so forth that reminds them of everything on their own rock chain now thats that person all right now all of sudden we find as were assessing the prehav scale which were reading on down the line we find that several levels are live we go back and try to pick up these levels that have livened up on oswald and we find out that one does still react all right put up command like this lets say the level thats still reacting is failed withhold all right now what have you failed to withhold from oswald and what has oswald failed to withhold from you those are the commands see what have you failed to withhold from oswald yap yap he says and you say thank you what has oswald failed to withhold from you thank you and thats all there is to it and you do those few times and thats the end of oswald even then see you watch the needle there is twentyminute test on this you just watch the needle and you say how do you feel about oswald now and you dont get any instant reaction on the emeter you instantly and immediately say well all right thank you very much now is it all right with you if we return to this list and he says yes and you say all right and you do so you can close the end of the process out as far as thats concerned all right down we go down the list here and weve got the next person now and weve got the next person weve got the next person weve got the next person theyre all null and then we hit one and we say all right well what have you done to this person and he says wow row row row and yeow and you say well how do you feel about this name and you read the name again you get reaction and so you say thats dandy and you read the next name and the next name and the next name and the next name and he says just minute i just remembered i just remembered i knew girl by the name of bessie ann bessie ann just remembered this and you say well all right thats good thank you very very much now if you go ahead and qanda you of course will say all right what have you done to bessie ann and we wont have anything more to do with the list but well move it all over here in the next county and only assess new names and forget the list and get all confused the pc responds to an orderly progress so we put bessie ann down at the bottom end of the list and say thank you very much and take the next name which was under our thumb up here which we were clearing and we will find that its that name that has the association with bessie ann all right so we go down and were now twenty names down the list or twentyfive names down the list here we are and we say and then theres mr stiffwhistle and the emeter goes clang on an instant read you know and you say well all right what have you done to mr stiffwhistle well tisnt so much what ive done to mr stiffwhistle actually its what hed done well you say thats good thank you very much its what he thank you very much now were going to assess mr stiffwhistle over here on the prehav scale and so forth and now would you have faith in mr stiffwhistle you get the idea and we can even vary this around you can actually run faith in mr stiffwhistle would mr stiffwhistle have caused anything for you see you could just take your opposite sides of the thing and read them crisscrossed you got the idea you read your oddnumbered levels with youmr stiffwhistles and the evennumbered levels mr stiffwhistleyou you got the idea keeps you from developing stuck flow on stiffwhistle you see how you can do lot of tricky things like this but you can keep flow from getting stuck and youll get better assessment well by the time youve gone over the list once youve knocked off four levels where mr stiffwhistle fell now youve gone over the list wholly once you only go back just as you do in any assessment to these four levels that youve made dot after and you read that one and you read that one and you read that one and you read that one and if theyre all null dont be surprised dont do anything further if theyre all null if one stays alive form the command for it still ask what about mr stiffwhistle and only if mr stiffwhistle still falls do you actually run the command you got the idea because hes evaporating here at great rate of speed all right you make sure that hes flat and you go to your next consecutive name on the list you go on clear on down to the end of the list in this fashion paying attention only to those that fall and paying attention to them only so long as they fall you dont go overshooting the thing with great enthusiasm here and spending half an hour on aunt betsy crocker just because she made such horrible cakes lets get into something else here thats more important lets find out periodically if betsy crocker still falls see you can overshoot this kind of running madly you know its like in the first place youre shootingyou know these little water bugs that scoot around on top of the water you know and walk on the water tension very amazingly so forth well youre just the same as shooting water bugs with sixteeninch gun if youre not very adroit about it man do you get splashed because you can go too far you can overrun this level just madly you see and the pcs bored and upset and so forth of course this guys evaporated hes not interested in this anymore all right now you go back to the beginning the first beginning of the whole list when you have finished it every time he has thought of anything you added another person at the bottom of the list of course you covered those too eventually in their turn you go back to the beginning of the whole list and assess it once more and in relatively short time not anything ghastly in terms of auditing in relatively short time youve got clean list you can go over everybody this person knows in present time without getting needle disturbance and the person begins to feel wonderful about these people and begins to feel wonderful about everything you got it all right now thats how you run prehav 13 did that straighten it out for you little bit better male voice yes you see what i meant by saying i had to give you an accurate idea of exactly how you did it my basics im telling you how to run this and the way to adjudicate just how to run this is i know the behavior of the prehav scale i know the behavior of present time terminals on the prehav scale and please be advised i want to repeat just one more time if terminal continues to fall which is present time terminal or continues to react badly on the present time list of this character i dont know youre running the pc with the rudiments out or youre doing something else that hasnt got much to do with it dont you see something else is going on and we had case here of somebody well id written sniffish note to the d of p of london actually pushed in her anchor points little bit more violently than she deserved to tell you the truth auditor started auditing on her now i think ive only seen her about oh i dont know not more than two or three dozen times in my lifetime he started to run her and he started to settle into profession of running out of this one person now that wouldnt be right so theres something else going on he probably has done this he probably said now look shes gotten bad dispatch and this has upset her because she says so all right very good now hes made up his mind that this is what is wrong with the pc and he hasnt consulted mr emeter see so he starts running something that isnt particularly wrong with the pc you get this and runs it with the rudiments ignored because he is so certain this must be whats wrong with the pc of course hes now running on completely sour assessment it wasnt determined at all see he didnt try to do anything about it so constantly he actually i think tried to run two whole sessions on this thing that was impossible it was frankly impossible he just couldnt have done this and yet he did it but that was how he would go about this hed say obviously because she received rough dispatch see that says pull up your socks to the knees if necessary and so on obviously then this is what is wrong with this pc so he takes off and says doesnt assess terminal says well this is the terminal then assesses the terminal on the prehav scale gets some random and wild falls here and there on the prehav scale picks one up at random forms up fiveway bracket and starts in profession and goes of course for five hours of run without even vaguely flattening it well what do you mean flatten it or non flatten it well the tone arm kept being different and things kept being different and they kept being different the pc wasnt changing things were just different you got the idea if you want to see this happen by the way do this with sop goals or routine 2 just make up your mind that the pcs level is grapeshot yes grapeshot thats the proper level we ought to be running on this pc because the pc is always spitting grape pits out while im auditing and so therefore grapeshot is the right one and we start running grapeshot and we start getting tone arm reaction on the annoyance of the pc see and we get tone arm action on the arc break of it all we get tone arm action on the unreliability and the unreality of the whole thing dont you see the mystery in the persons mind why is he running grapeshot have you ever shot any grapes and the person gets very very puzzled and of course what does this do it pulls in all the notknows on the track so the notknows give you an action on the tone arm as they naturally would but the pc isnt running now if you were to have go at this right you dont ever make up your mind this is what is wrong with the pc and run it its perfectly all right for you to make up your mind theres something this is whats wrong with the pc but dont feel so invalidated when you put him on the emeter and find it isnt so always have nerve enough to test your theory on the emeter and instead of shooting grapes you find out whats trouble with the fellow is cellar doors he goes around cellardooring all the time he just cant leave cellar doors alone and way up the line someplace you run into some weird computation that if you cellardoor enough on the right side it makes you spit grapes you know itll be something utterly incredible you say how in the name of god did he ever arrive at that well if youre auditing at the reactive mind this question wont enter your mind how did he ever arrive at that thats whats wrong with him its the helddown five the thing isnt connected right and it doesnt make sense it doesnt make sense to him it doesnt make sense to you and your trying to outguess the reactive mind is of course an heroic activity because youd have to be as crazy as he is so dont be at all surprised if youre all set to drive down center street and you step into this hispanosuiza and youre all ready to tear down center street at 120 miles an hour and clear this case up like mad and you suddenly find yourself driving buick in chula vista dont be so heartbroken about it because thats whats the matter with the pc he gets into the hispanosuiza on center street and has always wound up driving an old brokendown 1922 buick in chula vista and this is whats upsetting him you get the idea actually he tries to do this he tries to get into old brokendown 1922 buicks in chula vista hoping someday hell wind up in the hispanosuiza on center street and its one of the heartbreaks of his life that he never does his method of realizing his goals is quite often to run them backwards the goal is to enliven and make wonderful and beautiful every woman you meet thats his goal now obviously every time he does this something happens intervenes and he finds this poor girl winds up being knockedapart old bat get the idea and he this upsets him see you know his intentions are pure and yet he just seems to just practically knock any girl he ever had anything to do with right out of the right out of the firmament and he cant understand this so he will eventually start going about his goal something like this all right if you take some knockedapart old bat you see and yet that is almost logical for the reactive mind thats almost too logical for it hes much more likely to start piling up stones on the beach and this has something very definitely to do with realizing this goal of making all women beautiful if you just pile up enough stones on the beach and you say what the hell but of course thats whats the matter with the fellow its case of what the hell i tell you life is never dull when you have the reactive mind for target so as consequence when you make up your mind as to what the level or action or the pcs regard in certain direction should be dont feel so whipcurred see because its something else it isnt an invalidation of you its an invalidation of him if he was perfectly sane your computation would undoubtedly be absolutely right but of course the reactive mind is not sane anybody thats walking around that has long line of reactivity know that theyre sort of walking with just their eyes out of the water and there might be little splashing wave any minute you know justtheyre liable to trip themselves up any second have to walk pretty careful because somewhere from the depths some long fangs are liable to all of sudden appear from nowhere see so its invalidation of somebody as matter of fact its validation of somebody to try to do something about it you see the bulk of people that have gone around the bend and are being normal these characters not only dont think theres anything you can do about it they dont think there is anything else they think that is it and that is life and thats the way you live it absolutely screaming messes theyre not living any kind of life that anybody would want to live much less them and they tell you so you see but there isnt anything you can do about it you might say they have totally surrendered to the disorderliness of existence all right so much for all that have you got question before we end this yes female voice is there any difference i mean apart from the fact that their goals arent different between one case who expresses his goal in terms of beingness and another who expresses it in terms of doingness and another who expresses it in terms of havingness does it tell you anything additional about the case the fact that they choose to express it or that it is expressed in these if you had three cases that had more or less the same goal but one of those cases expressed the goal as beingness another expressed it as doingness and another expressed it as havingness female voice yeah would it tell you anything different about the cases actually not at first glance because bedohave harmonics you could pick it up on any harmonic you could pick up an excessive obsessive beingness on the part of person and move him up to havingness and then you could move him up to beingness and then you could move him up another one and he goes into doingness but thats reversed isnt it so you push him up little bit higher and you would now find him in beingness again and now you find him in beingness for some time and all of sudden hed go totally into havingness you got the idea so its disorderly progress female voice yeah so youre liable to pick up case at any level of disintegration and you cant adjudicate too much about it you could say on the upper strata that the bedohave level on its first levels before they start inverting and harmonicing and so forthyou could say that the beingness is higher than the doingness is higher than the havingness it is easier for somebody to run on those higher levels on havingness and its little less easy to run on the doingness and its pretty rough for most people to run on the beingness but youre talking now about the upper harmonics of it female voice hm okay female voice yeah thanks any other question yes female voice this is just casual observation that i noticed for myself that if my sensitivity was at 175 say very often the tone arm would be 30 or above if it were at 20 sensitivity would be at 3 or 4 yeah female voice why there is coordination between the sensitivity but there is an awful lot of error being made on can squeezes and im glad you brought it up there is coordination on that youre saying well its if your tone arm is at one place your sensitivity is at coordinated place for that in other words as your sensitivity rises your tone arm rises or your tone arm rises your sensitivity rises not necessarily doesnt hold true female voice didnt seem to it ought to be that way except i observed in well female voice peoples sessions that it did that sort of thing it isnt it isnt true and it doesnt follow you dont get coordination between sensitivity reading and tone arm reading id like to bring up this however the way youre doing can squeezes is probably why i took sensitivity knob out of diagnosis having put it in diagnosing by the sensitivity setting ive taken it out of the lineup because boy the way you let pcs hold cans varies so fantastically as to hardly have any comparison from one case to the other and i just found it out the other day in doing some observation you can make the sensitivity knob do almost anything by holding the cans in different ways now the proper way and what we mean by thirdofadial drop is to have the pc and this is one of the things you say to him now holding the cans put your hands comfortably in your lap and the pc does this he stops waving them around and directing god save the queen with the cans and drops them down comfortably in his lap now you say gently now squeeze the cans and you get proper fall that we mean thirdofadial drop the way youve been regulating this gives you all manner of wild reads the pc has the cans terribly tightly gripped they are just gripped gripped gripped and as soon as you get see if i can make this do this now well here you are more or less the meter isnt even tuned in now lets do this properly now hold the cans lightly in your hands or comfortably now squeeze them squeeze them with jerk see you get this jerk now im even going to exaggerate this now all right were going to exaggerate this now didnt see the squeeze at all did you what am i doing im sure squeezing the cans and you dont see that needle move at all do you theres zero move to it and look your sensitivity knob is set up there almost at 20 ill do that again there we go i made it do reverse squeeze how do you like that huh all right now lets set this thing up so that it makes some sense shall we all right now were going to set the cans relaxedly in my lap well if youre going to do that somebody has passion for you want to do the first one again did everybody see that all right here we go now see unmoving needle got that all right now im going to put the now tune it down below set this side of set all right now were going to put the cans comfortably in my lap im going to sit here relaxedly see i dont know what its doing female voice we have here pong pong pong which is my normal drop get that in other words when the cans are held relaxedly in the lap you know you just hold them you know relaxedly and then simply squeeze them with the hand itself not clear on up to the shoulder thats the way you test thirdofadial drop see but you actually this other trick is to hold the cans wrap your hands very hard around the cans very carefully around the cans you get the idea now increase the pressure enormously now im holding them very hard right now see and then try to squeeze them right from the shoulder down and of course theres not thing going to happen you got it because youve already got the things utterly locked in as tight squeeze as youre going to get this thing is all the squeeze end is already registering you got that so theres sense in making diagnosis out of something that is going to be done randomly its the proper thingwhat were talking about when we talk about thirdofadial drop then has to have this additional data that you put the hands relaxedly in the lap hold those electrodes relaxedly in the lap and then squeeze the cans you can even say gently now squeeze the cans and you will get your thirdofadial drop see and you notice that my proper thirdofadial drop is not obtainable on this meter this is another thing there is sense in backing off sensitivity and backing off sensitivity and backing off sensitivity and backing off sensitivity hoping that you can keep it down to thirdofadial drop because as person starts getting clear what do you eventually run into their needle gets so loose charge is less and less registering and youve done the same as back the sensitivity knob off the read and as person is halfway clear if you could set it to thirdofadial drop by some electronic mechanism inside the thing you would get registry of any kind on the needle so another factor is visible here and that is the factor that as person approaches the state of clear their mental charges have less and less reaction on the meter not more and more reaction on the meter as somebody thought once their needle gets looser and looser and looser and looser and the charge as that happens of course is less and less expressed they do not get anywhere near as upset as they used to even though they can be more volatilely upset you see so you could easily back this sort of thing off with electronically you could put new rheostat underneath this sensitivity knob that would back it off so that much pressure to give thirdofadial drop was all the reading you could get on the thing and if you did that as person was about halfway clear they would longer read in any way shape or form on the meter and in order to finish up clearing you will find out that you have exactly reversed the whole activity that you did in the beginning your person at the beginning was reading down here at very deadbody 20 and you said have you ever killed your grandmother and actually theyre doing time for it right now and the fellow says well and you dont get any reaction and you say well could you help anybody and the person says well i often do you know i often do help somebody and you say well what do you do and they say well i just often do help somebody yeah but what do you do that helps somebody well i just do i just help somebody i wouldnt tell you or something weird like this you see andwell name something that would be helpful well lets see i could hold the door open well that wouldnt be helpful i could give you some money that wouldnt do any good i could i could buy you din that wouldnt be helpful i guess there just isnt anything you could do that would be helpful people just really pretend there is such thing or some kind of weak oddball weird answer accompanies this which is by the way your most positive test all right now this thing starts acting up goes all over the place person that is reading anywhere over the dial here now you ask him did you ever kill your grandmother and it falls off the pin you got the idea thats the first time youve ever run into it and just bang you know you say do you have present time problem bang well what is your present time problem well ive eaten all my candy see its little tiny microscopic problem this tremendous read you see guy gets toward clear and your needle is going bongbong bongbong you know every time he squeezes the cans once and you find out do you have present time problem the fellow says yes i have present time problem you say whats the matter well he says ive lost fifty thousand dollars today and you got two division fall he says thats all right ill get it back tomorrow one way or the other is that bothering you now and the fellow says it isnt you say do you have present time problem theres fall on it now you say whats happened here well its just that the actions of life are not having just this much disastrous effect upon this guy anymore thats all all right now to clean up this case toward the end of the clear run this is something that i might forget to tell you and you certainly had better know at the end of the run in spite of the fact that its almost impossible to read in spite of this you have got to set this floating needle up here with sensitivity 16 to stabilize your clear its almost impossible to read youll be here dancing around with your emeter all the time you spend most of your time adjusting the emeter and you say lets see now whoa lets see now all right all right faith do you have faith in uncle joe has uncle joe caused anything and you say okay what was that and good thats pretty good the guy thought of something that got reaction on it all right fine now lets see if we cant get command worked out here what has uncle joe caused look at the meter what has uncle joe caused well the fellow says i guess he caused quite few things theres reaction on the meter uncle joe has blown and that was it but you have to crank that sensitivity up here to 16 to read these last few charges on the bank and when youre stabilizing clear youre doing an sop goals assessment the same old way over and over and over youre trying to assess for new goals trying to assess for new terminals you do find new goal it does fall now hold your breath hold your breath now lets find terminal for it lets find terminal for it now all right youve always wanted to fly to the moon on washboard very good all right now is it washboard is it washboard is it washboard is it washboard washboard washboard moon moon moon moon moon moon moon moon all right now fly to the moon on washboard now see whats the terminal for this fly to the moon fly to the moon on washboard fly to the you always wanted to fly to the moon on washboard now what would fly to the moon on washboard its gone you see you blew it because youve got somebody who can blow these things by inspection instead of the loss of his candy hanging around for the next two months and driving him into dementia praecox you get an entirely different meter reaction and you actually have to read the last stages of clear with your sensitivity enormously advanced which is great oddity in other words there is point of insanity called normal at which you get an optimum meter read its optimum everything falls the fall lasts everythings just wonderful its all smooth not difficult you get the goal and it just stays there for weeks you know and you get the terminal and it hangs around forever everything is just dandy here and you run it you can assess it everything weve been saying you see form commands for it you can assess it on new levels you can assess it on new levels boy you can have ball you see and then by the time youve got your next goal selected just about from there on youre in trouble trying to get sop goals in completed cycle find the goal find the terminal assess the terminal on the prehav scale find an auditing command get the auditing command run you see and all of sudden this whole cycle as an action starts to foreshorten just as the individual with higher and higher increased sensitivity on floating needle is getting less and less charge and its less and less lasting and so you eventually are just shorthanding it well do you have any more goals thank you do you have any more goals thank you you see itll actually beat you down to point where you say well theres sense in getting to terminal or anythinglike that well theres danger point you could become unalert he might still have sticky one he might have one thatll last for an hours auditing you see and its that one that youve got to look for and the end of sop goals routine 3 is just search search search search search search search search it find it lose it search it find it lose it search it find it lose it and it happens faster it happens faster it happens faster and pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa then there isnt anything else you can do with the case not in the framework of think auditing or reactive minds yes there are other things you can do with case but until youve got that one totally stabilized out the person is not going to be stable 100 percent there are other things now you can do with case weve invented them in the past they already exist in the past hell oddly enough be able to do some of these things oh what do you mean you know route 1 you mean copy copy copy copy copy oh yeah sure sure okay all right good copy copy copy yeah fine fine fine fine go outside of it inside of it play hopscotch with it oh you want an ashtray okay now if you do have any questions that suddenly rise up and smite you in the face during the course of the days auditing and you dont get them answered by the end of the day why remember to ask okay all right thank you very much
