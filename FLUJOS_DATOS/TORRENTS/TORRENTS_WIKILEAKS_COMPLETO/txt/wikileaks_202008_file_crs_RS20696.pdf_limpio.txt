1999 crop peanuts were supported at 175 per tonsoybeans and other oilseeds pl 10678 authorized usda to make 475 million in direct payments to growers of 1999 crop of soybeans or other oilseeds the act established the following formula for making these payments 1 payment rate to be determined by usda multiplied by 2 potential recipients crop yield stated in bushels per acre multiplied by 3 the applicants eligible oilseed acres receiving nearly threefourths of the fy2000 oilseed payments were producers in iowa illinois minnesota indiana ohio missouri and south dakota another 500 million in

1999 crop and were assigned quota level for 1999 that was below their 1998 quota because of tobacco market conditio ns nearly all tobacco quota holders were assigned 1999 quota below 1998 thus making them eligible for emergency payments the act directed usda to allocate the 328 million to eligible states in proportion to the total reduction in quota for each states farmers consequently more than twothirds of the payments accrued to kentucky and north carolina the two largest tobaccoproducing states another 340 million in market loss payments will be paid to tobacco growers in fy2001 as

any natural disaster as determined by usda an additional 186 million in disaster payments was subsequently provided by pl 106113 any farmer who experienced natural disaster that reduced 1999 crop yields by more than 35 of normal yields was potentially eligible for disaster payment in fy2000 because total claims for disaster payments exceeded the amount appropriated usda prorated its payment formula so that producers received 70 of the total payment they would have received had the formula been fully funded disaster assistance for 2000 crop losses is being considered in the context of the
