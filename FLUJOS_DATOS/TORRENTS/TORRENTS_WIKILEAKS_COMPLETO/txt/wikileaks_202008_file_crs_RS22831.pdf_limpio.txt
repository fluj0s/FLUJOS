similar to but slightly less than the percentage of the vote received by putin in the 2004 presidential election 7131 some observers suggested that zyuganov benefitted from his runnerup results since he gained greater percentage of the vote than the communist party which he heads received in the december 2007 duma election zhir inovskiy benefitted too according to this thinking because he also received higher percentage than his party received in the duma election bogdanov on the other hand appeared to have secured fewer votes than the number of spoiled ballots and less than onehalf of the votes he might have expected if those who signed his voter registration petiti ons had later voted for him he conceded defeat quickly and expressed the view th at the election had been conducted

siloviki few analysts suggest that the powersharing arrangement with putin may prove workable and may bolster possible democratization russian analyst dmitriy trenin argues that if putin strengthens the ministerial system visÃ vis the presidency other institutions may also attempt to garner some autonomy such as the legislat ure and the judicial system creating better balance of powers between these institutions11 the election also may have strengthened the constitutional norm of two presidential terms putin asserted on february 14 that he w ould hold the prime ministership as long as he felt he was meeting his own objectives and as long as medvedev was president apparently not considering th at he and medvedev would ev er clash or that medvedev would exercise his constitutional power to dismiss the prime minister12 alexander voloshin putins former chief of staff has predicted that the two leaders will eventually clash even if only because of the different institutions they head13 some observers have raised concerns that interbureaucratic clashes will come to paralyze the government few have even warned that during simila r period of dual power centers in 1993 then president boris yeltsin used military forces to defeat strong legislative speaker14 medvedev faces several domestic problems at the outset of his presidency it may be hard for medvedev to build on or sust ain the economic boom that occurred during most of putins presidency since the wo rld economy may be facing problems and the russian economy needs restructuring rising inflation is one pre ssing economic concern other domestic problems include increasing rrorism and civil disorder in the north caucasus area an approved opposition march was held in st petersburg on march 3 but similar unsanctioned demonstration in moscow the same day was forcibly dispersed perhaps troubling sign after the election instead moscow officials sanctioned large march by the proputin nashi ours yout h group which

administration on march 3 he announced that he would focus on foreign policy he has accepted invitations to visit belarus turkmenistan venezuela and germany some internati onal problems may have

continued policy include gazproms reduction of gas supplies to ukraine on marc h 3 more broadly german chancellor angela merkel met with dvedev and putin in moscow on march 8 and reportedly suggested that there will be continuity in russias relations with the west and that i do not think that the controversies in relations will just disappear17 other observers argue that medvedev may work toward

than on russias growing economic stability18 others are less sanguine andrey illarionov putins form er economic advisor calls russia unique historical siloviki dictatorship and argu that medvedev has used his legal background to reverse democratization in the country he warns that recent russian actions such as cyber attacks on estonia the radiation poisoni ng of alexander litvinenko in england
