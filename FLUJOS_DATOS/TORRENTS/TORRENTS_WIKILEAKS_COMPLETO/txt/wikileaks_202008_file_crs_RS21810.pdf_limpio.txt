director is european this convention was the outcome of gentle mans agreement struck at the 1944 bretton woods conference establis hing these institutions background an informal agreement not written in to the imf articles the convention reflected the political and economic world map at the end of world war ii at the time the united states believed that the world ba nk should be headed by an

representative headed the world bank the imf must be headed by nonamerican1 deputy managing director position in the imf was established in 1949 and an american citizen nominated by the us department of the treasury has always filled the position in 1994 the board of executive directors bed increased the number of deputy directors from one to three in order to increase the regional diversity of the top management team2 currently agustin carsens formerly mexicos deputy secretary of finance and takatoshi kato former adviso r to the president tokyomitsubishi bank serve as deputy directors once the managi ng director position is filled mrs krueger currently serving as acting managing director will likely return to her position as first deputy managing director ms krueger was ppointed to serve fiveyear term in june 2001 although the informal convention virtually ensures that the final candidate will be european the european member countries cannot independently appoint the managing director in current practice the managing decision making process is constrained by formal and informal guideline formal guidelines for lecting the imf md the formal guidelines for choosing the imf managing director are laid out in article xii section 4 of the imf articles of agreement it states that the executive board shall select managing director who shall not be gove rnor or an executive director3 this decision may be reached by 50 majority there is ntion of the nationality principle in the articles referenced in section 4 the boar d of governors bog is the highest authority in the imf and all countries are represented of ten at the finance minis try of treasury level the executive board handles daytoday aut hority over operational policy lending and other matters it is 24 member body that usually meets three or more times week to oversee and supervise the activities of the imf the united states japan germany britain and france are the five largest sharehol ders in the imf and thus allowed to appoint their own representatives on the board the remaining members are elected for twoyear terms by groups of countries generally on the basis of geographical or historical affinity in addition to the five largest shareholders saudi arabia china nd russia have enough votes to elect their own executive directors eds the us executive director is nominated by the president confirmed by th senate and directed by the department of the treasurys office of the undersecretary for international affairs informal guidelines for selecting the imf md the selection process is also constrained by informal guidelines among the executive board although any executive director can nominate an individual as ca ndidate for the managing director positionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810crs3 4 for example in 2000 the g11 group of eds re presenting the developing countries nominated acting managing director stanley fischer u s appointee for the managing director position although his nomination was backed by outgoin g managing director michel camdessus the united states and europe were unwilling to break the convention and support mr fischers candidacy 5 kahler p 23 6 see crs report rs21330 the international monetary fund current reforms the board has never had an official vote among plethora of candidates4 within the executive board there is very strong institutional aversion to voting executive board rule c10 states that the chairman managing director shall ordinarily ascertain the sense of the meeting in lieu of formal vote5 in deciding on the managing director potential candidates are weeded out by the executive board through informal straw polls to summerize the formal requirements that the articles of agreement lay out for the selection of the imf managing director is that the executive directors appoint by at least 50 majority an individual who is ne ither member of the board of governors or board of executive directors there are requirements on how individuals are selected on what criteria or by what pro cess they are vetted moreover although the imf executive directors may select its managing director by simple majority vote they historically aim to reach agreement by consensus with these factors combined the convention guaranteeing european leadership at the imf and american leadership at the world bank has remained in force for almost 60 years the debate over the useu convention the europeanunited states arrangement to split leadership at the imf and world bank has created lasting and lingering resen tment throughout much of the world the globalization of finance has had lasting changes on the in ternational economy over the past decades whereas united states and europe overtly dominated the postworld war two economy the current international econom is less easily categorized more and more countries are relevant and can impact the tenor of global finance the transition from dollar based fixed exchange rate system to floating exchange rate system has changed the imfs role dr amatically since the early 1980s its primary work has been balance of payments and fina ncial crisis support to its developing country members this has led the imf to embark on numerous governance and institutional policy reforms stressing increased transp arency accountability and inclusion of the developing countries in imf decisionmaking6 critics of the current selection process make two general arguments first any agreement that grants the leadership pos ition based on nationality must by done away with they argue that nationality prin ciple limits the pool of potential candidates excluding noneuropeans that may be better versed in the financ ial and development needs of the developing countries who are th major recipients of ifi assistance many also argue that the current system lends itself to political horsetrading among the eu countries as they divide up l eadership positions themselves it is important to raise the concern that broadening the process to incl ude many other countri does not inherentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810crs4 7 see the imf and recent capital account crises indonesia korea and brazil the independent evaluation office of the imf september 12 2003 8 kahler p 38 solve the horsetrading problem the election of imf officials like at any other major multilateral agencies is political process and electing the best candidate if such person can be identified without engaging th realities of internati onal politics is virtually impossible second they argue that the current sy stem where the executive board decides among candidates in secret closed door sessions is nontransparent and potentially undermines the legitimacy of the eventual managing director for any managing director to be successful they need to garner the respect and confidence of the imf staff and member countries since approximately twothirds of the imf membership have expressed their view that the current process is not appropriate any selection process that does not enfranchise the developi ng countries will be strained at best there is also the concern that the imf practice what it preaches the imf along with the world bank is at the forefront of promoting good gove rnance reforms throughout the world critics argue that the reform agenda pushed forward by the imfs staff of international civil servants may be compromised by the way it selects its own leadership practical concern though is that the united states and the europeans are the largest contributors to the imf and the world bank by forcing situation where the largest shareholders are not necessarily the largest stakeholders c ould fundamentally change the organizations most importantly the willingness of the unite d states to support these institutions could be diminished if its increased contributions di d not necessarily lead to greater influence the 2000 selection process horst kohler was appointed as the imf s eighth managing director on march 23 2000 after the retirement of michel camde ssus french national who was the only managing director appointed to three 5year terms mr kohlers appointment came at difficult time for the imf the late 1990s were period of numerous international financial crises during which the imfs involvement was heav ily criticized many observers believed that the imf was t oo heavyhanded in its imposing rigorous macroeconomic reforms as conditionality fo r accepting imf financial assistance to some extent this criticism s been acknowledged and accepted by the imf in its internal evaluations of its lending during the socalled asian financial crisis7 mr kohler was not europes first c hoice camdessuss retirement sparked passionate debate over who his successor would be since german had yet to hold the position germany assumed that it should be able to select the next managing director after european negotiations european consensus emerged around caio kochweser the german deputy minister of finance although kochweser received formal european union eu support for his candid acy at the february 28 2000 meeting of eu finance ministers ecofin and was nominated on behalf of the eu memberstates on february 29 2000 the united states did not support his candidacy after kochwesers formal proposal joe lockhart president bill clintons press secretary officially announced the us veto of kochwesers candidacy8 without the support of the united states and many developing countries w ho were supporting the candidacy of actinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21810crs5 9 kahler p 114 10 lopezcarlos augusto the imf is not the property of the rich international herald tribune march 15 2004 managing director stanley fischer kochweser was unable to get majority in the informal strawpoll vote after month of debate kochwesers name was removed fro m contention and was replaced by horst kohler also german national who was serving as the president of the european bank for reconstruction and developm ent kohler was selected as the new managing director on marc h 23 2000 less than one month after the eu had endorsed kochwesers candidacy although the euus convention emerged unscathed this was the first time that the official eu candidate was openly rejected by the united states morever the large amount of pr ess coverage that the selec tion process received gave the imfs critics ample opportunities to press for reforms to open up the managing director selection process making it more transparent more orderly and more receptive to the needs of imf borrowers the agenda for reforming the md section process in july 2000 the international monetary fund working group to review the process for selection of the managing director was created to discuss the selection procedure draft report of the working group was endorsed by the executive directors on april 26 2001 as guidance for the future sel ection of managing directors there is requirement that the imf executive board follow the guidelines proposed in the report for the following guidelines to be required the articles would need to be amended the report issu ed five recommendations 1 executive directors should establish clear criteria for identifying nominating and selecting qualified candidates for the post 2 executive directors should be informed in timely manner regarding candidates including their credentials and knowledge of the institution 3 there should be channel fo r facilitating smooth communication 4 transparency and accountability are critical 5 any decision concerning the selection pr ocess should take into account any impact on the selection process at other international financial institutions 9 immediately following mr kohlers resign ation wide range of experts advocated revision of the imf managing director selec tion process augosto carloslopez chief economist at the world economic forum calle d for choosing the new managing director from the entire imf membership in order to serve the interests of the entire international community10 moises naim editor of

of imf lending and according to dr birdsall the unwillingness of the us and the g7 to share power and responsibility in the global financial institutions is already undermining the legitimacy and effectiveness of these institutions12 within the imf developing country ex ecutive directors have voting group known as the group of eleven g11 to advocate th eir concerns this group represents over 100 countries and has an approx imately 30 vote on the executive board large enough to veto imf special majority decisions those requiring an 85 majority vote such as increasing the size of the fund

stating the process of identifying and sel ecting the candidate must be open and transparent with the goal of attracting the best person for the job regardless of nationality plurality of candidates representing the diversity of mbers across regions would be in the best interest of the fund13 in follow up release issued on march 21 2004 the g11 executive directors acknowledge that although abolishing the nationality principle and completely ensuring an open and transparent process are unlikely at the present time they propose few procedures to ensure that candi dates are proposed and vetted in clear and systematic process the proposed guidelines would require among other things that once an individual is nominated their credentials are made available to all executive directors and that the candidates should meet with the executive board before decision is reached14 for the 2004 selection it appears however that the europeans are determined to go ahead with the former process efforts are currently underway to identify common european candidate who will likely be acceptabl to the united states and the developing countries nonetheless the issue of proce dure for selection remains an active concern presuming major controversy remains after the europeans select the current nominee international attention is likely to shift towards preparing for the election of the next president of the world bank in 2005
