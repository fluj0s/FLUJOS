classes of noncitizens legal and illegal liens alike from receiving assistance in addition states have greater discretion in establishing eligibility for receipt of public benefits these changes in eligibility rules have required courts to revisit prior case law and dete rmine how principles that we re expressed in the context of earlier simpler regulation of noncitizen benefits apply now this report reviews the holdings of the major pre1996 cases and exa mines how they are being applied in the new regulatory environment this re port will be updated as events warrant general standards from constitutional perspective setting rules on providing assistance to noncitizens implicates three sets of interests 1 the plenary authority of the federal government to regula immigration along with its authority to spend federal funds for the general welfare 2 state aut onomy to regulate and expend funds for the general welfare and 3 the rights of nonc itizens to be free from unlawful discrimination during the 1970s and early 1980s the suprem court decided series of cases on governmental authority to discriminate against aliens in providing governmental benefits collectively these cases set out the following basic constitutional principles state governments generally cannot di scriminate between aliens who are authorized to live here indefinitely and us citizens in setting eligibility requirements for state benefits states have broader but limited authority to discriminate against aliens who are here illegally and the federal government by contrast has wide discretion to discriminate both between citizens and legal aliens and among various classes of legal alienshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21470crs2 2 403 us 365 3 in yick wo v hopkins 118 us 356 1886 the court

supreme court declared stateimposed welfare restrictions on lega l immigrants unconstitutional both because the st ate statutes violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment3 and because they encroached upon the exclusive fede ral power to re gulate immigration at issue in graham was whether states could impos separate add itional conditions for legal aliens receiving state or fe deral assistance funds they administered4 the court held that under the equal pr otection clause of the 14th amendment they could not absent compelling circumstances5 according to the court aliens as class are prime example of the type of discrete and insular minority that is due heightened judicial solicitude when states discriminate against them6 moreover the court rejected the asserted state interests in preserving scarce fiscal resources for citizens as insufficiently compelling to justify the alienage classifications7 equal protection aside the court further held that federal preeminence in regulating aliens was an independent ground for fi nding the separate stateimposed rules unconstitutional8 under the thenexisting law congress did not disqualify legal immigrants from receiving federal assistance nor did congress attach any immigration consequences to legal aliens receiving ssistance due to conditions arising after the aliens arrival also as now legal resident aliens were allowed to move as freely within the united states as citizens under these circumstances the court opined an additional burden placed by state on welfare benefits for legal resident aliens impermissibly encroached upon the exclusive federal power to regulate the conditions under which aliens may remain in the united states9 in footnote to the graham opinion the court stated th at it had occasion at that time to decide whether congress in the exercise of the federal immigration and naturalization power could enact statutes imposing residency requi rements on aliens as condition of receiving fe derally funde d benefits10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21470crs3 11 426 us 67 1976 12 id at 82 13 id 14 id at 84 15 id at 8687 16 457 us 202 1982 for discussion of the plyler decision see

requirement for alien pa rticipation in the medicare supplementary insurance part b program in upholding the residency requireme nt the court declared that it is obvious that congress has constitu tional duty to provide all aliens with the welfare benefits provided to citizens12 according to the court congress may draw distinctions among aliens in pr oviding benefits so long as the distinctions are not wholly irrational13 the mathews court recognized that the judicial deference given to discriminatory federal welfare provision was at odds with grahams recent application of close scrutiny standard to discriminatory state welfare measure14 yet the mathews court explained that the equal protection analysis in th two cases involves significantly different considerations because the fourteen th amendments limits on state powers are substantially different from the constitutional provisions applicable to the federal power over immigration and naturalization15 plyler v doe 16 in 1982 the supreme court in 54 decision held that it is unconstitutional to ny illegal alien ch ildren residing in state equal access to elementary and secondary schools the court reached this conclusion even while recognizing that illegal aliens by virtue of their illega l presence here alone are due lesser constitutional prot ection than legal aliens are nevertheless the court looked at thencurrent immigration enforcement policy and the consequences of depriving basic education to children who had control ove r their status and found that the states discrimination against illegal alien children could only be justified by substantial state interests burden not met in the case before it at the same time the court emphasized the unusual confluence of circumstances in plyler and suggested state authority to discriminate could be influenced by federal immigration policy welfare reform in general the rules on alien eligibility for government assistance were relatively simp prior to 1996 aliens w ho were permanently residing in the united states under color of law were treated like citizens in qualifying for state benefits and for the most part in qualifying for federal benef its illegal aliens with some exceptions were disqualified under most major assistance pr ograms but the rules were inconsistent or nonexistent with respect to range of other assistance this changed with the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconc iliation act of 1996 prwora the prwora broadly rewrote the alien eligibility rules fo r federal and state public assistance though

which aliens qualify for temporary assistance for needy families tanf or medicaid18 moreover legal immigrants are ineligible for federal meansbased assistance during their first five years here states are also authorized to determine which aliens qualify for statefunded be nefits including state cash assist ance so long as the standards are not more restrictive than standa rds under comparable federal programs19 illegal aliens are also denied fede ral benefits and ma qualify for state benefits only under laws passed by the states after prworas enactment the reach and interrelationship of these standards is unclear what is clear however is that prwora by direct requirement or through authorizati on potentially limits alien access to statefunded benefits in ways that are arguab ly unconstitutional under supreme court precedent especially graham v richardson 20 on one hand the courts precedent recognizes the plenary power of congress to regulate aliens and emphasizes the inability of the states to enact laws that conflict with congressional policy in this area21 on the other hand precedent also holds that under th fourteenth amendment states may not discriminate against legal permanent aliens absent compelling state interest22 the prwora raises the issue of whether the new federal restricti ons on aliens somehow affect the equal protection test that has been applied to states under graham in graham when the state of arizona argued that congress had implicitly authorized the states to restrict aid to families with dependent children afdc benefits for legal immigrants the court responded although the federal government admittedly has broad constitutional power to regulate alienscongress does not have the power to authorize the individual states to violate the equal protection clause23 in other words the court suggested that federal interests could not overcome the heightened protection that legal immigrants as suspect class are due vis vis the exercise of state power this was the view taken by the new york court of appeals in aliessa v novello24 in overturning new york law that relied on congressional authorization to the states in prwora to deny certain legal aliens medicaid the court found that t itle iv of the prwora could not constitutionally authoriz new york to determine for itself the extent to which it will discriminate against legal aliens for state medicaid eligibility because they remained suspect class that merited heightened protection for equalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21470crs5 25 id at 43435 26 id at 435 27 id 28 33

that an authorization to the states to discriminate did not appear to promote an overarching federal immigration policy because it allows for uneven treatment of similarly situated aliens among the states26 as such the court opined that title iv could not give the challenged statute special insulation from strict scrutiny review27 thus the challenged statute must be evaluated as any other state statute that classifies based on alienage state courts have reached differing conclu sions as to the constitutionality of state classifications of alienage ma pursuant to federal authorization for example in kurti v maricopa county 28 the arizona court of appeals reviewed state statute that denied state health care for indigents to all aliens who arrived after prworas enactment the court principally referenced two provisions of prwora in overturning the statute on equal protection grounds sec tion 403 provide s that aliens arriving after prworas enactment are ineligible for certain federal meanstested health benefits including medicaid for five years after entry29 the second section 412 generally authorizes states to determine the eligibility of aliens for state benefits30 the court first dismissed the states argument that it tracked federal standa rds finding that the arizona statue extended ineligibility beyond five years af ter entry the court then he ld that the authority given to states under section 412 could not sustain ariz onas restrictions pecially where state law goes beyond comparable federal restri ctions in the courts opinion the equal protection analysis in graham v richardson applied and the statut could not pass strict scrutiny in alvarino v wing 31 an intermediate new york court dealt with an issue of state laws that affirmatively sought to restore some benefits to some aliens who lost assistance because of prwora prwora generally ma aliens ineligible for food stamps federallyfunded program congre ss later authorized the stat to provide statefunded food assistance to aliens who lost eligibility for food stamps because of prwora new york then passed law to give state food assi stance to some but not all aliens who had lost food stamps under ra tional basis analysis the cour t found this affirmative grant of assistance to limited class constitutional the court concluded that new york was not obligated to assist either all or none of the affected liens finding that due to the explicit congressional pproval permitting the states to pr ovide food aid benefits to the persons who lost benefits alienage could not be considered suspect classification32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21470crs6 33 773 ne2d 404 mass 2002 34 252 f3d 567 2d cir 2001 35 42 usc 1396ae4 and 42 cfr 435117 435301b1iii 36 252 f3d 567 588 37 ida similar result was reached through somewhat different reasoning by massachusetts court in doe v mcintire 33 case that examined massachusetts statute that gave state assistance to certain aliens who were ineligible for comparable federal assistance because of prwora eligibility fo r this state assistance was limited to aliens who resided in the state for at least six months essentially the court held that while state laws broadly discr iminating between citizens and aliens under congressional authorization had to be justified under the heightened strict scrutiny test the statute before it was subject to sser standard because it was limite d to grant of assistance to aliens only applying the more lenient sta ndard the court conclude d that the distinctions drawn in the law were rational the foregoing cases address congressional authorizations to states to set alien eligibility rules with courts looking more favorably on affi rmative exercises of authority to provide benefits to those who are otherwise ineligible than on exercises of authority to cut off assistance as mentione d above however congress also has mandated that certain aliens not receive various types of fe deral and state assistance among the legal issues related to these mandates is whether they impose constitutionally impermissible classifications on individuals not directly subject to the mandates the issue of the indirect reach of mandated denial of assistance was before the second circuit court of appeals in the case of lewis v thompson 34 under prwora congress mandated that illega l alien women be ineligib for prenatal care under medicaid congress also enacted provision that automatically provides medicaid coverage at birth to children born of medicaideligible mothers but imposes waiting period on covering children born of mo thers who are not medicaideligible35 under both the constitution and federal statute children born in the us of illegal alien mothers are us citizens at birth and dispute arose as to whether congress could differentiate among us citizen children on the basis of their mothers immigration status in addressing this issue the court dis missed the argument that children of all medicaidineligible mothers rather than alienage was the relevant classification36 the court considered what should be the proper st andard of review for federal statute that discriminates on the basis of the immigration status of an individuals parent relying on plyler the court found that an inte rmediate level of scrutin analysis was appropriate the court found that the circumstances at i ssue were analogous to the ones presented in plyler inasmuch as children were penalized fo r their parents ille gal conduct resulting in significant and enduring dverse consequences to the ch ildren the court focused on this aspect of the plyler decision while not explicitly addressing the intermediate level of scrutiny or the pertinent governmental intere sts as such the c ourt found that citizen children of undocumented mothers must be accorded automatic eligibility on terms as favorable as those available to the children of citizen mothers37
