lives and increasing planned procurement of strikefighters this report will be updated as events warrant background navy and marine corps strikefighters the navy and marine corps which are both part of the department of the navy don each operate hundreds of strike fighters which are tactical aircraft that can conduct both airtoground ie strike and airtoair ie fighter operations strikefighters constitute the majority of the aircraft in each of the navys 10 activeduty aircraft carrier air wings cvws1 of the 70 or more aircraft typically embarked on navy aircraft carrier 44 are strikefighters strike fighters also constitute significant portion of the marine corps three activeduty marine air wings maws2 some marine corps strikefighters are assigned to navy cvws the principal strikefighter operated by the navy and marine corps is the fa18 hornetsuper hornet manufactured by boeing the older through d models of the fa18 are called hornets while the newer larger and more capable and f models are called super hornets the navy operates more than 600 hornets and super hornets while the marine corps operates more than 200 hornets plus roughly 130 av8b harriers which are short takeoff vertical landing stovl attack aircraft3 in coming 1 in the abbreviation cvw cv means aircraft carrier and w means air wing in addition to the 10 activeduty cvws the navy also operates one reserve tactical air wing 2 in addition to the three activeduty maws the marine corps operates one reserve maw 3 as of april 2008 don operated total of 964 hornets and super hornets including 334 navy hornets 311 navy super hornets 217 marine corps hornets and 102 additional hornets in continued crs2 years the navy plans to retire its hornets and shift to combination of super hornets and f35 lightning ii joint strike fighters jsfs while the marine corps plans to retire both its hornets and harriers and shift to strikefighter force composed entirely of f35s the carriercapable version of the f35 intended for the navy is designated the f35c while the stovl version intended for the marine corps is designated the f35b4 strikefighter procurement the first fa18efs were procured in fy1997 total of

report rl30563 crs3 the projected shortfall8 dons inventory of strikefighters currently falls short of the number that navy officials state is required to fully support requirements for cvws and maws and the navy is projecting that this shortfall will grow in coming years the navy projects that current don strikefighter shortfall of about 15 aircraft will grow to about 30 aircraft in fy2009 to more than 50 aircraft in fy2016 and to more than 90 aircraft in fy2017fy2020 before declining to more than 50 aircraft in fy2021 and to roughly zero aircraft by fy2025 at its peak in fy2017 the navy states the projected don strikefighter shortfall will be 125 aircraft of which 69 will be navy strikefighters the navy states that the projected don strikefighter shortfall if applied entirely against navy cvws would have the effect of reducing the number of activeduty cvws during the period fy2016fy2020 from 10 to 7 the navy states that the projected shortfall is the most optimistic projection because it assumes among other things that the service lives of hornets can be extended from the current planning figure of 8000 flight hours to 10000 flight hours the hornets were originally built for service lives of 6000 hours goal that was later changed to 8000 hours the navys most optimistic projection also assumes that procurement of f35s for don will increase from year to year as currently planned and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22875 eventually reach sustained rate of 50 aircraft per year although extending hornet service lives to 10000 hours is assumed in the navys most optimistic projection the navy has not yet determined whether such an extension is feasible and costeffective the navy stated in lateapril or earlymay 2008 that it felt fairly confident we can get to 10000 hours on the hornet but we havent finished the assessment yet9 in july 2008 however it was reported that preliminary results from continuing navy review have found that keeping the through dmodel hornets flying longer will require additional inspections modifications and longer time out of service navy spokesman said our estimate of the strike fighter gap assumed we could proceed with the slep servicelife extension program on the hornets as planned the spokesman said the scope and extent of the effect on the shortfall will take approximately four to six months to determine early results from the review also found hot spots in the current hornet fleet that could force the navy to conduct inspections and further modify the aircraft to keep them flying for just 8000 hours additional study is required to determine whether or not these fatigue hot spots are unique or systemic the spokesman said10 if hornet lives can be extended to 10000 hours but the sustained f35 procurement rate turns out to be 35 aircraft per year rather than 50 per year the navy states the 8 unless otherwise indicated this section is based on navy briefing papers provided to crs on april 24 2008 and industry briefing papers provided to crs on april 10 and 22 2008 9 zachary m peterson balderson navy to address fighter shortfall in pom10 planning inside the navy may 5 2008 the article was based on an interview with navy official that occurred the previous week 10 megan scully navys fighter jet shortage may be worse than expected national journals congressdailypm july 18 2008 bracketed material as in the original crs4 projected don strikefighter shortfall would increase to more than 120 aircraft in fy2016 more than 160 aircraft in fy2017 and more than 200 aircraft in fy2019 fy2022 peaking at 229 aircraft in fy2022 and then decline to more than 120 aircraft in fy2025 within that projection the navy states the shortfall in navy strikefighters would exceed 80 aircraft for the period fy2017fy2022 peaking at 109 aircraft in fy2020 the navy states that this greater projected don shortfall if applied entirely against navy cvws would have the effect of reducing the number of activeduty cvws during the period fy2016fy2020 from 10 to 6 some industry sources argue that the strikefighter shortfall is likely to be roughly twice as large as the navys most optimistic projection due to difficulties in extending hornet lives to 10000 hours and risks in the planned f35 procurement profile they argue that extending hornet lives to 10000 hours is highrisk assumption given the material condition of hornets today including recently discovered problem called stress corrosion cracking they also argue that the f35s initial operational capability ioc date may be delayed because of delays in completing the development of the aircraft and that funding constraints may limit procurement of f35s for don to less than 50 per year they calculate that if the f35s ioc is delayed one year and if budget constraints limit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22875 procurement of f35s for don to 42 per year the projected shortfall in navy strike fighters would increase to 80 aircraft starting in 2010 and peak at 134 aircraft versus 69 under the navys projection11 reported unsolicited proposal from boeing boeing reportedly has made an unsolicited offer to the navy to begin procuring an improved version of the fa18ef featuring upgraded avionics under this proposal the navy could forego procuring f 35cs while waiting for an even more advanced strikefighter design that could become available for procurement around 202412 issues for congress size of strikefighter shortfall one issue for congress to consider is the potential size of the shortfall key factors to consider include the likelihood that the navy will be able to extend hornet lives to 10000 hours the likelihood that the f35 will achieve its scheduled ioc and the likelihood that don will achieve sustained f35 production rate of 50 aircraft per year concerning the development schedule for the f35 march 2008 government accountability office gao report on the f35 program states three independent defense offices separately concluded that the f35 program development schedule is likely to slip from 12 to 27 months13 potential operational implications of shortfall second issue for congress to consider are the potential operational implications of the strikefighter shortfall for 11 source briefing from industry officials to crs on april 10 2008 12 see david fulghum boeing plans sixth generation fighters along with block 3 super hornet aerospace daily defense report january 30 2008 and chris amos super duper hornet defense news april 7 2008 13 government accountability office joint strike fighter recent decisions by dod add to program risks gao08388 march 2008 summary page crs5 either conflict situations or for meeting demands for daytoday forward deployments of don strikefighters for purposes of regional deterrence and reassurance the shortfall could lead to reduction in the number of strikefighter squadrons available for service reduction in the number strike fighters in each squadron or both options for congress options for congress to address the projected don strikefighter shortfall include but are not limited to the following some of which could be combined request further information and analysis from don andor industry concerning the potential size of the shortfall fund service life extensions of hornets to as much as 10000 hours if such extensions prove feasible and cost effective increase planned procurement of fa18efs in coming years increased planned procurement of f35s in coming years and expedited procurement of new longrange bomber httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22875 regarding the third option fa18ef procurement could be continued for few years beyond fy2012 until procurement of f35s for don begins to increase to higher levels alternatively fa18ef procurement could be continued for longer period of time so that mix of substantial numbers of both fa18efs and f35s is procured for certain number of years third option would be to begin procuring improved fa 18efs in lieu of procuring f35s while waiting for an even more advanced strikefighter to become available for procurement around 2024 supporters of increased fa18ef procurement could argue that the fa18ef is capable aircraft that it is less expensive to procure than the f35 and that procuring the established fa18ef design poses less risk of cost growth than procuring the new f35 design regarding the fourth option supporters of increased f35 procurement could argue that the f35 as newer design is more capable than the fa18ef and thus more able to counter potential future military challenges such as those that might be posed by improved chinese military forces14 that the cost difference between the f35 and the fa 18ef is not as great as it appears on first inspection because the procurement cost of the f35 includes the cost for number of ancillary pieces of equipment that are purchased separately for the fa18ef and that reducing or eliminating the f35c buy for the navy could reduce economies of scale in producing f35s and thereby increase the cost of f35s that are built for the marine corps the air force and foreign buyers don officials in addition to studying the feasibility of extending hornet service lives to 10000 hours reportedly are considering the option of procuring an additional 50 to 282 fa18s and the option of either accelerating or slowing down planned production of f35s15 the navy reportedly would consider using third myp arrangement for fa 14 see crs report rl33153 15 vago muradian us navy struggles with fighter gap defense news april 7 2008 see also philip ewing fearing fighter gap navy mulls new jet buy navytimescom march 6 2008 crs6 18efs procured in fy2010fy2014 should fa18ef procurement be increased16 the navy reportedly is not interested in the option of skipping production of f35cs17 regarding the fifth option cvws and longrange bombers share important attributes neither requires intheater bases and thus offer potential for prompt strikes in crisis therefore an increased inventory of longrange bombers could in some ways make up for shortfall in don strike fighters of course longrange bombers have other attributes that do not mirror don strike fighters such as higher cost and lower potential survivability this means that replacing don strike fighters with longrange bombers would change the overall capabilities of dod airpower either negatively or positively depending on the context current dod plans call for fielding new long range bomber by 2018 and bomber advocates have argued that new bomber could be fielded in more timely manner18 legislative activity for fy2009 fy2009 defense authorization bill hr 5658s 3001 section 124 of hr 5658 as reported by the house armed services committee would require the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22875 secretary of defense to submit report on fa18ef and ea18g procurement for fy2010 through fy2015 including comparative costs and benefits of using annual versus multiyear procurement to procure the aircraft and the secretarys recommendation as to whether congress should authorize multiyear procurement for the aircraft the provision would also authorize subject to the availability of appropriations the secretary of the navy to obligate up to 100 million of the amount authorized for fa18ef and ea18g procurement for use in cost reduction initiatives in fy2009 the committees report hrept 110652 of may 16 2008 discusses section 124 on pages 141142 the senate armed services committee in its report srept 110335 of may 12 2008 expressed concern about the projected don strikefighter shortfall and its belief that the navys estimate of the size of the shortfall may be based on questionable assumptions the committee stated that it believes that multiyear procurement of additional fa18efs may be helpful in reducing the shortfall and that the navy should explore all available options in determining how to address the shortfall the committee expressed concern that failure to establish the conditions for multiyear procurement of fa18efs could reduce the savings of such procurement the committee stated that it remains supportive of the f35 and that navy plans for procuring f35cs should not be affected if the navy decides to pursue an fa18ef multiyear contract pages 123 124 concerned by testimony that it received from dod regarding aircraft shortfalls the committee required sec 171 dod to annually submit longterm plan for procuring tactical aircraft so that congress can make rational judgements about which aircraft programs to fund 16 see for example the short items entitled closing the gap and up front cost in the april 14 2008 issue of defense daily 17 david fulghum navy wants f35c and perhaps
