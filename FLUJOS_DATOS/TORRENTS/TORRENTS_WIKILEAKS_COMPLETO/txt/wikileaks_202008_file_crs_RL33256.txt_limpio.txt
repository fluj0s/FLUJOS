energy department task force report february 1 2006 jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress nuclear weapons complex reconfiguration analysis of an energy department task force report summary congress annually funds the nuclear weapons complex the complex those sites that develop maintain manufacture and dismantle nuclear weapons in hearings held in 2004 the house appropriations committee pressed the secretary of energy for systematic review of requirements for the weapons complex over the next twentyfive years the committee expressed its concern that the complex is not well suited to the postcold war situation and should reflect presidential decisions on the stockpile as well as issues of cost security and complex size in response the nuclear weapons complex infrastructure task force of the secretary of energy advisory board prepared report released in final form in october 2005 the report indicated that the complex had redundant facilities security concerns high cost excessive competition between the weapons labs and inadequate equipment for the production plants to redress these problems the task force proposed restructuring the complex it would shift much production and some rd to new nuclear production center probably close one or more plants contract out some nonnuclear work shrink the labs consolidate facilities and take steps to make governance more effective it was concerned that current warheads produced during the cold war are inappropriate for the current situation because they have more yield and efficiency than is needed yet are more vulnerable to terrorist threats than is desirable are hard to manufacture are designed close to failure points and will probably become harder to maintain it recommends restructuring the nuclear arsenal by producing newdesign reliable replacement warheads rrws with characteristics deemed more suitable to the current environment the report links complex and warheads in the task forces view rrws would be easier to produce and maintain permitting smaller more efficient and less costly complex observers familiar with the current complex raise several concerns from their perspective closing complex sites and facilities might meet fatal political opposition they maintain that the report seems to downplay the value of investments in complex facilities over six decades and projects large cost savings through 2030 based on questionable assumptions they fear that shifting key tasks that the nuclear weapons labs perform to other sites could disrupt the labs ability to do their work the recommendation to proceed immediately with rrw deals with restructuring weapons rather than the complex and in this view may go beyond the task forces mandate department of defense official stated that department of defense department of energy agency did not approve the task forces proposed 3step transition to rrw despite the reports strong implication to the contrary while any final decision on deploying rrws must await completion of studies that might possibly reject rrw the task force assumes rrw will proceed and does not examine how its restructured complex would support current warheads some express concern that task force recommendations may be at odds with us nuclear

of eight governmentowned contractoroperated sites see appendix that study maintain and disassemble us nuclear weapons the national nuclear security agency nnsa semiautonomous part of the department of energy doe manages it some in congress have expressed concern that the us nuclear stockpile and the complex are becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain that security costs are rising sharply and that the complex is not sufficiently responsive to the needs of its customer the department of defense dod further they maintain it is difficult for congress to judge the merits of various large expenditures for the complex such as for major research facilities without longterm road map in this report site refers to an entire laboratory or plant or the nevada test site while facility refers to structure within site such as for production of specific item or for experiments or computation to address these concerns the house energy and water development appropriations subcommittee asked the secretary of energy to conduct study of the complex looking out 25 years and to make recommendations on restructuring the complex the committees report stated during the fiscal year 2005 budget hearings the committee pressed the secretary on the need for systematic review of requirements for the weapons complex over the next twentyfive years and the secretary committed to conducting such review the secretarys report should assess the implications of the presidents decisions on the size and composition of the stockpile the cost and operational impacts of the new design basis threat and the personnel facilities and budgetary resources required to support the smaller stockpile the report should evaluate opportunities for the consolidation of special nuclear materials facilities and operations across the complex to minimize security requirements and the environmental impact of continuing operations the secretary should assemble team of outside experts to assist with this review prior reviews have largely been conducted by insiders from the weapons complex who produce the predictable but not very credible recommendation that the department should preserve the status quo and maintain all existing facilities and capabilities as part of the fiveyear integrated budget plan for the entire department that is directed elsewhere in this report the secretary will have to balance nnsa requirements against competing needs for other doe programs crs2 this will require an objective review that is only possible with the help of independent experts who are not and have not been part of the nnsa weapons complex the committee directs the secretary to submit written report on his findings and recommendations on the nnsa complex to the house and senate committees on appropriations and armed services not later than april 30 20051 in response the secretary of energy in january 2005 had the secretary of energy advisory board seab form the nuclear weapons complex infrastructure task force hereinafter referred to as the task force or tf it issued draft final report in july 20052 after receiving comments it transmitted the final report to seab on october 4 with changes from the july version letter from david overskei chairman of the task force included clarifications on nuclear weapon storage and on production of key component also on october 4 seab transmitted the report to the secretary of energy3 the task forces view of and vision for the complex the tf reported that there was master plan guiding the complex instead it stated that there were redundant facilities within the complex excessive competition between the weapons labs an imbalance between the labs with stateof theart experimental facilities and the production plants with archaic equipment and special nuclear material snm see appendix at six of the eight complex sites increasing vulnerability to terrorist attack and raising security costs the tf also found current warheads to have undesirable characteristics such as designs offering less safety and less control over unauthorized use than dod and doe wanted designs that approached too closely the point at which they would fail components that were difficult to manufacture excessive use of exotic or hazardous materials and maintenance that would probably become ever more costly these problems resulted in high costs as result the task force concluded the status quo is neither technically credible nor financially sustainable ix throughout this report numbers in parentheses refer to pages in the task forces report the

meet unforeseen challenges and threats to the nations security are sustained by complex operating interactively and continuously conducting research nonnuclear testing and weapon modernization production and dismantlement 4 it would be responsive to the needs of its customer dod as measure of responsiveness the complex will be designed to respond to any needed design change in less than 18 months field prototype nuclear weapon in less than 36 months and go into full production in less than 48 months and perform an underground test at the nevada test site within 18 months by 2030 the complex would be in equilibrium producing and dismantling at rate of 125 devices per year 4 the tf would restructure the complex closing some sites building another relocating some experimental facilities and making other such facilities available for use by complex personnel it would dismantle all cold warera weapons the current stockpile by 2030 the replacement warheads and restructured complex would according to the tf be safer more secure and less costly the tf recommended proceeding briskly to implement this vision the task force vision is best achieved at the lowest risk to the nations nuclear deterrent through an aggressive schedule for achieving the 2030 vision with nearterm budget increases resulting in substantially larger accumulated longterm budget reductions 5 main recommendations of the task force to remedy the perceived problems and implement its vision the tf made two main related recommendations first it created master plan that would restructure the entire complex the plan has several key elements consolidated nuclear production center cnpc would produce all components in the nuclear explosive package or nep see appendix including those made from uranium plutonium and high explosives and would assemble complete nuclear weapons while pantex would dismantle current warheads by 2030 cnpc would dismantle the next generation of warheads vii 4 cnpc would include facility for fabrication of plutonium components separate facility for fabrication of uranium components materials research laboratory facility for machining and testing all the insensitive high explosive for the complex though the explosive itself might be procured from outside vendors or dod building for weapons assembly and disassembly areas to store plutonium and pits another building to store uranium and secondaries and several other facilities 1416 cnpc would not store deployed warheads4 4 the task force specifically wishes to point out that the consolidated nuclear production center is not proposed as location to consolidate the storage of nuclear weapons that are in the deployed stockpile letter from dr david overskei chairman seab nuclear weapons complex infrastructure task force to m peter mcpherson chairman secretary of energy advisory board department of energy october 4 2005 p 1 crs4 the y12 plant fabricates and stores uranium components and assembles and stores secondaries these functions would move to cnpc it thus appears likely that y12 would close pantex could close the tf states upon dismantlement of the last of the cold war weapons pantex if not the site of the cnpc could be decommissioned 19 while dismantlement of the last cold war weapon is envisioned to occur by 2030 4 the tf also emphasizes accelerating dismantlement e2 kansas city plant would not be part of cnpc it would continue to produce nonnuclear components batteries fuzes bomb casings etc but as many components as practical would be procured from commercial vendors 22 the labs would become smaller the tf states technical staffing levels at the design laboratories can be significantly reduced as the complex leverages the years of investment in new automated test and computational capabilities at the design laboratories perhaps greater impact on complex staffing levels will be the efficiency realized by personnel moving into continuous design plus weapon production and manufacturing cycles which evolve into family of modular nuclear weapons 23 some large experimental and scientific facilities might move to cnpc or nts and duplicative facilities at more than one lab might be closed and the remaining facility of each type made into user facility ie available to staff of all labs viii j1j3 the tf raises the prospect that one of the two nuclear weapon physics labs alamos national laboratory lanl and lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl might close the longterm requirement for two physics design laboratories will be determined through overall complex performance and needs 4 some lab facilities under consideration would move to cnpc for example the chemistry and metallurgy research replacement cmrr building at lanl for rd on uranium and plutonium for which construction began in january 2006 would instead be built at cnpc on grounds that other facilities to be placed in cnpc would have similar capability lanl would instead have cmrr lite designed for only laboratory sample levels of material and amenable to commercial security 21 one lab would house highend computing for the entire complex and complex staff at other sites could use that sites resources by remote connection 20 the nevada test site might gain several experimental facilities j1 j3 and is possible site for cnpc crs5 governance would be made more effective in the tfs view so as to enable the transformations needed for the complex and the stockpile 25 dodnnsa project officers groups which are key elements in managing integration of warhead with the weapon system throughout the entire life cycle would have representation from the plants 25 as is being done with the reliable replacement warhead program described below nnsa would have more independence within doe 26 nnsa offices at complex sites would report to the deputy administrator for defense programs rather than to the nnsa administrator 27 business practices would change 2732 and an office of transformation would be the change agent viii that would conduct riskbenefit and other analyses to support transformation of the complex 33 the problems that the tf found with the complex are intertwined with the products the complex supports accordingly the second main recommendation of the task force is to proceed promptly with family of warheads designed to meet different set of requirements and constraints than current warheads for detailed discussion of reliable replacement warhead rrw program and the life extension program lep discussed in the balance of this section see crs report rl32929 nuclear weapons the reliable replacement warhead program by jonathan medalia current warheads were designed and manufactured during the cold war to meet cold war requirements within the constraints of the time dod needed warheads with high explosive yield and that had high yield to weight that is they achieved their yield in the lightest package they were also tightly constrained as to size and shape to meet those goals nuclear weapon designers used sophisticated design features exotic and hazardous materials and hardtoproduce components and pushed designs close to points where they would fail while these weapons are complex nuclear testing gave designers confidence in their performance however the last us nuclear test was held in september 1992 the united states has observed test moratorium since then to maintain cold warera weapons without testing the complex undertakes leps when certain key weapon components deteriorate or otherwise need replacement an lep seeks to remanufacture these components as closely as possible to the original specifications the reason is that nuclear testing confirmed the safety and reliability of the designs now without testing nnsa chooses to minimize loss of confidence in warheads that use remanufactured components by minimizing changes so as to keep the components as close to their original testproven pedigree as possible there is considerable debate about whether leps will be able to maintain existing warheads indefinitely supporters argue that for nine years the secretaries of energy and defense have been able to certify that the stockpile remains safe and reliable without resorting to nuclear testing they have been able to do this because of the existing stockpile stewardship program ssp and key parts of it surveillance of warheads to monitor for defects and life extension programs these various programs have greatly increased knowledge of weapons performance and potential problems and knowledge of specific weapon types has likewise increased with crs6 experience supporters therefore believe that lep should enable the united states to maintain warheads indefinitely without testing nnsa questions the longterm viability of lep according to ambassador linton brooks administrator of nnsa it is becoming more difficult and costly to certify warhead remanufacture the evolution away from tested designs resulting from the inevitable accumulations of small changes over the extended lifetimes of these systems means that we can count on increasing uncertainty in the longterm certification of warheads in the stockpile5 lep also it is argued imposes high costs on the complex the tf states to support this unique stockpile the complex must maintain parts materials processes and even tools that are longer in common use to ensure capability to respond to any stockpile problems thus our current stockpile is extraordinarily expensive to monitor and to maintain 11 because of the costs and potential uncertainties associated with the types of warheads being maintained representative david hobson chairman of the house energy and water development appropriations subcommittee proposed new approach the reliable replacement warhead rrw program the fy2005 budget request had included funds for rrw and other committee reports for fy2005 had not referenced it instead rrw made its first legislative appearance in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 which provided 90 million for the purpose for fy2006 nnsa requested 94 million for rrw and congress appropriated 250 million the rrw program would design warheads taking into account the great changes in requirements and missions affecting warheads since the end of the cold war there is less need for high yield or for high yieldtoweight ratio accepting reductions in yield and yieldtoweight it is argued would enable weapon designers to move away from the complicated designs hardtomanufacture components and exotic materials that characterized cold war weapons instead the tf recommends setting number of design parameters including certification without underground nuclear testing inexpensive manufacture and disassembly ease of maintenance maximizing component reuse and minimizing lifecycle costs 8 the tf views immediate design of reliable replacement warhead as the most important element for transforming the stockpile 13 rrw advocates believe that these characteristics would benefit the complex in their view simpler easiertomanufacture designs could be made with simpler equipment would use less floor space and would have higher throughput reduction in hazardous and exotic materials would reduce the threat to worker and environmental safety permitting reduction in equipment and floor space designing nuclear explosive packages to incorporate use control and use denial 5 statement of ambassador linton f brooks administrator national nuclear security administration us department of energy before the senate armed services committee subcommittee on strategic forces apr 4 2005 p 3 crs7 features would reduce the amount of physical security required6 these factors would also be expected to reduce cost discussion of task force recommendations in the task force scenario construction of modernized complex would be simpler and less costly with several facilities built at single site the tf anticipates that operating costs would be lower for single new cnpc than for several facilities dating back halfcentury or more with security designed into warheads and facilities alike rather than retrofitted the tf projects that physical security costs would be lower it holds that new equipment should be more efficient than combination of new and old equipment and that removing most fissile material from alamos and livermore should reduce their security costs making many experimental facilities into user facilities to the extent that that differs from current practice might reduce costs further in this view the shift to rrw could offer savings and increased confidence in design production maintenance and certification yet some observers maintain that some tf recommendations may prove difficult or impossible to implement the balance of this report discusses some of the task force recommendations reliable replacement warhead program recommendations the tf makes recommendation that it believes is the most important element for transforming the stockpile the task force endorses the immediate initiation of the modernization of the stockpile through the design of the reliable replacement warhead this should lead to family of modern nuclear weapons designed with greater margin to meet military requirements while incorporating stateoftheart surety requirements the task force recommends that new version of the rrw incorporating new design concepts and surety features be initiated on planned fiveyear cycles this family of weapons will form the basis of the sustainable stockpile of the future 13 congressional language calling for the tf report stated that the report should assess the implications of the presidents decisions on the size and composition of the stockpile 7 these decisions were to be inputs for the tf which would then determine how to restructure the complex to implement them similarly the secretary of energy in letter to the tf chair wanted the tf to provide options and recommendations by the end of april 2005 to modernize consolidate and where 6 according to ambassador linton brooks if we were designing the stockpile today we would apply new technologies and approaches to warheadlevel use control as means to reduce physical security costs statement of ambassador linton f brooks

on appropriations energy and water development appropriations bill 2005 hrept 108554 to accompany hr 4614 108th congress 2nd session 2004 p 111 crs8 possible reduce costs of the infrastructure and facilities across the nwc nuclear weapons complex based on recent stockpile reductions and new security design basis threat requirements8 while the tf made numerous recommendations on the complex key recommendations concerned the stockpile itself that nnsa proceed with rrw and that dod change the characteristics it required of warheads in order to facilitate manufacture the dod should work to relax the military characteristics of its nuclear weapons in order to generate the design space necessary for nnsa to develop highmargin manufacturable designs for the future stockpile 34 some feel the tf may have exceeded its mandate by recommending how to redesign nuclear weapons for example seab noted concerns about the tfs work on rrw number of seab members believe that the issue of reliable replacement warhead rrw will need further study by the department of energy and the administration9 on the other hand complex and warheads are linked the goal of the complex is to design and manufacture product and characteristics of the product will necessarily shape the complex complex intended to produce reliable replacement warheads would be expected to differ from one intended to conduct life extension programs there is case to be made for shaping the complex to support rrws the tf finds the status quo is neither technically credible nor financially sustainable ix further ambassador linton brooks administrator of nnsa said that the current stockpile is the wrong one for todays needs technically militarily and politically and from the standpoints of longevity cost and physical security10 if current warheads are as problematic as claimed though others disagree as noted earlier perhaps it makes sense to design complex to support an alternative warhead type yet it may well have been appropriate for the tf to have shaped complex to support leps as well as rrws perhaps with path for the complex to transition to supporting only rrws if congress and the administration later decide to proceed exclusively with that warhead type while congress and the administration support rrw at this early stage that is not the same as commitment to deploy even one rrw type let alone an allrrw stockpile it may turn out that the future stockpile will be allrrw but final decision on whether to manufacture and deploy even the first rrw can be made for several years or more indeed choice among rrw design options is expected until november 200611 if for some reason the administration decides not to proceed with rrw likely fallback position would 8 letter from secretary of energy spencer abraham to dr david overskei january 26 2005 p 1 9 letter transmitting the task force report from peter mcpherson chairman secretary of energy advisory board to the honorable samuel w bodman secretary of energy october 4 2005 1 p 10 statement of ambassador linton f brooks administrator national nuclear security administration us department of energy before the senate armed services committee subcommittee on strategic forces apr 4 2005 p 24 11 us congress committee of conference making appropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes hrept 109275 to accompany hr 2419 109th congress 1st session 2005 p 159 crs9 be to continue maintaining existing warheads using lep in any event the complex will probably conduct leps of current warheads for many years it thus can be argued that it is premature to design complex based on the assumption that rrw will proceed the fiveyear cycle plan that the tf suggests could offer significant benefits for dod and nnsa continuous design certification production and deployment of nuclear weapons would exercise the complex provide realworld training to scientific and production staff minimize agerelated defects in weapons and permit the introduction of new design features into the stockpile developing and maintaining skills would increase dods confidence in the complex confidence that the complex could produce warheads in time to respond to adversary efforts to develop threats to the united states the responsive infrastructure that the december 2001 nuclear posture review called for would permit dod to reduce the number of reserve warheads it maintains as hedge to augment the force if needed confidence in the reliability of the new warheads would permit dod to reduce the number of warheads it maintains as reliability backups in case problems emerge with deployed warheads reducing warhead numbers and incorporating new usecontrol features could reduce dods security costs saving large sums in other ways however continuous design and production might impose high costs rrws are supposed to be easier to maintain than current warheads replacing one generation of rrws with another as the tf suggests 7 rather than maintaining the first would appear to forgo the maintenance advantage while incurring large costs for designing and producing new warheads and dismantling those being replaced b some claim that rrw might permit stockpile of fewer designs while at least two warhead types are currently available for each type of delivery system one rrw design might be used on more than one type of delivery system that approach could save money by reducing the number of designs and spare units in the stockpile simplifying production and maintenance and permitting smaller complex that advantage could be lost if steady stream of rrw designs entered and left the stockpile c firstgeneration rrws would presumably incorporate large gains in technology made since the last warhead was designed two decades ago if those rrws meet the high standards required to be certified for the stockpile though technical gains from subsequent generations might be modest d an ongoing production and replacement program would require larger and more costly complex than that needed to produce firstgeneration rrws and maintain them for decades through leps such program might raise proliferation concerns as discussed below the tf introduces new element into the rrw program block transition transition strategy emerging from the dod would put the nation on new path toward the sustainable stockpile this strategy already endorsed by the nuclear weapons council12 is based on the rrw concept an rrw weapon design is responsive to an existing weapon mission but moves the stockpile toward the 12 authors note the joint nuclear weapons council is small doddoe agency established by 10 usc 179 that coordinates nuclear weapons activities between the two departments crs10 sustainable stockpile of the future its introduction is made possible by segmenting the current leps into discrete blocks block 1 would incorporate the current lep design but would be truncated much sooner than normally planned and transitioned to the block 2 design rrw1 which would include some but probably not all attributes of the future stockpile as soon as practical block 2 would be transitioned to block 3 rrw2 which would incorporate all the attributes of the future stockpile implementation of this rrw block change strategy system by system would ensure smooth transition to sustainable nuclear stockpile and eventually to stockpile designed for modern deterrence 1213 block 2 could provide faster route to upgrading the stockpile than move directly to block 3 it would presumably incorporate features that were easier to design and manufacture leaving more difficult ones for block 3 as steppingstone to block 3 block 2 would in effect function as pilot project that would reveal potential difficulties in design and manufacture thus facilitating design and manufacture of subsequent rrws and lowering their costs block 2 would also be consistent with the tfs proposal for an ongoing cycle of design and manufacture with block 2 warheads done in the first cycle and block 3 warheads in the next it is however hard to know if these advantages would materialize because the tf does not provide clear definition of block 2 even though block 2 could involve billions of dollars for new warheads the only references to it in the entire report are in the paragraph quoted above along with brief mention on page 34 block 2 warheads would apparently include some features of current designs and some features of rrw designs but it is not clear which changes would render warhead block 2 warheads using components outside the nuclear explosive package such as radars that have been modified from the original design would probably not be considered as block 2 such components are tested extensively in the laboratory as part of existing leps warheads designed around newlymade pits of selected old designs might be counted as block 2 because the state of the art in design and manufacture has advanced considerably over the years pit designs from several decades ago might be simpler to manufacture than current designs that press the state of the art the fact that they have been tested would facilitate certification on the other hand they would not have some key rrw features and would divert resources from block 3 rrws warheads designed around old pits might be considered as block 2 but in addition to the drawbacks noted above the warheads would have short service life if the pits used were near the end of their service lives the most certain approaches to certifying replacement warhead without nuclear testing are at one extreme to replicate the original design as closely as possible or at the other to create new design that is simple enough to permit high confidence in order to maximize yield to weight and achieve other design goals all crs11 components of cold warera warheads are designed to work together with little performance margin to spare with such tight design small changes in materials or manufacturing processes can reduce confidence in performance that is why the complex goes to great lengths to minimize differences from original specifications when designing and producing replacement components despite the absence of nuclear testing the labs have been certifying for continued use in the stockpile current warhead designs that incorporate replacement components that are not exact replications at the same time the labs believe that they will be able to certify rrws without testing by designing in greater performance margins in contrast the labs have said nothing to indicate that they could certify anything between these extremes such as block 2 warheads as result any potential advantages from block 2 replacement warhead might be lost owing to difficulty in certification or in acceptability to dod it might be argued that surer path to confidence in replacement warheads would be to skip block 2 and move to block 3 directly even if the threeblock approach could be done successfully it would apparently result in three distinct designs one lep one rrw and one in between for each warhead type for example w76 block 1 2 and 3 block 2 would be neither the original weapon with which the complex has extensive experience nor the final rrw which would be in the stockpile for years to come but transient interim design sustaining producing and maintaining the three designs would appear to require far more complex resources than would be required for one design per warhead type steve henry deputy assistant to the secretary of defense for nuclear matters in the office of the secretary of defense stated that the nuclear weapons council voted to study the feasibility of reliable replacement warhead and if the study proved successful to endorse transition directly from leps of currentdesign warheads to the rrw program council study group considered other options including block 2 but did not recommend them to the council because those options could not achieve critical rrw program goals such as enhancements to safety and use control in addition the study group was concerned that pursuing block 2 option would be costly and could delay the rrw program beyond the time when nuclear weapon designers with underground test experience would retire raising certification difficulties13 therefore block 2 is only recommendation of the task force not of the nuclear weapons council cost issues to analyze costs of its recommendations the tf set forth three cases baseline case with flat budget in fy2005 dollars for the period 20062030 if the baseline budget is the fy2006 request for the complex the tf finds that the total cost for 20062030 would be some 170 billion the tf rejects this case because it would not lead to the tfs vision for the future complex thereby representing 13 the preceding information in this paragraph was provided in personal communications november and december 2005 crs12 very high risk option for maintaining the nations nuclear deterrent e1 complex transformation in place case involving minor changes to the complex and the stockpile there would be consolidation of snm and cnpc existing production facilities would continue in place rrw begins but most leps continue like the baseline this case would not lead to the tf vision for the future complex because the physical plant especially the production facilities will not be transformed into the 21st century the tf states that this option involves risks especially beyond 2020 when pit lifetime warhead reliability and dismantlement become issues the tf calculates that this case would cost about 5 billion more than the baseline case in 2005 dollars e1 revolutionary complex transformation case involving consolidation of snm maximum acceleration of cnpc and implementation of the other tf recommendations the tf finds this case would cost 10 billion total above the baseline case for the period 20062015 but would save 25 billion for 20162030 saving 15 billion over the 25year period about half the extra 10 billion is to accelerate dismantlement and half to accelerate cnpc the case would manage risk by having rrw proceed on responsive schedule the results are sensitive to assumptions on the extent of leps cnpc operating efficiencies reductions in physical security costs and efficiencies from improved business practices costs could be reduced by delaying the start of cnpc operations closing some facilities and reductions in force at the labs etc but the tf finds that such steps would increase risk e2e3 in its analysis the tf judges that the baseline case involves high risks that minor tweaks to the complex in the transformation in place case increase cost and risk that large upfront investment would yield large savings some years from now and that the calculated costs and savings depend heavily on various assumptions its revolutionary transformation case shows that proceeding with complex modernization and rrw in tandem would reduce both cost and risk the latter case makes 5 billion investment to accelerate dismantlement of warheads the tf concludes that so doing reduces the significant security and storage cost burden on the complex 24 further the tf would have pantex dismantle existing weapons and upon dismantlement of the last of the cold war weapons pantex if not the site of the cnpc could be decommissioned 19 finding that savings from accelerating dismantlement would exceed the 5 billion that the tf allocates to that purpose would be significant these cost and schedule estimates however could prove optimistic for number of reasons because the tf plan would represent major change to complex sites their operation and their facilities under current law doe would have to prepare programmatic environmental impact crs13 statement eis because the plan would affect facilities and missions of several sites doe would have to prepare sitewide eiss for sites with new facilities doe would also have to prepare site specific eiss for individual facilities meeting the various requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa is timeconsuming doe would also be required to comply with environmental laws of states in which facilities would be built14 which could lead to further delays lawsuits have been used to challenge eiss dealing with nuclear matters lawsuit over an eis led to preliminary injunction that halted construction of major experimental facility at lanl the dualaxis radiographic hydrotest facility from january 1995 to april 1996 for example15 any lawsuits would add to the cost of the tf alternative and would cause delays the tf states historically doe projects are either underestimated or have scope creep that drive the projects above their budgeted estimates historical doe completed construction costs are in the range of 13900 to 33000 per square foot of construction this wide range calls into question the accuracy of estimates of cnpc cost and thus of savings the tf projects mpf modern pit facility see pit production issues below to cost in the range of 14400 to 19400 per square foot h2 estimating mpf cost at the bottom of the historical range of doe construction costs seems highly optimistic given that it is probably the facility within cnpc that would have the highest requirements for safety and security and produces one of the most difficulttomanufacture components of nuclear weapon combination of delays and cost growth would increase investment costs and shorten the period through 2030 in which operational savings could accrue tipping the balance between investment costs and operational savings toward the former the tf proposes reducing the footprint of mpf as one option to reduce cost h5 much of the cost of complex facility is for planning proceeding through the nepa process selecting site obtaining the needed permits designing the facility and especially for snm facilities providing the requisite security if nnsa later needed to add capacity at mpf it would be much more costly and timeconsuming to secure any needed permits perhaps repeat the nepa process redesign the facility shut it down if construction so required and finally undertake the construction than it would be to 14 for background on this point see us congress congressional research service

needed initially rather than the minimum according to the report the task force used budget details from the fy 2006 nnsa congressional budget submission appendix d to form the basis of financial comparisons and estimates made within this report xi the fy2006 nnsa budget submission goes through fy2010 it seems an insufficient basis for estimating costs and savings going out quartercentury that document also appears to have limited value for estimating rrw expenses even for the period it covers the projected rrw budget for fy2006 fy2010 in the fy2006 request simply uses the amounts that would have been allocated to the advanced concepts initiative nuclear weapons research and study program that congress terminated in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 because nnsa did not have sufficient time between the signing of that act in early december 2004 which contained initial funds for rrw and the submission of the budget request in early february 2005 to prepare detailed program and budget for rrw forgoing the value of sunk costs the complex has developed over more than 60 years during that time it has accumulated many buildings and much equipment and infrastructure given that history the complex is probably far less efficient than complex of new design and construction would be the complex that the tf recommends would incorporate new facilities eliminate redundant ones and probably close some sites these steps are predicted to reduce operational costs including security the tf anticipates that conducting manufacturing using modern processes in new buildings making easiertomanufacture components for rrws would save large sums on the other hand the united states has invested many billions of dollars in the complex over the years it could be argued that abandoning some of this investment which has been built and is now operating on the basis of an analysis showing reduced operating costs over the long run would be taking budgetary risk by closing some major facilities and perhaps some sites sunk costs would certainly be lost whether reduced operating costs would exceed the costs of closing existing facilities and building new ones is less certain and as the tf notes depends heavily on the assumptions used following are examples of sites and facilities whose sunk costs might be lost under the tf plan lanl has spent more than decade to restore pit production operations at its technical area 55 ta55 facility lanl delivered certifiable pit in 2003 and expects to deliver certified pit for the w88 warhead in 2007 the tf estimates that ta55 is operating at about 5 percent efficiency h1 it states modern manufacturing techniques if applied rigorously could yield unprecedented reductions in ta55 pit manufacturing costs and cycle time h1 while the base rate is unclear if ta55 could produce pits at 20fold higher rate should mpf be built the tf crs15 would upgrade ta55 for production doubt at considerable expense yet it appears that the tf would not use ta55 for pit production once cnpc is operational the snm manufacturing facility at cnpc will be the sole snm production and manufacturing facility for the complex 15 nnsa should contract for the management of pit production at the new cnpc that also covers interim pit production at ta55 nnsa should focus ta55 on pit production until cnpc is fully operational 35 and nnsa should commit to producing 50 production pits per year that go into the stockpile from ta55 beginning in 2012 and continuing until replacement pit production facility can meet the needs of the stockpile 34 bringing in separate contractor to manage pit production at ta55 and cnpc as the tf recommends 35 might disrupt ongoing pit operations once nnsa halted pit production at ta55 more expense would presumably be incurred to convert its production space back to rd the tf envisions decommissioning pantex after it completes dismantlement of cold war weapons unless pantex is the site of cnpc 19 but pantex could still perform weapons assembly and disassembly it also stores thousands of pits from dismantled weapons would any security and operations savings resulting from building pantexlike facility at cnpc outweigh the investment costs of that new facility as well as the cost of decontaminating and decommissioning pantex and moving pits stored at pantex to cnpc one type of experiment that lanl and llnl perform is hydrodynamic testing in which pit using surrogate material instead of plutonium is imploded and measurements are taken using powerful highspeed xrays and other types of diagnostic equipment these experiments are conducted at two large costly facilities the dual axis radiographic hydrodynamic test darht facility at lanl and at the contained firing facility cff at llnls site 300 some 15 miles from the lab16 these sites conduct many smallerscale experiments as well the task force believes that the nts should become the only complex site for combined he and category i and ii snm testing consolidation of both facilities darht and site 300 into one hydrodynamic testing user facility at the nts incorporating containment and radiography could save significant costs17 21 having one facility instead of 16 see indoor testing begins soon at site 300 science and technology review may 2001 and carol wilkinson dual axis radiographic hydrodynamic testing the darht project september 9 2003 29 briefing slides available at httpwwwligocaltechedu ligo_webseminarspdfwilkinsonpdf 17 category i and ii refer to quantities of radioactive materials category i amounts are those continued crs16 two would presumably yield savings in operations and security further it could prove difficult to secure the permitting needed to conduct tests using plutonium at darht or cff should such tests be desired on the other hand the two facilities are integrated into the work of the labs and have ample work conducting tests without plutonium moving large delicate experimental facility to nts could prove difficult and costly the sunk costs of the two facilities would be lost the nepa process and any attendant lawsuits could delay construction the purpose of the two axes in darht each of which would take xray photos of an imploding surrogate pit is to have time sequence of the implosion or threedimensional radiograph this information would be of value for lep or rrw darhts second axis is to be completed in 200818 halting work on darht and moving it to nts threatens to delay pit experiments for years possible alternative many years out would be to build successor facilities to darht and cff at nts even then removing the existing facilities from their labs would make it harder for hydrodynamic experiments to draw on lab resources workforce issues throughout the report the tf recognizes the importance of strong workforce for the complex it finds that the complex is rapidly losing experienced nuclear design experts 1 it was delighted to find generation of young people entering the complex 3 it notes the enduring key to maintaining safe reliable stockpile of nuclear weapons is the quality of people 22 some of its recommendations are made with goal of strengthening expertise it stresses the absolute necessity of resuming design activities now such that those who still have the benefit of real testing experience can mentor the nextgeneration designers in the complex 23 several of its recommendations however might undercut this workforce or seem to rely on workforce that may not exist the tf states that as the complex is transformed it will need to develop talent pool of personnel experienced in modern production technologies and processes the task force believes that these 17 continued for which hazard analysis shows the potential for significant offsite consequences and category ii are those for which hazard analysis shows the potential for significant onsite consequences us department of energy

personnel should come from commercial hightech background not from within the complex 23 the plants have modern equipment and workers trained to operate it as well as old equipment yet the recommendation could be viewed as downplaying the value of the workers skills many of which are unique to the complex suggesting that workers skills may not meet current needs and implying that existing workers will not be trained in the skills needed could be seen as showing lack of confidence in the workforce that could harm morale even rrw will require workforce experienced in handling and machining snm it is also not clear that personnel with commercial high tech background would have the expertise to work on nuclear weapons production or that they would want to do so as the specialized skills required might be difficult to market in the civilian economy narrowing their career options the tf would locate cnpc in sparselypopulated area in order to reduce the effect that terrorist attack on the facility would have on nearby communities it considers llnl lanl y12 and pantex sufficiently close to residential and commercial structures such that any partially successful terrorist attack on these sites may cause collateral damage to the surrounding civilian population and associated assets 19 if lanl y12 and pantex are considered too densely populated for safety cnpc would have to be located in an even more rural area yet it could prove difficult to hire thousands of people in rural area who come from commercial hightech background and could take years to provide the requisite security clearances and training the problem would be eased somewhat by the length of time needed to build cnpc the tf envisions the complex producing and dismantling 125 warheads per year and states second shift would provide surge capacity in pit production or weapon assembly should it be required 5 it does not indicate the source of workers to constitute the projected second shift potential problem in rural areas would the complex train second cadre of people with these skills and then provide them with work sufficient to maintain these skills so they would be available if needed manufacturing typically requires some depth of personnel to back up workers who are ill on vacation in training etc but it is unclear if these added personnel would suffice to operate an entire shift especially for an extended time the director of lanl suggests that establishing cnpc would likely encounter high costs major technical risks and delays all of which would severely disrupt skilled personnel across the complex and crs18 could sharply curtail the ability of the complex to recruit and retain the next generation workforce19 implications for the nuclear weapons laboratories the role of the nuclear weapons laboratories and the resources they require have been perennially contentious issues some have argued for raising or lowering the amount spent on experimental facilities for reducing funds for independent research for limiting nonweapons work and the like some are concerned that having two physics design labs alamos and lawrence livermore results in excessive redundancy cost and competitiveness in this regard the tf shows an ambivalence concerning competition and cooperation at the labs regarding competition the current complex needs to initiate design competition immediately for family of modern replacement weapons 4 and each weapon design incorporated into block change should be the result of formal competition between lanl and llnl each supported by snl sandia national laboratories 34 regarding cooperation within the complex the physics design laboratories lanl and llnl aggressively seek independence rather than cooperative interdependence resulting in redundant programs and facilities increasing costs and reducing productivity and the production sites are under funded vi regarding both the challenges to the complex will require competition for the best design concepts followed by cooperation in implementing the winning design and cooperation in the certification 19 of particular concern the three design laboratories routinely compete with each other and set their own requirements as justification for new facilities and redundant research funding in the fear that one laboratory may become superior the net result is that the complex sites are competing for programmatic funds and priorities rather than relying upon their divergent and complementary strengths and thereby operating as truly interdependent team with shared success and rewards 2 the tf recommends number of changes to the labs that seek to reduce redundancy save money and foster cooperation it would eliminate many research facilities and capabilities from the labs in order to consolidate them it would store all category i and ii quantities of snm at cnpc 4 move rd on category i and ii quantities of snm to cnpc 15 close ta55 as pit production plant 15 move rd on all but small quantities of explosives to cnpc or nts 15 and consider consolidating the type of experiments done by darht and site 300 at nts 21 j3 the tf proposes that there be only one capability ie highend computing machine location in the complex single location would more effectively leverage staff and infrastructure users 19 robert kuckuck director alamos national laboratory letter to richard burrow deputy director and acting executive director secretary of energy advisory board ab 1 us department of energy september 27 2005 p 2 crs19 would be and should be highly distributed this would tend to enhance expertise and substantially reduce operating costs 20 the tf favors making some large facilities at single lab into user facilities that is shareduse facilities that would be run by the host lab but available to users from other labs it proposes that nnsa can reduce operating costs and promote teamwork by designating many of its facilities as user facilities examples of such facilities are the highenergy density devices eg the nif llnls national ignition facility the zmachine at sandia omega laser facility at the university of rochester as well as the facilities involved in such activities as hydrotesting site 300 and the darht facility he high explosives testing snm testing and tritium research 28 further over the last 12 years the sciencebased stockpile stewardship program has made an enormous investment in new capability and test facilities in the three design laboratories the task force believes that these are valuable complex assets and should be operated as assets for the benefit of the complex not the host site 20 the tf calls for elimination of redundant nonweapons relevant research and testing 33 the tf accepts the prospect of smaller labs the weapons laboratories of the future will likely have smaller nuclear weapons program staff than they have today 19 critics of the tf report are likely to raise number of issues concerning these recommendations regarding user facilities some current laboratory facilities have been operated in this manner for many years the labs treat major facilities such as nif sandias z machine and the alamos neutron science center as national assets because it would be too costly to replicate maintain and staff them at two or three labs they are instead made available for use by complex staff and in some cases by academic and industrial researchers the tf would have lab scientists travel to cnpc or nts to do some work this would result in additional effort expenditure of time and costs and would separate work at those sites from other relevant equipment and expertise at the labs it is also uncertain if these sites could provide the needed support the tf states that cnpc would include center for research on snm as user facility for laboratory staff and cnpc staff would provide all requisite equipment and technical support staff to support the design laboratories science and engineering users 15 but the existing facilities at the labs for snm rd have been developed over many years through scientific administrative budgetary and political reviews and are integrated into the work of the labs critics believe it would be difficult to crs20 bring the required support into being at cnpc new site whose prime mission would be production rather than rd as noted the chemistry and metallurgy research replacement building at lanl would conduct research on plutonium and uranium lanls director has expressed concern that limiting this building to categories iii and iv quantities of snm as the tf recommends will 1 eliminate the capability to do the necessary suite of actinide chemistry required to meet pit production mission requirements 2 would not allow secure access to and storage of necessary quantities of snm critical for interim pit manufacturing capacity and therefore 3 undermine the development and deployment of rrw20 lanls director is also concerned about changes affecting key experimental facilities rrw design certification will push the limits of current predictive tools the seab recommends that these critically important tools be consolidated transferred or eliminated putting rrw at risk21 the tf approach raises more general issues as well regarding the labs cooperationcompetition relationship lanl and llnl cooperate in many ways such as peer review of weapon designs joint use of computational and experimental facilities and collaboration on scientific research at the same time they are by design and evolution competitive in their most important strength nuclear weapon design during the cold war they created competing designs in response to military requirements for new weapons in these competitions sandias albuquerque branch teamed with lanl and sandias livermore branch teamed with llnl this competition continues with the design for rrw many analysts believe that design competition is especially important now that nuclear testing is not available to check warhead performance in this view competitions require competitors nuclear weapon design competitions require rival labs in order to explore differing approaches and to challenge competing design teams redundant facilities at the two labs help make competition possible by providing each lab with similar base of resources some supporting the current laboratory system hold that if the tf wants competition there must be redundancy because it would be difficult to have one without the other even more than research facilities the core strength of the labs is arguably their ability to bring many disciplines to bear on weapon problems each lab is community with each member drawing on the skills of many others and each contributing to the research needs of many others because of the complexity of nuclear weapons solving typical weapon problem draws on many skills resident at lab including physics chemistry metallurgy computer operation computer modeling engineering mechanical chemical electrical instrumentation and 20 letter from robert kuckuck to richard burrow september 27 2005 p 2 actinides are chemical elements numbered 89103 including uranium and plutonium 21 ibid crs21 experimentation designing weapon also draws on many skills similarly research facilities support multiple areas of expertise only few laboratory staff may operate an experimental facility computer center research laboratory building and the like but single experiment may draw on many skills and may contribute data valuable to staff in many areas of the weapons program accordingly some are concerned that removing one major scientific resource would be likely to disrupt work in number of areas the tf would shift resources in number of crucial areas of weapons science it would remove highend computation facility from most labs and would move much work on snm and he from the labs to cnpc and nts snm high explosives experimentation and computation are critical to nuclear weapon labs and are often interdependent nuclear explosion requires he and snm experimentation provides data on the behavior of nuclear weapons computer modeling integrates data from experiments scientific theory and past nuclear tests to improve understanding of weapons performance and of the relevant theory the tf would move category i and ii snm to cnpc and nts yet llnl and lanl are currently conducting socalled accelerated aging experiments on plutonium to provide better estimate of pit life which is crucial for determining future pit production requirements these experiments use more than category ii amounts of plutonium so the tf plan would seem to bar that work from the labs both labs dismantle pits which have category i quantity of snm to inspect them for age related changes the tf would apparently move pit production from ta55 to cnpc yet ta55 could arguably be used to experiment with production methods and as pilot plant in addition to serving as backup to mpf some believe that removing major scientific facilities from the labs could impair recruiting laboratory staff have stated for many years that outstanding scientific facilities attract outstanding recruits for example goal of the laser sciencebased stockpile stewardship program at alamos is to exploit excellent highquality science in recruiting22 while the tf envisions the prospect of smaller weapons program staff critics of the tf report maintain that nuclear weapons laboratory requires certain set of skills regardless of stockpile size they point out that staffing assumptions based on the more limited range of skills that the tf seems to believe may be required by the rrw concept implicitly rest on other assumptions that the rrw concept will appear after study able to meet its goals that the administration and congress will choose to replace many current warheads with rrws and that designing and engineering such new warheads will require smaller skill set than is needed to maintain existing designs they question whether such farreaching assumptions should be present basis for planning future lab needs regarding the possible impact of improvements in computing on reducing numbers of laboratory staff the tf states technical staffing levels at the design laboratories can be significantly reduced as the complex leverages the years of investment in new automated test and computational capabilities at the design 22 alamos national laboratory inertial confinement fusion mission statement available at httpwwwlanlgovprogramsicfmissionshtml crs22 laboratories 23 improved computing has greatly increased the capability of lab staff so they are able to do better work and presumably more work per hour this does not necessarily mean that fewer people are needed laboratory staff state that chemist cannot do the work of weapon designer designer who specializes in weapons primary stage cannot design secondary stage and computers cannot mentor new staff they also question whether automated test equipment and enhanced computational capabilities would permit significant reductions in technical staff at the labs having highend computer at each lab offers important benefits it helps each lab recruit and retain talented computer specialists who are attracted by the opportunity to work on such machines having top computation talent at each lab makes computer specialists more easily accessible to specialists in the many if not all disciplines who depend on highend computing it can be argued that providing highend machines for all the labs permits them to try different approaches to computer and software design and aids competition between the labs complex relying on one highend computer center could face the risk that connectivity to the labs would fail or become overloaded because it takes several years to design program and install highend computers and make them operational managers of single highend computer center serving the entire complex might be unwilling or unable to introduce new machines very often in contrast supporters of the current laboratory system maintain that with each lab having its own highend computers which may phase in at different times highcapability computer is likely to be introduced into the complex more often than would be the case with single complexwide computation site clearly supporting one location instead of four would save on procurement operation and maintenance at issue is whether the savings outweigh the benefits of the current approach laboratory staff have stated over the years that sharply curtailing nonweapons work as the tf proposes would harm the labs the labs conduct much non weapons research some is related to security such as nonproliferation conventional defense technology and homeland security for example weapons scientists help interpret intelligence data relevant to nuclear proliferation and study how to disarm potential terrorist nuclear weapons23 the labs perform other work in areas such as energy global climate modeling the human genome traffic flow modeling and basic research such work aids recruiting interviews with laboratory staff suggest that few graduate students start out intending to do nuclear weapons work but as postdoctoral fellows some come to the labs to work on nonweaponsrelevant projects and then move to classified weapons work24 permitting staff to do some work that they and their laboratory deem as having high potential value aids morale skill development and retention as well as leading to useful new technologies critics maintain that removing nonweapons work could harm weapons work because the two often benefit from each others resources and efforts 23 on the latter point see eileen patterson render safe defusing nuclear emergency alamos research quarterly fall 2002 2223 24 personal interviews alamos livermore and sandia staff crs23 implications for the plants the tf many of whose members have over the course of their careers done some work in industry25 was sensitive to perceived problems at the plants it found the production side of the complex operating from world war ii era facilities lacking in modernday production technology and striving to optimize performance with antiquated equipment and facilities 1 congress and nnsa recognize these problems as well and have begun to address them by among other things directing part of the budget to the plants for specific purposes and including facilities and infrastructure recapitalization program for which 1509 million was appropriated for fy2006 cnpc proposes more comprehensive solution with cnpc for nuclear components and more contracting out for nonnuclear ones the industrial model that the tf applies to the plants however may have some deficiencies in dealing with nuclear weapons production for one as an organizing principle cost has been accorded lower ranking in the design and production of nuclear weapons than in other areas of industry the tf states strong leaders and healthy organizations must have commitment to success not perfection successful businesses know when products and services are good enough and recognize that cost is one of the metrics for excellent performance 25 and aggressive cost goals are achievable on new weapon component designs and cost goal adds healthy degree of discipline to the design process 9 many would maintain that when designing and manufacturing nuclear weapons in contrast to many commercial products only something close to perfection is good enough during the cold war cost was much less important than warhead safety and reliability while cost is more salient consideration now nuclear weapon experts hold that safety and reliability are and will remain of greater importance the tf also suggests design tocost model which may not be appropriate to the complex upon dod and nnsa acceptance of lifecycle cost estimates designproducetocost metrics can be established for the complex 14 yet there is designtocost equation for the complex cnpc is to perform specific tasks many of which are at the state of the art and unique to the complex at the lowest price if that price is greater than the targeted design cost what happens the tf recommends outsourcing of nonnuclear components the complex is strongly encouraged to purchase these components and assemblies from commercial industrial vendors to the degree practical given classification and security requirements 14 while this has been done for years to limited extent expanding the scope of outsourcing could encounter many problems qualifying vendors such as by assuring compliance with quality assurance standards obtaining security clearances for workers and installing security apparatus for facilities would be burdensome to companies even if nnsa bore the monetary costs some nonnuclear components would be procured in small lots that would be economically unattractive to vendors some would be of old design or would use nonstandard manufacturing techniques so would not provide skills or equipment of value to the vendor in commercial work removing substantial amount of work on nonnuclear components from the kansas city plant kcp could harm the operations of that 25 us department of energy secretary of energy advisory board advisory board member biographies available at httpwwwseabenergygovsubbios_nwcitfhtml crs24 plant kcp contracts out for some nonnuclear components but is set up to produce the full range of them if kcps workload drops significantly it would have difficulty maintaining diverse set of skills these problems could become significant large shrinkage of the plant could put production of certain nuclear weapon components at risk if key vendor went out of business or chose not to continue its work one tf recommendation on outsourcing might be seen as potential conflict of interest in keeping with its approach to outsourcing nonnuclear components the tf recommends outsourcing production of beryllium and beryllium oxide components immediately if services can be obtained from quality commercial vendors 22 tf member is director of technology at brush wellman iii that company bills itself as the only fully integrated producer of beryllium and beryllium oxide in the world26 the tf would also outsource storage of components to save money on security for security cost savings most of these nonnuclear components would be stored at the commercial vendors location or another complex facility but consistent with justintime commercial practices 16 however total security cost could arguably be higher if components were made at dozens of industrial plants each of which would seemingly have to be secured rather than at kcp which has security in place and elaborate procedures for accounting for these components as they work their way through the transportation system might hamper justintime deliveries the recommendations could affect pantex upon dismantlement of the last of the cold war weapons pantex if not the site of the cnpc could be decommissioned for the sustainable stockpile the ongoing dismantlement of all future rrw based weapons would be conducted at the cnpc 19 cnpc would contain facilities for the main operations now at pantex weapons assembly and disassembly explosive component fabrication and storage of pits 1516 the tf would consolidate most if not all of y12s weapons work at cnpc including foundry for highly enriched uranium heu see appendix uranium production facility assembly of secondaries storage of heu and secondaries and heu rd 1516 the tf would also move beryllium work from y12 and lanl to cnpc or would contract it out j1j3 this consolidation would eliminate many if not all of y12s critical weapon functions calling into question the rationale for retaining y12 potential consequences of closing existing plants and building new cnpc could include political pressure from constituents on nimby not in my back yard and kimby keep it in my back yard grounds cnpc would provide construction and operating jobs for the region chosen but fear of many new nuclear facilities even at an existing site might lead to public protests when nnsa sought public comments on siting mpf as part of the environmental impact process the office of 26 brush wellman website home page httpwwwbrushwellmancom crs25 the governor of nevada strongly opposed siting mpf at nts27 conversely closing existing sites could arouse public opposition sites for the complex were built in the 1940s and 1950s and are major employers pit production issues the pit is the fissile core of nuclear weapons primary stage see appendix the united states has been unable to produce pits certified for use in deployed nuclear weapons since 1989 when the only largescale pit production site in the complex rocky flats plant co closed28 nnsa argues that pits deteriorate over time and must eventually be replaced critics believe that nnsa may be underestimating pit life but do not dispute the need for eventual pit replacement29 accordingly nnsa seeks way to produce pits on scale sufficient to sustain the stockpile at present lanl is building few pits at ta55 which was designed for plutonium rd these pits have not yet been certified for use in the stockpile because development of the procedures needed to have high confidence in certification has not yet been completed nnsa does not view ta55 as having sufficient capacity for the long term instead nnsa has planned for modern pit facility or mpf with capacity of 125 pits per year the tf would locate all of mpfs functions at cnpc 15 as discussed below congressional actions have raised questions about the future of mpf that facility might proceed on the other hand decision not to proceed with it would call into question the future of cnpc because mpf would arguably be cnpcs most important facility the tf analysis of mpf and ta55 is discussed here to cast light on the role of ta55 and considerations involved in establishing pit production program the schedule and capacity required for pit production hinge on several factors pit life the tf states that the pits in the stockpile were made between 1978 and 1990 actually 1989 and that the best current estimate of pit life from the weapons labs is minimum of 45 to 60 years 12 thus the entire stockpile may need to be turnedover by 2035 to 2050 depending on the acceptable level of uncertainty in pit lifetime 12 27 letter from robert loux executive director agency for nuclear projects office of the governor state of nevada to jay rose nnsa august 4 2003 28 the tf uses date of 1990 for when the united states made its last pit for the stockpile but an nnsa report states in december 1989 doe shut down production at the rfp rocky flats plant due to environmental and safety concerns consequently stockpile certified pits have not been manufactured in the united states us since that date us department of energy national nuclear security administration requirements for modern pit facility summary report to congressional defense committees requested by the united states congress in public law 108375 ronald w reagan national defense authorization act january 2005 p 6 29 see for example steve fetter and frank von hippel does the united states need new plutoniumpit facility arms control today may 2004 1014 crs26 stockpile size the tf analyzes the cnpc schedule needed to support stockpile of 2200 active and 1000 inactive warheads 17 it finds that to support that stockpile with pit life of 45 years and production rate of 125 pits per year cnpc must be functional by 2014 with pit life of 60 years that date shifts to 2034 17 either case assumes that ta55 produces 50 pits per year 17 from 2012 until replacement pit facility came on line 34 larger stockpile would require that mpf have more capacity or in theory an earlier operational date ta55 capacity nnsa plans to have ta55 reach capacity of 10 pits per year by the end of fy200730 the tf envisions boosting that capacity to 50 pits per year by fy2012 34 higher capacity at ta55 would permit lower capacity at mpf or delay in reaching given capacity at mpf alternatively it appears that the tf would close production at ta55 when cnpc opens as noted earlier if ta55 were kept open then it and mpf could meet stockpile requirements more easily than mpf alone without mpf ta55 would require very large increase in capacity to maintain stockpile of 3200 warheads ability to reuse pits the tf states that reuse of young plutonium pits less than 45 years old and of canned secondary assemblies should be evaluated 9 reusing young pits would reduce the number of pits that would have to be made before then perhaps permitting delay in mpf until pit life and future weapon requirements became clearer in contrast if ta55 is to be the sole us pit facility its capacity would have to be increased sharply even if young pits are used much more capacity is needed than simply enough to provide pits for direct stockpile use under the moscow treaty the united states and russia will each have 1700 to 2200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads by the end of 2012 other warheads would be needed for tactical missions and for nondeployed reserves the tf assumes stockpile of 3200 warheads nnsa notes that additional pits must be manufactured because some units will be scrapped because of manufacturing defects while others will be needed to meet requirements for replacements for pits destroyed in the course of evaluating the condition of pits in the stockpile over many years b pits reserved for later evaluation c pits to prove manufacturing processes at the start of production of each type of pit and d pits built and destructively tested during steadystate production to assure product quality31 30 nnsa requirements for modern pit facility summary p 6 31 ibid crs27 in the tf plan nnsa would select site for cnpc expeditiously starting in fy2006 23 and the entire cnpc would need to be functional by 2014 under assumptions noted above 17 this plan however has several problematic elements first it is not known whether congress would support mpf or by extension cnpc in the fy2004 conference report on the energy and water development appropriations act pl 108137 conferees reduced the request for mpf by 120 million to 108 million on grounds that until the congress reviews the revised future stockpile plan it is premature to pursue further decisions regarding the modern pit facility32 the conferees statement on pl 108447 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act included the following the conferees agree that funding for modern pit facility cannot be used to select construction site in fiscal year 200533 the house appropriations committee report on fy2006 energy and water appropriations stated the committee continues to oppose the department of energys accelerated efforts to site and begin construction activities on modern pit facility the committee will consider modern pit facility site and design only when the detailed analysis of the pit aging experiments and the concomitant capacity requirements tied to the longterm stockpile size are determined34 the senate appropriations committee report on fy2006 energy and water appropriations stated the committee disagrees with the purported task force proposal to consolidate all of the nuclear material and the entire weapons manufacturing capability including the construction of modern pit facility at single location there are very strong opinions in congress regarding the siting of new pit facility or changing the military capability of the existing weapons as such the committee believes it is unlikely that congress would support such comprehensive reforms as currently proposed by the nnsa complex study panel35 the fy2006 energy and water development appropriations act conference report stated the conference agreement provides funding for the modern pit facility the conferees direct the

the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes continued crs28 other hand representative hobson who as chairman of the house energy and water development appropriations subcommittee has taken the lead on several issues on nuclear weapons and the complex said in an address of december 2005 that he focused on the need to define mpf rather than opposing that facility per well probably build modern pit facility but we need to know what size were going to build first and how many were going to build im not opposed to building new modern pit facility but this numbers thing drove nuts and until we get there were just not going to do it37 consequently the tf recommendation to greatly accelerate the current pit production schedule despite congressional opposition to mpf unresolved concerns over mpf characteristics and sharp constraints on capacity at ta55 would appear problematic second it may be difficult to find site for cnpc for example as noted earlier the office of the governor of nevada opposed siting mpf at nts even if site is found it would take years to complete the nepa process obtain the needed permits design and build the facility and prepare it for operation lawsuits by national nongovernmental organizations or local groups could further delay site selection third the tfs estimates of capacity and schedule for mpf and ta55 are at odds with those of nnsa the tf states classified supplement2 analyzes the issue of timing for the cnpc for stockpile of 2200 active and 1000 reserve and the expected pit manufacturing capacity of the future complex the conclusion is that if the nnsa is required to 1 protect pit lifetime of 45 years 2 support the above stockpile numbers and 3 demonstrate production rates of 125 production pits to the stockpile per year the cnpc must be functional by 2014 if one accepts the uncertainty of pit lifetime of 60 years the cnpc can be delayed to 2034 in either case ta55 is assumed to be producing 50 production pits to the stockpile per year 17 footnote 2 in text classified supplement to the nwcitf report recommendations for the nuclear weapons complex of the future in contrast nnsa states minimum production capacity of about 125 pits per year starting in 2021 is required to support reduced stockpile as reflected in the june 2004 stockpile plan assuming 60year pit lifetime and the current nnsa planning approach for an mpf of 125 pits per year with production starting in 2021 is not sufficient for pit lifetimes of 40 or 50 years or for larger longterm 36 continued hrept 109275 to accompany hr 2419 109th congress 1st session 2005 p 162 37 representative david hobson how congress changed administration policy on the bunker buster bomb case study in effective oversight address delivered at center for american progress washington dc december 14 2005 p 19 transcript available at httpwwwamericanprogressorgatfcfe9245fe49a2b43c7a5215d6ff2e06e03 hobson20speech20on20the20bunker20busterpdf crs29 stockpiles38 nnsa would start construction in 201239 nnsa notes that more pits must be produced than the number headed for the stockpile as discussed earlier some would be spares or withheld to examine later for aging problems or destined to replace pits that detailed evaluation renders unusable others would be rejected because of manufacturing defects the tf envisions an annual mpf production rate of 125 pits to the stockpile40 while nnsa envisions mpf producing 125 total pits per year thus the capacity of the tfs mpf would be substantially larger than that of nnsas mpf nnsas plan for mpf is to start construction in 2012 and full scale production in 2021 the tf calls for an operational mpf with capacity well beyond 125 pits per year 7 years ahead of nnsas schedule at the same time the tf envisions modifying ta55 to produce 50 pits per year by 2012 it is not clear that that is feasible nnsas goal is to have ta55 produce 10 pits per year by the end of fy200741 and is planning to increase that figure to 30 40 per year sometime after 2010 according to report of an interview with ambassador brooks42 modifying ta55 to produce 50 pits per year starting in 2012 would require larger investment and the schedule might prove difficult to meet as discussed under forgoing the value of sunk costs the tf would shut production at ta55 when mpf opens at cnpc which could in the tf plan be as early as 2014 if mpf proceeds the logic of spending large sums to turn ta55 into production facility and then closing it for production after only 2 years is open to question on several grounds most of the potential value of the investment would be lost after converting ta55 so that its main mission was production it might be desirable at added cost to reconvert it back to research facility once production halted because plutonium facilities are extremely costly and ta55 is the largest such facility in the complex if mpf were to open ta55s production capacity would appear to be of potential value in many ways as an engineering facility to test new production techniques as pilot plant to test and improve the producibility of new pits as surge producer in case the international situation called for added capacity as source of extra production to fix unanticipated warhead problems without disrupting mpfs production schedule as boutique producer of small lots of pits for new or modified nuclear weapons and as backup production facility in case mpf must shut down so as to avoid total halt to weapons production as occurred when rocky flats pit production ended 38 nnsa requirements for modern pit facility summary p 9 39 nnsa requirements for modern pit facility summary p 9 40 the task force later reemphasized this point when he transmitted the final tf report task force chairman david overskei stated we the tf wish to clarify that pit production means pits produced and certified for the stockpile letter from dr david overskei chairman seab nuclear weapons complex infrastructure task force to m peter pcpherson chairman secretary of energy advisory board department of energy october 4 2005 p 1 41 nnsa requirements for modern pit facility summary p 6 42 john fleck nuclear agency looks to expand lanl pitmaking albuquerque journal october 22 2005 1 crs30 finally the tf raises the prospect that newer pits could be reused if this is the case then fewer new pits would be needed as result the capacity required by pit facility could be reduced or the pit production schedule extended security in the tf plan cnpc would be the only site in the complex for category i and ii snm 14 15 this material would be moved from pantex and y12 assuming cnpc is not located at either site and from lanl and llnl part of the rationale is to reduce security costs cnpc would probably achieve that objective whether it would reduce the overall threat to the complex vii is less clear it would reduce the number of sites and communities that could be targets of terrorist attacks 24 but reducing the number of potential terrorist targets would seem to increase security only if there is concern about the possibility of an attack on multiple complex sites at the same time if terrorists could attack only one site having more sites with fewer assets at each would make each site lowervalue target which could reduce the risk of attack on any one site conversely locating many facilities at single site would seem to make that site more attractive terrorist target it is far from certain that any complex site would rise to the top of terrorist target list given that these sites are well defended and large in area related tf goal is that consolidation would result in reduction of risk to adjacent civilian populations currently the llnl lanl y12 and pantex sites are sufficiently close to residential and commercial structures such that any partially successful terrorist attack on these sites may cause collateral damage to the surrounding civilian population and associated public and private assets 19 of these four sites only llnl is located in denselypopulated area yet the tfs consideration of relocating plutonium rd to llnl 35 would require increasing the inventory of plutonium at that laboratory for the threat of snm release to occur as result of terrorist attack on complex site several steps would be required terrorists would have to attack the site which would be difficult given site security they would have to gain access to snm which additional security features would render very difficult they would then have to seize and detonate bomb although there are few complete weapons in the complex other than at pantex and complete weapons are well protected alternatively they might try to seize and disperse snm as dirty bomb but snm is poor choice for dirty bomb because it is very much less radioactive or accessible than such radioactive materials as cobalt60 or cesium 137 reducing risk to adjacent population thus seems questionable rationale for cnpc nonproliferation critics hold that the tf report might adversely affect us nuclear nonproliferation efforts the lead sentence of the report states that the goal of the nuclear weapons program has shifted to sustaining existing warheads for the indefinite future v even though states party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty including the united states agreed in article vi to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament the tf recommends continuous design and production on family of modular nuclear weapons 23 this might likewise be interpreted as inconsistent with the npt the tf says it is confident that the complex can now design nuclear weapon that is certifiable without the need for underground testing vi this has been true since 1945 designers were so confident in the hiroshima bomb that it was dropped without test of its design at crs31 the same time some who hope to reduce the number of us nuclear weapons fear that the stockpile stewardship program is intended to enable the united states to design weapons without testing43 the tf statement might be taken as support of this point the tf recommends considering placing key snm facilities underground 17 even though the united states has expressed concern about irans and north koreas practice of hiding their nuclear facilities underground and has conducted research on nuclear earth penetrator weapon to destroy buried facilities assessment of nuclear weapon issues critics might call into question several tf statements on nuclear weapons the nuclear weapons program and the complex the report states as weapon designs move away from the ugt underground nuclear test experience base toward highmargin conservative designs the issue of final stockpile certification becomes increasingly important 10 nuclear weapon experts maintain that final stockpile certification may become more or less difficult but never more or less important asserting that it has always been of the utmost importance the ta55 facility is not being run as production unit but rather as research and compliance driven facility productivity is about 5 of what would be required and achievable of an industrial operation in the same facility with the same task h1 high production rate however was not the goal of ta55s pit production program after rocky flats closed doe could have converted part of ta55 to more efficient production by taking out existing equipment and installing new production lines but that could have taken years and been expensive instead doe chose to utilize existing equipment and space at loss of efficiency but with less expense and quicker time to begin limited production ta55 is pilot plant installed in an rd building to prove out the processes to make certifiable pit until the processes can be shown to work and pits can be certified and decision on mpf can be taken and decision reached on where to conduct plutonium rd and the type of pits to be produced current or rrw designs is decided critics argue there is little point in incurring the expense of redoing ta55 for 20fold increase in production in trying to arrive at industrial benchmarks for production of plutonium components at mpf the tf stated since there is little commercial experience with plutonium the study group tf subgroup looked at beryllium manufacturing beryllium components are used in current primary designs and have very similar machining requirements and tolerances to the plutonium parts number of the casting techniques are different but not sufficiently different that the physical nature of the building is altered rather the hazardous nature of be and pu make handling specifications and restrictions similar thus lot of the building requirements are similar and 43 see for example christopher paine and matthew mckinzie end run simulating nuclear explosions under the comprehensive test ban treaty natural resources defense council washington 1997 chapter v conclusions and preliminary observations available at httpwwwnrdcorgnuclearendruner5asp crs32 other than the forging and casting equipment the machining and metrology equipment is virtually identical h1 however beryllium and plutonium are very different beryllium is light and stable while plutonium is heavy and radioactive weapon scientists note other differences concerns over criticality the possibility that too much plutonium in small volume could lead to small nuclear chain reaction and security drive every aspect of planning plutonium facility radioactivity dictates spacing between plutonium processing stations to limit worker exposure to radiation plutonium hemispheres must be joined together to form pit lanl metallurgist stated that welding processes used to join beryllium components are very different than those used to join plutonium components equipment for forging and casting differs for the two metals as the tf notes h1 applications for commercial beryllium parts are not at all like those for plutonium components plutonium has different metallurgical characteristics at different temperatures and pressures for example like ice plutonium increases in volume when it solidifies since plutonium is radioactive leaks during handling can be detected constantly in real time unlike beryllium so that processes for handling the two metals are very different industrial methods for handling beryllium are not necessarily an ideal model the toledo blade reported health and safety problems resulting from beryllium exposure at plant in elmore ohio and elsewhere44 the tf states the current lack of teamwork and trust is manifested in unnecessary redundancy of missions and facilities at various sites and an inability to harness the talent of the complex to solve critical problems 28 concern with these stated problems underlies many tf recommendations supporters of the current complex however would raise questions about the tfs statement they would maintain that lanl and llnl have for decades competed on nuclear weapon design as noted earlier this institutionalized competition should not be characterized as failure of teamwork despite this competition there are many examples of teamwork between the labs lanl and llnl conduct peer review as part of the annual assessment process in support of weapon certification this peer review will arguably be critical as the laboratories proceed with work on rrw lanl teams with snlnew mexico and llnl with snlcalifornia in developing warheads staff from the labs use each others experimental facilities and cooperate in many aspects of weapons and nonweapons science the labs partner much more with the plants than they did during the cold war lab and plant staff frequently said that during the cold 44 deadly alliance toledo blade march 28 1999 this article is the introduction to long series and contains links to the

regard for ease of manufacture and throw the designs over the fence to the plants leaving the latter to make the components despite difficulties now labs and plants exhibit much more concern about ease of manufacture for example the two design teams routinely consult with the plants on this topic ease of manufacture is goal of rrw and plant representatives participate in the rrw project officers group the focal point of rrw activity redundancy has value in certain instances for example rocky flats plant was the only site in the complex that made pits for the stockpile when production at rocky flats plant halted in 1989 the complex could longer produce nuclear weapons as result today the united states is the only nuclear weapons power without productionlevel capability to manufacture plutonium pits for the nuclear arsenal45 supporters of the current complex maintain that there are many examples to counter the tf statement that the complex is unable to solve problems the ability of the complex to create scores of warhead designs and to produce many thousands of units during the cold war the ability of the complex to increase its understanding of nuclear weapon behavior through the ssp and the ability of the complex to maintain the nuclear stockpile after the cold war so that doe and dod could certify its safety and reliability annually for nine years so far another example is the ability of the complex to recapture the pit manufacturing process despite long hiatus between 1989 when rocky flats manufactured the last certified pit 2003 when lanl delivered the first certifiable pit and 2007 when lanl is scheduled to deliver its first certified pit46 the task force found complex of varied strengths and weaknesses with little evidence of master plan vi task force critics acknowledge that there is single overarching multidecade master plan but maintain that that lack is inevitable from their perspective the administrations nuclear posture review of december 2001 sought responsive infrastructure and in fact the complex has responded to and been shaped by many political and technical developments over the past six decades world war ii the start of the cold war the prospect of developing the hydrogen bomb sputnik the massive buildup and subsequent reductions of nuclear forces the end of the cold war the development of modern information technology and the global war on terrorism to name few they note that the administration and congress have responded over the years by funding new programs and facilities at complex sites to obtain capabilities needed at the time 45 nnsa requirements for modern pit facility summary p 6 46 certifiable pits meet manufacturing and inspection quality assurance requirements but not performance requirements when in addition nnsa completes analyses and nonnuclear experiments needed for pits to meet performance requirements certifiable pits can be certified for use in the stockpile crs34 just as the foregoing developments did not exhibit master plan so too were many responses necessarily ad hoc at the same time major facilities typically take years to build so there has necessarily been some longterm planning as well according to the tf dismantlement is central element in nuclear threat reduction and deterrence as the complex embarks on continuous production strategy and replaces the cold war stockpile the nation needs to dismantle the retired cold war weapons to demonstrate to its citizens the congress and the world that the deployment of an improved sustainable stockpile is not the beginning of stockpile growth 19 yet there is link between deterrence and dismantlement in the long history of us nuclear weapons policies and programs us arms control and weapon employment policies have focused on us deployed forces perceived us will and intent to use them and the potential to increase their numbers or capabilities not on the ability to dismantle them similarly the nuclear posture review of late 2001 links infrastructure such as the complex to deterrence but this linkage results from the ability of the infrastructure to maintain existing warheads or make new ones not from its ability to dismantle them warheads are removed from deployed forces as byproduct of treaties and other agreements that reduce deployed forces as result of determination that certain types of warheads or their delivery systems are longer needed or during the cold war because they were replaced by newer models some of these warheads are kept in an inactive status available for use others are retired stockpile size has dropped because fewer and fewer warheads are deemed necessary for deterrence or other military requirements the end of the cold war for example led to sharp reduction in the number of potential targets and therefore in the number of weapons needed by one analysis the size of the us nuclear stockpile has been falling steadily since 1966 and even more sharply since 198947 this trend may continue president bush said i am committed to achieving credible deterrent with the lowest possible number of nuclear weapons consistent with our national security needs including our obligations to our allies my goal is to move quickly to reduce nuclear forces48 such reductions in deployed forces might lead to further stockpile reductions though not necessarily in any precise numerical relationship while many retired warheads are dismantled dismantlement is not required by treaty but is more housekeeping matter to reduce the cost and effort for maintenance storage and security current methods used at pantex to dismantle the cold war stockpile provide physical basis for demonstrating to the world that the overall number of nuclear weapons is being reduced thereby reducing the nuclear threat 24 because there is transparency such as international monitors observing dismantlement if there were continuous production as the tf suggests dismantlement would demonstrate net reduction to us citizens the congress and the world only if observers could monitor both dismantlement and new production and found that the former exceeded the latter in contrast the united 47 natural resources defense council table of us nuclear warheads last revised november 25 2002 available at httpwwwnrdcorgnuclearnudbdatab9asp 48 president george w bush remarks by the president to students and faculty at national defense university fort lesley j mcnair washington dc may 1 2001 crs35 states has for decades demonstrated threat reduction through verifiable dismantlement of delivery vehicles and associated equipment eg bombers intercontinental ballistic missile silos and missile submarines moreover there is link between dismantlement and force reduction different stockpile sizes can support the same deployed force and it is that force that figures in us deterrent policy further most current dismantlement is happening to warhead types totally removed from deployment over the last two decades not to warhead types still deployed task force assumptions the tf makes number of assumptions on lep and rrw that may prove correct but further details are required to make the case convincingly accordingly some would view it as premature to adopt recommendations based on them the task force assumes that the current method for repairing problems with existing warheads the lep will be increasingly costly over the long term v it notes that many warheads contain toxic materials that the complex must maintain materials and equipment longer in current use and that the lep strategy requires that the complex retain or reacquire capabilities and processes that are necessary to refurbish weapons designed and built many years ago 1112 while it would be costly to maintain the stockpile using lep the tf does not show why it would be increasingly costly an alternate possibility is that while the first lep of warhead type might be costly and difficult second and subsequent leps of that warhead might be easier and cheaper in that scenario several thing would occur between the first and second leps ssp would learn more about weapons science in the intervening decades the surveillance program would provide further information on the specific warhead details of conducting the lep on that warhead type would be recorded software instructions to production machines would be stored and key equipment and materials would be stockpiled related point involves the longevity of the stockpile under lep the tf argues that lep will sustain the viability of the cold war stockpile for while but it will not achieve future sustainable stockpile 12 some are concerned that an accumulation of small changes with several leps could lead to insufficient confidence to certify warheads in the absence of nuclear testing in this view the very lack of adequate evidence on the future effectiveness of lep combined with the absence of complex with adequate capacity poses risk that an unexpected failure of warhead type could undermine the deterrent force on the other hand if ssp including surveillance and lep have been able to sustain the stockpile for about decade lep supporters ask why should it not be able to do so for longer indeed nnsas goal for lep is to extend warhead life by 20 to 30 years49 to that end it has conducted an lep of an intercontinental ballistic missile warhead w87 and is conducting leps of gravity bomb b61 submarinelaunched ballistic missile 49 department of energy department of energy fy 2006 congressional budget request volume 1 p 75 crs36 warhead w76 and cruise missile warhead w8050 that is an lep for each major type of nuclear delivery system the task force recommends that the united states should proceed immediately with rrw the recommendation rests on assumptions that the labs can come up with workable design for rrw that the weapon can be produced at acceptable cost and on an acceptable schedule and that the design can be certified without nuclear testing further the tf assumes that the cost of refurbishing existing weapons through lep will exceed the cost of designing and certifying rrw setting up new production lines to manufacture it and producing thousands of newlybuilt units the tf also assumes that the status quo is not financially sustainable ix clearly the status quo is costly it is one thing though to estimate that particular course of action would cost certain amount to call it unaffordable appears to be subjective judgment 50 ibid p 7576 crs37 appendix nuclear weapons and the nuclear weapons complex this appendix describes key terms concepts sites and facilities as an aid to readers not familiar with them current strategic longrange and most tactical nuclear weapons are of two stage design51 the first stage the primary is an atomic bomb similar in concept to the bomb dropped on nagasaki it provides the energy needed to trigger the second stage or secondary the primary has hollow core often called pit made of fissile weapons grade plutonium with high content of isotope number 239 it is surrounded by layer of chemical explosive designed to generate symmetrical inwardmoving implosion shock front when the explosive is detonated the implosion compresses the plutonium greatly increasing its density and causing it to become supercritical so that it creates runaway nuclear chain reaction neutrons drive this reaction by causing plutonium atoms to fission releasing more neutrons to increase the fraction of plutonium that fissions boosting the yield of the primary neutron generator injects neutrons directly into the fissioning plutonium in addition boost gas mixture of deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen gases is injected into the pit the intense heat and pressure of the implosion cause the gas to undergo fusion generating great many neutrons the chain reaction can last only moment before the force of the nuclear explosion drives the plutonium outward so that it can longer support chain reaction metal radiation case channels the energy of the primary to the secondary stage which contains lithium deuteride and other materials the energy from the primary implodes the secondary causing fission and fusion reactions that release most of the energy of nuclear explosion the primary radiation case and secondary comprise the nuclear explosive package thousands of other nonnuclear components however are needed to create weapon these include case for the bomb or warhead an arming firing and fuzing system and means of linking the weapon to its delivery system the hiroshima bomb used simpler gun assembly design in which one subcritical mass of highly enriched uranium ie highly enriched in the fissile isotope 235 was shot down gun barrel into another subcritical mass of highly enriched uranium forming critical mass and causing nuclear explosion highly enriched uranium and weaponsgrade plutonium are referred to as

weapons federal agency the national nuclear security administration nnsa semiautonomous part of the department of energy manages the nuclear weapons program and the complex pit production is the most controversial aspect of nuclear weapons production and the one most closely linked to the reliable replacement warhead program rocky flats plant co used to produce pits but that work was halted in 1989 due to safety concerns since then the united states has not made any pits that have been certified for use in stockpiled warheads once rocky flats pits were used up the united states has been unable to make entire new warheads alamos has established smallscale pit production plant at its plutonium facility technical area 55 ta55 ta55 has produced several pits but alamos has not completed the work needed to certify them for use in the stockpile nnsa anticipates that that work will be completed in fy2007 and that ta55 will achieve capacity of 10 pits per year beginning in fy2007 nnsa has plans to increase ta55s capacity to 3040 pits per year sometime after 2010 nnsa however believes that that number is inadequate to support the stockpile and proposes new modern pit facility mpf to provide more capacity 125 pit per year mpf with full production starting in 2021 ontime is the minimum capacity to support the presidents reduced 2012 stockpile assuming 60 year pit lifetime52 in nnsas view because of the long lead time needed to design and build pit facility planning for mpf should continue as hedge against unexpected problems with pits in the stockpile others challenge that plan arguing that if pit lifetime proves longer than anticipated or if the future stockpile declines more than anticipated an expanded ta55 would suffice so that the united states should delay decision on mpf until future pit requirements become clearer the fy2006 energy and water development appropriations act pl 109103 deleted funds for mpf conferees on the measure directed nnsa to focus on improving the manufacturing capability at ta55 on the other hand representative david hobson chairman of the house energy and water development appropriations subcommittee and key player on nuclear weapons issues stated in december 2005 that he does not oppose mpf but wants to have it defined more clearly before proceeding the future of mpf thus appears uncertain 52 nnsa requirements for modern
