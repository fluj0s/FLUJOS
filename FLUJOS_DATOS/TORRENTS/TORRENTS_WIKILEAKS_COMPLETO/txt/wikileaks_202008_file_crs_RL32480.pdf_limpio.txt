determine classes of aliens who may be admitted into the united states and the grounds for which they may be removed pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina as amended certain conduct may either disqualify an alien from entering the united states inadmissibility or provide grounds for his or her removaldeportation prominently included among this conduct is criminal activity criminal activity comprises acts violative of federal state or in many cases foreign criminal law it does not cover violations of the ina that are not crimesmost notably being in the us without legal permission thus the term illegal alienan alien without legal statusis not synonymous with criminal alien most crimes affecting immigration status are not specifically mentioned by the ina but instead fall under broad category of crimes such as crimes involving moral turpitude or aggravated felonies in addition certain criminal conduct precludes finding of good moral character under the ina which is requirement for naturalization and certain types of immigration relief in certain circumstances grounds for inadmissibility or deportation may be waived in some cases aliens facing removal may be allowed to remain in the united statesfor example when they are granted discretionary or mandatory relief from removal for humanitarian reasons such as through asylum withholding of removal or cancellation of removal aliens facing removal may also be permitted to depart the united states voluntarily and thereby avoid the potential stigma and legal consequences of forced removal criminal conduct may affect an aliens eligibility for either voluntary departure or discretionary relief from removal additionally criminal conduct is key disqualifying factor under the character requirement for naturalization several legislative proposals were made during the 110 th congress that contained provisions modifying the immigration consequences of criminal activity enacted legislation modifying the immigration consequences of criminal activity included pl 110257 providing certain relief from inadmissibility to members of the african national congress pl 110340 making persons who have engaged in the recruitment of child soldiers in violation of federal law inadmissible deportable and ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal and pl 110457 modifying the grounds for

broad plenary authority to determine classes of aliens who may be admitted into the united states and the grounds for which they may be removed1 pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina2 as amended certain conduct may either disqualify an alien from entering the united states or provide grounds for his or her removal prominently included among this conduct is criminal activity in general aliens may legally enter the united states under one of three categories 1 legal permanent residents lprs who are also commonly referred to as immigrants 2 nonimmigrants who are aliens permitted to enter the united states temporarily for specific purpose such as for tourism academic study or temporary work and 3 refugees who are aliens facing persecution abroad and are of special humanitarian concern to the united states there are two aspects for legal admission under each of these categories first an alien must fulfill the substantive requirements for admission under specified category for example in order to enter the united states as nonimmigrant student an alien must demonstrate that he is bona fide student at an approved school 3 second aliens who fulfill substantive requirements for admission may nevertheless be denied admission if they fall within class of inadmissable aliens listed under ina 212 4 once admitted aliens remain subject to removal if they fall within class of deportable aliens listed under ina 2375 the ina contains bars for admission and grounds for deportation based on criminal conduct6 this report discusses the potential immigration consequences of criminal activity criminal activity generally refers to conduct for which an alien has been found or plead guilty before court of law though in limited circumstances consequences may attach to the commission of crime or admission of acts constituting the essential elements of crime consequences may flow from violations of either federal state or in many circumstances foreign criminal law some federal crimes are set out in the ina itselfalien smuggling for example however not all violations of immigration law are crimes notabl being in the us without legal permission ie being an illegal alienis not crime in and of itself7 thus for example an alien who overstays student visa may be an illegal alien in that the alien may be subject to removal from the us but such an alien is not criminal alien 1 for further background on us immigration policy see crs report rs20916 immigration and naturalization fundamentals by ruth ellen wasem 2 8 usc 1101 et seq 3 ina 101a15f 8

implement and enforce the provisions of the ina was vested with the attorney general8 the attorney general delegated most authority over immigration matters to two bodies within the department of justice doj the immigration and naturalization service ins which was delegated authority over immigration enforcement and service functions and the executive office of immigration review eoir which was delegated adjudicatory functions over immigration matters following the establishment of the department of homeland security dhs the ins was abolished and its functions were transferred to dhs pursuant to ina 103a1 as amended the dhs secretary is now charged with the administration and enforcement of the ina and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens except insofar as this chapter or such laws relate to the powers functions and duties conferred upon the other executive officers and agencies including the attorney general 9 pursuant to ina 103 as amended eoir retains adjudicative authority over immigration matters and rulings by the attorney general with respect to questions of immigration law remain controlling upon immigration authorities10 however the precise scope of the attorney generals continued authority over other immigration matters remains unclear because most provisions of the ina have not been specifically amended to reflect the transfer of certain immigration functions to dhs 11 as result many of the regulations implemented by dhs and eoir are presently duplicative or otherwise overlapping12 the homeland security act of 2002 which established dhs and transferred to it many immigration functions previously conducted by the ins provided general guideline that immigration officials to whom immigration functions were transferred may for purposes of performing the function exercise all authorities under any other provisions of law that were available with respect to the performance of that function to the official responsible for the performance of the function immediately before transfer 13 as practical matter the dhs has primary daytoday authority over immigration matters while the attorney general and eoir maintain adjudicatory authority over immigration matters and questions of immigration law 8 primary authority over immigration matters was transferred from the department of labor to the department of justice in 1940 reorg plan 5 of 1940 5 fed reg 2223 1940 9 8 usc 1103a1 10 id at 1103a1 g 11 for further background on the transfer of immigration authority to the dhs see crs report rl31997 authority to enforce the immigration and nationality act ina in th wake of the homeland security act legal issues by stephen r vina 12 according to the doj which issued these regulations just pr ior to the transfer of certain immigration authority to the dhs the duplication of regulations was intended to ensure continuity even though the attorney general and secretary may later amend their respective regulations to further separate the procedures and clarify those sections that affect each agency but the duplication assures that interp retation will be consistent until coordinated decisions are

inadmissible or deportable most crimes included under these grounds are not specifically mentioned but instead fall under broad category of crimes such as crimes involving moral turpitude or aggravated felonies in addition certain criminal conduct precludes finding of good moral character under the ina thereby preventing an alien from becoming either naturalized us citizen or candidate for certain types of relief the class of crimes involving moral turpitude the class of aggravated felonies and the class of crimes that preclude finding of good moral character are overlapping but two classes are coextensive the types of crimes constituting crimes of moral turpitude are determined by case law crimes that are aggravated felonies are listed in statute with case law illuminating the bounds of certain listed crimes crimes precluding finding of good moral character are determined by combination of case law and statutory law these criminal classes are further modified for the purposes of specific ina provisions 14 the following sections will describe these criminal categories in more detail

grounds for exclusion since 189115 whether crime involves moral turpitude has been determined by judicial and administrative case law rather than statutory definition in general if crime manifests an element of baseness or depravity under current moresif it evidences an evil or predatory intentit involves moral turpitude thus certain crimes such as murder rape blackmail and fraud have been considered crimes involving moral turpitude whereas crimes such as simple assault have not been considered to involve moral turpitude16

removal of aliens convicted of such crimes priority through streamlined procedures and ineligibility for various types of relief aggravated felonies were 14 for example crimes involving moral turpitude that may make an alien inadmissible include all such crimes other than 1 single such crime committed by minor if the crime was committed and any confinement ended at least five years before applying for admission or 2 single misdemeanor for which the term of imprisonment imposed if any did not exceed six months ina 212a2a 8 usc 1182a2a on the other hand crimes involving moral turpitude that may make an alien deportable include 1 one conviction of such crime committed within five years of entry ten years in the case of small subcategory of aliens if the crime is punishable by at least one years imprisonment and 2 the conviction of more than one such crime whenever committed and whatever the potential punishment if the crimes were not committed in single scheme of criminal conduct ina 237a2a 8 usc 1227a2a 15 prior to 1891 conviction of felonious crime served as the basis of exclusion subsequently conviction for felony or other infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude could constitute grounds for alien exclusion act of march 3 1891 26 stat 1084 ch 551 16 for more thorough listing of crimes found to involve moral turpitude see maryellen fullerton

the possession of good moral character appears always to have been statutory requirement for naturalization 20 and good moral character now also bears on the eligibility for various forms of immigration relief21 prior to 1952 the effect of criminal conduct upon assessments of good moral character was determined solely by case law and administrative practice following the enactment of the ina certain criminal activities were statutorily designated as barring finding of good moral character the activities listed by the ina as prohibiting finding of good moral character are not exclusive and engaging in illegal activity that is not specifically designated by the ina may therefore still be considered when assessing character 22 19 ina 101a43 8 usc 1101a43 20 possession of good moral character was requirement for naturalization under the original us naturalization law act of march 26 1790 1 stat 103104 21 for more detailed discussion of good moral character see 7 charles gordon
