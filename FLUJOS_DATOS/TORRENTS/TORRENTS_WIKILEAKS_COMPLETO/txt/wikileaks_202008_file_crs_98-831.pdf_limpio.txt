punishable under othe r federal statutes some like 18 usc 1001 equally broad and others like 18 usc 1516 more narrowly drawn this report focuses on selected aspects of the genera l obstructi on of justice provisions found in 18 usc 1503 1505 and 1512 it i s essentially replica without footnotes or ci tations of crs report 98832 obstruction of justice under federal law review of some of the elements section 1503 prohibits obstruction of pending federal judicial proceedings section 1505 outlaws obstruction of pending adm inistrative and congressional proceedings and section 1512 bans witness tampering with the intent to obstruct federal judicial administrative or congressional proceedings obstruction of federal courts 18 usc 1503 section 1503 condemns obstructing pending judicial proceedings under any of four kinds of interference three explicitly address interfering with federal jurors or cour t officials the fourth interference with the due administration of justice the courts often observe that to convict under this omnibus clause the government must prove beyond reasonable doubt 1 that there was pending judicial proceeding 2 that the defendant knew this proceeding was pending and 3 that the defendant then corruptly endeavored to influence obstruct or impede the due administration of justice there is little dispute over the demands of the first two elements the suprem court has maintained for over century that person is not sufficiently charged wit h obstructing or impeding the due administration of justice in court unless it appears that he knew or had notice that justice was being administered in such courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98831crs2 marking the outer boundaries of corruptly endeavoring to influence obstruct r impede has proven more challenging several circuits have held that to act corruptly within the meaning f the omnibus clause requires that the defendant have acted with the intent to influence obstruct or impede the proceeding in question the combination of this somewh at relaxed standard coupled with the fact that an offender need onl endeavor to obstruct gives the clause potential sweep that the courts have sought to confine by requiring d emonstration of clear nexus between the obstructing conduct and the target proceedings the nexus requirement is alternatively and more regularly cast as requirement that the miscondu ct have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration f justice there is requirement however that the defendants endeavors succeed or even that they were capable of succeeding as long as the accused was unaware of the futility of his efforts to obstruct the courts are at odds over whether the due dministration of justice in section 1503 may be obstructed by corrupting witness before federal judicial proceeding th second circuit believ that when congress enacted the more specific witness tampering and witness retaliation provisions of 18 usc 1512 and 1513 it intended to remove those crimes from the omnibus clauses inventory of proscriptions the other circuits to th extent they have addressed the issue disagree the specific kinds of misconduct which under the appropriate circumstances ma provide the basis for prosecution under the omnibus clause include creation of false documents to be presented in evidence destruction of documentary evidence submission of forged letter during probation revocation hearing instructing subordinate to conceal evidence civil trial jurors solicitation of bribe pressuring bar owners to backdate video machine leases to conceal gamblin g income encouraging grand jury witnesses to falsify records and commit perjury promising to bribe trial judge even absent an intent to offer the bribe grand jurors disclosing matters occurring before the grand jury backdating contract to be submitted to the grand jury instructing others to alter records in anticipation of grand jury subpoena inform ants providing defense attorney with false statement that might be use d to impeach the informants contrary testimony at trial obstruction of congressional and administrative proceedings 18 usc 1505 section 1505 outlaws interfering with justice department civil investigativ demands issued in ant itrust cases but deals primarily with obstructing congressional and federal administrative proceedings prosecu tions under section 1505 are relatively few and most of these arise s obstruction of administ rative proceedings the crime of obstruction of such proceedings has three essential elements first there must be proceeding pending before ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98831crs3 departmen t or agency of the united states second the defendant must be aware of the pending proceeding third the defendant must have intentionally endeavored corruptly to influence obstruct or impede the pending proceeding perhaps due to the br eadth of judicial construction the question of what constitutes pending proceeding has arisen most often taken as whole the cases suggest that proceeding describes virtually any manner in which an administrative agency proceeds to do its busi ness the district of columbia circuit for example has held that n investigation by the inspector general of the agency for international development may constitute proceeding for purposes of section 1505 in doing so it rejected the notion that section 1505 applies only to adjudicatory or rulemaking activities and does t apply to wholly investigatory activity furthermore proximity to an agency s adjudicatory or rulemaki ng activities such as auditors working under the direction of an officer with adjudicatory authority has been used to support claim that an obstructe d agency activity constitutes proceeding the courts seem to see comparable breadth in the congressional equivalent obstructing the due and proper exercise of the power f inquiry by congress and its committees in the case of either administrative or congressional proceedings section 150 5 condemns only that misconduct which is intended to obstruct the administrativ proceedings or the due and proper exercise of the po wer of inquiry in order to overcome judiciallyidentified uncertainty as to the intent required congress added definition f corruptly in 1 996 as used in section 1505 the term corruptly means acting with an improper purpose personally or by influencing another including making false r misleading statement or withholding concealing altering or destroying document or other information 18 usc 1515b examples of the type of conduct that has been found obstructive include enlisting others to lie to aid inspector generals office investigators using threats to avoid an interview with irs officials making false statements to defense department auditor lying to customs service officials and inspectors endeavoring to use family relationship to obstruct congressional committe investigation submitting false documentation in response to an irs subpoena instructing subordinate to destroy records sought under doe subpoena blatant evasiveness and feigned forgetfulness of witness during testimon before an sec investigative hearing witness tampering 18 usc 1512 section 1512 forbids murdering 18 usc 15 12a harassing 18 usc 1512c or otherwise tampering 18 usc 1512b with federal witnesses in order to preven t them from reporting misconduct to federal authorities appearing as witnesses in federal proceeding s or producing evidence at federal proceedings although the murder an d harassment subsections are not insignificant the heart of the section is the omnibu s subsection subsection 1512b it outlaws 1 knowingly 2 using one of the prohibited forms of persuasion 3 with the intent to prevent witnesss testimony or physica lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98831crs4 evidence from being presented at off icial federal proceedings or with the intent to prevent witness from reporting evidence of crime to federal authorities obstruction under section 1503 can only be committed during the pendency f federal proceedings congress expressly disclaimed any intention to impose simila r requirement for obstruction prosecutions under section 1512 consequently conviction under section 1512 does not require the government to show that the defendant was aware of any pending or contempla ted federal proceedings or investigations congress likewise eliminated any requirement that the government prove that the defendant knew of th federal character of the proceedings or investigations he intended to obstruct in case charging that the defendant acted with the intent to obstruct the reporting of federa l crime to federal authorities the government need not show that the accused knew th crime was federal or knew that the authorities were federal authorities but th governm ent must still prove the existence of the federal nexus in fact as practica l matter evidence that establishes the requisite intent will ordinarily prove guilt knowledge as well corrupt persuasion seems to be both the most commonly charged and the mos t perplexing of the means used in violation of section 1512 to obstruct federal proceedings and criminal investigations there is consensus among the circuits as to its exac t demands the second and eleventh circui ts have held the element requires more than that the government prove that the defendants attempts to persuade were motivated by an improper purpose the third circuit appears to have adopted an improper purpose plus standard having suggested that under the facts of given case an accused who with the improper intent to obstruct attempted to persuade witness to testify falsely would be guilty of violation of c orruptly persuading the district of columbia circuit seems to be similarly inclined for when it addressed poindexter based vaguenes s challenge it found the element satisfied by evidence that the defendant had attempted to persuade witness to violate her legal duty to testify truthfully in court when the defendants misconduct takes the form of deceiving potential witnes s with the intent the witness later repeat the deception either at federal proceedings or t federal authorities the government need prove neither that the potential witness was i n fact deceived nor that there was any particular likelihood that the potential witness would in fact ever be called upon to testify or report conviction under th omnibus provisions of 1512b can only follow upon evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant intended by his prohibite d misconduct to obstruct proceeding or the reporting of crime that was in fact federal the federal proceedings protected by obstruction under section 1512 are defined broadly by statute to cover executive judicial and legislative branch proceedings just as th statute does not insist upon pending proceedings so it is complete upon the commission of the prohibited misconduct committed with qualifying intent the defendants guilty motive need not be exclusive the demands of subsectio n 1512b are satisfied as long as the misconduct of the accused was motivated at least in part by qualifying intent to obstructhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98831crs5 subsection 1512d creates an affirmative defense available to any defendant wh can establish by preponderance of the evidence that his conduct was not otherwis criminal and was committed for the sole purpose of producing truthful evidence in addition violation of section 1512 occurs when an individual whether n attorney or not advises potential witness to assert an available fifth amendmen t privilege against selfincrimination
