possible options for the united states to exploit the link provided by the chosen soren between the reclusive north korean regime and the outside world this report was prepared using exclusively open sources members of congress may benefit from classified briefings from the intelligence community on the extent of chosen sorens ties with the north korean government background membership the chosen soren general association of korean residents in japan is political and social organization made up of ethnic koreans who have chosen to affiliate themselves with north korea chosen soren represents minority of the 640000 ethnic koreans in japan membership estimates range from 50000 to crs2 1800001 established in 1955 the group is made up primarily of descendants of koreans who moved to japan as laborers in the 1930s when the korean peninsula was annexed by japan chosen soren reportedly administers and finances 140 schools and university that emphasize korean language and culture publishes newspaper serves as confederation for 12 affiliated associations holds close ties with financial institutions catering exclusively to ethnic koreans and acts as an unofficial representative of the north korean government up to 30 of the pachinko industry popular form of pinball gambling with over 18000 parlors nationwide is controlled by ethnic koreans many of whom have close ties to chosen soren2 the chosen soren has counterpart in the proseoul korean organization mindan korean residents union in japan both organizations work to promote ethnic koreans civil rights in japan members of both are classified as special permanent residents but hold official citizenship in north or south korea the groups differ in approach mindan supports the enfranchisement in japan of special permanent residents the designation of most ethnic koreans while chosen soren advocates strong national identity with north korea chosen soren facilitated the repatriation of over 100000 korean residents living in japan to the north and sparred with mindan in the 1960s including outbreaks of violence3 membership in mindan now outpaces chosen soren about 4 to 1 and the trend over the past few years indicates that ethnic koreans are increasingly either becoming naturalized japanese citizens or associating with mindan4 historic relations with japanese government chosen soren justifies its longstanding existence largely on the discrimination faced by ethnic koreans in japan although some korean families have been in japan for several generations as special permanent residents they do not have the right to vote cannot work for the central government and were required to be fingerprinted as resident aliens until the early 1990s5 together with the history of japans often brutal 35year colonization of the korean peninsula 19101945 relations between the korean minority and the japanese government have always been strained japanese political leaders have avoided confrontation with chosen soren both out of fear of provoking reaction from pyongyang and out of sensitivity to accusations of racial discrimination6 government agencies also largely ignored 1 murder shines light on the

north korea permitted ferry links with little enforcement of safety measures and cargo inspections7 and allowed chosen soren to maintain its taxfree diplomatic status for years8 traditionally chosen soren had close ties with the political left in japan particularly the socialist party but until very recently chosen soren leadership also enjoyed warm relations with several members of the liberal democratic party accusations have arisen regarding chosen sorens ties with organized crime in counterfeiting and the drug trade some critics suggest that japanese politicians may intentionally allow cash remittances and contacts between chosen soren and north korea to continue because of the politicians own involvement with gangster trade detractors allege that the interdiction of links with pyongyang could expose ldp affiliation with the yakuza organized crime syndicate9 chosen sorens relationship with pyongyang political ties the secretive nature of north korea makes the extent of political interaction between chosen soren and kim jong ils regime difficult to assess north korea reportedly sends 36 million year to chosen soren to help administer the korean schools in japan10 chosen soren sends representatives to serve in north koreas legislature the supreme peoples assembly as well as delegations to major public celebrations but the extent of leverage and access to policymaking in pyongyang is not clear chosen soren also reportedly runs 2000member underground network of study groups called gakushugumi which are affiliated with the north korea workers party and train members to spy on south korea and the japanese military11 in september 2002 shortly before diplomatic summit with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi kim jong il publicly issued directive to visiting chosen soren leader ho jongman ordering the gakushugumi to disband in advance of the meeting12 although this indicates direct communication between kim jong il and 6 continued pursue

korean leader directs disbanding of propyongyang study groups in japan continued crs4 the chosen soren organization reports on whether the directive was obeyed are not conclusive cash remittances the issue of hard currency flowing into north korea from japan has been the subject of extensive debate both on the question of where the money goes to individuals or to the regime and the amount before japans economic bubble collapsed in the early 1990s us officials estimated that up to 1 billion year could have been transferred to north korea from japan but by all accounts that figure has decreased with the economic downturn in japan and the death of president kim il sung most observers now agree with nicolas eberstadts estimation that even at their peak remittances generally were below 100 million annually13 remittances are passed either in person when korean residents travel to north korea or by transfers through financial institutions according to japanese finance minister masajuro shiokawa at least 33 million was reported to the government as transferred to the north in fiscal year 200214 technology transfers some japanese firms associated with chosen soren have been implicated

exported without authorization by japans ministry of economy trade and industry was ordered by the korea daesong general trading corporation company administered by the intelligence unit of the korean workers party15 us reports have singled out daesong as part of an extensive organization known as division 39 of the korean workers party that provides hard currency to kim jong ils regime some reports value the cash assets of the unit at up to 5 billion secreted in banks in macau and switzerland16 reportedly japanbased firms often go through third countries in their dealings with north

soren has also been involved with at least one other nonethnic korean company that sold military technology to north korea the japanese engineering firm seishin enterprises was found to have shipped jet mill machine that can be used to grind solid fuel into fine powder for use in missiles to north korea in 1994 on board the mangyongbong ferry and attempted again in may 2003 to export electronic scales that could be used in the production of biological and chemical weapons senior member of science and technology organization affiliated with chosen soren reportedly coordinated price

other precision devices in the recovered vessel raising questions about japanese firms supplying equipment to the dprk military19 narcotics and counterfeiting north korean involvement in international drugtrafficking has recently come under increasing scrutiny in his annual report to congress on drugproducing nations president bush asserted that evidence revealed that state agents and enterprises in the north were involved in narcotics trade state department officials have testified that japan is major recipient of methamphetamines from north korea market that according to state department testimony may have provided up to 7 billion in cash profit for the regime20 the mangyongbong passenger ferry that links japan and north korea is suspected of hauling illicit shipments of such drugs north korean escapee told the yomiuri newspaper that he had smuggled narcotics for the regime on the ferry handing over the goods to members of chosen soren who would then pass the drugs on to japanese gangsters for sale21 reported indications of ties between north korea and the japanese mafia are on the rise but documentation of links specifically with chosen soren is scant 17 japan probe

missile over japan in august 1998 by north korea and the admission by kim jong il in september 2002 that north korea had abducted several japanese nationals has significantly altered the japanese governments stance towards chosen soren in the past year domestic outrage over the abductions and intense media coverage of the return of five abductees has spurred the government to crack down more severely and monitor more closely chosen sorens interaction with north korea japanese politicians responding to public opinion have become more outspoken in their criticism of pyongyang and have curtailed existing ties with chosen soren the japanese government has taken number of legal steps either in enforcing previously lax laws or proposing new legislation to stem possible illicit transfers to north korea new controls on sea links with north korea japanese officials have recently imposed and enforced more strict regulations for the northkorean operated mangyongbong ferry which can carry 200 passengers and 1000 tons of cargo it has operated for years as the sole link for ethnic koreans living in japan with their families in the north usually making one or two round trips month following the abduction admission by kim jong il authorities have taken harsher line insisting on thorough safety checks inspections of the cargo and strict adherence to regulations on passenger limits in january 2003 the mangyongbong suspended its operation for seven months ostensibly to bolster safety requirements before resuming service in august since then japanese officials have delayed departures by citing violations of the ships safety law and the domestic animal infectious diseases control law japanese officials have also ordered improvements on 40 of the 50 vessels from north korea inspected this year officials estimate that 1300 north korean ships dock at japanese ports annually the transport ministry has requested budget increase for 2004 to improve inspection of foreign vessels22 taxation policy chosen soren reportedly has not paid local taxes since 1972 when the then governor of tokyo declared the organization to be north koreas facto representative in japan entitling it to diplomatic taxexempt status in july 2003 conservative tokyo governor shintaro ishihara rescinded the status demanded 515000 in annual taxes and in early september seized three chosen soren facilities when organization officials refused to pay several other local governments with chosen soren chapters are either considering or have already demanded similar tax payments23 22 bar

several credit associations that cater to propyongyang residents also has directed attention to the questionable financial operations of chosen soren and heightened public anger in the past several years most of japans chogin an abbreviation for korean bank in japanese credit unions have collapsed reportedly largely due to illegal remittances to north korea24 once numbering 38 only seven such credit associations remain25 the banks are accused of allowing pyongyang sympathizers to use fictitious or borrowed names to create bogus accounts which were then used to channel cash to north korea as well as offering preferential loans to people who donated large amounts to the north korean cause26 the banks also lent money in excess of the collateral which was often land and buildings either owned by or affiliated with chosen soren27 although the banks are officially independent the management of many of the credit unions was appointed by chosen soren executives according to media reports28 the banks began failing as their nonperforming loans increased necessitating the infusion of public funds to protect ordinary depositors japans financial services agency authorized the transfer of the operations of several failed credit unions to four new lenders with the stipulation that the unions sever ties with chosen soren29 more than 33 billion in public funds was pumped into the replacement credit unions in 2002 alone prompting an outcry from the public as the abduction issue heightened tension with north korea group of legislators forced government banking regulators to insist on the appointment of japanese national as the credit union president after revelations that the former president had earlier served as chosen soren executive30 japans major newspapers have published strident editorials calling on financial authorities to closely scrutinize the new unions links with chosen soren officials to ensure independence from the organization31 24 credit unions

japan following the abduction admission and north korean missile tests japans actions over the past several months suggest an increased willingness to confront chosen soren which would be in line with previous us proposals for japan to choke off funds to north korea japanese measures to promote this goal might include continued close surveillance of the restructured banks serving chosen soren members reinvigoration of efforts to regulate the flow of pachinko profits and more robust enforcement of export controls on vessels bound to or originating from north korea some observers have suggested that the united states press japan to cut off all official trade about 400 million in 2001 with north korea much of which is facilitated by chosen soren32 japan has already relaxed its sanctions criteria by citing the foreign exchange and foreign trade control law which permits the government to impose sanctions in order to preserve peace instead of requiring united nations security council resolution33 overall reform and increased transparency of japans financial institutions could also prove helpful in following the money trail to pyongyang congress and the administration may pursue multilateral efforts as well the bush administration recently has promoted cooperative measures with allies to pressure north korea such as the 11country proliferation security initiative psi charged with interdicting vessels suspected of carrying illicit cargo such efforts to crack down on international drug and weapons trafficking may reveal more illicit ties between chosen soren members and north korea which could trigger additional punitive actions options involving third parties include asking thailand to eliminate technology transfers to north korea that are reported to have transited through its territory or asking austria and macau to curtail bank transfers that often pass through their financial institutions34 32 trade figures from japan statistical yearbook 2003
