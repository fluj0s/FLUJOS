abuse reduction act of 2005 was reported by the house judiciary committee on june 14 2005 hrept 109123 and passed by the house on october 27 2005 hr 420 would strengthen rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure and would narrow the choice of venues for personal injury actions other than class actions brought in state and federal courts the bills rule 11 provisions would apply to all civil actions not just tort actions rule 11 provides for sanctions against parties who f ile frivolous claims or defens or who file paper for any improper purpose1 rule 11 rule 11 of the federal rules of civil pro cedure currently provide s that federal courts may impose sanctions upon attorneys law fi rms or parties who among other things file frivolous claims or defens or file pleading written motion or other paper for any improper purpose such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation2 the sanctions that court may impose include an order to pay penalty into court or if w arranted for effective deterrence an order directing payment to the opposing party of so or all of the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred as direct result of the violati on such sanctions shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetiti on of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated rule 11d provides that rule 11 does not apply to disclo sures and discovery requests responses objections and motions that are subject to the provisions of rules 26 through 37 hr 420 as introduced would ve repealed rule 11d but the reported and passed versions of the bill would nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21931crs2 3 it does not appear that this change would aut horize court to order sanction in an amount that is more than sufficient to accomplish these purposes this is because sanctions would be limited to reasonable expenses including reasonable atto rneys fee court could apparently order sanction of less than the full amount of reasonabl expenses if it determines that such lower amount would be sufficient to acco mplish the prescribed purposes 4 though state courts are sometimes required to follow federal procedures when implementing federal laws it is much less common for state courts to be required to follow federal procedures when implementing state laws anthony j bellia jr federal regulation of state court procedures 110 yale lj 947 95964 2001 although some commentators have suggested that the latter practice violates precepts of federalism see id at 97083 the supreme court has not extended tenth amendment doctrine to prohibit this practice see new york v united states 505 us144 17879 1992 printz v united states 521 us 898 907 1997 5 traditionally the invocation of the language ffects interstate commerce as limiting factor for application of statute is intended to make the reach of statute consistent with congresss powers under the commerce clause see us const art i 8 cl 3 the language in hr 420 however appears to be narrower than cong resss power to regulate commerce in some instances and in excess of it in others for in stance the statute does not allow for aggregation of the effect on commerce of all activities regulated under the provisions s ee gonzales v raich 125 s ct 2195 2005 wickard v filburn 317 us 111 1942 but instead requires that each lawsuit have such an effect yet the provision would also appear to apply to all civil actions even if the underlying cause of action did not arise from commercial activity and thus might not be within congresss commerce clause authority see united states v lopez 514 us 549 564 1995 anthony j bellia jr supra note 4 at 96475section 2 of hr 420 would amend rule 11 so that court shall rather than may impose sanctions when appropriate in addition section 2 would eliminate the right of party to avoid sanctions by withdrawing its improper filing within 21 days after the opposing party has filed motion for sanc tions section 2 would also eliminate the courts option of ordering the vi olator to pay penalty into court and would leave as the only authorized sanction payment to the oppos ing party or parties of their reasonable expenses including reasonable attorneys fee sanctions would longer be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition rather sanctions shall be sufficient to deter repetition and to compensate the parties that were injured3 to some extent hr 420 would return rule 11 to the form it had before 1993 when it provided that the court shall impos sanctions when appropriate when it did not provide for party to withdraw its improper filing and when it did not explicitly authorize court to order violat or to pay penalty into court section 3 of hr 420 would ma ke rule 11 applicable to ci vil actions in state courts provided that the court determines that the civil action substantially affects interstate commerce4 the word substantially was added in committee such court shall make such determination based on an assessment of the costs to the interstate economy including the loss of jobs were the relief requested granted the bill does not specify the extent of the costs to the interstate ec onomy that the civil action would have to have for rule 11 to apply5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21931crs3 6 28 usc 1391a b 7 28 usc 1391c 8 section 4c of the bill would define pers onal injury claim to exclude class actions 9 unlike section 3 section 4 does not contain language limiting its application to cases affecting interstate commerce raising the issue of whet her the scope of the statute exceeds congresss authority under the commerce clause see note 5 supra in addition section 4 would raise the federalism issue mentioned in note 4 supra 10 the reported version of the bill added 4 and limited the applicability of 3 to corporations the housepassed version added that if there is state court in the county then venue would be in the nearest county where court of general jurisdiction is located 11 28 usc 1391a c 12 the establishment of personal jurisdiction relates to whether defendant has availed itself of the privileges of doing business in states asahi metal industry co v superior court of california 480 us 102 109 1987venue federal law currently provides that in fe deral court civil action may be brought only in 1 the judicial district where any defe ndant resides if all fendants reside in the same state or 2 judicial district in wh ich substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred or substantia l part of property that is the subject of the action is situated if there is district in which the action may otherwise be brought then if the action is founded sole ly on diversity of citizenship ie is based solely on state law it may be brought in judi cial district in which any fendant is subject to personal jurisdiction or if the action is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship it may be brought in judicial district in which any defendant may be found6 corporation is deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced7 section 4 of hr 420 would prescribe new ru of venue for pers onal injury claims other than class actions8 and these rules would apply in both state and federal courts9 venue refers to the place within state in which lawsuit may be filed hr 420 would permit personal injury claim to be filed only in the state and within that state in the county or federal district in which 1 the plaintiff re sides at the time of filing or resided at the time of injury 2 the alleged injury or circumstances giving rise to the personal injury claim allegedly occurred 3 the defendants principal place of business is located if the defendant is corporation or 4 the defe ndant resides if the defendant is an individual10 it would appear in certain circumstan ces that the proposed act would preclude litigation in united states courts that would be authorized under curre nt law for instance as noted federal tort law currently allows its against corporate tortfeasors anywhere in the united states that such corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction11 such as where corporation engages in business12 thus if corporation s stores factories offices or property anywhere in the united states th is would mean that federal suit might behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21931crs4 13 the presence of activities which would indicate that defendant was doing business in state might include the presence of stores offices agents employees or property in state or advertising or soliciting business therein asahi metal industry co v superior court of california 480 us at 10506 1987 14 there must be sufficient minimum contacts between defendant and state or federal district that asserts jurisdiction over the defenda nt in lawsuit in order for such case to be sustained id at 109 15 the fact that plaintiff resides in par ticular jurisdiction would not generally provide sufficient minimum contacts for bringing suit in that jurisdiction nor would the fact that an injury or circumstances giving rise to that injury occurred in that forum generally provide sufficient minimum contracts 16 even if the defendants principal place of bus iness were in the united states the state it was in might be inconvenient to the plaintiff for example if plaintiff resided in maryland and was injured in maryland but defendant had cont act with maryland then the plaintiff could not sue in maryland if the defendants principal place of business was in california but the defendant also had an office in virginia then under existing federal law the maryland plaintiff could sue in either virginia or california under hr 420 the plaintiff could sue only in the presumably less convenient california 17 suppose that person bringing claim chooses venue based on 1 or 3 and person who apparently may be either the plaintiff or th defendant alleges that the injury or the circumstances giving rise to the personal inju ry claim occurred in more than one county or federal district would the trial court neverthe less determine the most appropriate forum for the claim or would its authority in this respect be limited to situations in which person bringing continuedbrought against it in one of the judicial dist ricts where such activity occurs or property resides13 under hr 420 however such suits are limite d to where plaintiff resides where the injury occurred or to corporate defendants principal place of business since due process requires that defe ndant have sufficient minimum contacts with forum to establish jurisdiction before it can be brought in that court14 the first two categories may in some instances be precluded by the constitution15 take for example corporation that does business in some but not all federal judi cial districts and that has its principal place of business outside the united states plaintiff who resides in and was injured in district in which the co rporation does not have business presence can under current federal law simply sue in anot her judicial district where the corporation does do business under hr 420 however the lack of minimum contacts would preclude suit under the first two categories whe re plaintiff reside s or where the injury occurred and would preclude suit under the th ird category defendants principal place of business since that place is not within judicial district in such case enactment of hr 420 apparently could result in plain tiffs being left without judicial forum in the united states for his or her tort claim16 section 4b addresses situations where injuries occur in more than one forum implicitly referring to 2 in the above list section 4b provides if person alleges that the injury or the circumstances giving rise to the personal injury claim occurred in more than one county or federal district th trial court sh all determine which state and county or federal district is the mo st appropriate forum for the claim17 the sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21931crs5 17 continued claim chooses venue based on 2 hr 420 does not answer this question 18 this provision might present problem for plaintiff who filed his claim on the final day of the statute of limitations if his claim was dism issed then even though the statute of limitations would have stopped running on the date the clai m was filed it would nevertheless have to be refiled on the very day that it was dismissed if the plaintiff had filed his claim before the final day but nevertheless near the end of the stat ute of limitations then he would have the same problem to lesser degreecontinues if the court determines that nother forum would be the most appropriate forum for claim the court shall dismiss the claim any otherwise applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the claim is dismissed under this subsection18 section 5 of hr 420 provides that sec tions 2 and 3 of the bill shall not be construed to bar or impede the assertion or devel opment of new claims or remedies under federal state or local civil rights law this provision does not appear to mean that sections 2 and 3 would not apply in civil rights cases committee and flooradded provisions in addition to making various changes ntioned above the repor ted version of hr 420 added sections 6 7 and 8 to the bill nd the housepassed vers ion revised section 7 and added section 9 section 6 provides that if federal di strict court determines that an attorney during his career has violated rule 11 in that federal district court three or more times the federal district court shall suspend that attorney from the practice of law in that federal district court for one year and may suspend him or her for any additional period that it consid ers appropriate section 7 of the housepassed bill provides in full whenever party presents to federal court pleading writte n motion or other paper that includes claim or defense that the party has already litigated and lost on the merits in any forum on final decisions not subject to appeal on 3 c onsecutive occasions and the cl aim or defense involves the same plaintiff and the same defendant there shall be re buttable presumption that the presentation of such paper is in violation of rule 11 of the fe deral rules of civil procedure section 8 provides that any person who attempts to impede court proceeding through the intentional destruction of relevant documents would be punished with mandatory civil sanctions held in contempt of court and if lawyer referred to the appropriate state bar associations for disciplinary proceedings section 9 provides that in any rule 11 proceeding court may not order that court record not be disclosed unless the court makes finding of fact that identifies the interest that justifies the order and determines that that interest outweighs any interest in the public health and safety that the court termines would be served by disclosing the court record section 9 woul d apply to any record formally filed with the court but would not apply to any records subject to the attorneyclient privilege or any other privilege that grants the right to prevent disclosure and would not apply to any recordhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21931crs6 19 cq today sept 8 2004 p 7 20 hrept 109123 109th cong 1st sess 2005 at 5 21 id 22 id 23 see note 16 supra 24 cq today sept 9 2004 p 10 25 this critic also contends that the bill unwis ely eliminates judicial discretion and transforms permissive sanctions into mandatory ones christopher m fairman frivolous new bill ignores lessons learned from rule 11 legal times june 13 2005 p 76subject to law that protects the confidentiality of crime victims including victims of sexual abuse pros and cons hr 420 is tort reform legislation but it is also more than that because its rule 11 provisions would apply to all civil lawsuits probusiness groups reportedly argue that proposed revisions to rule 11 are needed to curb what they describe as flood of frivolous lawsuits19 the committee report accompanying th bill states that due to an onslaught of frivolous suits legal fear has become defining feature of our culture affecting not only businesses but churches schools spor ts and playgrounds and other cultural and social institutions20 some experts however claim that ther is little evidence that the 1993 changes to rule 11 which hr 420 is designed to undo increased the number of meritless claims21 some defend the1993 amendment that allows party to withdraw an improper filing within 21 days on the ground that before that amendment parties traded accusations of meritless claims giving rise to additional litigation22 applying rules of federal civ il procedure such as rule 11 and rules of venue to state court is unusual supporters of the bill might argue that if these rules as hr 420 would amend them would be desirable in federal courts then they would also be desirable in state courts opponents of the bill might ar gue that applying federal rules of civil procedure in state courts c onstitutes undue interference with matters that should be left to the states in addition the bills venue provisions apparently could leave some plaintiffs without recourse to it in court in the united states23 finally we note that congress has delega ted to the supreme court the power to prescribe the federal rules of civil proce dure 28 usc 2072 and does not generally amend them itself reportedly such revi sions are first considered during lengthy review process by committees of judges and attorneys that the supreme court appoints24 one critic of the bill has calle d it another attempt to under mine the rulemaking authority of the judiciary25 in response supporter of the b ill might note that the supreme court would not have the authority to make the fe deral rules of civil procedure or federal venue rules applicable to state courts
