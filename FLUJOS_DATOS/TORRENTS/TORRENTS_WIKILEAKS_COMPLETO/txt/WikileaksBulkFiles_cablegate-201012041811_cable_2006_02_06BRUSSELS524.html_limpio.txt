adviser john bellinger met with comprehensive array of eu interlocutors in brussels on february 78 to discuss us views on the legal framework for the war on terrorism he stressed that us decisions on how to deal with an unprecedented global terrorist threat had been made after serious consideration of all legal and political options and that european officials must publicly underline useu solidarity in the fight against terror on guantanamo detainees and qaeda bellinger argued that the us was and is acting in the context of new form of international armed conflict and that therefore while the geneva conventions do not fit this new situation well the rules of war provide more appropriate framework than domestic criminal law he discussed european concerns about the treatment of detainees bellinger also argued that rendition is vital tool against terror finally he urged the eu not to support cuban resolution at the human rights commission on guantanamo the eu response to the visit was for the most part extremely positive with the legal adviser of the austrian eu presidency underlining that the fight against terror is our shared struggle europeans however remain concerned about protection issues end summary comprehensive set of meetings 2 sbu on february 78 secretary of state legal adviser john bellinger met with wide range of eu and memberstate officials including robert cooper directorgeneral for common foreign and security policy at the eu council secretariat jeanclaude piris the directorgeneral of the sipdis legal services of the eu council secretariat michel petite directorgeneral of the legal services of the european commission jim cloos eu council secretariat director for transatlantic relations human rights and and gijs vries eu coordinator for the fight against terrorism the visit was capped by twoandahalfhour discussion with the eu legal services working group cojur comprising the mfa legal advisers of the 25 eu member states plus commission and council legal services and romanian and bulgarian observers basic context unprecedented global conflict 3 sbu bellinger stressed that the situation in which the us and its allies find themselves is unprecedented faced with thousands of qaeda and associated terrorists around the globe whose goal is to inflict mass casualties on innocent civilians by any means possible the legal frameworks that are readily available the geneva conventions or domestic criminal law do not fit this unprecedented situation well in this context the usg has thought long and hard about how best to prosecute the conflict thrust upon it in way that is politically and legally legitimate and the answer to the question of what the rules should be that govern the war on terror is not an easy one international armed conflict with qaeda 4 sbu it is clear bellinger said that the military response against the taliban and qaeda in afghanistan following the september 11 attacks an action covered by unsc resolution 1373 is properly categorized as an international armed conflict the us believes that the continuing struggle against qaeda remains legal state of international armed conflict qaeda has attacked and continues to attack our ships embassies people and territory its leaders have explicitly declared war on us therefore the proper legal framework cannot be that of domestic criminal law qaeda is not the same as domestic european terrorist groups like the ira or raf because it is global and operates outside the us and across borders it is in effect new manifestation on the battlefield that of armies of terrorists conceptually this is military conflict not police action to round up criminals most detainees have been picked up by our armed forces on foreign battlefields practically these cases would be virtually impossible for domestic courts to handle since there are rarely witnesses statements or forensic or documentary evidence that would meet domestic standards accordingly the most appropriate framework would be the rules of international armed conflict 5 sbu it is important to note bellinger emphasized the distinction between the presidents political statement that we are part of war on terror and the legal status of the international armed conflict with qaeda when the president speaks of the war on terror after 911 he is taking the position that we must all declare our opposition to terrorism of any kind the us also believes however that it has been and continues to be in legal state of armed conflict specifically with qaeda detainees covered by geneva conventions 6 sbu bellinger stressed that the current rules of international armed conflict do not fit this unprecedented situation very well after 911 the us carefully considered whether and to what extent the geneva conventions would apply article 2 of the third geneva convention declares that these conventions apply only between high contracting parties while afghanistan was high contracting party qaeda is certainly not in addition article 4 dictates that pow must be soldier in national army wear uniform with marked insignia carry arms openly and follow the laws and customs of war because the taliban did not meet any of these conditions they are not covered as pows under the geneva conventions furthermore qaeda members could not be considered protected persons under the fourth geneva convention the fourth convention defines protected persons as civilians caught up in conflict qaeda was not caught up in but rather initiated the conflict bellinger noted that privileges are given to pows under the geneva conventions for following the laws of war which are intended to protect civilians from harm qaeda and the taliban completely disregard the rules of war and intentionally target civilians 7 sbu if not covered as pows or protected persons what then is the status of qaeda and taliban combatants bellinger asserted that there is clear gap between these terms and that the gap is intentional article 5 of the fourth geneva convention he notes specifies that spies and saboteurs are not granted rights and privileges under the geneva conventions this designation spies and saboteurs is the designation in the geneva conventions that most closely describes qaeda terrorists thus though they are combatants they are best defined as unlawful combatants who do not have right to any protections under the geneva conventions bellinger also explained that the term unlawful combatant8 is not new term but rather has been used for many years in treatises and military manuals to describe those who engage in combat but in an unlawful manner 8 sbu bellinger added that the us response to qaeda attacks does not make members of qaeda legitimate combatants under the geneva conventions qaeda does not follow the laws of war and the fact that the us is fighting back in way renders unlawful combatants legitimate under the very laws they do not respect standards for treatment of detainees 9 sbu if the protections of the geneva conventions do not apply bellinger said there is the question of what rules the us is applying to detainees accordingly to clarify us policy towards detainees president bush issued public directive on february 7 2002 titled humane treatment of qaeda and taliban detainees this directive orders that all detainees under the control of the armed forces be treated humanely and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity consistent with the geneva conventions in addition the us remains bound by and committed to the united nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment this includes article 4 which prohibits torture and article 3 which prohibits transfers of persons to countries where there is substantial likelihood that they will be tortured article 3 is applied on casebycase basis countrys poor record on human rights will raise red flag but not necessarily entail prohibition against transferring detainee to that country instead in each individual case the us seeks assurances that the person involved will not be tortured and transfer is only allowed if those assurances are deemed credible regarding article 16 of the convention against torture which prohibits cruel inhuman and degrading treatment the us senate expressed reservations during ratification in 1995 because there was definition of cruel inhuman and degrading treatment in the convention the senates reservation dictated that the us would tie this provision to the prohibitions of cruel and unusual treatment in the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendments to the us constitution because these constitutional amendments apply only to us citizens in territories under us jurisdiction the department of justice interpreted the senate reservation to mean that article 16 applies only inside the united states nonetheless as secretary rice said in december as matter of policy the us will treat detainees in manner consistent with these standards 10 sbu bellinger described recent us legislation further codifying the standards applied towards detainees the detainee treatment act of 2005 he explained allows the armed forces to use interrogation techniques listed in the us army field manual in addition the mccain amendment codifies the prohibition of cruel unusual and inhuman treatment as interpreted by the senate in its reservation concerning article 16 of the convention against torture of any detainee regardless of nationality or of where he is being held also the grahamlevin amendment allows detainees to appeal the results of military commissions or combatant status review tribunals see 12 to federal courts while limiting detainees ability to file frivolous habeas corpus suits in us courts bellinger also explained the presidents signing statement issued with his signature of the mccain amendment bellinger said the statement is in keeping with customary presidential practice and does not indicate any intention to ignore the law rather the statement explains how the president intends to interpret the law consistent with the powers conferred upon him by the constitution bellinger pointed further to the public statement released by the white house at the same time which demonstrates the presidents commitment to upholding the mccain amendment regular review of detainee cases 11 sbu bellinger then raised some of the more troubling questions for example according to the rules of international armed conflict nation may hold detainees until the end of the conflict when they longer pose threat how long however will the war against qaeda last can detainees be held indefinitely what if some are innocent the us recognizes that these are troubling questions but does not believe such questions could justify decision not to detain people who represent danger to american citizens to deal with this problem at guantanamo the us has created an annual administrative review board process to determine for each individual detainee whether that detainee should still be considered as in state of war with the us this process has resulted in the release of 180 detainees and the transfer to other countries of 76 leaving approximately 500 detainees left in guantanamo of those released at least dozen people are known to have gone back to fighting against the united states 12 sbu the question has also been raised as to the possible innocence of guantanamo detainees as the geneva conventions dictate if there is any doubt about whether or not an individual is pow there must be an article 5 tribunal since taliban and qaeda fighters clearly did not meet the conditions necessary to be granted pow status the president decided that article 5 tribunals were not necessary in 2004 however combatant status review tribunals csrts were mandated by the supreme court the csrt process goes beyond the brief tribunals required by article 5 providing each individual detainee with full review these csrts have resulted in the determination that there was not enough information upon which to hold further 38 detainees renditions 13 sbu bellinger pointed out that renditions have been used for decades to detain terrorists and criminals who cannot be extradited or otherwise detained or brought to justice he stressed that the united states does not conduct extraordinary renditions for the purpose of torturing suspects or transferring them to countries in which they will be tortured there are many circumstances in which rendition might be the best option in all cases renditions are conducted in manner consistent with international obligations and the sovereignty of other states the us would expect that states cooperating in rendition activities would also do so in manner consistent with their domestic law 14 sbu bellinger sought to dispel allegations that hundreds of people had been kidnapped from european streets he pointed out that there is evidence for such allegations and that the united states respects the sovereignty of european governments on renditions cia flights and other intelligence operations the us will not confirm or deny specific allegations in order not to compromise the confidentiality of intelligence operations as such bellinger noted that denying five out of six such allegations would in effect confirm the sixth the us trusts that european governments will continue to follow the same policy guantanamo at human rights commission 15 c some eu interlocutors expressed concern that some eu member states would support cuban resolution against us actions in guantanamo at the upcoming human rights commission that might be modeled after european parliament resolution on the subject bellinger warned that european support for guanatanamo resolution would be serious setback to useu cooperation against terrorism and give the unacceptable impression that the eu was aligned with cuba against the us eu council directorgeneral for common foreign and security policy robert cooper said some eu member states might feel obliged to support the resolution because they had agreed last year not to in return for us commitment to allow the special rapporteur on torture manfred novak to visit guantanamo now the us had gone back on that agreement bellinger explained that the us had invited novak to visit but that novak had chosen publicly to reject the us offer to visit under normal conditions but not to able to interview individual detainees as only the icrc may do that cooper said the eu having cooperated with the us in resisting chinese attempts to impose conditions on visits of special rapporteurs was having difficulty justifying the us attempts to impose conditions on novaks guantanamo visit both sides agreed that the us and eu needed to consult further in order to avoid train wreck at the human rights commission on this european reactions positive for us 16 c comment by and large bellingers european interlocutors responded very positively to his visit their questions were many and varied and all of the meetings were marked by vigorous but constructive discussion it is clear that many europeans continue to believe that article 3 of the geneva conventions can be applied to enemy combatants and still afford the united states the flexibility it seeks it is also apparent that lingering concerns fed by negative public perceptions remain about the treatment of detainees and protection against wrongful detentions some governments remain focused on renditions and the possibility that there will be negative revelations that impact on them directly 17 that said the visit was very helpful in beginning to dispel european misunderstandings and misgivings about our pursuit of the war on terror continued engagement on these issues is critical in the coming months to persuade eu governments to stand more firmly and publicly in the face of their publics concerns and suspicion regarding guantanamo renditions and the legality of us actions against qaeda the austrian chair of the cojur meeting ferdinand trauttmansdorf concluded the meeting with the following message we leave this discussion with the notion that america is carefully considering these difficult questions in good faith he said also that the fight against terror was burden shared by the eu and that the us has as much of right to ask questions of the eu as the eu does of the us on the upcoming human rights commission urgent consultations with the eu will be necessary to avert the possibility of eu support for cuban guantanamo resolution 18 u this message has been cleared by legal adviser john bellinger gray
