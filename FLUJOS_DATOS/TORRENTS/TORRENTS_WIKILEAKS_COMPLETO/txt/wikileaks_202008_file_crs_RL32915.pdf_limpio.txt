legislation in the 109th congress summary the upper mississippi river and illinoi s waterway umriww is at the center of debate over the future of inla nd navigation the restoration of rivers used for multiple purposes and the reliability and completeness of the us army corps of engineers analyses justifying inves tments consequently authorization of investments in navigation and ecosystem re storation of the umriww played role in water resources development act wrda hr 2864 debates in the 109th congress among the topics debated were the cost urgency necessity and national benefit of expanded umr iww navigation capacity and ecosystem restoration given the constraints and competition for corps construction funding during the 109th congress the house and senate both passed water resources development act bill hr 2864 confer ees were named but fu rther action was taken the umriww is 1200mile 9footdeep navigation channel created by 37 lockanddam sites and thousa nds of channel training structures built beginning in 1822 the umriww makes commercial na vigation possible between minneapolis and st louis on the mississippi river and along the illinois waterway from chicago to the mississippi river it per mits upper midwestern states to benefit from lowcost barge transport since the 1980s the system has experienced increasing traffic delays purportedly re ducing competitiveness of us products in some global markets the river is also losing the bitat diversity that s allowed it to support an unusually large number of species for temperate river this loss is partially attributable to changes in the distribu tion and movement of river water caused by navigation structures and operation of the 9foot navigation channel in december 2004 the corps chief of engineers approved umriww 50 year framework for navigation and ecosystem restoration investment s as laid out in corps final feasibility report this framework consists of combined navigation investments 24 billion and ecosystem re storation investment s 53 billion to be accomplished through incremental implementati on for the first increment the chief recommends authorizing 188 billion 50 from the inland waterway trust fund and 50 from federal genera l revenues for seven ne w locks and smallscale navigation measures and 146 billion 133 billion from federa l general revenue and 013 billion from nonfederal partne rs for ecosystem restoration the house and senate versions of wr da would have authorized investments in navigation 203 billion and ecosystem restoration 158 billion for

this study set out 50year plan for combined navigation investments 24 billion and ecosystem restoration investments 53 billion for the upper mississippi riverillinois waterway umr iww from the 50year

waterway contend that this competitiveness is in danger b ecause of increasing transit delays most of the lockanddam infrastruct ure of the umriww navigation system was built by the corps in the 1930s thes 600foot locks require the nowprevalent 1100foot barge tows to split in half and pa ss through in two steps this decoupling contributes to wait times at some locks the corps reports that the umriww system has over half 19 of 36 of the most delayed locks of th countrys inland waterways2 commercial users advocate fo r expanded lock capacity with new 1200foot locks parallel to the existing 600foot locks keep ing both operational they contend that commercial umriww barge operators have been paying fuel tax into the inland waterway trust fund iwtf3 for making this type of infrastructure investment in contrast taxpayer advocacy group taxpayers for common sense and some environmental groups have argued that inexpensive smallscale measures like traffic scheduling congestion tolls nd switchboats could manage demand and reduce lockage delays and unlike new locks that would take years to design and build smallscale measures would be implemented quickly at fraction of the cost4 navigation investment supporters conte nd that the usefulness of smallscale measures is limited in practice some nvironmental groups are also concerned that additional stress caused by construction

been steady recently because of delays that is delays are forcing grain shippers to switch to alternate transportation modes to ensure timely arrival at downriver processing plants or gulf ports navigation supporters cite that since the late 1940s the umriww has experienced substantial traffic growth from less than 10 million metr ic tons in the mid1940s to more than 80 million metric tons in the 1990s for an analysis of the historic trends and the prospect for future traffic see crs report rl32470 upper mississippi river illinois waterway navigation expansi on an agricultural transportation and environmental context coordinated by randy schnepf although 1200foot locks are expected to reduce current waiting times at locks they are not expected to eliminate all lock delays b

umriww has been the subject of controversy in february 2000 corps economist approached the us office of special counsel an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency that protects governme nt whistleblowers contending that the corps manipulated benefitcost analysis to support umriww lock improvements the feasibility study was temporarily halted while the allegations were investigated by the army inspector genera l ig and available study documents were reviewed by the national research c ouncil nrc of the national academy of sciences the igs investigation found incidents of fraud or waste it did reveal serious misconduct and impropr ieties with the study and suggested an institutional bias that favored largescale projects10 the nrc pointed out several flaws

co rps feasibility report which is similar to the final feasibility report13 the nrc suggested in its reports that until small scale measures were investigated and implemented where feasible it would be impracticable to evaluate the benefits of new locks and lock extensions following on the earlier reports the october 2004 re port found economic feasibility for any of the navigation alternatives has theref ore not been demonstrated and the nrc panel concluded that many of the flaws nd omissions in this study can be corrected in the course of implementation by the application of adaptive management principles14 final feasibility report in september 2004 the corps released final feasibility report based on the results of the reformulated study it recommended 50year plan for combined navigation efficiency and ecosystem restoration investments the corps proposed authoriza tion of first increment of measures as well as dualpurpose navigation and ecosy stem restoration management of the umriww the corps navigation improve ment plan would cost an estimated 24 billion over 50 years while the ecosystem restoration plan would cost an estimated 53 billion over 50 years the corps reco mmended that congress authorize first increment of the navigation measures at 188 billion and first 15year increment of ecosystem restoration measures at 146 billion although the corps did not implement smallscale measures as the nrc suggested the agency evaluated them as part of the reformulated study few of the smallscale measures that were studied were included in the corps r ecommendation for navigation investments in addition to supporting navigation and eco system restoration investments the corps recommended creating structure for umriww investments and operations consisting of three basic elements adding ecosystem restoration as umriww project purpose creating dualpurpose navigati on and restoration authority approving combined navigation nd ecosystem restoration plan as framework andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs6 15 part of the corps definition of adaptive management is an approach to natural resources management that acknowledges the risk and uncertainty of ecosystem restoration and allows for modification of restoration measures to optimize performance the process of implementing policy decisions as scientifically driven mana gement experiments that test predictions and assumptions in management plans using the resulting information to improve the plans corps final feasibility report and peis p 611 16 for more information on the

contains final feasibility report including studies of engineering feasibility and analyses of benefits and costs environmental studies and the chiefs recommendation on how to proceed the corps umriww feasibility report has also been reviewed for compliance with administration policy by the assistant secretary of the army civil works in contrast to the corps chief of engineers who has signed off on the proposed project the assistant secretary of the army civil works reportedly chose to suppor t proceeding with design and recommended waiting until additional economic data and analysis are available before initiating construction the formal corps project development and authoriza tion process typically has congress authorizing project based on ch iefs report that has been reviewed for compliance with administration policy by th assistant secretary of the army civil works then the office of management and budget omb16 in recent years congress increasingly has authorized project s based on informati onal copies of the chiefs report before complete reviews by the assistant secretary and omb however majority of projects are still aut horized after full executive branch review supporters of exceptions from the standard process generally contend that the completion of the administrations reviews and the timing of authorizing legislation are not always synchronized and that exceptions provide the flexibility to bridge the two schedules when most of the corps analysis is already complete environmental and taxpayer groups have been critical of exceptions to the corps standard process they contend that authorizing without complete administration review rushes projects through review that congressiona l decisions are made with incomplete information and that reviewers ma be pressured to make favorable recommendations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs7 17 corps final feasibility report and peis pp x 437438 and 493 18 ibid pp 462 and 493 19 ibid p 493 20 ibid p 458 21 ibid p 459 22 similar approach was used for the corps first largescale ecosystem restoration effort continuednavigation investments the umriww feasibility report evaluating the federal interest in investments in navigation improvements is atypical in some respects the analysis had to account for complex set of risks and uncertainties resulting from 50year planning horizon for the extensive umriww system for the final feasibility report and peis the corps used scenariobased approach rather than forecasting navigation demand over 50 years which the corps was doing prior to the criticism in 2000 and 2001 the scenario approach examined umri ww movements for five traffic scenarios based on differing world trade crop area crop yield and consumption patterns the corps used the scenarios to arrive at preferred navigation plan and to make three general findings first si ngle navigation alternative was clear best choice across range of economic conditions17 second the preferred navigation alternative depended on two variables 1 tr affic forecasts derived from future trade scenarios and 2 price sensitivity of shippers18 third the risks are high if action is taken and high traffic occurs ri sks are also high if large investment is made and increases in traffic do not materialize19 stated another way the corps found every alternative incl uding action to contain risk in the face of an uncertain future meeting fundamental criterion for federal involvement that national economic development benefits ex ceed costs depends on what the future holds for example according to the corps analysis if umriww traffic continues at the fairly constant level of the last 20 years costs of largescale measures would likely exceed benefits20 if navigation traffic on the sy stem increases ie follows the longer 50year growth trend be nefits probably will exceed costs21 these findings are useful for understanding why proceed ing with navigation capacity expansion remains controversial fo r discussion of the difference of opinion on the urgency of new locks the feasibility of using alternatives to new locks for reducing delays and the confidence level in the co rps analysis see crs report rl32470 upper mississippi riverillinois waterway na vigation expansion an agricultural transportation and environmental context coordinated by randy schnepf the corps usually recommends authorization of an entire project that it has analyzed and compared to alternatives because the umriww is an extensive navigation system the corps analyzed and compared alternative 50year packages of projects for navigation and ecosyst em restoration nd it recommended that congress approve the combined plans as framework and authorize subset of initial projects with the implication that it would be asked later to authorize the remaining projects in the 50year plan22 the subset of projects was not analyzed ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs8 22 continued in the florida everglades where wrda 2000 pl 106541 approved the final feasibility report as framework authorized few specific projects under the framework and established process for developing and authorizing additional projects 23 ibid p 493a standalone plan for example the corps feasibility report did not have benefit cost analysis for the first increment of navigation activities as subset of the analysis of the 50year plan the report also did not present costeffectiveness analysis for the first increment of ecosystem restoration projects corps navigation plan adaptive implementation the final feasibility report and peis stated that sufficient analysis had been co mpleted to support an initial navigation investment to be implemented using an adaptive approach that minimizes risk by controlling the magnitude of investment decisions23 the corps recommended authorization of an initial set of navigation investments from its 50year navigation plan including seven new 1200foot lock s authorization for the remaining navigation investments whic h consist primarily of exte nding five 600foot locks to 1200 feet would be sought in later legisl ation to support this adaptive approach the corps recommended the continued study and monitoring of umriww navigation to produce the data to feed in to an adaptive implementation approach in another departure from standard pr actice the corps recommended that the seven new locks be reconsidered after congressional authoriz ation as additional information becomes available the corps would transmit reports to the administration and congress containing ac quired information first the corps would produce notification report at the end of the first phase of lock design and before the award of construction contr act the notification report would present all new information resulting from monitoring river traffic and markets and results of any improved models and analysis the corps recommendation was to break up preconstruction engineering and design wo rk for the seven new locks into two segments first the design work on three locks followed by the design work on the remaining four locks the design work for the first three locks was estimated to take three years following initiation of appropriations so the corps anticipated notification report in 2008 if the full annua l appropriations were received starting in 2005 the corps estimated that it woul d spend 30 million on preconstruction engineering and design for the first three lock sites the second report would come five to seven years into implementation ie 2010 to 2012 when the corps submits reevaluation report upon the development and use of new and widely accepted models the report would conclude with recommenda tion to congress on whether to continue stop or lay lock construction third report would be an updated feasib ility report for the 50year plan evaluating investments in second increm ent of measures the second increment of navigation measures would cons ist primarily of five lock extensions upstream of the new locks on the mississippi river the co rps anticipated that this report would be written 16 years into impleme ntation ie around 2021 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs9 24 switchboats would be used to assist tows by managing the second half of their hauls as they move the first half through the 600foot locks resulting in shorter lockage time switchboats would be employed as hired vessels permanently stationed on both the upstream and downstream sides of lock 25 corps final feasibility report and peis p 419 the corps did not established specific mitigation actions instead it identifies potentia l mitigation measures for each river reachfirst increment the corps 50year navigation plan consists of smallscale measures structural and nons tructural including switchboats24 and largescale improvements seven new lock s and five lock extensions the plan would have first cost ie design and constr uction costs of 24 billion plus annual switchboat costs of 18 million in the final feasibility report and peis the corps recommended that congress appr ove the 50year plan as framework and authorize first increment of 188 billion to be pa id 50 from federal general revenue funds and 50 from the inland waterways trust f und consistent with standard policy for inland waterway projects the first incr ement would include seven new locks and smallscale measures for us during lock construction the seven new locks would be 1200foot locks parallel to existing 600foot locks the 188 billion authorization proposed by the corps would cover the first costs for authorized navigation measures like most corps authorizations the authorized amount would not reflect ope ration and maintenance om expenses om for inland waterways is 100 fe deral responsibility the om for the recommended navigation measures woul d be 78 million annua lly the federal government would be responsible for this amount as well the 115 to 126 million spent annually on om of the existing umriww navigation system if fully funded the corps estimated that it would take 13 years for each lock to proceed to completion from the start of preconstruction engineering and design the first three of the seven new locks would be complete at the earliest by 2019 the remaining four locks would be started three years later and completed earlier than 2022 environmental mitigation the final feasibility report and peis assessed and set out process and specific measures for mitigating impacts directly associated with navigation in its preferred alternative the corps concluded that the impacts of largescale umriww navigation improvement measures could be mitigated it stated that by using mitigation the net ffect from both increased traffic and site specific impacts would be loss to the five principal areas of concern fisheries submerged aquatic plants backwaters sec ondary channels and historic properties25 proposed legislation and corps navigation plan as recommended by the corps the hous and senate versions of hr 2864 in the 109th congress would have authorized ven new locks and smallscale and non structural measures see

mississippi river system restoration plan is unusual in that the investments are aimed at benefitting diverse set of species most of the corps other environmental investme nts have been for project mitigation often targeted at specific threatened or enda ngered species for the umrs the corps is proposing largescale restoration effort that is not directed at specific species but at providing habitat and habitat di versity to benefit popul ations of multiple native species in situ for more detailed discussion of th ecosystem restoration proposal see crs report rl32630 upper mississippi river system proposals to restore an inland waterways ecosystem by kyna powers and nicole t carter the environmental management program for the umrs au thorized in wrda 1986 has allowed the corps to test the impacts of measures similar to those propos ed for the umrs however since largescale implementation of these measures may produce uncertain outcomes the corps is recommending an adaptive management approach since the umrs restoration plan is among the firs t largescale restoration efforts being planned across the country it raises numer ous unanswered policy questions which were not addressed in hr 2864 and thus are not addressed in this report including what distinguishes ecosystem restoration from mitigation for past and ongoing damages of navigation projects what qualifies as restoration for example is system that needs regular intervention such as dredging restored is restoration feasible goal for waterway managed for intensivecommercial navigation is dualpurpose management for ecosystem restoration and navigation possi ble for highuse commercial waterway how should federal ppropriations be distributed among the universe of ecosystem restoration projects nationally for example how does restoration of the umrs rank compared to the restorations of the california baydelta the chesapeake bay coastal louisiana florida everglades the great lakes and the missouri and rio grande rivers corps ecosystem restoration plan the final feasibility report recommended an ecosystem restoration plan for combating the environmental damage resulting from ongoing navigation om and other factors degrading the umrs ecosystem it recommended longterm 50year restoration framework an adaptive manageme nt approach and authorization of 15 year first increment of activities the restoration goals of the plan are26 maintain viable populations of native species in situ represent all native ecosystem types across their natural range of variationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs12 27 another exception is the corps only other largescale restoration effort the florida everglades restoration the everglades restoration was split 50 federal and 50 nonfederal the everglades ecosystem was harmed by operations of federal projects and encompasses extensive federal lands for information on everglades restoration see crs report rs20702

evolutionary and ecological processes eg disturbance regimes hydrologic pro cesses nutrient cycles etc and integrate human use and occupa ncy within these constraints the corps limited its ecosystem restoration plan to the navigation project and study and to addressing the cumulative imp acts of operations of federal projects and other stressors without reducin g the benefits of existing federal projects as such restoration measures are constrained b ecause they cannot impede navigation and they are limited to the umriww and its floodplain rather than the larger watershed for example dramatic water level changes that could produce substantial restorati on benefits are not in the corps plan because they would interfere with navigation another consequence of limiting restoration to the navigation project and study is that some of the stressors leading to degradation were not considered in the preferred plan the recommended umrs re storation plan does not include changes to land use practices flood protection practices that isolate the river from its floodplain on largescale or significant altera tions to navigation infrastructure for example the corps plan includes backwater dredging measures dredging addresses the symptom of elev ated sedimentation but not the land use practices that can cause it directly changing land use is outside the scope of the navigation study and navigation project b ecause only some of the stressors causing ecosystem degradation are managed under th corps plan not all of the ecosystems natural river processes would be restored resulting in the need for regular human intervention to sustain so restorati on benefits 15year restoration increment in the final feasibility report the corps proposed that congress authorize an in itial 15year

general the 100 federal components ddress impacts of the existing 9foot navigation pr oject or are on federal land according to the corps measures in the 15year increment were selected to provide 1 the best return on investment 2 the best gains in habitat diversity and 3 additional knowledge that will fac ilitate implementing the 50year plan28 the corps also favored measures for whic h planning design construction and monitoring could occur during the 15year window however some organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs13 29 ibid p 522 argued that 15 years would be insufficien t to demonstrate substantial improvements unlike the analysis of the 50year ecosystem restoration options the final report did not analyze in detail the ecosystem benefits expected from the 15year increment it also did not present alternative 15year increments or costeffectiveness analysis of the 15year increment the recommended 15year increment included 225 measures from the 1010 measures in the 50year plan the 225 measures were grouped into three main categories of activities fish passage and dam operations fish passage construction at four dams and fish pa ssage planning and desi gn at

with an expected split of 96 million fe deral and 519 million nonfederal proposed legislation and corps restoration plan the house and senate versions of hr 2864 during the 109th congress were largely similar to the corps recommendations they would have authorized the same projects and had the same costshare arra ngement although the senate version would have required that restoration be implemented in accordance with the general framework outlined in the final feasibility report and peis and the house version would have required that restoration be implemented in accordance with upper mississippi river and illinois waterway sy stem report of the chief of engineers there were some differences between the corps 15year increment and the proposed authorizing language see table 2

2864 made mention of adaptive management the language w ould have required so complementary measures the house version would ve required an ecosystem restoration implementation report by june 2007 june 2008 in the senate version and every five years thereafter the report was to include baselines benchmarks goals and priorities for restoration projects and to measure the progress in meeting goals the language also would have authorized an advisory panel similar to the science panel which was one of 12 elements of the adaptive mana gement strategy outlined in the final feasibility report30 because the b ill language did not specifically authorize the adaptive management approach it was uncer tain if the corps would have had the authority to implement the 136 million ad aptive management program and the complementary 136 million monitoring and evaluation that the agency recommended similarly the corps recommended adding ecosystem restoration as project purpose31 the hr 2864 language would have required the corps consistent with requirements to avoid adverse effect s on navigation to modify umriww operations to address cu mulative environmental impacts and improve ecological integrity and to carry out ecosystem rest oration projects the language did not explicitly add ecosystem restoration as project purpose of the umriww the implications of this for managing for bot h navigation and restor ation were unclear another distinction was that hr 2864 would have authorized lump sum of 158 billion with one primary limitation th at land acquisition be limited to 35 million annually in the final feasibility report the corps ma recommendations on an annual limitation on land acquisition instead it recommended cap of 35000 acres on land acquisition the final repor t provided breakdown of the 146 billion among three categories of restoration activities fish passage and dam operations programmatic restoration au thority and land acquisition project design hr 2864 would have require d that before an individual restoration project begins construction the secretar establish restoration performance measures incl uding baseline indicator and target goals the language also would have required that the design of these projects include monitoring plan for the performance measures including timeline for project completion the provisions appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns over what would be achieved under both the first incr ement of authorized activities and the longer 50year plan and when restora tion would be complete these provisions complemented the corps recommendation for an adaptive management approach which required establishing baselines nd monitoring performance to incorporate new information into ongoing investments linked progress hr 2864 would have required the corps to establish milestones for the ecosystem restoration and navigation projects the language also would have required the secretary of the army to determine if the projects werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs16 32 early 2004 nrc report p 19being carried out at comparable rates if the projects were not moving toward completion at comparable rate annual funding would have been adjusted to promote comparable progress the provision appeared to be an attempt to address concerns about ecosystem restoration i nvestments being outpaced by navigation investments similar provisions were included in legislation proposed in the 108th congress at that time some environmental groups were willing to accept new locks if ecosystem restoration also was authorized and funded they wanted investments in restoration and navigation linked they f eared that if the two were not linked ecosystem restoration could have been authorized but could receive minimal appropriations navigation nd agricultural interests expressed their dissatisfaction with linking navigation and restoration progress they consider navigation and ecosystem restoration inves tments as separable they did not want navigation construction slowed due to constraine d federal appropriations for ecosystem restoration in light of the multiple multibilli on dollar largescale restoration projects already underway or under development nationa lly they also contended that linking might delay progress of lock constructi on thus extending the environmental and traffic disturbances caused by constructi on linked progress u ltimately is policy decision of how congress wants to direct its appropriations differences while the house and senate ve rsions of hr 2864 were largely similar the two had subtle differences for example the advisory panel established under the house language would have had one chairperson the secretary of the army in the senate version the secretary of the army and secretary of the interior were cochairpersons further the compar able progress provisions of the house and senate versions differed the house version would have explicitly required the secretary of the army to submit annual reports to congress describing whether projects were being carried out at compar able rates the sena language did not include this provision project ranking hr 2864 would have require d the secretary of the army in collaboration with the advisory panel that the bill established to develop ranking system for restorati on projects emphasizing projects that restore natural river processes project ranking based on restoring natural rive r processes appeared to be an attempt to promote projects that tri gger selfrepair and selfmaintenance over large areas at relatively modest cost32 these provisions coul d have given priority to water level mana gement and other da m alterations floodplain measures such as levee modifications and remova ls and alteration of river tr aining structures such as wing dams and dikes the impact that these provisions would have had on the imple mentation of the corps final plan is uncertain it could ve given priority to single aspect of project rather than facilitating multiple objec tives prioritizing projects that restore natural river processes might not have been appropriate for all river reaches especially lower reaches that are more altered than ssdisturbed upper reaches greater number of engineered restoration activities were recommended by the corpshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32915crs17 in the lower basin which is more heavily developed and levee d than in the upper basin for example the corps recomme nded artificially mimicking natural hydrograph to restore ecological processe s eg pumping water out of areas with water levels raised by dams for reaches where natural river restoration options were limited by the navigation system and development solution using more natural river process might have decreased water levels by altering dam operations thus harming navigation this option was not considered in the corps plan because the agency considered it outside the scope of the feasibility study and navigation project conclusions the corps feasibility report recommended first increment of investments in navigation 188 bi llion and ecosystem restoration 146 billion the recommendation was for these investments to be made using an adaptive approach and as part of longterm framewo rk for dualpurpose operations the recommendation was to improve navigation efficiency by building seven 1200foot locks to reduce delays caused by decoupling of barge tows the ecosystem restoration proposal was to address cumulative impacts degrading the umrs ecosystem including the ongoing effect s of om of the navigation system recommendations for restoration activities were limited geographically to the umr iww and its floodplain and to the scope of the navigation project and its feasibility study more comprehensive watershed approach was not part of the plan recommended in the feasibility report hr 2864 would have authorized many of the elements of the corps recommendation for the first increment of investments the language would have authorized seven new navigation locks sm allscale navigation m easures and related environmental mitigation the adaptive imp lementation process that the corps recommended in its feasibility report to integrate new information into the decision on lock construction was not explicitly adopted in bill nguage instead the senate version directed that the investments be implemented in general conformance with corps documents while the house version directed that implementation be substantially in accordance with corps documents drawing from the corps recommendati ons hr 2864 would have authorized ecosystem restoration activities to be ca rried out in accordance with the framework in the feasibility report and these activities would have required operational changes to the umriww consistent with requirements to avoid any adverse impact on navigation additionally hr 2864 c ontained three provisions related to implementation of ecosystem restoration one provision appeared to require comparable funding requests to be made based on the rate of progress for navigation and restoration projects the other tw provisions would have required outcome oriented project design fo r ecosystem restoration proj ects and the development of ranking system for restoration projects that prioritizes natural river processes
