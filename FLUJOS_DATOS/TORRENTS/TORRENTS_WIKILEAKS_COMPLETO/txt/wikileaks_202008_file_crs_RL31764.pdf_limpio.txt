analyst in telecommunications and technology policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31764spectrum management auctions summary radio frequency spectrum policy issues before congress are characterized by economic technological and regulatory comple xity of particular interest to policy makers are the allocation of spectrum for specific types of use such as tv broadcasting radio advanced wireless services or unli censed and the assignment of licenses for exclusive or shared use of specific frequencies today most frequencies allocated for commercial uses are assigned through auctions with licenses going to the highest bidder another important allocation of spectrum is for unlicensed use both commercial nd noncommercial entities use unlicensed spectrum to meet wide variety of mon itoring and communications needs suppliers of wireless devices must m eet requirements for certifica tion to operate on frequency bands designated for unlicensed use ex amples of unlicensed use include garage door openers and wifi communicati ons the federal communications commission fcc regulates licensed and unlicensed spectrum not allocated for federal use is responsible for auctioni ng spectrum licenses and can also use its authority to redistribute licenses proceeds from spectrum license sales are presently attributed to general revenue in the us budget in the 108th congress however precedent was established with the creation of spectrum relocati on fund to hold proceeds from the auction of specified radio frequencies allocated to federal use federal agencies vacating spectrum to be auctioned for commercial use are being compensated from the fund for costs of relocation in the 109th congress the defic it reduction act pl 109 171 included provisions that placed certain auction proceeds in digital television transition and public safety fund the f und is being mainly used to assist the transition from analog televison broadcas ting to digital broadcasting and for contributions to programs for public safety over 7 billion of the auction proceeds were applied to deficit re duction the funding came from the auction of spectrum at 700 mhz currently used for analog levision broadcasting to be vacated by february 17 2009 the auction auct ion 73 concluded on march 182008 it grossed 19592420000 the rules for auction 73 introduced two new business models for spectrum management and assign ment that represented depart ures from past policy one model designated block of spectrum licen ses for network that could be managed to accept any suitable wireless device or so ftware application referred to as open access the ot her model would require shar ed network to accommodate both public safety and commercial users in pa rtnership nationa l license referred to as the d block was put up for auction as pa rt of auction 73 with reserve price of 13 billion the winning bidder would have been required to assume the cost and responsibility of building the network usin g d block spectrum and adjacent spectrum assigned to public safety the sole bid fo r the d block was below the reserve price and consequently the d block will be reauctioned the prospects for this new auction have triggered bate about the nature of competition in the wireless industry and the need for nationwide public safety network that may be

communications including cellular telephony paging pers onal communications service radio and television broadcast telephone radio relay aerona utical and maritime radio navigation and satellite comma nd and control spectru m policy covers both satellite and terrestrial transmissions the issues discussed here refer principally to spectrum management for terre strial technologies background radio frequency spectrum is managed primarily by regulations that set rules for example for permissible uses certification of devices requirements for public safety and the acquisition of licenses spectrum is assigned primarily through licenses while some spectrum remains unlicensed and accessible to any user who meets specific requirements the federal communications commission fcc is responsible for overseeing licensed and unlicensed spectrum used for commercial purposes and by state and cal agencies including firs t responders as well as most other radio frequencies not assigned for federal use although congress has legislative role in spectrum management the fcc routinely takes on the responsibility of making decisions about the assignment of spectrum for different uses and sets the rules for auc tions of spectrum licenses two recent important auctions of spectrum licenses were for the 700 mhz band1 auction 73 and the advanced wireless services aws designated auction 66 or aws1 the auction for licenses at 700 mhz airwaves that are or will be available because of the planned switch from analog to digital television broadcasting ended march 18 2008 the bids in this auction tota

technology can only operate on certa in frequencies commercially viable frequencies are valuable commodity renewable airwaves used to broadcast any transmission can be reused after the broadcast is completed technology dependent most natural resources can be harvested manually albeit inefficiently spectrum is in the atmosphere and is usable because technology has been developed to exploit the properties of electro magnetic waves for sound data and video transmission national asset with international rules and regulations for example most domestic uses of spectrum are assigned bands of operation through the internati onal telecommunications union an agency of the united nations satellites for broadcasting are governed by international treaty administered to avoid interference from competing broadcast transmissions frequency assignme nts are managed by recognized authorities administrative decisions as to how to allocate spectrum for example the number of channels to assign with license influence its commercial potential and the supply of spectrum for commercial and public use the development and imp lementation of better wireless communications technologies are critical to maximizing the efficiency of spectrum resources spectrum management policie s ideally should take into account the impact of new technology or since it is difficult to predict the devel opment paths of new technologies allow for flexibility nd accommodation in spectrum allocation although flexibility may be desirable in policymaking most existing wireless technologies are inflexibly constructe d to work on limited range of specific frequencies relocation from one part of the spectrum to another can require costly equipment changes therefore reallocation of spectrum to new uses is often expensive as well as technically and administratively difficult additionally some uses of spectrum are governed by international regulations spectrum auctions because two or more signal transmissi ons over the same frequency in the same location at the same time could cause interference distortion of the signals thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31764crs3 3 two signals can interfere with each other even if they are not at the same exact frequency but are close in frequency to avoid harmful interference the frequencies must have frequencies that are sufficiently different known as minimum separation 4

years of debate over the idea of using competitive bidding ie auctions to assign spectrum licenses the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 added sec tion 309j to the communications act authorizing the fcc to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communica tions services additional provisions concerning auctions were included in th balanced budget act of

use specific frequencies and are recent innovation in spectrum management and policy spectrum for what is widely described as prime frequencies 300 mhz 3000 mhz is judged by many to be the most commercially desi rable and is widely sought after at auction by competing interests4 several lucrative auctions have added billions to the federal treasury applied to general revenue the fcc has the authority to conduct au ctions only when applications are mutually exclusive ie two licensees in the same frequency band would be unable to operate without causing interference w ith each other and when services are primarily subscriptionbased the fcc does not have aut hority to reclaim licenses awarded prior to the decision to permit auctions in accordance with the budget enforcement act of 1990 and provisions in the communications act of 1934 as amended auction proceeds cannot be used for funding other programs5 creation of two important trust funds the spect rum relocation fund and the

act of 1934 as amended directs the fcc to develop competitive bidding methodology6 the fcc initially developed rules for each auction separately with some common elements but after several years of trial and error it s developed set of general auction rules and procedures while there may be special requirements for specific auctions the following rules generally apply as screening mechanism all auctions require bidders to submit applications and upfront payments prior to the auction most auctions are conducted in simultaneous multipleround bidding in wh ich the fcc accepts bids on large set of related licenses simultaneously using electronic communications bidders can bid in consecutive r ounds until all bidding has stopped on all licenses the rules the fcc sets for each auction c over many activities such as evaluating and qualifying bidders the bidding process and final paym ent recent fcc decisions about auction rules that are currently controversial include setting new requirements for designated entities and using blind bidding designated entities and entrepreneur bidders in some auctions the fcc has given concessions to small businesses that incl ude bidding credits and set asides of licenses these small companies are typically classed as entrepreneurs or small businesses entreprene urs are defined as having annual gross re venues of less than 125 million and total asse ts of less than 500 million qualification as small business includes annual reve nues of more than 40 million averaged over three years the fcc originally also gave special provisions to womenowned minority owned and rural tele phone companie s referred to as designated entities after 1995 supreme court decision determined that government affirmative action policies must pass strict scrutiny test to demonstrate past discrimination the fcc removed minorityowned and womenowne d groups from its list of businesses qualifying for bidding credits as designated entities7 many industry observers have expressed concern that some of the small businesses participating in auctions actually represent larger companies8 by contracting with larger company some companies that bid as designated entity or entrepreneur are alleged to have benefitted from bidding credits and other considerations granted to smaller companies while tapping the financial resources of major wireless telecommunications company furthermore study by the congressi onal budget office cbo found that significant number of small companies that acquired spectrum licenses through preferential programs

opponents for contested licenses will not be able to identify the competitor they argue that blind bidding would prevent collusion for example between incumbents to keep out new entrant retaliatory bidding and other practices that may skew auction results blind bidding was proposed during the comments period leading up to the aws1 auction but met resistance from the wireless industry on the grounds that there were sufficient prospective bidders to assure competition12 media access project published two st udies on the aws1 auction alleging evidence of collusive bidding and other practices that enabled incumbent wireless companies to exclude new entrants and possibly manipulate the process so that final bids were lower than might have been the case if the auction had been truly competitive13 in news report the author of the media access project papers dr gregory rose was quoted as saying that unde r current auction rules i do not think it is illegal for bidders to discuss who they may want to keep out of an auction and to make arrangements to intervene if they did it while an auction was going on that would be an explicit violation of the rules the same news

to those experienced in the auction where next wave successfully bid on large amounts of spectrum and then defaulted the fcc adopted strea mlined auction rules for all services to be auctioned in the

companies spectrum license value spectrum value depends on many factors such as bandwidth its frequencies since signal transmission characteristics vary along different parts of the spectrum the geographic area covered the services permitted by fcc rules the availability of equipment that can operate at those freque ncies the demand for services that do not interfere with other bands the amount of alternative spectrum already available for similar services the number of incumbents presently occupying the spectrum and whether incumbents will remain in that spectrum or be relocated to

section 3003 b11 billion in 2008 from the sale of tv airw aves and an additional 29 billion in the period 2009201222 unlicensed spectrum unlicensed spectrum is not sold to the highest bidder and used for the services chosen by the licenseholder but is instead accessible to anyone using wireless equipment certified by the fcc for thos frequencies among the advantages of unlicensed spectrum is the opportunity to test new technology directly with consumers instead of going through sp ectrum licenseholders one of the disadvantages of unlicensed spectrum is the possibility of interference among the transmissions of the various users both with in the assigned bandwidth and with other bandwidths rules regarding interference differ between licensed and unlicensed spectrum recent congressional actions regarding spectrum auctions the omnibus budget reconciliation act amended the communications act of 1934 with number of important provisions affecting the availability of spectrum licenses and authorized the fcc to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services am ong the subsequent laws that deal with spectrum policy and auctions are the bala nced budget act of 1997 the auction reform act of 2002 the commercial spect rum enhancement act of 2004 and the deficit reduction act of 2005 the balanced budget act also directed fcc actions concerning the transition to digital tele vison an event with significant impact on spectrum management the balanced budget act of 1997 the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 contained seve ral spectrum management provisions it amended section 309j of the communications act to expand and broade n the fccs auction authority and to modify other aspects of spectrum management whereas previous statutes gave the fcc the authority to conduct auctions the balanced budget act required the fcc to use auctions to award ownership in mutually exclusive applications for most types of spectrum licenses it directed the fcc to experiment with combinatorial bidding ie allowing bidders to place single bids on groups of licenses simultaneously and to estab lish minimum opening bids and reasonable reserve prices in future auctions unless the fcc determined that it was not in the public interest this amendment also gave the fcc auction authority until september 30 2007 extended to sept ember 30 2011 by

not later than 2002 the spectrum was to have been auctioned in 2002 but not reclaimed from broadcasters until 2006 or later the act directed the fcc to grant extensions to stations with broad conditions that effectively nullified the 2006 deadline24 auction reform act of 2002 concerns about spectrum management including spectrum used for public safety prompted the introduction of the auction reform act of 2002 pl 107195 among the purposes of the act is the elimination of deadlines for auctions of upper and lowe r 700 mhz frequencies originally scheduled by the fcc for 2002

proceeds when they are required to vacate spectrum slated for commercial auction in eff ect successful commercial bidde rs would be covering the costs of relocation to accomplish the ntia and fcc goals the communications act of 1934 would need to be modifi ed to permit the agencies direct access to auction funds this was accomplished with the passage of the commercial spectrum enhancement act title ii of pl 108494 following the requirements of the act the fcc scheduled auctions for 1122 licenses at 1710 1755 mhz and 2110 2155 mhz the auction auction 66 was c oncluded on september 18 2006

policy as implemented by the federal communications commission and to report to congress on its finding27 the study28 concluded that auc tions were generally perceived as desirable way to allocate spectrum and recommended the extension of the fccs auction authority past the current expiration date of september 30 2007 the gao could not find evidence that market participants that had bought spectrum were at disadvantage in compe ting with service providers who had been assigned spectrum it found that the high cost of developing infrastructure was barrier to market entry and that this cost was more significant in shaping competition and pricing decisions than the cost of sp ectrum many findings were inconclusive and the gao recalled that in an earlier st udy it had recommended the

including the possibility of increasing the amount of spectrum at 700 mhz31 the study was submitted to congress in late 200532 in it the fcc did not make specific recommendation for additional spectrum allo cations in the shortterm although it stated that it agreed that public safety could make use of such an allocation in the longterm to provide broadband services33 the fcc then initiated rule making soliciting comments on how to take best advantage of the 24 mhz of spectrum already designated for public safety34 auction of frequencies at 700 mhz the process of preparing rules for the 700 mhz band auction attracted more debate than usual for number of reasons one reason for interest in the spectrum is that the airwaves used for tv have good propagation qualities able to travel far

700 mhz airwaves httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31764crs12 35 service rules and other fcc requirements for shared public safety network are discussed in crs report rl34054 publicprivate partnership for

network for public safety users to be shared with commercial users national license for 10 mhz designated as upper block d was put up for auction under service rules that required working with public safety licensee to build and manage shared network the public safety licensee was assigned single national license for part of the 24mhz originally assigned for public safety use at the behest of congress the two licensees were to negotiate network sharing agreement subject to fcc approval the public safety spectrum trust formed by group of associations was awarded th public safety license by the fcc37 partnership would give some public safety agencies access to privatesector capital and expertise to build the network there is currently federal plan to assist in building nationwide inte roperable network althoug h public safety users would be charged for access to the network proponent s of the plan argue that overall costs in such an arrangement would be less th an if the network were purely for public safety because of greater economies of scale service rules open access several companies associated with silicon valley and internet ventures petitioned the fcc to set aside block of spectrum as national license that would be used for open access which was defined as open devices open applications open services and open networks38 the fcc ruled that it would auction licenses for 22 mhz of spec trum with service rules requiring the first two criteria open devices and open pplications these licenses are referred to as the c block these licenses are being issued to winning bidders on the condition that the licensees adhere to the open access rules as spelled out in the code of federal regulations 47 c fr 2716 with limited exceptions licensees shall not deny limit or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice on the licens ees c block network network operators that violate this rule face enforcement action from the fcc including but not limited to forfeiture penalty39 band plan licenses and buildout requirements the band plan for the auction reflected several changes to the plan originally proposed by the fcc the changes make it possible to create licen ses for 62 mhz of spectrum at 700 mhzhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31764crs13 40 auction of 700 mhz band licenses sche duled for january 24 2008 october

areas or cmas creating 734 cma licenses for auction there were also 176 licenses offered for broader economic areas or eas also using 12 mhz of the lower 700 mhz band all of the commercial licenses have what the fcc describes as stringent performance requirements in particular for what are refe rred to as buildout rules winning bidders will have short time to provide service based on geographical or population parameters or risk forfeiting li censes for example the cma and ea licensees in the lower 700 mhz band must c over at least 35 of the geographic area within four years and 70 of the area by the end of ten years the term of the license the regional licenseholders in the uppe r 700 mhz band must ve built network that will reach 40 of the population in thei r license area within four years and 75 by the end of the license term failure to meet these interim guidelines will result in reduction of the license term from ten to eight years accelerating the buildout schedule licensees that fail to meet the final deadline will forfeit that part of the license that has not met buildout requirements the fcc will reclaim the spectrum and make it availa ble to others auction rules rules for the auction were released on october 5 200740 one decision in the rules was to use blind bidding recent auctions have had open bidding where all participants knew not onl the amounts of competing bids but also the names of their competitors with anonymity bidders w ill not be able to cooperate to exclude thirdparty wh ich allegedly occurred during the aws1 auction41 the fcc rules also permitted package bidding also known as combinatorial bidding in package auction bidders may make single bid for group of licenses instead of competing for each license individually package bidding is believed to favor new entrants and larger companies by allowing them to acquire licenses for the coverage that meets their business needs in manner that is more efficient and less risky in attempting to acquire for ex ample national coverage by winning many auction licenses bidder risks winning some of the licenses but not enough of the licenses to support its business plan successful package bid eliminates number of licenses from the general bidding proce ss reducing the supply of licenses open for bids from small players that are s eeking only one or two licenses auction results

of reauctioning the d block with different requirements but re served the right to make decision based on its determination of public interest42 in an order adopted and released on march 20 2008 the fcc directed the wireless tel ecommunications bur eau not to proceed with the reauction of the d block because it is in the public interest to provide additional time to consider all options43 the fcc therefore has begun review of its rules regarding licensing structuring partnership setting service requirements and other rule s and obligations established prior to the commencement of auction 73 it has prepared furthe r notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks comments on identified options that might be pursued in disposing of the d block44 some commentators believe that the conditions placed on the licenses in the upper 700 mhz band diverted bidding activity to the lower part of the band driving up the prices of these licenses some of the smaller companies may have been outbid in their efforts to obtain cma licenses because of increased competition and the effect of package bidding conclusion spectrum valuable resource governed by available technology is regulated by the federal government with the primary objectives of maximizing its usefulness and efficiency and to prevent interferen ce among spectrum users key component of spectrum policy is the allocation of bands for specific uses and the assignment of frequencies within those bands auctions fairly recent innovation in frequency assignment are regarded as marketb ased mechanism for allocating spectrum other marketdriven policies include licensi ng fees based on fa irmarket valuations of spectrum and flexibility in spectrum usage within assigned bandwidths today spectrum for commercial applications is typically auctioned to the highest bidder but many commercial users have spectrum ac quired before the presentday auction process was implemented auctions as means of allocating spectrum are considered success by many observers because of the federal revenue generated as well as for the speed with which licenses auctioned have gone to the companies that value them the most and are most likely to put them to use moreover many prefer letting businesses determine whether to invest in new service rather than relying on the government to decide who receives spectrum license the fcc has concluded that auctioning of spectrum licenses has contributed to the rapid deployment of new wireless technologies increased competition in the marketpl ace and encouraged participationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31764crs15 45 fcc 97353 fcc report to congress on spectrum auctions wt docket 97150 released october 9 1997by small businesses45 however many have ques tioned whether auction policy should be supplemented more aggressively with other ma rketdriven solutions and whether the existing auction process and administration can be improved spectrum management is an exercise in reconciling divergent interests over time developments in technology may sign ificantly increase the amount of useable spectrum and consequently the ease with wh ich policy of equ itable allocation and use can be crafted for the immediate futu re congress may choos to debate and act on questions such as reforming spectrum management and allocation mechanisms some observers argue that fullydevel oped policy should take into account issues such as international competitiveness the communications needs of public safety agencies and the military the role of wi reless technology in economic growth and the encouragement of new technologies that make spectrum use more efficient and more beneficial to society as whole the stated objective of many policy reformers is coherent national policy that provides the proper bala nce for existing applications while at the same time providing opportun ities for future growth and development given the number of objectives in the llocation and use of spectrum and the differing solutions for achieving them choices made for 700 mhz could be far reaching in setting the direction for future policy decisions
