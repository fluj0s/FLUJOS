divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32836child welfare an analysis of title ive foster care eligibility reviews introduction congressional interest in ensuring that states achieve positive results for children in foster care has sparked num ber of reforms in federal policy and regulations over the past decade among these were amendments requiring new review system designed to assess states ability to achieve safety permanency and wellbeing for the children it serves this report will examine one aspect of this new review system title ive foster care eligibility reviews these reviews which are smaller in scope than the much more frequently discussed child and family services review cfsr are meant to determine whether state is making proper claims for federal reimbursement under the title ive foster care program in particular the review is concerned with whether stat has in place the systems to ensure timely permanency and other judicial determinations nd adequate safety checks of provider homes apart from fiscal accountability thes aspects of the title ive eligibility review are designed to promot strong program management since the early 1980s the us depar tment of health and human services hhs has conducted reviews to monitor state compliance with child welfare protections included in titles ivb and ive of the social security act title ivb authorizes funds to states for broad rang of child welfare services including child protection family preserva tion family support timel imited family reunification and adoption promotion and support services t itle ive authorizes the foster care independent living and adoption assistan ce programs past reviews of these programs were called 427 re views in reference to pr otections originally outlined in section 427 of the social security act and title ive financial reviews traditionally reviews focused on case management practices and file documentation child welfare advocates state and federal officials and ultimately members of congress became critical of 427 and title ive financial reviews for procedural and programmatic deficiencies concerns included the lack of formal regulations to establish uniform review standards and the punitive rather than collaborative nature of the review process additionally ther was perception that focusing on paper compliance and legal requireme nts did not lead to improved services for children and families as result beginning in 1989 c ongress issued series of moratoriums prohibiting hhs from collecting penalties associated with these reviews in 1994 amendments to the social s ecurity act pl 103432 directed hhs to issue formal regulations establishing new review system to monitor programs under titles ivb and ive of the social s ecurity act and to incorporate the concepts of technical assistance and standardized corrective action into review processes subsequently congress pa ssed the adoption and safe families act of 1997 asfa pl 105189 which was intended to ensure both the safety of children in foster carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32836crs2 1 federal register vol 65 16 part ii us depart ment of health and human services administration for children and

title ive eligibility reviews table 1 stages of title ive foster care eligibility reviews initial primary review the first title ive eligibility review conducted in state following passage of the final rule on january 25 2000a it is intended to give states an opportunity to implement the requirements included in the regulations based on sample of 80 cases not more than eight cases can be in error for the state to be in substantial compliance federal funds are disallowed for any ineligible cases found in the sample primary review if state is found to be in compliance on an initial primary review primary reviews occur at threeyear intervals th ereafter as long as state continues to be compliant primary reviews have higher threshold based on sample of 80 cases not more than four cases can be in error to be compliant federal funds are disallowed for any ineligible cases found in the sample secondary review if state fails an initial primary or primary review it must develop program improvement plan pip and secondary review is conducted upon completion of the plan larger sample of 150 cases is taken for the state to be in compliance not more than 10 15 of cases can be in error and the dollar amount of ineligible claims cannot exceed 10 of total claims in the samp if state is not compliant tougher penalty structure is used to calculate the total disallowance amount hhs

carolina filed an appeal with the dab stating that cour t orders did in fact contain some language in support of reasonable efforts to prevent removal and finalize permanency plan albeit not the magic

source table prepared by crs based on analysis of state title ive foster care eligibility review final reports note percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding initial primary and primary reviews nine of the 28 states that received initial primary reviews we re found not compliant which means the number of ineligible cases exceeded eight seven of the 15 states that received primary reviews were found not compliant which means the number of ineligible cases exceeded the primary review threshold of four while only 15 states have received primary reviews under the new rule 47 have been found not compliant this is higher percentage of noncompliance than found in initial primary reviews where 32 of states were found not compliant the lowe r error rate threshold four instead of eight is the most obvious reason for this tr end but the persisten ce of errors related to permanency plan judicial determinati ons in both reviews also appears to be factor it is in this area that states have had to make the most adjustment in responding to the requirements in asfa and the final rule partic ularly in bringing their court systems up to speed and ensuring that staff are monitoring cases for compliance the following gives brie f account of errors associated with each categoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32836crs13 figure 3 review errors rela ted to provider requirementsjudicial across the

frame contrary to the welfare errors resulted from lack of appropriate lang uage and the finding not being included in the first court order after the childs removal reasonable efforts to prevent removal errors were largely because the state did not obtain the court order within the requi red 60day limit nearly every state experienced errors because permanency plan determinations were not timely which means they did not obtain these orders within the required 12month time frame provider errors associated with licen sing and criminal records background checks were most often due to lack of appropriate doc umentation in provider files some states continued the use of provi sional licenses beyond the effective date september 28 2000 of the provision in th final rule prohibiting them and others had ineligible cases due to invalid or expired licenses of providers lack of timely renewal of provider licenses created lapses in eligibility for otherwise federally eligible ive foster care children source figure prepared by crs based on analysis of state title ive foster care eligibility review final reports note percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding afdc throughout the reviews afdc elig ibility errors were often the result of lack of sufficient documentation in childs case file to validate the child was financially needy removed from specified relative andor prived of parental support this was especially an issu for redeterminations of afdc eligib ility where many files lacked case narrative or history to suppor t continued eligibility under these requirements afdc unspecified includes erro rs that were identified only as afdcrelated in final reportshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32836crs14 26 these four states were part of the twentyt wo state reviews not included in this analysis because the period covered by the review occurred prior to mar 25 2001 figure 4 review errors related to afdc eligibility source figure prepared by crs based on analysis of state title ive foster care eligibility review final reports note percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding state less than 1 of errors during revi ews were result of this requirement errors were mostly due to the court order or voluntary placement agreement not explicitly indicating that the state agency has responsibility for the childs placement and care or the court order that extended the childs placement in foster care was not timely or could not be located at all secondary reviews of the 16 states that were not in compliance on their initial primary and primary reviews after the march 25 2001 effective date for the permanency planning provision none have d secondary reviews that are available yet four states that received nd failed an initial primary review before the march 25 2001 effective date have d their followup secondary reviews with final reports available26 these states iowa kansas maine and new jersey were not assessed for compliance with the permanency plan provision on their initial primary review but were assessed for compliance with this requirement during their secondary reviewshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32836crs15 27 the number of ineligible cases does not always match the total number of errors since case could be deemed ineligible based on multiple errorsas discussed earlier secondary reviews are required of states that are found not compliant in their original reviews secondary reviews are conducted after implementation of program improvement plan pip which is intended to outline goals and activities to address areas of weaknesses in determining title ive eligibility iowa kansas and maine were found compliant on their secondary reviews meaning out of the 150 case sample the number of ineligible cases did not exceed 15 new jersey was found not complia nt during the secondary review since only four states have undergone secondary reviews it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of pips and technical assistance at improving state compliance with title ive requirements yet these examples do provide some insight into specific problem areas that states are addressing to come into compliance with requirements kansas was originally found not compliant in their initial primary review for 21 ineligible cases27 thirteen errors were attributed to judicial determinations contrary to the welfare and reasonable efforts to pr event removal 10 errors were result of incorrect afdc eligibility determinations and revi ewers found eight provider licensing errors the state implemented pip that focused on activities to better train staff on title ive requirements especially related to afdc provisions in the states secondary review only two inelig ible cases were found due to two errors related to afdc eligibility determination and one error in provider licensing the final report noted that the state has been able to successfully implement many of the practices described in the pip in iowa 22 cases were found ineligible during the initial primary review the majority of errors 15 resulted from inco rrect afdc eligibility determinations reviewers found that the eligibility form was difficult to follow and did not clearly identify childs eligibility based on income resources removal from the home of specified relative and deprivation of pa rental support the state also received 12 errors due to judicialrela ted problems on contrary to the welfare and reasonable efforts to prevent removal determinations and three errors for provider licensing issues in iowas secondary review seven cas were determined to be ineligible and the state was found to be compliant probl ems with judicial determination provisions resulted in five errors and two errors were cited for licensing documentation not being found in the file the review found errors due to afdc eligibility determinations in maine the initial primary review found 24 ineligible cases with 22 errors associated with provider licensing requireme nts three judicial determination errors and six errors related to afdc the majority of these errors were due to the lack of timely fire inspections in foster care facilities the state addressed this issue by working to improve communication with the fire marshalls office implementing tool to track licensing tasks and by increasing the term of foster home license from one to two years in the states fo llowup secondary review all cases reviewed had fire inspections up to date although the reviewers found three other licensing errors four errors because financial need or deprivation for afdc eligibility was not established and six errors relate d to judicial determinationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32836crs16 new jersey was found not compliant in its initial primary and secondary reviews in the initial primary review the predominant reasons for error were invalid or expired licenses of providers 33 rrors and problems with timely judicial determinations 17 errors the initial primary review report noted that the state relied on the issuance of temporary licenses which resulted in lapses in eligibility and that the content and language of cour t orders was not sufficient the state developed pip that incl uded certification of 3000 new foster homes hiring title ive specialists and improving provider certification record keeping and tracking systems in the secondary review the state had problem s meeting judicial requirements 48 errors specifically with the provision that agencies make and finalize permanency plan within 12 mont hs of the childs removal from the home which made up 22 of the 48 j udicialrelated errors the state also had 30 provider licensing errors and 19 afdc eligibility determination errors strengths and weaknesses found among states final reports for each of the states reviewed included section that identified strengths and weaknesses of state agency practice related to title ive eligibility determinations though these recommendations varied wi dely across states depending on the severity of compliance problems there were several points repeated by reviewers that highlight some trends many of the recommendations for im provement centered around appropriate paperwork and documentation in case files that substantiate timely judicial determinations current provider licensing and afdc eligibility requirements strengths organization of case files prep aration for review s and attention to detail when managing cases was strength for many states examples of these practices are efficient tracking of childre n and use of case narratives that contain documentation of specific services provided to families to prevent removal of the child from the home also the use of standard filing format separation of foster care eligibility files from the children and family files and collaborative teamwork preparing for reviews were noted as best practices in the area of provider licensing and safety strengths were found in clear documentation of criminal records background checks and certification of fost er family homesfacilitie s developing licensing checklist for files and use of software system to manage licensing renewals other examples of strengths included welldocumented title ive eligibility process and clear eligibility determination forms that show income eligibility and whether depriv ation of parental support ex ists reviewers noted that the design of title ive eligibility forms was helpful to the review and that well designed forms were important for facilitating compliance staff and management was also an area of strength for some states one of the most often noted strengths was that the agency had centralized staff whose exclusive function was the termination of title ive eligibility reviewers found that direct result of this specializa tion was more accurate and timely decisions regarding eligibility and redetermination of eligibility collaboration with the courts was an important component in the title ive eligibility pr ocess and reviewers highlighted strengths in this area training initiatives with judicial pers onnel completion of judges handbook developm ent of court incentives to hear cases timely and hiring court improvement project coordinator were strengths noted in reviews reviewers emphasized best prac tices in states where court orders werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32836crs17 child specific and well written the court syst em was responsive to foster care cases and court orders were desc riptive of case specific circumstances additionally some states established practices that assessed for judicial determinations more frequently than required by statute for example arizona completes voluntary placement determinations in 90 days as opposed to 180 days and california assesses permanency plan efforts ever six months instead of 12 weaknesses some of the strengths and weaknesses identified mirror each other but they also reveal points of empha sis by reviewers in the area of judicial determinations lack of child specific court orders was often cited as an area in need of improvement especially when states us ed form or check off type of order as evidence of judicial determinations re viewers recommended discontinuing the use of boiler plate court orders that do not reflect court decisions made for each child or adequate language related to judicial requi rements other examples are inappropriate use of longterm care as permanency goal and surpassing the 180day limit for voluntary placements across states obtaining timely determinations for permanency plans was frequent problem reviewer s recommended implementing tickler system to notify staff of the due date for the required court orders in states with licensing errors reviewers recommended the licensing bureau develop training for staff on acf title ive review processes it was problematic during reviews if the licensing staff were not available or did not participate in reviews to make clarifications or answer questions weaknesses also included the use of provisional licenses and lack of tracking process and organized record keeping to establish the licensing history of providers afdc eligibility was an area of weakness for few states especially for redetermination of title ive case eligibility reviewers often found that afdc linkages did not clearly identify the month that the eligibility determination was made lacked documentation of financial resources and had process in place for communicating to staff changes in family circumstances further trai ning of staff on afdc requi rements and centralization of eligibility determinations within the agency were recommendations given by reviewers in some states there was subs tantial variation among particular counties in the completeness of case histories reviewers emphasized better communication to make standards for handlin g federally eligible foster care
