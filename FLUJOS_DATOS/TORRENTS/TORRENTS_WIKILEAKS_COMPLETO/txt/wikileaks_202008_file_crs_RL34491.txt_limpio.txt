2008 megan suzanne lynch analyst on the congress and legislative process government and finance division unanimous consent agreements establishing 60vote threshold for passage of legislation in the senate summary the senate frequently enters into unanimous consent agreements sometimes referred to as uc agreements or time agreements that establish procedures for the consideration of legislation that the senate is considering or will soon consider in recent practice such unanimous consent agreements have sometimes included provision that would require 60vote threshold to be met for amendments or legislation to be considered agreed to rather than the simple majority ordinarily required these amendments or measures may be of controversial nature with the potential for causing filibuster by incorporating 60vote threshold such uc agreements avoid the multiple requirements imposed by senate rule xxii for invoking cloture while preserving the same requirement for supermajority support this report will be updated each session of congress contents introduction 1 function and effects of adopting 60vote requirement 1 language and recent increase in frequency 2 method and sources 3 list of tables table 1 identified senateadopted unanimous consent agreements establishing 60vote threshold for passage of legislation 19992008 4 unanimous consent agreements establishing 60vote threshold for passage of legislation in the senate introduction the senates emphasis on individual and minority rights reflected in both its standing rules and chamber custom1 can make it challenging for the chamber to achieve its various goals in timely manner for this reason the senate routinely chooses to set aside its standing rules by unanimous consent2 this is done formally through uc agreements which in many cases outline the terms under which specific legislation will be considered under recent practice these uc agreements sometimes include provision imposing 60vote requirement for approval of amendments or legislation instead of the simple majority vote3 ordinarily required in the senate4 these amendments or measures are sometimes of controversial nature with potential to be subjected to extended consideration or even filibuster by incorporating 60vote threshold such uc agreements avoid the multiple requirements associated with senate rule xxii both for invoking cloture and for consideration under cloture such uc agreements ensure that measure will not be successful without the same level of supermajority support that would be required for cloture by stipulating that if the 60vote threshold is not reached the matter will be disposed of as with all uc agreements once agreed to they can be altered only by the adoption of further uc agreement function and effects of adopting 60vote requirement several possible effects could result from the senate choosing to impose 60 vote threshold for the passage of legislation first for cases in which large majority 1 for

order postpone treaty consideration indefinitely and invoke cloture for information see crs report 98779 supermajority votes in the senate by walter oleszek crs2 of senators is in favor of or opposed to the question the time that would ordinarily be required to invoke cloture can be avoided once cloture petition has been submitted it must lay over until the second calendar day that the senate is in session before vote on cloture occurs for cloture vote to be successful in most cases threefifths of all senators must vote in the affirmative ie 60 votes if there are vacancies5 if the cloture vote is successful another 30 hours of consideration are in order before vote on the underlying business must occur incorporating the 60 vote threshold into uc agreement allows the senate to bypass these time consuming requirements second for cases in which large majority either in favor of or against the question cannot be assumed the 60vote threshold accomplishes the same purpose as filibuster by preventing or delaying passage but without requiring the senate to engage in extended debate thus surrendering the right to filibuster may be more palatable if senators are confident measure will not pass without supermajority support another reason that 60vote threshold might be included in uc agreement is that it presents senators with an opportunity to vote directly on the underlying policy issue votes on cloture often fail and consequently vote on the actual measure or amendment may never occur the 60vote threshold in uc agreement has the effect of bypassing the procedural vote to grant senators direct vote on the policy issue at hand lastly in many of these 60vote threshold uc agreements it is pair or group of amendments or measures that are jointly held to the 60vote requirement many of the pairs or groups are competing options for the same policy issue this allows the senate to debate and choose between contending alternatives in timely and controlled manner language and recent increase in frequency although examples of uc agreements placing similar 60vote threshold provisions can be found dating from at least the early 1990s the practice has increased in frequency over the last four years unanimous consent agreements that impose 60vote threshold may be agreed to at any time either in advance or during consideration it is notable that unlike senate rules requiring super majorities which typically are framed in terms of fraction either of the membership or those voting eg twothirds threefifths these uc agreements explicitly state the number of votes required given that practices do not generally specify disposition for question that achieves majority vote but not supermajority vote imposed by unanimous consent the language of these uc agreements typically provides for disposition of the amendment or measure if it fails 5 for amendments to the standing rules of the senate twothirds of senators present and voting must agree senate rule xxii for information on cloture see crs report 98425 invoking cloture in the senate by christopher m davis crs3 to achieve the required 60 votes typically the matter is withdrawn but it could alternately be laid on the table or returned to the calendar for example in one uc agreement the senate agreed that two amendments be subject to 60 affirmative vote threshold and that if neither achieves that threshold then it be withdrawn6 thus far in the 110th congress 20072008 30 amendments have been held to the 60vote threshold as result of provision in uc agreement seven were adopted 22 failed and one was withdrawn also in the 110th congress seven measures have been held to the 60vote threshold as result of uc agreement of these five passed and two failed lastly in the 110th congress two motions to concur with house amendments with senate amendment were held to the 60vote threshold by uc agreement one passed and one failed in the 109th congress 20052006 eight amendments were held to the 60vote threshold as result of provision in uc agreement of these six failed and two were ruled out of order also in the 109th congress three measures were held to the threshold all of which passed amendments or measures held to 60vote threshold as the result of uc agreement were identified in the 108th 20032004 107th 20012002 or 106th 19992000 congresses of the 50 amendments motions and measures held to the 60vote threshold since the 106th congress an additional 13 26 would have been successful had only simple majority been required for passage method and sources table 1 as of may 8 2008 shows all
