designed to eliminate any incentive for employers to cut retiree health benefits employers have frequently sought to trim the high cost of providing group health coverage for their workers by reducing retir ee benefits or narrowing the group of retirees eligible for coverage unde r one commonly used formula employers often provide one level of benefits to retirees under age 65 to cover them til they are eligible for medicare and then reduce or eliminate the benefit when the retiree becomes medicare eligible inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21845crs2 1 220 f3d 193 3d cir 2000 2 see eeoc age

different benefits to older and ounger retirees based on their eligibility for medicare constitutes age discr imination in violation of the adea because medicare eligibility is an explicitly agerelated factor in 2000 the equal employment opport unity commission eeoc adopted the courts reasoning as the agencys national enforcement policy but the commission later rescinded its position to further review the i ssue following two years of study the eeoc proposed rule in 2004 that would allow employersponsored retiree health plans to reduce or eliminate benefits for medicaree ligible retirees without violating the adea2 according to the eeoc since the adea requires only equal treatment employers threatened to comply with the adea not by raising benefits for older retirees but by reducing benefits to younger retirees or by eliminating all benefits for all retirees indeed the erie county case was settled by requiring younger retirees to pay higher premiums and move into an hmo plan in light of evidence that employers would equalize benefits by reducing them the eeoc sought in essence to undo the courts decision in erie county by issuing rule specifying that the practice of coordinating retirees health benefits would not violate the adea3 background the adea prohibits discrimination against workers over 40 years of age in compensation or with respect to employ ment terms conditions or privileges4 the acts legislative history contained statement of managers which suggested that the practice of coordinating retiree health plan s with medicare was not prohibited5 in erie county however the third circuit disregarded that ev idence of congressional intent when it ruled that providing inferior bene fits to medicareeligible re tirees than to younger retired workers may be illegal age discrimination it remanded the case for trial court determination of whether the pl an was saved by the equalbe nefit or equal cost provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21845crs3 6 29 usc

provide safe harbor for employers who pr ovide equal benefits to older and younger workers or who incur equal costs on behalf of each6 in the erie county case group of retirees who were over the age of 65 sued the county claiming that their retiree health prog ram was inferior to the program offered to younger retirees designed to supplement medi care benefits older re tirees were offered an hmo plan that coordinated all health care services through primary care physician the county provided former employees who we re not medicareeligible with hybrid point of service program that combined the features of an hmo with traditional indemnity plan the district court grante d partial summary judgment for the county holding that the adea was not intended to appl to retirees such as plaintiffs who based their age discrimination claim on disparities in health coverage arising from medicare eligibility in its reversal the third circu it found that age discrimination had occurred since the medical benefits for older retirees were based solely on their eligibility for medicare and medicare eligibility follo ws ineluctably upon attaining age 657 in reviewing the adea the third circuit concluded that an ag ebased disparity in retiree health benefits is only lawful if the pr ogram falls within safe harbor established by the equal benefitequal cost standard both the legislative history of the adea and the plain language of the safe harbor pr ovision indicated congresss intent that the section apply when an employer reduces health benefits on the basis of medicare eligibility in other words the county of erie could only prevail if it established that the benefits offered to medicare eligible retirees were equal to those provided to younger retirees or that its costs for providing benef its to the two groups were equal the third circuit remanded the case back to the trial c ourt which ultimately found that the countys plan was unlawful because 1 older retirees were required to pay greater percentage of their overall premium than were younger retirees and 2 younger retirees were given the option between hmo coverage or indemnity coverage while olde r retirees could only elect hmo coverage for these reasons the tr ial court concl uded that older retirees were provided inferior benefits in violation of adea8 the eeoc had initially supported the positi on adopted by the third circuit in erie county which the agency then incorporated in its compliance manual as part of its national enforcement policy on the adea in 2001 however after consulting various labor and employer groups the eeoc resci nded its policy regarding employersponsored retiree health plans announcing that it w ould study the issue further the eeoc study demonstrated considerable decline in th number of employers providing retiree health benefits in the decade preceding due to higher health care coverage costs the number of employees nearing retirement age and ch anges in accounting rules for retiree health benefits9 in addition it found that concern about the potential application of the adea to employersponsored retiree health benef its is adversely aff ecting the continued provision of this important retirement benefit in other words when faced with the prospect of equalizing benef its many employers were choos ing not to increase benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21845crs4 10 383 f

or to eliminate retiree benefits altogether indeed the erie county case resulted in settlement in which benefits were reduced for younger retirees ultimately th eeoc concluded that reversal of policy was required in the public interest to protect retiree health coverage as valuable benefit to olde r individuals and therefore the agency proposed to amend the eeocs adea regulations the eeocs proposed rule as proposed the eeoc rule would exempt from adea requirements the alteration reduction or elimination of employersponsor ed retiree health be nefits when retirees become eligible for medicare or other comparable state retiree health benefits the eeoc cited 9 of the adea which permits the eeoc to establish such reasonable exemptions to and from any or all provision of the act as it may find necessary and proper in the public interest as its aut hority for issuing the regulation noting that employers are not legally obligated to provide any retiree health benefits and arguing that the safe harbor provisions of the adea have become unworkable given the broad diversity of employer health plan options cu rrently available the eeoc indicated that the exemption provides necessary and proper incentive to employers not to eliminate all retiree health benefits nor to reduce the be nefits of younger re tirees to equal those provided to their medicar eeligible counterparts legal challenges to the proposed rule implementation of the proposed rule how ever was delayed in 2005 by federal district court in philadelphia that initially f ound the rule in conflict with the third circuit decision in the erie county case in aarp v eeoc 10 the court first ordered permanent injunction against enforcing the rule finding that it is contrary to congressional intent and the plain language of the age discrimination in employment act the eeoc according to the court has the power to issue rules regulations and exemptions within explicit or implicit gaps that congress left in the adea in the case of the challenged exemption however the third circuit held that congre ss did not allow for ambiguity with regard to the applicability of the adea to retiree health benefits in other words the court found that the eeo c was interpreting too broadly its powers to create exemptions to the adea the eeoc filed an appeal with the third circuit meanwhile the us supreme court decided national cable and telecommunications association v brand x internet services in 200511 the justices there ruled that federal court under the chevron doctrine12 is required to defer to an agencys interpretation of law even if its differs from the courts own views if the particular statute is within the agencys administrative authority if it is ambiguous on the point in contention and if the agencys interp retation is reasonable in other words thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21845crs5 13 aarp v eeoc 390 f supp 2d 437 d pa 2005 14 id at 448 15 489 f3d 558 3d cir 2007 16

leaving gaps for the agency decision to fill in view of brand x the eeoc moved the district cour t to reconsider whether prior judicial precedent foreclosed issuance of the proposed rule on retiree health benefits ultimately the district court reversed its earlier decision holding that the eeoc does indeed have the authority to issue the challenged regulation13 brand x makes it clear that where courts holding states merely the best interpretation of statute not the only pe rmissible interpretation the court decision does not foreclose later differing agency interpretation because the third circuits opinion in erie county did not hold that it was the only permissible interpretation of the adea it cannot fore close contrary interpretation by the eeoc14 despite the decision to vacate its earlier judgment the court left in place the injunction preventing implementation of the proposed eeo c rule pending the outcome of appeals that the parties filed with the third circuit in 2007 the third circuit issued its ruling in aarp v eeoc 15 although the appellate court affirmed the district courts decision uphol ding the eeocs retiree health benefit rule the third circu it reached its decision on different legal grounds specifically the court held that the proposed rule doe s fall within the eeocs exemption authority under 9 according to the court because t he power to grant exemptions provides an agency with authority to permit certain acti ons at variance with the express provisions of the statute in question congress made pl ain its intent to allow limited practices not otherwise permitted under the statute so long as they are reasonable and necessary and proper in the public interest16 finding that the retiree health benefit rule was reasonable necessary and proper exercise of the eeocs exemption authority under the adea the court upheld the rule and lifted the injunction llowing the final regulations to become effective on december 26 2007 when the eeoc published them in the federal register although the american association of retired persons aarp filed petition with the supreme court requesting re view of the third circuits decision the court recently declined to review the case17 the eeocs final rule the eeocs final rule contains na rrowly drawn exemption from the adea to permit the practice of coordinating employerprovided retiree health coverage with eligibility for medicare18 specifically employers may w ithout violating the adea alter reduce or eliminate health benefits for retirees when the participant becomes eligible for medicare or comparable state health benefits the eeoc emphasizes that the rule is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21845crs6 intended to encourage employers to eliminate any retiree health benefits they may currently provide the final regulations also include an appendix with questions and answers that provide the following specific guidance the exemption does not mean that the adea does not apply to retirees or that all forms of retiree health coverage are exempted only the specific practice of coordinating retiree health benefits with medicare or comparable state health plan is exempted from adea employers may offer to retirees med icare carve out plans under which medicare is primary and the employ er plan secondary for retirees but they may not offer such plans to active employees the exemption also applies to depende nt andor spousal health benefits included as part of retirees benef its although these may be altered reduced or eliminated even when the retirees are not other aspects of adea coverage or employment benefits other than retiree health benefits are affected by the exemption the exemption applies to existing as well as newly created employeehealth benefit plans the exemption does not apply to active employees over the age of medicare or state health plan eligibility conclusion as noted above the supreme court recently denied request to review the third circuits decision upholding the eeoc regula tion as result the eeocs new retiree health benefit rule has survived legal challenge and remains in effect
