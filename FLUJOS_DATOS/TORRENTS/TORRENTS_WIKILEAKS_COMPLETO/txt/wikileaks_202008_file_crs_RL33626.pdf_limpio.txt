they deserve an increase in the influence that they wield at the international monetary fund imf they point out that after years of sustained economic growth their representation does not reflect their current economic position in the world economy proposed changes would give these emerging economies as well as poor borrowers and countries that do not significantly contribute to funding imf operations greater say in order to enhance the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of the institution at the spring 2006 imf meetings imf managing di rector rodrigo rato presented loosely fleshed out proposal that would provide for twost ep process in the first step there would be socalled ad hoc quota increase that would immediately raise the representation of few select countries who it is commonly agreed are unde rrepresented at the fund and follow with fundamental reform of the imf quota system ratos reform agenda was approved by imf members at the fall 2006 imf meetings in singapore at the meetings imf members granted four countries quota increases china south korea turkey and mexico these adhoc increases are to be followed by additional reforms during the next two years fundamental reform ca n take several forms four options are 1 closer alignment between actual and existing quotas 2 revising the quota formulas 3 reorganizing the executive board and 4 increasing the number of basic votes these reform options are not mutually exclusive it is likely that any eventual reform may comprise aspects of several of the options discussed any potential reform however must enhance both the imfs relevance and credibility there is often tension between these two goals the imf is relevant precisely because it caters to the financial needs of the worlds neediest countries however it is credible only to the extent that it is financially sound and is able to fulfill its mission increasing the representation of devel oping countries may only be successful if it can be accomplished without damaging the credibility of the institution and sacrificing the imfs financial stability the bush administration has supported this proposal in testimony and speeches since 2006 administration officials explained that they are willing to support an adhoc increase for few countries but only if it is tied to fundamental reform of the imf governance system depending on which course of action imf members choose action may be required by the 110 th congress congress must give its consent by law before the united states may agree to participate in any new imf funding agreements that change the us quota require additional contributions from the united states amend the imf articles of agreement or dispose of any gold currently held by the imf this report will be

at the international monetary fund imf is linked roughly to the degree of financial support countries provide to the institution and their relative share of the world economy many developing countries have long argued that they deserve an increase in their representation on the grounds that after years of sustained economic growth their participation does not reflect their current economic position in the world economy proposed changes would give these emerging economies as well as borrowers and countries that do not contribute to funding imf operations greater say in order to enhance the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of the institution this in turn may enhance the ability of the fund to carry out its mission of international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability 1 the imf has introduced twostep reform process beginning with an ad hoc quota increase for few underrepresented emerging market countries china mexico south korea and turkey these increases are to be followed within the next two years by fundamental reform of the quota system quota reform is at the heart of the imf reform debate as quotas largely determine representation and voting rights as well as financial contributions however since quotas are fundamental to so many aspects of countrys re presentation at the imf any change is difficult politically some fastgrowing economies will gain voting power while others will lose an overwhelming consensus of all imf member nations is required for any quota reform to take effect the bush administration has expressed support for the twostep imf proposal fundamental reform of the imf quota and voting system could take variety of forms and several options are being considered congressional action may or may not be required depending upon which fundamental reform option if any is implemented the united states is the largest contributor to the imf and has the largest vote in the institution c ongress is responsible for authorizing and appropriating us contributions to the imf and must give its consent to any change in the size of the us quota although there are potential sc enarios where the bush administration would not need to seek congresss approval and there is current legislation addressing imf reform many of the imf reform proposals may likely require congressional authorization andor appropriations this report explains how countries are represented at the imf discusses the reform agenda analyzes various options to reform the quota system and evaluates the role of congress it will be updated as events warrant

each member is required to contribute to the fund 2 the amount of financing member may receive from the fund2 and 3 the amount of voting power each country has at the imf quotas are expressed as special drawing rights sdr3 total quotas at endseptember 2007 were sdr 2173 billion about 3383 billion countries contribute to the imf mainly in local currency since the currencies of many emerging market and developing countries are weak and not used by the imf to fund its operations only about 69 of the imfs total quota resources are deemed usable by the imf4 since the imfs founding it has been the stated intention of the imf to base quotas on various formulas that technically deduce countrys ability to contribute to the imf and its likelihood of drawing imf resources the imf periodically calculates country quotas based on these formulas in practice quotas have only been loosely guided by the calculated quotas and actual quotas are determined more by political negotiations among the member countries5 2 over time this linkage has weakened and several countries have been granted special access allowing them to borrow several times their imf quota argentina for example borrowed over five times its quota in 2002 in addition the poorest countries borrow from the imf under the funds concessional facility the poverty reduction and growth facility prgf the resources for the prgf do not come from quotas and are not restricted by any limits 3 special drawing rights sdr are the imfs unit of account initially defined as equivalent to 0888671 grams of fine gold the value of the sdr was switched to basket of in ternational currencies following the collapse of the bretton woods system of fixed parity exchange rates in 1973 the current basket includes the euro japanese yen the british pound sterling and the us dollar 4 see imfs financial resources and liquidity position 2004june 2006 the international monetary fund 2006 5 when the imf was created at the bretton woods conference there was debate between the united states represented by harry dexter white and the united kingdom represented by john maynard keynes over many aspects of the proposed institution both the white and keynes plans proposed fixing quotas on some type of formula that would determine countrys relative global economic standing and allocate an appropriate quota such formula could

found that the formula had only an indirect influence on actual quotas6 the study also found that the gap between actual and calculated quotas has persisted and thus actual imf quotas and subsequent voting power do not accurately reflect the current world economy since 1945 there have been 12 general quota reviews of these seven have led to an increase in the financial resources of the institution of the total quota increase since 1945 less than onethird has been based on the quota formula the remaining increase was general or equiproportional each country receiving an increase proportional to their existing share since quota reviews have maintained the status quo western europe the united states and the other dominant countries when the imf was created have benefitted while emerging countries specifically asia and other developing countries have quotas and voting power disproportionately low relative to their growing global economic weight g24g152g157g146g151g144g561 unlike the united nations general assembly which relies on oneperson onevote governance system the imf uses weighted voted system th imfs founders agreed that the voting system should combine elements of the onecountry onevote principle with proportional voting depending on contribution levels the voting system adopted at bretton woods give 250 votes automatically to every country basic votes and one additional vote for each 100000 of quota over time as the size of the imfs quota increased while the number of basic votes stayed the same basic votes have become marginal component of the total number of votes down to 21 from 113 initially many analysts agree that an fundamental reform would require an increase in the number of basic votes 7 continued include consideration of countrys reserves of gold and foreign currencies magnitude of its balance of payments national income population or any other of host of economic indicators very quickly into the negotiations it was clear that formula would determine quota system that would please all of the 44 new imf member nations moreover by the time of the bretton woods conference the united states great britain and the other major donors had reached agreement on the total capitalization of the new institution and their contributions thus the united states and the other contributor nations determined the final quota structure through negotiations and then backed into formula to give the desired result explaining how he came up with the quota formula raymond mikesell an advisor to the us delegation at bretton woods r ecalled i had anticipated this request and gave rambling twentyminute seminar on the factors taken in calculating the quotas but i did not reveal the formula i tried to make the process appear as scientific as possible but the delegates were in telligent enough to know that the process was more political than scientific since then the quota formula has been formalized and expanded several times to include additional variables however the quota formulas are only used as guide for quota reviews see raymond f mikesell the bretton woods debates memoir princeton university essays in international finance 192 march 1994 pp 3539 6 external review of quota formulas international monetary fund 2000 7 at the bretton woods conference the british proposed simple voting structure where each c ountry would have direct vote in proportion to their quota mr white however was concerned that such system would give the united states and great britain too much control over the institution on the other hand he noted that to give all countries equal representation would be equally problematic since the resources were not contributed equally mr white proposed mixed system that combined elements of the onecountry onevote system and proportional system mr white proposed that each country be given 100 basic votes plus an additional vote for each million dollars of quota mr white and lord keynes agreed on the mixedvoting system however they compromised on system that gave significantly less voting power to small countries than mr whites original proposal since countries r eceive one vote for each 100000 of quota rather than mr whites original proposal of one vote for each 1 million of quota

uses voting system where the executive directors eds can represent either single country or several countries grouped in mixedstate constituencies box 2 result of this constituency system is significant power as ymmetry among members on the board moreover the distribution of voting strength among eds has become more unequal over time the minimum voting power that the imf allows each ed to hold dropped to 40 in 2005 in practice however this rule is waived and 15 eds each have fewer than 40 of the institutions votes the two eds that represent 43 african countries wield 30 and 14 of the imfs votes respectively by contrast the us ed holds 17 of the vote and the four other largest contributors having voting power ranging between 5 and 6 bo x 2 the ex ecutive board and mix edstate

constituencies is not equivalent to their quotadetermined voting weight since they vote in constituencies very small countries can easily be sidestepped by the larger countries in the constituency 8 for many countries at the imf they can at best express divergent opinion orally but cannot bring it to bear in the form of vote9 executive directors must cast their votes as single unit even though some of the countries they represent may disagree with their position of the 16 mixedstate constituencies five have country with majority of the total votes and three have countries that control over 40 of the total vote appendix ranks the largest member of each constituency and their percentage of the total votes within their constituency the imfs articles of agreement set the various thresholds required for imf decisions the majority of imf decisions require 50 majority vote however some special matters changes in the articles of agreement or approval of ne w quota increases for example require an 85 affirmative vote since the us vote exceeds 15 quota increases amendments or other major actions can go into effect without us consent the same can be said for other major blocks of imf member countries principally european countries 10 8 for example guatemala has an 011 voting share at the imf based on its quota however guatemala never actually independently votes at the imf on this percentage as part of constituency led by mexico and also including costa rica salvador honduras nicaragua spain and venezuela guatemala shares one executive director on the executive board who currently wields 92989 votes or 43 within its constituency guatemala has 25 of the total votes spain has 331 of the intraconstituency votes venezuela has 289 and mexico has 281 within this

executive board there is very strong institutional aversion to formal voting executive board rule c10 states that the chairman managing director shall ordinarily ascertain the sense of the meeting in lieu of formal vote11 since the united states or combination of european countries could block most policy issues if they were to actually come up to vote it is difficult to determine how true an executive board consensus often is thus if it appears that the united states or other large quota holders does not support policy issue requiring 70 or 85 approval it will never come to vote and there will be formal record of us dissent this may have the effect of stifling debate on the executive board

the world has changed dramatically since the imf was founded established in 1946 with membership of 46 countries the imf now includes 185 countries and oversees vastly different world economy with new distribution of economic power unlike in 1946 emerging market economies primarily in asia and latin america play vibrant and crucial role in the world economy however the distribution of quota and voting power at the imf has changed very little to reflect these changes the imfs response to the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s highlighted the lack of representation of many key emerging market economies in imf decisionmaking many countries believe that the imfs response was heavyhanded and exacerbated the crisis 12 discontent with the imf has had tangible effects on the funds operations and spurred reform efforts several major borrowers have taken advantage of the benign economic conditions beginning in 2003 to prepay their imf loans in 2003 thailand paid off its imf debts two years early in 2004 russia prepaid 33 billion to the imf in 2005 argentina and brazil both paid their remaining imf debt early these early payments significantly reduce the imfs lending activities to middleincome countries primary source of income for the imf in addition to removing themselves from imf lending some member countries are also creating alternative institutions to the imf under the chiang mai initiative several asian countries are seeking to insulate themselves from the imf by accumulating large foreign exchange reserves to remove any potential need to seek imf lending if they run into difficulties with their international financial relations 13 the chiang mai initiative is in direct response to the perceived mishandling by the imf of the east asian financial crisis in the late 1990s if developing countries continue to withdraw from imf lending and its sphere of influence the financial future of the institution may continued block any governance reforms if they voted together 11 see miles kahler leadership selection in the major multilaterals institute for international economics 2001 p 23 12 see crs report rl30517 asian financial crisis and recovery status and

the need for governance reform in his 2005 midterm strategic review presented to imf members at the fall 2005 annual meetings15 in the report rato wrote fair weight and voice are crucial to the legitimacy of universal institution the current allocation puts this legitimacy at risk in many regions for example in africa where the fund is heavily engaged and in asia whose place in the world economy has grown far more than its role in the fund16 at the spring 2006 meetings rato presented loosely fleshed out reform proposal that would consist of twostep process in the first step there would be socalled ad hoc increase that would immediately raise the representation of few select countries that are commonly viewed as underrepresented at the fund this adhoc increase would be followed in the next two years by more fundamental reforms of the imf governance framework imf member countries endorsed the rato proposal at the spring meetings the communiquÃ© released at the meetings by the imfs international monetary and finance committee imfc 17 reiterated the theme raised by managing director rato the imfs effectiveness and credibility as cooperative institution must be safeguarded and its governance further enhanced emphasizing the importance of fair voice and representation for all members 18 the communiquÃ© went on to call upon the imf to work with the imfc and the imfs executive board to come up with concrete proposals for fundamental reform of the system by which countries are represented at the imf19 at the fall 2006 meetings the imf won approval for more detailed reform proposal beginning with small quota increases for china mexico turkey and south korea following this increase the imf will work during the next two years to adjust imf quotas through new quota formula second round of ad hoc increases and increases in the number of basic votes available to all countries there was some resistance to the proposal at the meetings from other emerging economies including brazil india and argentina these countries among others opposed the initial ad hoc increase arguing that reforms should be adopted for all developing countries simultaneously 20 14 see

developing countries into the global economy and its main international institutions in his statement at the spring 2006 imf meetings thenus treasury secretary john snow told fellow imf members that the united states strongly supports the efforts to realign quotas and board representation at the imf in order to reflect changes in the global economy 22 the administration hopes that this ad hoc quota increase will act as spur for broader imf gove rnance reform within the next two years moreover the administration would like to give china greater say at the imf as an incentive for them to revalue its currency the yuan23 timothy adams is quoted as saying if were going to give china or any other country greater weight in the imf then they need to take their responsibilities in that institution seriously and they need to play by the rules as theyre laid out24 however giving china substantial increase in quota may upset several members of congress who wish to see china appreciate the va lue of its currency prior to their gaining any additional representation at the imf25 finally the bush administration wants to see the imf executive board better reflect the imfs full

legitimacy and effectiveness we are only willing to support limited ad hoc quota increase at the imf annual meetings in singapore if it is credibly linked to second step that delivers fundamental reform emphasis added31 as noted earlier imf members agreed to an ad hoc quota increase for china mexico south korea and turkey at the fall 2006 imf meetings this ad hoc increase does not require amending the imf articles of agreement and does not lead to european countries or any other country losing any quota though it marginally reduces their quota share however an ad hoc increase does not address the broader concerns affecting the majority of developing countries at the imf anne krueger imf first deputy director speaking in tokyo on june 6 2006 argued that such an ad hoc increase by itself would be insufficient to meet the reform goals expressed by imf members especially the asian countries that appear to be turning away from the imf in her remarks deputy director krueger argued that to ensure that asias emerging economies engage further with the imf and support stronger imf role in the global economy new system needs to be devised that better allocates quota representation of the executive board and overall votes based on some measure of countrys economic size 32 g8g158g151g141g138g150g142g151g157g138g149g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 at

one option to boost the quota for emerging countries could be to move towards closer alignment between calculated and actual quotas the imf periodically calculates quotas based on set of formulas to determine countrys economic weight and likelihood of needing imf assistance33 these calculated quotas are supposed to guide imf quota determinations in practice these quota formulas have only loosely guided actual quotas which have been decided more through political negotiations large gap exists between the calculated and actual quotas and thus one proposal has been to move closer toward the calculated quotas such realignment could occur during general quota review the imf will conclude its 13th general quota review in 2008 and could use general increase to closer align quotas with their calculated rates if approved by all national governments and the necessary national legislatures this would succeed in boosting the quota share of many emerging countries however the increased quota

desire for new set of formulas that closely links countrys imf quota and vote with their gdp secretary snow reiterated this point in his house testimony fundamental reform must include revising the imfs quota formulas with gdp as the predominant variable administration officials note however that quotas of the poorest countries should not be decreased likely result if there is greater reliance on gdp for determining quotas the bush administration and most other developed countries agree that it is appropriate to overrepresent the very poorest countries by giving them larger quota and vote than what would be inferred from their gdp in the current set of quota formulas gdp has low percentage of weighting while economic openness is highly weighted result of this is to give small economically open european countries such as belgium and the netherlands large quota these formulas have guided imf quota allocations since 1983 and have not been significantly changed since in 1999 the imf convened an independent working group to discuss options to simplify the imf quota formulas chaired by harvard economics professor robert cooper the quota formula review group qfrg evaluated th history of imf quotas after analyzing various options the group recommended single formula with two variables measure of the ability to contribute to the imf gdp and measure of external economic vulnerability variability of current receipts and longterm capital flow 35 following the review imf executive board members agreed with the need to simplify the imf formula but were concerned that the qfrg formula would lead to an even greater concentration of imf quotas among the large industrialized countries36 significant action was taken an alternative proposal has been put forward by the g24 group of countries currently the gdp figures used by the imf for the quota calculations are calculated at market rates averaged over several years the g24 however proposes that the imf move to purchasing power parity ppp based gdp measure in the g24s view marketbased exchange rates do not equalize prices across countries and thus understate developing countries gdps37 on the other hand others including the imf believe that market based exchange rates represent the actual cost of transferring goods between countries and that using pppbased calculations which equate the relative prices of goods regardless of location to calculate gdp would inaccurately estimate countrys ability to contribute to the imf as well as its relative role in the world economy and possible need for imf assistance prices of goods are often lower in developing countries which may allow nominal exchange rates to underestimate the size of their economy however in many cases prices in these emerging economies china for example are significantly distorted by government subsidies and price controls shifting to pppbased gdp measure would imply major differences if the gdp measure became the dominant determinant of imf quota shares table 2 shows gdp measures for several countries in ppp and marketbased figures moving to pppbased measure would significantly increase emerging market countries quota

india and brazil the quota reform working group discussed whether to measure gdp at current dollar rates or based on ppp and their debate highlighted the issues raised by moving to pppbased measure minority of the qfrg members supported moving to pppbased rate arguing that market exchange rates do not necessarily equalize prices of tradable goods across countries even after allowing for quality and transport costs the majority of the group however favored the continued use of marketbased rates this is also the prevailing view among the imfs industrialized countries the majority members of the qfrg noted that there are significant data problems with pppbased rates pppbased rates are not available for all imf members and many of those available are based on fragmentary data the qfrg minority also reiterated that it is necessary to consider the cost of actually moving goods from one place to another market prices properly reflect these costs while pppbased equate prices of goods regardless of the transportation costs although these costs are decreasing using pppbased measures gives according to the qfrg seriously misleading indicator of ability to contribute to international undertakings there is current agreement on what proper quota formula would be leo van houtvan longterm secretary of the imf and counselor to the managing director wrote in 2002 there is quota formula that is sensible from financial perspective and that would also solve the governance issue 38 although the suggestion of the qfrg to use formula comprised of gdp variability of current receipts and longterm capital flow was not acted on by the executive board imf members agreed with the qfrg that simpler more transparent formula would be beneficial for successfully guiding quota allocations other possible variables that could be included in such formula are official reserves current payments ratio of exports to gdp per capita income or population external debt share of food and energy in imports access to capital markets and variability of exchange rates 38 leo van houtvan governance of the imf decision making institutional oversight transparency and accountability international

proposal for improving developing countries representation at the imf is reorganizing the executive board quota reform is important from fundamental framework since it determines the voting share of each member country however for the vast majority of imf members since the imf operates on the basis of consensus among the 24 eds executive board realignment may likely be the more effective reform for boosting developing countries representation and participation currently the power asymmetry on the executive board is vast in its current configuration eight countries hold single seats on the board and control 48 of the vote the remaining 164 countries are grouped into 16 mixedstate constituencies the most powerful of these has 513 of the imf vote and the weakest has 141 the latter represents 24 poor african countries many of whom have programs with the imf in addition to having marginal vote in greater imf discussions this situation raises capability issues many analysts have raised concerns that it is difficult for one executive director to successfully represent the diverse interests and needs of 24 often imfdependent countries in this situation where many countries are spoken for by few executive directors the voice of many countries likely suffers reshaping the executive board may prove difficult since european countries have the largest and most widely dispersed representation any reform will likely be impossible without strong european support in march 2006 the european parliament released resolution on the strategic review of the imf the resolution supported the idea of moving toward single voting constituency for the eu but practical guidelines were offered originally the document was to propose increasing the basic votes of all members and devising some form of mechanism to increase the shares for the poorest developing countries 39 however both of these suggestions were removed from the final text40 it is unclear to what extent european countries are willing to consolidate their representation although the adhoc increased was achieved with only small decrease in european representation fundamental secondstage reform would likely require much more sustained coordination among europeans to rationalize their representation it has been argued that the legal political and institutional climate in europe may not facilitate moving toward single eu seat 41 eu governments have mechanism for coordinating their policies on realtime basis without relinquishing authority to the european commission or some other function of the eu bureaucracy the legislatures of the eu countries that provide funds to the imf may not wish to cede their policy choices from national control depending on how executive board reform occurs congressional action may or may not be required if imf members agree on voluntary shuffling of countries between the existing constituencies formal authorization from the us congress would be needed were this to occur and european countries were less dispersed among the multiple executive board constituencies than they currently are eu countries may have vote on the imf executive board much larger than the us vote further reform by consolidating several eu countries into single imf executive board seat however would likely in volve congressional authorization as it would 39 this could be in the form of trust fund set up to help finance the purchase of quota shares for poor countries 40 both documents are available at httpwwwglobalpolicyorgsoceconbwiwtoimf20060323euapprovedhtm 41

on july 31 2006 managing director rato said that to protect the voice and vote of the poorest countries he would like to see an increase in the number of basic votes allocated to all countries regardless of quota size42 the us government has stated that it could consider such an increase in basic votes as part of the overall imf reform package 43 as figure 1 illustrates basic votes as percentage of total votes has decreased substantially since the imf was created even as the number of imf member countries each receiving basic votes has increased figur 1 imf basic v otes source int

require amending the imf articles of agreement difficult process requiring broad level of support in the institution and approval by legislators increasing the number of basic votes has been discussed during the past several quota reviews one possible way to increase basic votes would be fixed increase giving the same amount of votes to each country basic votes could be reset at the original level

its oversight role to shape us policy at the institution on many occasions c ongress has enacted legislation specifying what us policy shall be in the international financial institutions ifis and how the us executive directors at these institutions shall vote and the objectives they shall pursue45 congress has also used increases in us funding for the imf and the multilateral development banks

thirteenth general review of imf resources the imfs articles of agreement require that the imf review its financial resources at least every five years although it is not required that the imf seek to raise additional capital from its members every five years the last quota increase was in 1998 quota increases have been way for countries to adjust quotas and votes among imf members like the 1998 quota increase which sparked vibrant discussion within congress on the role and value of the imf if the administration proposes quota increase for the united states or puts forward reform proposal

if it can be accomplished without damaging the credibility of the institution and sacrificing the imfs financial stability for the fund to maintain its credibility as the primary international financial institution the industrialized creditor countries will likely need to maintain their dominance in the institution moreover to increase the vote of the poorest developing countries would require increasing their quota it is not clear whether many of these countries can afford and are willing to increase their financial contributions or to take steps that would make their national currencies usable in imf operations any resolution of the governance issu will thus be political compromise that balances the financial needs of the institution with distribution of votes and
