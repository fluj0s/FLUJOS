huge reversals for the incumbent ndaallied telu gu desam party of the andhra pradesh state as well as for the bjp which fe ll from 181 seats in parliament to only 138 were seen by many as evidence

become key point of criticism for these groups and it is likely that her decision to pass on the prime ministership was in part result of her not wanting to become subject of c ontroversy as hindu nationalist groups had threatened to launch nationwide pr otest campaign if she took the prime ministership it also is widely held that gandhis action was driven by perceived interest in establishing

volunteer force responsible for the outbreaks of serious communal violence in which mosque was destroyed at ayodhya and so 3000 people were k illed in antimuslim rioting in bombay and elsewhere while in power the bjp worked with limited success to change its image from right wing hindu nationalist to conservative and moderate though anti muslim riots in bjprun gujarat in early 2002 again damaged the partys national and international credentials in general terms the bjp has comp rised moderate wing focused on governance and development and hardlin wing more concerned with emotive issues related to hindu nationalism former pm atal vajpayee is viewed as the leading moderate while former deputy pm and current bjp parliamentary leader lal advani fronts the hardline faction dvani who steered the bjps 2004 electoral strategy has widely been viewed as hei rapparent to vajpayee but advanis close ties to the rss and vishwa hindu parishad vhp or world hindu council and past involvement in communal c onflict especially the 1992 struction of the babri mosque and ensuing violence have deni ed him the widespread popularity enjoyed by vajpayee12 because the bjp did not play th hindutva card in recent state elections its impressive december 2003 victor ies in three of four contested states were viewed as triumph of the politics of development associated with vajpayee still national election results were widely viewed as serious blow to the hindu nationalist project13 bjp leaders attributed their setback to complacency and overconfidence hindu nationalists blamed the ndas defeat on an alleged betrayal of the hindutva cause by the bjp one top leader called for the creation of new party to look after the interest of hindus bjp lead ers such as advani equate hindutva with
