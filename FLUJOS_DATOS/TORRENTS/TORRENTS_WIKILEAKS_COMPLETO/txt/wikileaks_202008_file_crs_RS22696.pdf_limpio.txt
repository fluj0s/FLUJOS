anticompetitive conduct simply because federal agency has jurisdiction over the activities of one or more of the defendants gordon v new york stock ex change 422 us 659 692 1975 justice stewart concurringbackground from an antitrust perspective the basic antitrust law is section 1 of the sherman act 15 usc 1 which prohibits contracts and conspiracies in restraint of trade although most alleged restraints ar analyzed pursuant to the rule of reason1 some categories of anticompetitive activity eg price fixing joint refusals to deal tying the purchase of desired commodity to the purch ase of lessdesired commodity have over the years been deemed automatically to violate section 1 as per offenses because the effect and purpose of the practice are to threaten the proper operation of predominantly freemarket economy2 as the antitrust laws are not industryspecific whether an entity is subject to the strictures of the antitrust laws depends on whether and under what circumstances congress has specifi cally exempted an industry or activity3 where congress has been silent however the courts have created the doctrine of implied immunity to cover situations in which the application of the antitrust laws would be contrary to an expressed public policy or could subject entities to possibly conflicting mandates the supreme court has been generally unreceptive to arguments in favor of implied antitrust immunity ie that inferred with respect to member of regulated industry from the mere fact that congress has given re gulatory jurisdiction over an industry to federal agency4 or with respect to those actin g in purported furtherance of congressional statute from the mere existe nce of the legislative pronouncement except in instances where there is plain re pugnance between the antitrust laws and the regulatory scheme or statutorily expresse d preference as the court put it in silver v new york stock exchange the problem arises from the need to reconcile pursuit of the antitrust aim of eliminating restraints on competition with the effective operation of public policy contemplating certain activity which may well have anticompetitive effects in

practice at issue was the exchanges disconnection of brokers private wire service which service he alleged was critical to his ability to profitably do business because the cour t found the manner in which th exchange and its members carried out their collective refusal to deal to be fundamentally unfair5 it decided that the exchange had plainl exceeded the scope of its authority under the securities exchange act to engage in selfregulation and had not even reached the threshold of justification under that stat ute for what would otherwise be an antitrust violation6 moreover since the sec could exercise re gulatory supervision over the application of the exchange rules that permitted or re quired wireservice ter mination there was potential for conflict between the securities regulatory scheme and enforcement of the antitrust laws therefore implied immunity was not available and the actions were amenable to prosecution under 1 of the sherman act 15 usc 1 gordon v new york stock exchange7 involved an antitrust challenge to the system of fixed commission rates for securities tr ansactions of less than 500000 there b ecause there had been time when the antitrust law had forbidden the very thing that the securities law had then permitted namely an anticompetitive rate setting process8 the court determined that immunity was required in order to make the securities market scheme and the secs specifically authorized supervision of stock exchange commission rates work as the court explained to deny antitrust immunity with respect to commission rates would be to subject the exchanges and their members to conflicting standards 422 us at 689 the third major supreme court securitiesantitrust decision was us v national association of securities dealers nasd 9 in that instance the court looked at challenged price restrictions imposed on th sale and transfer of mutual fund shares in the secondary market ie the market for transactions occurring after the initial sale of the shares it concluded that because the purpose of the investment company act was to restrict most of secondary market trading10 it had to reject the governments tooliteral reading of the applicable section of the act and find instead that the agreements in question were immune as among the kinds of restri ctions congress contemplated when it enacted that section11 moreover even though

comprehensive body of securities regulation statutes in cluding the securities act of 1933 15 usc 77a et seq and the securities exchange act of 1934 15 usc 78a et seq the typical manner in which inves tment securities are offered to the public first involves underwriting services offered by an underwriting firm to an issuer of securities the most common delivery of those services has been said to be by firm commitment agreements12 in such an agreement the underwriter agrees that on fixed date the issuer will be given certain amount of money for certain amount of its securities such an agreement removes the uncertainty of an early cash infusion for the issuer and transfers the risk of selling the issue to the underwriter in the first half of the twentieth century syndicates consisting of few to many underwriting firms emerged to manage many of the risks th at underwriters assume syndicate often buys the entire new issue of the securities at fixed price and then reoffers it to the public at somewhat higher predetermined price the price difference is in effect kind of commission for the syndicate these principal underwriters often contact other brokers or underwriters who act as wholesaler s of the securities the issuer and the underwriters often agree on the size and the pricing of the offering credit suisse securities v billing13 credit suisse gave the court the

2394 2395 22 id at 2395at first glance this system of agreement by the issuer and all of the major underwriters of size and pricing of the offering does app ear in fact to be antitrustviolative price manipulation however not ll underwriter manipulations ve been prohibited little price manipulation has been permitted in order to further appropriate market goals15 the securities and exchange commission has traditionally recognized certain types of manipulative activities consider ed stabilizing activities as permissible under section 9a6 of the securities exchange act16 and sec rule 10b117 in fact the court itself indicated that the complaint was an attack not on the existence of the secapproved joint ipo activity but rather the abuse of that activity18 the court in an opinion authored by justice breyer began its analysis of the availability of implied antitrust immunity in this instance by noting that all of the challenged activities meet the basic prerequisite for implied antitrust immunity in the regulated securities industry they are central to the proper functioni ng of wellregulated capital markets further the sec has and has exercised its specific authority to supervise those activities moreover injured investor s are specifically authorized to recover damages and have successfu lly sued under the securities statutes for violation of applicable sec regulations f or conduct virtually identical to the conduct at issue here19 further the court observed the challenged pr actices all seemed to describe conditions that the investors apparently were willing to accept in order to obtain an allocation of new shares that were in high demand20 continuing the opinion noted the various ly nuanced sec decisions concerning eg commissions and future sales nd laddering the court obser ving that it would often be difficult for someone who is not familiar with accepted syndicate practices to distinguish what is forbidden from what is allowed the more so because evidence tending to show unlawful antitrust activity and evidence tending to show lawful secu rities marketing activity may overlap21 further since antitrust challenges to securitiesmarketing activities could be brought throughout the nation in dozens of different courts w ith different nonexpert judges22 the decision to defer to the secs expertise seemed only logical we believe it fair to conclude that where conduct at the core or the marketing of new securities is at issue where securities regula tors proceed with great care to distinguish the encouraged and permissible from the fo rbidden where the threat to antitrust lawsuits through error and disincentiv could seriously alter underwriter c onduct inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22696crs6 23 id at 2397 24 15 usc 77pa 78bba noted at

offense produce trinko like result verizon communications inc v trinko 540 us 398 2004 is controversial decision in which the court f ound that the existence of an antitrust savings clause in the telecommunications act of 1996 did not serve to create an antitrust action where cause of action would have existed but for breach of obligation under the 1996 telecommunications act ie even if the savings clauses were found to allow for antitrust actions and remedies proposition the court notes was unsuccessfully argued by the united states as amicus in gordon id at 2392 there is antitrust offense described in the complaint that would trigger the use of the antitrust statutes undesirable ways to allow an antitrust laws uit would threaten serious harm to the efficient functioning of the securities markets 127 sct at 2396 given 1 congresss expressed concern that securities markets become and remain stable 2 the continued oversig ht and actions of single ex pert regulatory agency versus the probability of diverse and possibly conflicting decisions by nonexpert judges in the event of securitiesantitrust lawsuits and 3 the likeli hood of conflict between the mandates of antitrust w and allowable activities under the securities laws the court found that the securities laws are clearly incompatible with the application of the antitrust laws23 accordingly implied immunity from prosecution under the antitrust laws is accorded to participants in securities markets justice stevens concurred parately to emphasize that in his opinion neither the incompatib ility between the antitrust and securities laws nor the question of implied antitrust immunity for regulated tities should have been the issue in my view agreements among underwriters on how best to market ipos including agreements on price and other terms of sale to initial investors should be treated as procompetitive joint ventures for purposes of antitrust analysis in all but the rarest of cases they cannot be conspiracies in restrain t of trade within the meaning of 1 of the sherman act 127 sct at 2398 justice thomass dissent found fault with th courts assertion that the securities acts were silent on whether the antitrust laws shoul d be applicable to entities in the securities industry he noted that both the securitie s act of 1933 and the securities and exchange act of 1934 state in savings clauses that th eir remedies shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity24 therefore both statutes explicitly save the very remedies the court holds to be impliedly precluded 127 sct at 239925
