the budget documents provided by the office of management and budget and the appropriations bills do not necessarily follow the same organization of accounts for example not all of the agencies which are organizationally within the executive office of the president as found in the budget are funded through the treasury postal service and general government appropriations legislation also the fy2001 and fy2000 individual account data in this report do not reflect scorekeeping by the congressional budget office see the glossary for definitions of discretionary and mandatory spending in some instances the mandatory levels drive up the percent of increase represented in the appropriation the appropriators are bound by those entitlements under permanent law and control only the discretionary spending levels the data in the tables and the funding levels provided in the text unless otherwise noted reflect the mandatory and discretionary funding combined fte or fulltime equivalent is budgetary term and does not represent the number of personnel employed by or the number of actual positions allowed in department or agency the fte number is calculated by dividing the

of people working in the organization during the course of the year are two entirely different statistical results seasonal employment and parttime employment are two factors which serve to make the

customs uses to track control and process all commercial goods imported into the united states has proven inadequate and has suffered from brownouts that inhibit international commerce earlier in the year gao testified that the current import processes handled by acs are paperintensive errorprone and transaction based and out of step with justintime inventory practices of the trade community32 since 1994 congress appropriated large infusions of funding for customs to upgrade acs and continue development of its replacement the automated commercial environment ace but customs has struggled with the upkeep of acs and the development of ace in the fy2000 conference report congress directed customs to provide revised blueprint schedule and budget for ace this report was delivered to the appropriations committees but late in the fiscal year for fy2001 the administrations request included new customs budget account for automation modernization for which the administration requested 338 million to offset the ace developmental costs the administration requested authorization for new user fee that was similar to fee proposal rejected by congress in the fy2000 appropriations cycle of this amount 123 million was requested for the continued operation and maintenance of acs 5 million for the international trade data system itds and 210 million for the development of ace once again congress rejected the fee proposal instead congress provided over 258 million in direct appropriation which includes 5 million to continue the development of the itds and at least 130 million to continue the development of ace it was reported in government executive magazine that the development operation and maintenance of ace over 7 years will cost between 14 and 18 billion and that customs would begin taking bids to develop the new system in fy200133 gao has also testified that customs had taken deliberate steps to implement recommendations made in previous audits by reducing duplication of effort developing an enterprise systems architecture and improving acquisition and investment management gao cautioned however that the development of ace is complex and highrisk endeavor that supports the agencys ability to collect billions of dollars in revenue generated by imports in addition to appropriated funding customs generates offsetting receipts from two user fee programs the first fee program consists of seven conveyance and passengerrelated user fees established by the 1985 consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra and the user fee for processing bulk cargo from mexicohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30502crs16 and canada established by the 1986 tax reform act the second fee program consists of the commercerelated merchandise processing fee mpf established by the 1986 omnibus budget reconcil iation act obra customs generally has control over the allocation of mpf fee receipts cobra fee receipts on the other hand are not appropriated for obligation by congress and they account for substantial portion of funding available to customs for expenditure each year from fy1992 to fy2000 cobra fee receipts have increased from about 176000000 to 299000000 there are codified limitations on the use of cobra fee receipts and initially they were used principally to pay overtime costs for inspectors and canine enforcement officers surplus revenues could be and were carried over from one year to the next such carryover could be and is used to fund recurring costs in positions and equipment from previous years as result cobra fee receipts have funded an increasing share of permanent inspector positions and information technology costs in recent months however there have been reports of dropoff in air passenger processing fee receipts consequently the growing reliance on cobra fee receipts to fund base positions in conjunction with dropoff in receipts may prove problematic in the coming year as customs may not have allocated enough to pay overtime for customs officers it is also notable that the authorization for the cobra fees expires at the end of fy2003 internal revenue service irs the fy2001 request for irs was 8986084000 the request represented 936 increase over the net funding for fy2000 of 8216489000 the net funding takes into account the 038 rescission in the irs processing assistance and management account required by congress in the consolidated funding act the request for that account was 1278 higher than the net funding for fy2000 the irs budget increases focus on maintaining current

automatically unless there is language denying it and hr 4516 is silent on the issue see federal pay belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30502crs42 federal personnel issues pay general under the federal pay comparability act of 1990 fepca federal white collar employees paid under the general schedule and related salary systems are to receive annual adjustments based on two separate mechanisms the first is the adjustment to base pay which is based on changes in private sector salaries as reflected in the employment cost index eci the rate of pay adjustment is supposed to be the percentage rate of change in that element of the eci minus 5 for january 2001 the base pay adjustment should be 27 at this time there are legislative proposals to change that rate since the president sent alternative plan to congress by the end of august the base pay adjustment will be 27 since the budget recommendation is for 37 and since the assumption in this legislation is that the programs are funded to accommodate that rate it follows that the second tier of the adjustment would be 1 localitybased payments are calculated based on the results of surveys of occupations in specific localities within the continental united states see discussion under opm above with regard to the designation of those localities the surveys show that localitybased payments would have to average about 16 in order to meet the expectations of fepca on december 1 2000 president clinton sent an alternative plan to congress which provides that locality payments equal 1 of payroll federal wage system the federal wage system fws is designed to compensate the federal blue collar or skilled labor force at rates prevailing in local wage areas for like occupations if the statutory system were allowed to be managed as planned the wage rates and the rates of adjustment in the over 130 wage areas would vary according to the labor costs and compensation in the private sector for the last several years congress has limited the rates of adjustment based on the rates of adjustment for the general schedule part of the rationale for that decision is that in certain high costs areas the some fws wages would exceed the salaries paid to general schedule supervisors section 613 of the fy2001 appropriations continues the limitation wages in lower cost areas will be allowed to increase according to the findings of the wage surveys but the high cost area wages will be capped members of congress judges and other officials under the ethics reform act of 1989 as amended pay adjustments for federal officials including members of congress and judges is also based on eci calculations but for different 12month period the eci calculations would dictate pay adjustment in january 2001 of 3 however the statute limits those adjustments to the rate of adjustment for base pay of the general schedule therefore if general schedule base pay is adjusted at the rate of 27 that will be the maximum rate of adjustment in salaries of federal officials although there has been substantial journalistic reporting that the president vetoed the legislative branchtreasury and general government in order to eliminate january 2001 pay raise for members of congress the pay raise would go into effect regardless of that action neither of those bills has any section in it providing for
