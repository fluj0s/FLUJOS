the 29 million assisted rental units th administration timated it would take about 17 billion more spending than in the pr evious year just to continue assisting this number of units largely because of ri sing rent levels the presidents proposal to add 33400 additi onal vouchers at cost of 204 million would not have significantly reduced the 49 million very lowincome renter households that hud says pay more than 50 of their income for shelter or who live in substandard housing but who receive federal assistance these are often referred to as worst case renters in its version of the fy2003 budget for hud the h ouse appropriations committee proposed several cont roversial changes to the section 8 program 1 funding for the renewal of secti on 8 housing assistance and 2 limits to administrative fees that hud pays to phas for administering the section 8 tenant based voucher program proposed section 8 funding formula change for fy2003 for several years both the house and senate appropriations committees have expressed concern and frustration about the amount of unspent section 8 funds that have been accumulating in the reserve accounts of pub lic housing authorities phas the house bill contained several controversial formula changes that attempted to resolve this hr5605 recommended 1835 billion of sp ending authority for the housing certificate program largely for section 8 rental assistance while this was substantially above the amount enacted in fy2002 only 166 billion of this amount would have come from direct appropria tions the remaining 18 billion would come from the unobligated unspent bala nces in two reserve accounts maintained by individual public housing authorities phas an estimated 938 million would have come from the carryover of secti on 8 program reserves and about 830 million from unobligated balances in section 8 ad ministrative reserve accounts under the house bill phas would have been funde d from direct appropr iations based on the number of units actually rented as shown in their most recent financial statement available if this were not enough to re new all of their section 8 contracts they would have been able to draw upon their program reserves individual phas could then apply to hud for additional funds from new central reserve fund that would have been established with an initial am ount of 280 million phas that had at least 97 lease up rate and who made the case that they could have put more funds to use within 90 days could also ve applied for these new funds the house committee said their new f unding approach would have been sufficient to assure that all families curren tly receiving section 8 rental assistance could continue to be helped however the center on budget and policy priorities httpwwwcb pporg said that the proposed funding formula was flawed since it was based on financial statemen ts that could be one or mo re years old and not reflect the current level of phas section 8 activity the cbpp claimed that the reduction in funds for the renewal of vouchers represented about 127000 fewer vouchers than the administration had indicated would ex pire in fy2003 they argued that phas who had been most successful in increas ing their voucher utiliz ation rates would have had the smallest re serves to draw upon and that the new central reserve account with 280 million would not have b een adequate th ey concluded that families currently using vouchers in some phas could end up either paying higher rents or losing their voucherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30916crs3 the house bill would also have changed the formula for determining public housing administrative fees paid by hud to phas for administering rental contracts limiting these fees to 10 of the rental subsidy they receive from hud if these administrative fees were inadequate to cover their costs phas would have to draw upon their administrative reserves which the committee said are substantial the house committee would also have restrict ed the use of funds in administrative reserve accounts to activities re lated to the provision of rental assistance under the section 8 program some phas have b een using these funds for much wider variety of housing activities under the house bill 36 million would have been allocated for about 6000 additional vouchers that would have been targeted to nonelderly disabled families living in public housing projects that had been designated to be occupied only by the elderly the senate bill recommende d an appropriation of 174 billion for the housing certificate fund in fy2003 about 100 million below the administrations request an additional 15000 vouchers would have been funded with 90 million proposed changes to public housing programs also had to do with large amounts of unspent funds the administr ation had proposed controversial cut of 417 million from the public housing capital fund from 2843 billion in fy2002 to 2426 billion in fy2003 under propos ed public housing reinvestment initiative the administration said that phas could make up the proposed 417 million reduction by seeking private financ ing to rehabilitate or replace aging properties pledging projectbased revenue as collateral for loans and moving towards more efficient marketbased operations both the house and senate bills rejected this initiative hr 5605 recommended level funding for the capital program at 2843 billion 417 million more than the administrations request the senate appropria tion committee recommended 2783 billion 357 million above the presidents budgeted amount the hope vi program that is used to rehabilitate or tear down the worst public housing units would have recei ved 574 million under the administrations proposal the same as provided for fy2002 both hr 5605 and s 2797 would also have provided 574 million in its report the senate committee expressed certain concerns about the future of the progra m and included language to sunset the program on september 30 2003 to encourage meaningful reauthorization process between hud and the appropria authorizing committees the public housing drug elimination grant program that had been funded at about 300 million in recent years received funding in fy2002 the administration did not request funding for fy2003 and neither the house nor the senate bills recommende d funding despite interest in renewing funding by some in congress others pointed out that th capital and operating accounts could be used to combat drug use the home block gr ant program would have been increased by 238 million to 208 billion under the administrations request the house bill would have increased the home progra m by 137 milli on more than the administrationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30916crs4 proposal while the senate bill at 195

the home block grant program for fy2003 for its downpayment assistance initiative this initiative was initially funded at 50 million in fy2002 but the funds were later rescinded by fy2002 supplem ental appropriations bill pl 107206 some local governments argued that the taside would mean they would have to make cuts to some existing homef unded efforts for fy2003 however the administration would have increased the overall home program by 238 million to 208 billion to cover the downpayment initiative the house bill recommended 375 million more than enacted for fy2002 and included the 200 million setaside the senate bill would have increased the home program by 104 million but did not recommend funding for the downpayment initiative the administration requested that the community development block grant cdbg program be cut by 2845 million for fy2003 from 50 billion to 4716 billion most of these funds 443 billion in fy2003 go to over 1000 cities urban counties and states through formula gran ts congress also provided 27 billion in cdbg assistance to new york city in fy2002 to assist in postseptember 11 2001 recovery efforts the administration pr oposed to change the

to the cdbg program would have come from economic development initiatives also called special purpose grants these grants received 294 million in fy2002 despite opposition from the administration neither the house nor the senate appropriators agreed to cuts in the special purpose grants the house bill recommended 50 billion for cd bg the same as in fy2002 and the senate bill asked for slightly more at 505 billion neither the house nor the senate committees accepted the administrations request to eliminate funding for the office of rural and economic development but instead recommended

housing and urban development office of policy development and researchreducing the chances that some welfare r ecipients will be able to achieve economic selfsufficiency since most of the hud budget addresses the shortage of rental housing and because many mayors and governors and other elected officials believe the problem has become serious this report reviews this issue in some detail the shortage of affordable housing is complex matter with many dimensions including the often overlooked but important role of local g overnments there are many statistics available for advocates who argue that more federal assistance is needed hud reported in 2001 that 1999 american hous ing survey data from the us census bureau showed 49 million worst case hous eholds those with incomes below 50 of the local area median verylow incomes who pay more than 50 of their income for housing or live in substandard housing but who receive assistance because of limited funding2 these same data showed that in 1999 44 of extremely lowincome renters about 375 million households were in the worst case situation to put these median incomes into more meaningful perspective on national basis those with verylow incomes would be households with recent incomes below about 21000 those with extremely low incomes had incomes below 13000 those who support more federal efforts to help lowincome households with their housing costs generally want either more funds for housing vouchers or more funds to encourage the construction of affordable rental housing or both hud secretary martinez has said he favor s housing vouchers over subsidized housing production to address the affordability issue pointing out that there are already government programs that can and are being used to produce affordable rental housing some conservative critics of hud programs believe that with the exception of few metropolitan areas there is generally shortage of rental housing units they say the affordability issue is not housing issu at all but an income issue and argue that better and more direct way to respond to worsecase renters is through government efforts to help lowincome households become more productive and earn higher incomes presumably this would mean they would not need federal housing assistance or not as much of it the administration seems to favor th is approach the fy2003 budget says hud would fail in its missi on if families were not moving towards eventual self sufficiency an important measure of huds success s hould be the number of families that longer need to reside in assisted housing because they have moved to safe decent and affordable private hous ing the administration and the clinton administration before it has placed increasing emphasis on promoting homeownership for lowerincome families in the belief that this is an effective way to move families towards selfsufficien cy and wealth accumulation number of housing analysts believe that there is

development housing in the seventies report of the national housing policy review 1974homeownership is less expensive than addressing more costly and intractable rental housing issues brief history of federal housing assistance in the housing act of 1949 congress established national goal of providing decent home and suitable living environment for every american family much progress was made in the next two decades in eliminating substandard housing as many of the nations worst slums were torn down but against the b ackdrop of the inner city riots of the 1960s and the recommendations of the 1967 douglas commission the 1968 kaiser committee and the 1968 kerner commission on civil disorders congress adopted the housing act of 1968 which set speci fic 10year goal of building 6 million housing units for low nd moderateincome families federallysubsidized housing production increased from 91000 in 1967 to 166000 in 1968 200000 in 1969 430000 in each of 1970 and 1971 and 339000 in 1972 during the 4 years from 19681972 there was also total of about 200000 units rehabilitated with fe deral subsidies and 2200000 mob ile homes built the latter considered an important source of affo rdable housing for lowerincome households3 during the 1970s attention on housing issues changed from its previous focus on the problem of too many substandard housing units to the problem of housing being too expensive for lowerincome families to afford in effect the 1949 housing act paved the way for the more elusive goal of making it possible for all families to have decent affordable home and suitable living environment the problem of substandard housing s not been entirely eliminated data from 2001 show more than 25 million housing units lacked some or all plumbing facilities with more than million wit hout bathtub or shower nd ove r 976000 without flush toilet at the same time the quality of the new housing built in the past 25 years and the level of amenities provided or required such as ffstreet parking wide sidewalks and roads air conditioning landscaping health safety additions and modifications for the handi capped and environmen tal protections had so upgraded housing and neighborhoods th at many lower income families cannot afford it increases in the minimum standards for housing by local governments began to conflict with the goal of th availability of affordable housing an important public policy issue is now the co st and advisability of putting lowincome people in middleclass housing reducing the size and level of amenities is only one of the many dimensions of the affordability issue some point out that many of the recent immigrants to the united states come from culture of extended families thus needing larger units not smaller but many lower

the latter half of the 1970s hud began phasing out its involvement in subsidizing new housing construction by the early 1980s this withdrawal was nearly complete and the shift towards subsidizing existing units with housing vouchers was well underway since the 1980s there has been obvi ous consensus about what should be done to improve housing opportunities for t hose with difficulties finding adequate and affordable housing beginning in 1982 the number of additional rental units receiving assistance under hud dropped sh arply in 1986 congress replaced number of existing rental housing tax

greater than 60 of the local area median after slow start the number of subsidized units built or rehabilitated averaged about 50000 to 60000 year during most of the 1990s more than 12 million units are now said to have been built with subsidies under this program after number of years in which new housing vouchers were added congress appropriated m oney for 50000 additional vouc hers in fy1999

an hour or even 6 8 or 10 an hour to find an affordable apar tment waiting lists for rental assistance in most major cities are so long that others are allowed to be added the national housing conference nhc examined recent american housing survey data looking at households with low to moderate incomes those with incomes from 80 to 120 of the local area median income nationally about 33000 to 50000 these households are much less likely to receive government rental assistance than those with incomes below 50 of the local median the nhc concluded that affordable housing problems had moved up the income ladder police teachers fire fighters and othe r public municipal employees who have been cited in the media as having problems affo rding housing generally fall into this 80 to 120 median income category alt hough twoearner families for example police officer and teacher can often reach securely into the middleclass the nhc concluded that simply having fulltime job does not guarantee family decent place to live at an affordable cost among its findings more than 220000 teachers police and public safety officer s across the country spend more than half their income for housing and the problem is growing worse5 local governments are often reluctant to adopt policy approaches that may attract lowincome households the mentally and physically disabled exfelons many of the estimated 75 to 11 million unauthorized aliens and others partly some say because of their negative fiscal impact many of these households would pay much less in local taxes than the cost of providi ng schools police fire and rescue trash collection and other social services many homeowners may believe that affordable rental units built near their homes would lower their property values and resist local government efforts to increase the supply of lowincome housing in their neighborhoods the result is that verylowincome households or even those not quite so poor are heavily concentrated in particular neighborhoods and local official s in these areas often find it necessary to look the other way as many apartments are shared by two or threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30916crs11 families in violation of local laws some housing analysts and others believe that the social and financial cost of this isolation is much greater than is often perceived increasing the supply of affordable housing aside from the issue of how much additional money could or s hould be spent to address th housing affordability problem the question remains about how funds could best be spent towards achieving the 1949 national housing goal housing analysts inside and outside of hud elected offici als and others have been debating for decades the relative advantages and disadvantages of tenantbased rental assistance and projectbased assistance in simple terms this usually means whether to use housing vouchers to assist individual househol ds or to subsidize the construction or rehabilitation of more housin g knowing when each type of assistance is most appropriate requires knowledge of local housing market conditions the discussion that follows reviews this ongoing debate voucher utilization rates in the past few years there has been growing concern that not all of the housing vouc hers awarded to local public housing authorities have been put to use some households with vouc hers have found it difficult or impossible to find an apartment within the time period for which the voucher is approved an increasing number of vouchers have been returned unused although these vouchers are often give n to someone else who does succeed in finding appropriate housing in recent years arguments have surfaced in congress that because not all vouchers are used there is less reason to increase the number of vouchers both hud and the house appropriations committ ees expressed concern hrept 107 740 over the amount of section 8 voucher f unds that were going unspent 13 in fy2001 the 33400 additional vouchers that hud proposed for fy2003 would only have been awarded to phas with voucher utilization rate of 97 or greater some phas with lower voucher utiliz ation rates have tried with limited ccess to better inform landlords about the voucher program and to encourage more to participate in it by offering various incentives some voucher holders have been provided transportation to assist them with their search and help with security deposits nevertheless where vacancy rates are very low it may have become prohibitively expensive on perunit basis for phas to try to locate additional units for voucher holders local phas have some flexibility to raise the payment standard the maximum rent on unit that is acceptable fo r household with voucher while this makes it easier for voucher holder to find it this raises the cost of the program since the government pays part of th rent the october 10 2002 report by the house appropriations committee says that since fiscal year 1999 the section 8 program has realized net increase of 5 764 433000 even after accounting for rescissions of unspent section 8 f unds included in the bill each year rental vacancy rates in one of the many doxes of housing policy the national vacancy rate for rental housing reach ed record high of 91 in the third quarter of 2002 also 91 in the 1st quarter while statistics show serious shortage of affordable rental housing in many tropolitan areas vacancy rate above 5 is often considered adequate for ma rketplace to function without difficultyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30916crs12 vacancy rates for 2001 varied widely acro ss the country atlanta 119 louisville 108 houston 111 west palm beac h 180 new york 36 boston 29 angeles 34 san francisco 34 and jacksonville 46 as noted low vacancy rates make it more difficult to us voucher many landlords who have choice of tenants will not pick very low income families with or without vouchers some landlords are unwilling to accept vouche rs because they want to avoid the bureaucratic red tape of the program or because they believe rightly or not that lowincome families will cause problems few local governments have recently adopted laws requiring landlords to accep t renters with vouche rs although landlords can often reject voucher holder because of bad credit lack of references and for other reasons reports also continue to show that discrimination in rental housing on the basis of race and against households with children is s till comm on which makes the use of vouchers more difficult but as this review has suggested vacancy rates tell only part of the story about the shortage of affordable housing high er vacancy rate may not help very low income household if the available units are too expensive furthermore statistics on vacancies can be misleading many large c ities have tens of t housands of boardedup rental units for example philadelphi lists more than 14000 housing units as abandoned many vacant units are or were owned by landlords who could not charge their very lowincome renters enough to pay the cost of operating the units other landlords struggle to survive letting their buildings deteriorate over time among the policy questions this raises would more housing vouchers if made available to very lowincome renters in marginally profitable buildings help landlords to continue operating ofte n shabby but affordable units with increased rent revenue some of these units that may have housin g code violations c ould be brought up to code related policy issue is the advisability of new federallysubsidized apartment buildings being built near these struggling landlords some think this can make it even more difficult for marginally profitable landlords to compete and stay in business increasing the number receiving assistance by adding vouchers the hud secretary has said he is not in support of new hud program to subsidize the construction of affordable rental housing he says that instead he favors housing vouchers because of the freedom of mobility they offer to lowincome renters in theory at least family with voucher can move out of poorly maintained building or dangerous neighborhood and go to sa fer one with better schools and more job opportunities however as the above di scussion has indicated the freedom of voucher holder can be quite limited those who do not have automobiles are very limited in where they can live most of the 3135 billion proposed for hud in fy2003 would continue housing assist ance for the approximately 55 million housing renters now receiving federal rent assistance through the section 8 public housing home and cdbg programs and veral others at congressional hearing on the fy2003 budget some concern was expressed at the increasing cost of the section 8 pr ogram it will cost about 17 billion more in fy2003 just to renew all 29 million s ection 8 contracts and protect somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30916crs13 vulnerable groups from losing their current rental assistance the proposed 175 billion for the housing certificate fund l argely section 8 will account for well over half of the total hud budget there are number of reasons why section 8 costs continue to increase rapidly the main one being that rents have increased significantly in 2001 in 39 tight rental markets hud began permitting the allowable rent level fair market rents for units elig ible for vouchers to be based on the 50th percentile for the local rental housing market rather than the previous 40th percentile since voucher holders generally pay 30 of their income towards the rent with the government paying the rest allowing units with higher rents to be eligible means higher cost to the government also ma jor housing legislation passed several years ago pl 105276 the quality housing nd responsibility act of 1998 requires that 75 of all new households getting vouc hers have to have incomes below 30 of the local area median more voucher holders with even lower incomes than previously means that these new households w ill require larger rental subsidy the cost of an average voucher is now about 6000 year for illustrative purposes one million additional vouchers would cost 6 b illion year for comparison purposes the joint committee on taxation shows taxpayers with incomes over 100000 received an estimated 55 billi on of federal assistance in fy2002 to help pay their mortgage interest and property taxes increasing rental housing production the difficulty of using vouchers in some areas has led to legislative pr oposals for new hud program devoted solely to the development of rental housing for extremely lowincome households referring to the limited value of vouchers in many tight rental markets the senate appropriations committee expressed its concerns in 2001 that families with vouchers often have little choice in their rental decisi ons leaving them often in low income and very lowinco neighborhoods and living in substandard housing number of bills were introduced in the 107th congress that would have subsidized the production of additional ffordable rental housing s 1248 hr 2349 hr 19 90s 940 title vii hr 2349 and s 1248 had 229 largely democratic cosponsors veral of these bills are summarized immediately below in addition the house financial serv ices committee approved hr 3995 which is discussed in following section s 1248 the national affordable housing trust fund act of 2001 introduced by senator kerry d goal of producing 15 million homes for lowincome families by 2010 it would be financed by excess reserves of the fha program that are above what is necessary to maintain 3 capital ratio the capital ratio is the value of the reserves divided by the amount of mortgage insurance in force 2 ratio is now requi red by law the excess reserves are what some call the surplus or profits from huds fha mortgage insurance business since the reserv have become an integral part of rental housing production proposal s this contr oversial matter is discussed in detail immediately below at least 75 of the trust funds would be used for the constr uction of rental housing and rental housing subsidies in the same ma nner as voucher assistance underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30916crs14 section 8 states would be provided with 025 of nonfederal resources for every 1 of federal assistance less than 75 of trust funds used for rental activ ities would be used for extremely lowincome families income below 30 of the local area median threequarters of money from th trust fund would be given as matching grants to states throug h formula based on the need for housing the remainder would be awarded by hud through national competition to nonprofit intermediaries assisted housing would remain affordable for 40 ears states would distribute funds to grantees giving preference based on 1 the degree to which the development is mixedincome 2 whether the housing is located in census tract in which the poverty ra is less than 20 and 3 the accessibility of jobs to the project hr 2349 the national affordable housing trust fund act of 2001 introduced by representatives sanders lee and mchugh would have used fha reserves in excess of that necessary to maintain the capital ratio of 2 there would be the same state matching requirements as in s 1248 fortyfive percent of the funds for affordable rental housing w ould be targeted to families with incomes less than 30 of the area median income 30 would go to families with incomes equivalent to the federal or state fulltime minimum wage whichever is high er and 25 would be for the development preservation or re habilitation of existing affordable housing for rental or homeownership for families with incomes below 80 of the area median income all of the funds would be distributed to the stat under formula that considers the percent of families in substandard housing the percent that pay more than 50 of their income for rent the per cent below the poverty line counties with vacancy rates below 2 and the age of the housing stock using mortgage insurance reserv to f und addi tional rental construction as noted several bills hr 2349 s 1248 s 652 introduced in the 107th congress sought to stimulate rental construction through trust f und financed by what some believe to be excess reserves of mortgage insurance premium pool others point out that these reserves are not idle pools of unutilized capital but federal funds booked for insurance purposes and treat ed like other federal revenue thus these excess reserves cannot be used as if the reserves were unspent resources simplified explanation of this funding dispute is as follows hud operates successful mortgage insurance business under the federal housing administration fha program during the strong economy of the 1990s this insurance business was very profitable for hud the premiums were much larger than the expenses from defaults on loans seriou s economic downturn with increased unemployment would increase the number of mortgage defaults then more of the reserves would have to be used to pay off the loans held by lenders and also be used by hud to fix up properties and to pay real estate agents to sell these homes each default could cost the fha tens of thousands of dolla rs thus because of the uncertainties of the economy in the years ah ead the insurance program must keep certain amount of the profits as rainy day reserveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30916crs15 supporters of using the steady growth in the trust fund believe the reserves are more than required by law and more than enough to cover future needs and as noted they want to tap some of the excess reserves for housin g trust fund the administration does not favor using the reserves in this manner the reserves now go to the us treasury and help fund th overall federal budget in turn the fha program has the explicit financial backing of the treasury thus the debate over the reserves is largely academic both sides agree that if congress were to redirect part of the fha reserves into housing trust fund there would have to be additional appropriations made to make up for the reserves alr eady built into the federal budget there is another view that the growing fha reserves means that the insurance premiums are too high and should be wered to more closely approximate the estimate of future needs s607 in the 107th congress would have done this even some who support efforts to increase the pr oduction of affordable rental housing are uneasy about using the fha reserves since these reserves come from charging higher than necessary insurance premiums that are paid largely by low and moderate income households including many minor ity families to some this would constitute regressive method of funding re ntal production program are there other options for obtaining mo re affordable rental housing some point to the congressional budget office report of february 2001 budget options restrict itemized deductions credits and exclusions under the income tax one of the options identified by cbo to increase federal revenues is limit the mortgage principal on which interest can be ducted to 300000 taxpay ers may now deduct interest on up to 1 million of mortgage debt used to buy and improve first and second home cbo says that reducing the eligible amount of debt for the mortgage interest deduction from 1 million to 300000 would trim deductions for 12 million taxpayers with large mortgages and in crease revenues by 558 billion over the 2002 2011 period some argue that this would be less regressive option to fund rental housing production program for extrem ely lowincome families limiting deductions to the interest on not more than 300000 of mortgage debt would affect highcost areas such as san francisco s angeles new york and boston it is probably coincidence that these are the areas that have some of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country and the most severe shortages of affordable rental housing another option for addressing the shorta ge of affordable rental housing is to encourage more local governments to us inclusionary zoning which requires home builders to construct and setaside minimum percentage of new units in specific residential development that are affordable to particular income level see inclusionary zoning viable solution to the affordable housing crisis the center for housing policy october 2000 for th pros

parties contribute up to 500 to help lowincome families fina nce the purchase of first home hud estimated that this would help 40000 additi onal families to buy home in 2002 the administration made the same request for 200 million setaside within home this proposal was criticized because home money can already be used to help families buy first home and new money was being added to the home program to pay for this new initiative it was thus argued that this proposal would create federal mandate that could take away funds that so communities might prefer to use for affordable rental

explanation for increased mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures increases in the cost of homeowner insurance and high levels of consumer debt have also played role as has predatory lending data from the quarterly survey of mortgage delinquencie s by the mortgage bankers association of america show that the percentage of homeowners with fhainsured mortgages who are 30 days or more behind in their paym ents reached record level of 1181 for the first time ever in the second quarter of 2002 this is higher delinquency rate than during the recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s the

1990s along with certain inner cities number of older suburbs tinue to be fiscally and economically distressed for example see why california is generating large scale slums anthony downs senior fellow the brookings institution june 7 2000 therefore it would be important to know where fha buyers are purchasing homes also as discussed above some believe that fha homeowners are paying higher mortgage insurance premiums than necessary research also shows that lowerincome and minority buyers are more likely to receive subprime mortgages with higher interest rates and higher f ees often higher than can be justified by standard underwriting guidelines7 predatory lending has hurt lowerincome and minority homeowners most often stripping away home equity accumulated over lifetime furthermore the tax benefits of mortgage interest and property tax deductions are worth much less if anyt hing to lowincome homeowners than to middle or upperincome households all of these factors work against lowerincome homebuyers accumulating wealth low income housing tax credits rental housing tax credits the low income housing tax credit lihtc 1986 provision in the federal tax code has become the ma jor engine for subsidizing the production of privately owned rental housing affordable to lower income households although estimates vary at least one million new nd rehabilitated units

president signed hr 4577 on december 21 2000 pl 106554 under this law the tax credit formula that determines the amount of tax credits that state agencies may allocate each year was increased to 150 per capita as of january 1 2001 and to 175 in 2002 after 2002 the cap will be i ndexed to the inflation rate the new law also established 2 million minimum beginning in 2001 for small states who would get less than this under the per capita formula these changes in the law are expected to subsidize the constructi on and rehabilitation of an additional 180000 affordable rental units over the next 5 years the new law also made programmatic changes to the lihtc added to the criteria that state ag encies must consider in allocating housing tax credits among the competing projects of deve lopers

agencies will also have to conduct comprehensive ma rket study of the housing needs of low income individuals in the area to be served by the project before the credit allocation is made more regular site visits will be required to monitor existing projects for owner compliance with habitability standards issues and concerns in terms of apartments produced the lihtc has been quite successful as builders and investor s have responded to this tax incentive although the exte nt if any to which these units would have been produced in the absence of the tax credit is not known th ere has been some criticism that the tax credits are poorly targeted being allocated on the basis of population rather than on some index of need such as the shortage of affordable units to very low income households some housing advocacy groups poi nt out that many of the units are not affordable to extremely low income househol ds without additional rent subsidies hud study of 39 tax credit projects

median would help in some situations some oppose this change because it would allow renters with higher incomes to be eligible for the program they think the current income maximum of 60 of the local

mrb program was made permanent in 1993 requires states to use the mortga ge payments received from homeowners to pay off the bond once the bond has been outsta nding for 10 years rather than using or

allow larg er volume of taxexempt bonds to remain outstanding for longer period of time this change is supported by the national council of state housing agencies the na tional governors association and the millennial housing commission however others observers maintain that the purpose of the rule was to reduce the dvantage that the mrb program has over other bond users such as those for student
