unchanging principles guiding the turkish republic since its founding in 1923 it also has been the principle that has produced considerable domestic political tension over the years political parties have emerged that appeared to challenge that principle and to strive to restore re ligion to central place in the state each time the party has eventually been banned from the political stage the justice and development party akp formed in 2001 has islamist roots and claims to be conservative and democratic the akp won the 2002 and 2007 national elections by wide margins yet its victories have not ended the secularreligious tensions in the country the akp narrowly survived lawsuit seeking its closure on july 30 2008 when the constitutional court held that the party was focal point of antisecular activities but opted for financial penalty instead of ban some analysts contend that the party is on probation but it is not yet clear how the court case will affect akps conduct in the near term it is proposing to pursue additional reforms required to achieve eu ropean union eu membership if akp renews and strengthens its mandate in the march 2009 municipal elections or in early national elections it might then opt for more aggressive agenda at the same time police have unearthed what they claim is conspiracy called ergenekon of ultranationalists and secularists to create chaos in the country and provoke the military to overthrow the government those arrested include two retired fourstar generals the case will be presented in court beginning in october 2008 some suggest that the arrests are evidence of turkeys progress as democracy because the deep state or elite who have manipulated and controlled the political system for 50 years are finally being confronted others charge that the akp is using the affair to intimidate its opponents and that the authorities handling of those charged fails to meet international standards the powerful turkish military has been unusually quiet throughout the closure case and the ergenekon revelations and appears to be cooperating with the ergenekon investigation the united states is concerned for stability in turkey because it is strategic partner and nato ally the bush administration has closely monitored recent developments in turkey which it continues to view as secular democracy that could serve as an inspiration for other muslim majority countries the recent domestic turmoil may either strengthen turkeys democracy or cast shadow on it this report will be updated if developments warrant it is

fundamental and unchanging principles guiding the turkish republic since its founding in 1923 it also has been the principle that has led to considerable domestic political tension over the years political parties have emerged that appeared to challenge that principle and to seek to restore the centrality of religion to the state each time the party has eventually been banned from the political stage the justice and development party akp formed in 2001 has islamist roots but claims conservative democratic place in the political spectrum the akp won the 2002national election by wide margin and the 2007 election by wider one but its victories have not ended the secularreligious tensions in the country today the turkish domestic political scene is in turmoil with two coincidental perhaps related dramas unfolding simultaneously the public prosecutor initiated lawsuit to have the ruling justice and development party akp banned for being focal point of antisecular activities 1 prior to this action and after it in stages the authorities arrested prominent secularistsultranationalists ulusalcilar on suspicion of plotting and instigating actions to create chaos in the country and provoke the military to overthrow the government both dramas highlight severely polarized political climate nd continuing crisis over power and identity in turkey the akp and the secularists each have champions and opponents who disseminate conflicting narratives and interpretations of events in some instances the schism is blurred as some secularists argue for akps survival in the name of democracy and some akp members and followers question their leaders actions none theless the national rift is real and as yet unhealed the united states is concerned for stability in turkey because it is strategic partner nato ally and candidate for membership in the european union eu the bush administration may be concerned about the survival of turkeys democracy because turkey is one of the few predominantly muslim democratic countries in the world and administration officials refer to it as an inspiration for other muslims even as they appear to have lessened emphasis on democratization elsewhere during the recent governmental crisis in ankara the administration adopted what appeared to some to be stance of studied neutrality with us officials calling on turks to find solution based on democracy and rule of law g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g21g146g157g158g138g157g146g152g151g561

appeared in spring 2007 when the justice and development party akp controlled parliament sought to elect then foreign minister abdullah gul as president of the turkish republic2 gul has roots in turkeys islamist movement and his wife wears head scarf 1 turkish law refers to ban which also is commonly termed closure in the west some would use the word dissolution 2 for background see crs

backwardness hence to secularists the countrys identity was tied to the selection of president moreover they argued that because the akp already controlled the prime ministry and parliament the turkish grand national assembly the balance of political power in the go vernment would tilt in favor of islamists if the party also assumed the presidency turkish president is mainly symbolic head of state but he has significant powers of appointment as well as bully pulpit the crisis was temporarily resolved via early national elections on july 22 2007 which the akp won with decisive 466 usually rounded up as 47 of the vote on august 28 the new legislature elected gul president secularist opponents continued to scrutinize the akp governments performance for islamist tendencies and reprise of the crisis may have been expected in december 2007 president gul named an akpallied professor to head the hi gher education board yok disturbing some secularists 3 they were even more provoked when on january 14 2008 prime minister recep tayyip erdogan declared that the ban on wearing the head scarf in all public institutions was serious problem in terms of freedom4 the ban has been in effect for several decades on february 9 following erdogans lead 411vote majority in the 550seat parliament passed two constitutional amendments to lift the ban on wearing head scarves on university campuses president gul ratified them on february 22 the prime minister may have miscalculated in focusing on liberalization with the head scarf to the apparent exclusion of other human rights that are restricted5 he thereby derailed an akp initiated albeit somewhat stalled process to draft new constitution to replace the current one which had been largely drafted under military guidance in the aftermath of 1980 military coup the akps stated goal had been to make the document more democratic and civilian erdogan may have been able to reform the constitution if he had tried harder to build national consensus for the change instead of shifting his attention so singlemindedly to the head scarf issue more sweeping revision of the constitution might have included the head scarf issue amid changes that are required for turkey to meet the criteria for european union eu membership and perhaps might not have generated as much blowback ultimately lifting the head scarf ban alone simply provided ammunition for the akps enemies on february 27 the opposition republican peoples party chp and democratic left party dsp filed suit in the constitutional court to overturn the new amendments then on march 14 the chief public prosecutor of the court of appe als requested the constitutional court to ban the akp and 71 of its leading members including erdogan gul more than 40 members of parliament and 11 mayors from politics for becoming focal point of antisecular activities 6 among other charges the request cited parliaments lifting of the head scarf ban in universities the akp holds 340seat majority in the 550se at parliament and therefore the prosecutor deemed it responsible for the action7 he did not seek to indict the opposition nationalist action party mhp or smaller parties which had joined the akp to provide the supermajority required 3 yok oversees state universities and has been traditionally viewed as bastion of secularism 4 lifting the headscarf ban

claimed that lifting the ban was aimed at expanding freedoms in the country and rejected all of the prosecutors allegations analysts considered the outlook for the akps survival bleak as 8 out of the 11 judges on the constitutional court had been appointed by form er president ahmet necdet sezer staunch secularist seven had accepted the prosecutors case permitting it to go forward and the court ruled in 92 vote on june 5 that parliaments action lifting the ban on head scarves in universities was unconstitutional 7member court majority was required to close the party and the june 5 decision was widely viewed as harbinger of the decision on the fate of the akp moreover ban on party would not have been unprecedented some 24 parties have been banned since the founding of the republic and 4 parties accused of antisecular activities or islamism have been banned since 1980 if the court banned the akp and its leaders then observers feared turkey might have entered period of political instability or at least uncertainty yet each time an allegedly islamist party had been banned in the past it reconstituted itself and returned stronger however some analysts suggested that the akp may have peaked with 47 of the vote in 2007 and would not return with larger share 8 others suggested that prime minister erdogan may have alienated some centrists he had attracted in the 2007 election by not fulfilling his 2007 victory speech promise to govern for all turks bringing an islamist agenda to the fore with the head scarf issue apparently dropping plans to revise the constitution neglectin g the eu membership process and failing to meet international standards in the ergenekon police investigation see below nonetheless the successor akp might have succeeded in portraying itself as victim of judicial coup garnering considerable sympathy vote and winning majority in parliament furthermore the akp continues to benefit from th ineffectiveness and lack of vision of the two main opposition parties chp and mhp neither has party organization nor level of grass roots support that can compete with the akp under deniz baykals leadership the chp the party of mustafa kemal ataturk founder of the turkish republic has opposed government proposals without offering alternatives and may have lost its social democratic moorings9 according to some experts the party appears bereft of ideas of service and recent elections have shown that its constituents are diminishing group of academics and elite nationalists who reside mainly in cities along the aegean coast for his part mhp leader devlet bahceli supported lifting the head scarf ban and opposed banning the akp but maintained that akps leaders such as prime minister erdogan should be held responsible for illicit actions and subject to being banned from holding political office thus baykal transparently saw route to greater personal political success via banning the most popular and charismatic politician in the country on july 30 six judges on the constitutional court voted to ban the party one short of the required supermajority providing the akp with narrow escape four others agreed that the party had become focal point for antisecular activities but not serious ones thus ten judges found the party guilty yet because the required seven judges did not agree to the ban the court ruled that penalty requiring the party to forfeit onehalf of its financial assistance from the state would suffice this penalty is not hardship for the akp whose private donors can readily 8 crs conversation with

court president hasim kilic voted to exonerate the akp and called for constitutional amendments to eliminate party closure cases he nonetheless described the ruling as serious warning to the akp and expressed hope that it would act accordingly some analysts concluded that the court had placed the akp on probation the court has not yet issued the reasoning for its decision which reportedly is based on the constitution some observers suggest that the court may have been influenced by the lack of possible alternative government given the absence of serious political opposition therefore ban on the akp would have produced an indefinite period of political instability that might have devastated the countrys economy it also could have seriously harmed turkeys european union prospects and perhaps its relations with other allies and friends instead the court opted to give the akp severe warning in the months after the prosecutor proposed the indictment akp leaders assiduously acted as if business were usual even though ankara seemed frozen in time while awaiting the courts verdict they refused to call supporters out into the streets for protests believing that counter reaction by security forces or opponents would exacerbate tensions in the country and prove counterproductive shortly before the court ruling prime minister erdogan reportedly admitted that we made mistakes 10 however he did not repeat that admission after the ruling when he still denied that his party was ever focal point of antisecular activities after the judgement akp officials reaffirmed their commitment to an agenda of reforms and eu membership president gul called for selfcriticism and empathy saying in looking at our own errors we at the same time have to place ourselves in the position of those opposed to us and try to understand the thinking and feelings of those against us11 first indications however suggest that the akp will not abandon its desire to respond to and change society according to its underlying religious principles on august 6 president gul rejected 9 out of 21 nominees for university rector posts reportedly because they had opposed the government on the head scarf issue instead gul chose others close to the akp he acted in accordance with presidential authority yet according to some observers his decision proved that he was unable to put himself as he had himself proposed in the position of the opposition and understand how it would react many observers including some akp supporters now want the government to embark on an ambitious program to draft new democratic constitution make changes necessary to prevent future actions to ban parties revise election laws to lower the 10 per cent of the vote threshold to enable broader representation in parliament and change the political parties law to democratize and revive those institutions 12 it may be premature to expect the akp to undertake an aggressive agenda before renewing its mandate in the march 2009 municipal elections or in early national elections the next national elections are otherwise scheduled to occur in july 2012 nonetheless the government has said that it has developed new fouryear program of legislation including constitutional amendments to further the countrys bid for eu membership 10 interview with ertugrul ozkok hurriyet july 26 2008 open source center document

raided an apartment in istanbul and seized cache of hand grenades explosives and fuses the investigatory trail led to the arrests in january 2008 of prominent ultranationalists ulusalcilar and secularists including retired major general and other retired military officers the head of fringe political party university rector the head of non governmental organization businessmen and journalists on july 1 two retired fourstar generals additional retired military officers the head of the ankara chamber of commerce and other journalists were taken into custody the arrests of generals of such high rank are unprecedented one of them gen sener eruygur is the former commander of the gendarmerie and now heads the nongovernmental ataturkist thought association which organized peaceful mass demonstrations against president guls election in 2007 the other gen hursit tolon is the former commander of the first army the indictment proposed on july 14 2008 requests that 86 individuals be charged with being members of an armed terrorist organization attempting to overthrow the government by force inciting people to armed insurgency instigating the killing of judge during 2006 attack on the council of state the highest administrative court and bombing of the cumhurriyet newspaper in 2007 among other crimes 13 the perpetrator of the 2006 attack on the court previously had been thought to be religiously motivated the final indictment is about 2500 pages and includes almost all sensational political crimes committed in turkey over the past few years an additional indictment is expected to be requested against gens eruygur and tolon perhaps for attempting coups during the akps first term the high criminal court has accepted the indictment and the case will be heard beginning october 20 2008 arrests of individuals related to ergenekon continue the alleged members of the criminal organization are said to have referred to themselves as ergenekon 14 ergenekon means steep mountain pass and refers to the turkish national myth it was the route via which turkish ancestors following gray wolf escaped from central asia to freedom in turkey to exact revenge on their emies all of the accused are known to have openly opposed the akp their enemy according to the prosecutor ergenekon is not connected to the armed forces or the national intelligence organization mit turkey has highly centralized government in which the interior minister member of the akp government controls and funds the police some analysts believe that the akp is using the ergenekon prosecutions in its fight for life seeking to intimidate its opponents 15 they state that media outlets supportive of the akp have disseminated reams of leaked evidence related to 13 the prosecutor defined terrorism according to turkeys c ounterterrorism law 3713 as actions undertaken with the aim of weakening destroying or seizing state authority destroying the security of the state both at home and abroad and destroying public order 14 httpwwwozturklercom it has been suggested that the ergenekon are remnants of turkeys gladio forces nato established during the cold war to set up resistence in case of communist invasion those forces were dismantled in many nato countries but not in turkey where they were military special warfare units whose mission was to catalyze sabotage assassinations and the like the units recruited people from different walks of life such as journalists businessmen mafioso and judges gladio are multiple groups not single organization gareth jenkins

some of it wildly inaccurate16 the observers suggest that these same media outlets are engaged in disinformation campaign to boost the akps fortunes and to help it ensnare its more wellknown opponents and not coupplotters17 chp chairman deniz baykal argues that the ergenekon charges are fictitious and asserts that there is suspicion in society that it is turning out to be political revenge process rather than legal process18 for his part gen tolon claims that he and gen eruygur are not in the slightest way involved in ergenekon and are scapegoats19 if true charges that ergenekon is product created for revenge and intimidation would undermine akps claim to be the standardbearer of democracy on the other hand prime minister erdogan has suggested that the closure case against the akp was response to the governments earlier pursuit of ergenekon not vice versa even some at odds with the akp see the case as test of turkeys democracy and rule of law primarily its ability and willingness to confront the extragove rnmental power of what has long been referred to as the deep state 20 the deep state refers to likeminded members of the military bureaucracy and related elite who believe it their duty to safeguard the legacy of ataturk and his vision for turkey and who according to this theory have controlled the country and manipulated the political system for 50 years today the deep state is seen as nationalist secularist and statist network that opposes modernizing reforms and compromises required for turkey to join the european union among other concerns memb ers of the network are said to feel most threatened by the akps rise however the prolonged detention without charge and harsh treatment of those indicted in the ergenekon affair which contradict international standards may undermine hope that the case would reinforce turkeys democracy rule of law and pathway to the eu g20g152g149g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g15g146g149g146g157g138g155g162g561 the turkish military which views itself as the guarantor of the turkish republic and protector of its secular identity has intervened in the political process five times since 1960 including two coups yet aside from calling for caution and respect for the law during the crisis over the possible closure of the akp and the ergenekon affair the military commanders were quiet they may not have recovered from bungled attempt to prevent president guls election by means of warning notice posted on the general staffs website on april 27 2007 described by some as an ecoup 21 instead that action appeared to have the opposite effect it helped to bring about the early national elections contributed to the akp victory and produced guls election thus it is possible that the military may have been content to let its secularist allies in the judicial bureaucracy take the principal lead in the effort to eliminate the akp after the party survived its 16 bulent aliriza and seda ciftci another long hot summer

prime minister erdogan incoming land forces commander general isik kosaner who is slated to become chief of staff in 2010 forthrightly stated protection of fundamental characteristics of the republic cannot be considered intervention in domestic politics his approach was in keeping with that traditionally taken by deputy chiefs of staff and force commanders new chief of the general staff general ilker basbug also perhaps communicated the same message but with more subtlety he confirmed the turkish armed forces is always involved as party when it comes to safeguarding and protecting the underlying philosophy of the republic of turkey and noted the principle of secularism is one of the pillars of the underlying philosophy the republic basbug quoted from article 24 of the constitution which stipulates that religion should not be exploited for political benefit 22 he also asserted or recommended that it was essential for social peace that those concerned about the growing influence of religious ideas on the countrys cultural identity be taken seriously the general staff apparently is cooperating with the police in the ergenekon investigation allowing searches of military residences and the seizure of documents23 g23g495g21g495g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 the overall us policy toward turkey is largely determined by the united states need and appreciation for turkey as strategic partner and na to ally in addition the bush administration values turkey as predominantly muslim secular democracy that might provide political inspiration for other muslim countries therefore it has vested interest in the continuation of turkeys democracy and political stability and does not want military coup there the administration adopted stance of studied neutrality toward the turkish domestic political crisis resulting from the closure case against the akp on april 15 secretary of state condoleezza rice said we believe and hope that this will be decided within turkeys democratic context and by its secular democratic principles 24 her spokesman stated we are strong supporters of democracy in turkey and we have faith in turkish democracy but ultimately these questions about politics and religion and different social values are going to have to be ones that are resolved within the context of turkish law politics and their constitution however the constitution that administration of ficials referred to although much amended was drafted under the supervision of military junta and accepted in 1982 referendum without opposition permitted nonetheless the administration continues to emphasize democracy in turkey while it longer sounds that theme for other muslim majority countries due to the increasing popularity of fundamentalist parties 22 speech delivery by turkish chief of the general staff gen ilker basbug in an inaugural ceremony held on august 28 2008 text on website of the office of the chief of the general staff open

turkey the akps advocates sought stronger statement opposed to the possible banning of party that had won decisive election so recently they believed that the eus threat to suspend membership talks if the akp were banned was more in line with democratic principles others contend that the eu had to take stronger stand because turkey is candidate for membership the secularists believe that the bush
