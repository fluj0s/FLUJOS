selected science and technology policy studies summary since the end of the cold war in the early 1990s number of reports have been prepared on broad range of science and technology st policy issues reports dealing with national research and development rd goals priorities and budgets and universitygovernmentindustry relationships are among those of current interest to congress ten st reports dealing with those subjects completed since 1991 were selected and analyzed for this crs report during the cold war period from 1945 to about 1990 the us st system grew rapidly as result of number of forces the report of vannevar bush in 1945 during period of major st system restructuring immediately following world war ii set the tone for much of the nations subsequent rd growth and st policy development the bush report is the subject of much current interest for the lessons it may have for future us st policy development in addition policy adjustments were made from time to time by congress and the administration three different types of adjustment are identified and discussed major st system restructuring reaction to crisis and fine tuning of the st system major crosscutting themes emerged from the analysis of the ten documents summarized in this report all noted that significant national and international changes are affecting the nations st system they discussed three kinds of responses new mechanisms for determining the nations st goals priorities and budgets new models of research development and innovation and refinement of the roles of government industry and academia in each and changes in university research and the universitygovernment relationship the reports identified number of major changes that have occurred in the world at large and in science and technology over the past several years such as the end of the cold war and increasing international economic and scientific competition such changes provided and continue to provide both opportunities and problems for the us st system the reports contained many recommendations on how the us st system and especially the us government rd establishment can respond many recommendations centered on the need for new mechanisms for determining national st goals and priorities and federal rd budgets questions were raised in the reports about the current understanding the bush model of the relationship of basic to applied research and the relationship of those types of research to innovation several recommendations in the reports called for new understanding of these terms and new models of their relationships changes since the end of the cold war also have affected academia significantly including its funding by the federal government the balance between teaching and research in universities

analysis of ten selected science and technology policy studies introduction the cold war period saw the creation and maturation of large research and development rd establishment in the united states funded primarily by industry and the federal government since the end of the cold war that system particularly the federallyfunded portion has been subjected to changing stresses as result several reports from various sources have been prepared analyzing broad range of science and technology st policy issues among them are reports dealing with national rd goals priorities and budgets and universitygovernmentindustry relationships as it reviews current us science policy the congress has been addressing these and related issues and has expressed interest in the content of those studies in addition there appears to be special interest in the report of vannevar bush1 fundamental and guiding document in us st policy since the post world war ii era for lessons to be learned in considering options for change in us science policy whether major or incremental to assist in that effort crs has reviewed cross section of those studies ten reports completed since 1991 were selected and each was summarized in two to five pages the documents were selected in consultation with experts in st policy in the congressional research service and in other organizations involved with the subject they were selected from among large number of reports of merit based upon one or more of the following criteria they are recognized as influential reports express range of views were done by leaders in the field focus on one or more of the subjects to be covered or represent views of current policymakers the ten reports are not exhaustive in range and although they cover number of policy viewpoints may not reflect all perspectives the section containing the report summaries is followed by section that presents brief analysis of major cross cutting themes identified in the ten reports preceding the summary and analysis sections of this report is section that provides brief background of some major st policy efforts since the bush report including major congressional hearings and study efforts an appendix contains listing of some policy study efforts currently underway in the st policy community 1 vannevar bush science the endless frontier reprint washington national science foundation may 1980 192 p crs2 background the history of the american science and technology system2 is coextensive with the history of the nation from the patent clause in the us constitution to the most recent scientific discoveries technological applications and federal rd programs science and technology have been integral to the nations development as the nation developed so did its st system the system achieved its present structure mainly during and immediately following world war ii many issues are associated with this complex and evolving system including the strength of the nations defenserelated rd the adequacy of the st system in support of strong domestic economy and international scientific cooperation and economic competition the balance between defense and civilian rd the balance between the federal and nonfederal industry academia other sectors the federal role in basic and applied research and development the adequacy of and constraints on federal rd budgets present and future numbers of scientific and engineering personnel congressional rd policy making and legislation executive branch rd policy making and management executive office of the president and rd departments and agencies specific programs of the federal rd mission agencies critical national st problems and opportunities and the longterm overall strength of the us st system during different periods since world war ii these and other st issues have been dealt with by us policymakers in different ways or with different emphases influenced by circumstances for purposes of analysis this report notes three broad types of system change major st system restructuring reaction to crisis and fine tuning of the st system while these situations are not mutually exclusive fine tuning for example occurring even in periods of crisis it is useful to discuss the american st system since world war ii in these terms to better evaluate the current period of us st policy and what may follow major system restructuring the period immediately following world war ii was one of major restructuring of the st system from the defensedominated war effort to what evolved into the cold war in 1944 president roosevelt asked vannevar bush the director of the office of scientific research and development which was responsible for the us wartime rd effort to prepare report on how to take advantage of the nations great st capabilities consistent with national security secrecy restrictions in the 2 us library of congress congressional research service federal research and development funding concise history by richard rowberg report 951209 spr dec 15 1995 11 p crs3 postwar years in 1945 the bush report science the endless frontier 3 was submitted to president truman the bush report reasoned that because scientific progress is essential for the nation science is proper concern of government the latter statement confirmed by the great contribution of science and technology to the war effort this conclusion echoed in part the finding of report of the national resources committee the prewar focus of federal science planning that federal support of research was an appropriate responsibility of the federal government and might help the united states out of the great depression4 bush convened four committees which submitted their reports to him the medical advisory committee the committee on science and the public welfare the committee on the discovery and development of scientific talent and the committee on publication of scientific information major conclusions of the bush report based upon the work of the committees were that the government should extend financial support to basic medical research in the medical schools and in universities fund civiliancontrolled military research in support of that conducted by the armed services support the general welfare by funding basic research in academia and in regard to applied research by improving the procedures for hiring and retaining federal scientific personnel and by providing tax and patent incentives to industry provide reasonable number of undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships to develop the nations scientific talent especially those currently in the armed services and declassify secret scientific information as rapidly as possible5 the bush report also called for the establishment of national research foundation which was to be the central scientific agency within the federal government although there was consensus on this idea by 1945 the two major proponents bush and senator kilgore differed on some important matters such as whether the new organization should mainly support basic research proposed by bush or rd broadly proposed by kilgore in furtherance of societal goals another major issue was political control of the organization president truman vetoed the first bill because it did not provide for presidential appointment of the director it took until 1950 before those issues were resolved and the national science foundation nsf was established in the interim however several other federal rd agencies also were established eg the atomic energy commission and the office of naval research and rd responsibilities and capabilities of other agencies eg the national institutes of health nih were increased consequently nsf was not the governments central scientific agency as was originally envisioned6 nevertheless the bush report has played an important role in us science policy up to the present in laying down guiding principles for 3 bush science

22 p crs4 federallyfunded rd and for establishing strong support for universityperformed basic research reaction to crisis the evolution of the us st system also received significant direction as st policymakers responded to several periods of national crisis since world war ii one crisis was the soviet unions 1957 launching of sputnik the earths first artificial satellite that caused widespread fear of the impending domination of military space efforts by the soviets as well as concern about soviet technological leadership the united states responded in several ways including the establishment of the predecessor committee of the house science committee the enactment of the national defense education act7 the creation of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the creation within the department of defense of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa and greatly expanded budgets for the nations military and civilian space efforts another national crisis to which the st system responded was the arab oil embargo of 1973 congress responded with the enactment of the energy reorganization act of 19748 which among other things established the energy research and development administration the enactment of the department of energy organization act9 in 1977 which established the department of energy doe comparable development although it may be termed major adjustment to an existing situation the soviet military threat rather than response to new crisis was the large increase in defenserelated rd funding during the 1980s begun during the last year of the carter administration federal defenserelated rd funding reached peak of about 70 of total federal rd funding in 1986 after reaching postwar low of about 50 in 1979 by 1996 preliminary estimates of defenserelated rd funding had decreased again to about 51 nearly the 1979 level although the final figure for 1996 probably will be higher10 in addition the entire period from about 1965 to about 1980 has been characterized by various analysts as period of science and technology policy disarray11 or crisis12 strains within the system arose from shifting st 7 public law 85864 72 stat

united states 19401985 task continued crs5 priorities toward for example civilian rd strains also resulted from the slowing of the expansion that had begun in world war ii and that had continued with the rapidly increasing space budgets of the early 1960s other strains that impacted on the st system were number of societal and political pressures including those caused by the vietnam war the struggle for civil rights and the conservation and environmental movements perhaps most important to the st community was the new belief by significant segment of the citizenry that the nations problems could not be solved by science and technology that was symbolized by the inability of the most powerful nation in the world to subdue technologically inferior enemy in vietnam as one analyst saw matters societys support for science had been based on the assumption that progress in the various scientific disciplines would ultimately lay the foundation for better life for all americans but as americans lost confidence in this premise as their optimism about the future became tinged with pessimism the foundations of societys support for science and scientists faith in themselves eroded13 one significant attempt to address societal needs through the application of science and technology during this period was the research applied to national needs rann program of the national science foundation in part because of doubt concerning the role the federal government should play in civilian applied research the program established in 1971 was abolished in 1978 because of various strains on the nations st system during this period there was movement for the establishment of national science and technology policy and for strengthening the presidents science advisory committee psac established by president eisenhower and the office of science and technology ost established by president kennedy in 1970 for example the house subcommittee on science research and development the daddario subcommittee of the committee on science and astronautics held series of hearings on the history of national science policy since world war ii14 president nixon did not support the legislative enactment of an st policy and in 1973 abolished both psac and ost under the administration of president ford the national science and technology policy organization and priorities act of 197615 was enacted it provided national policy for science and technology and established within the executive office of the president exop the office of science and technology policy ostp and the

and executive branches by providing congress with additional independent st analytical capabilities especially in assessing the impacts of technology on society with the ebbing of some political and societal crises vietnam and watergate the establishment of new national science and technology policy and new policy structure within the exop and increasing rd budgets by the end of the carter administration the period of science and technology policy disarray appeared to be over although major disagreements for example about the increasing share of resources devoted by the reagan administration to defenserelated rd would continue fine tuning the government continually fine tunes the federal rd system and to much lesser extent the nonfederal st system through its st policies and annual rd budgets this fine tuning results in incremental change aimed at improving the nations st system or adapting it to changes in addition from time to time government and private sector entities conduct major st policy study efforts two such major science policy study efforts occurred during the early 1960s just before the period of policy disarray discussed above by the elliott committee and the daddario subcommittee of the house of representatives the elliott committee was the house select committee on government research which during its existence in 1963 and 1964 reviewed the rd programs of nine federal departments and 12 agencies submitted ten major studies and made over 40 recommendations the daddario subcommittee during its existence from 1963 through 1970 conducted number of hearings and produced number of reports on government and science as set forth in its 1963 statement of purpose the reason for the study was that the federal government was then providing more than twothirds of the total research and development money being spent in the united states17 in fact the federal share of rd funding peaked at 665 in 1964 and decreased to below 60 by 1969 it has further decreased to about 34 at present the lowest share reported by nsf in its 44yearold rd data series18 the most recent comprehensive congressional science policy study effort was that of the science policy task force of the house committee on science and technology during the mid1980s that effort might be viewed by some as fitting better into the preceding categories of major st system restructuring or reaction to crisis rather than fine tuning indeed one of the two strong factors that made such review highly desirable was the urgent need to reverse the growing 16 public law 92484

crisis however the chairman in his discussion of possibly establishing department of science and technology stated our recognized problems revolve around the pace of technological development and commercialization and not primarily the performance of american science i do not believe that the best way to approach these problems is through the reorganization of federal science activities20 the study was comprehensive review of american science and technology 40 years back to the bush report with focus on the longrange 40year future major emphasis of the study was basic and applied research supported by the government in academia industry and its own laboratories with emphasis on the health of american colleges and universities in the future during 1985 and 1986 the task force held 66 days of hearings on 25 science policy areas fourteen background reports on separate subjects were prepared the chairmans report has served as summary of the efforts of the task force it discussed 19 topics interdisciplinary research national laboratories regulatory climate international cooperation big and little science department of defense research energy health research biotechnology space

task force it held ten hearings and produced seven reports four of which were hearings summaries including ones on technical enterprises for computers communications and manufacturing in the 20th century commercial development of medical biotechnology and the effects of technological change on the labor force the final report of the technology policy task force22 discussed technology and the economy specifically the role of government in technology the effects of government policies on technology and the human resources and industrial sectors involved the report made six recommendations

establish such an organization the committee should investigate the charter of each national laboratory and nasa centers to determine the capabilities which qualify them to support specific industrial areas the four remaining recommendations were that the committee should explore opportunities for authorizing civilian rd for the us corps of engineers to support the construction industry consider legislation for pilot programs in urban areas to improve technical achievement in school children consider legislation for restoring the us consumer electronics manufacturing industry and consider legislation to designate an existing higher education establishment to host national institute of manufacturing engineering and management the final technology policy task force report noted that government should not and can not sic prescribe programs for industry or even recommend areas of technology where industry should concentrate its resources23 noting further however that the government already affects industry through broad range of trade education regulatory tax patent and other policies it recommended national policy on technology that encompassed its six recommendations in the 102d congress the same committee established the task force on the health of science unlike the other two task forces discussed above this task force effort was not intended to be comprehensive but to expand the current science policy dialogue which has been too narrowly focused on funding levels and not sufficiently concerned with the structure of the research system24 the task force made use of informal offtherecord briefings from active members of the research policy community and commissioned several performance assessments by outside groups of number of different research efforts conducted by the nations research communities and federal rd agencies in reviewing national science policy since the bush report the report concluded that the real question is whether available resources are being allocated in manner that can best achieve national goals yet this question has never been addressed in comprehensive manner25 the basis of the task forces recommendations was that in this era in which the us st system is perceived to be under stress federal rd priorities should not be driven by fiscal concerns and circumscribed by the boundaries of scientific disciplines rather the report stated that for each national goal including those that still need to be adequately defined the policy questions should be what research is most necessary and what mechanisms for 23 ibid

administering preforming and evaluating research create the optimal pathways from research to goal attainment26 because of the complex structure of the executive branch and the many congressional committees with jurisdiction over some aspect of rd the task force sought to outline broad strategies by which the committee can strengthen its oversight of the federally funded research portfolio while crafting policy directed at improving the linkages between federally funded research programs and national goals it recommended two principal strategies strengthen mechanisms for setting governmentwide researchpolicy goals and for oversight of the federal research portfolio by exploiting committee jurisdiction over the office of science and technology policy ostp integrate various performance assessment mechanisms into the research process using legislative mandates in order to help measure the effectiveness of federally funded research programs27 the report looked beyond the continuous need to fine tune the nations st system it suggested that the committee may wish to consider fundamental reformulation of science policy principles with the view toward exploiting research as tool designed to achieve national goals rather than as black box into which federal funds are deposited and from which social benefit is somehow derived28 the issues of establishing national st goals st priority setting and fine tuning or restructuring the national st system have continued during the 1990s selected reports discussing these subjects are summarized below the current situation the cold war is over to some this marks turning point in us science and technology policy as important as the end of world war ii however militarily the world is still dangerous place the gulf war

generally have decreased in constant dollars since 1988 while nongovernmental rd funding has increased currently federal rd accounts for about 35 of national rd funding down from the peak of about 665 in 196430 and the lowest level since world war ii the federal government is in period of adjustment of its relationships with industry and academia in addition many st problems and opportunities will continue to be addressed by major federal civilian space energy environmental biomedical and public health basic research and science engineering and mathematics education programs as well as by the private industrial sector and academia federal science policymakers may wish to address whether the time is ripe for major evaluation of the nations st system or whether continued fine tuning is all that is required now some questions that could be asked are the bush report contributed to major changes in the nations st system following world war ii do current national and international circumstances warrant mandate for another major restructuring of the nations st system the bush report for example called for major structural changes in the federal rd bureaucracy is that needed today what is the role of the private sector and market forces alternatively is it time for another major study effort aimed at fine tuning the existing st system it has been for example about 11 years since the conclusion of the major science policy study of the house science committee and about four years since the concluding report of carnegie commission on science technology and government many recommendations have been implemented but additional changes to the nations st system might be necessary if major study effort is now warranted critical discussion is sustained by reports on specific aspects of the nations st system published continually as problems and opportunities arise and are addressed recently for example studies of the impact of decreasing federal funding on academia have been published what are the important areas of current concern to st policymakers that warrant study to determine what specific changes might be necessary to assist congress in

off may 1991 314 p overview in december 1989 the house committee on science space and technology requested that the office of technology assessment ota provide it with information on the nature and distribution of research funding and decisionmaking p 4 it was specifically interested in understanding the state of the federally funded research system its goals research choices policies and outcomes and the challenges that it would face in the 1990s this request was as followup to 1 the 1988 report federal science and technology budget priorities new perspectives and procedures prepared by the national academy of sciences nas national academy of engineering nae and institute of medicine iom as the first of several studies by the academy complex on the need for explicit priority setting in rd and 2 hearings held by the house science and technology committee on the academy report31 the 1988 nas study had been requested by the congress in the conference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fy 1989 june 6 1988 which called for the academy complex to provide advice on developing an appropriate institutional framework and information base for conducting cross program development and review of the nations research and development32 the nasnaeiom report identified four categories of st priorities warranting support including agency missions the st base national objectives and major st initiatives the report recommended that the federal budget enunciate presidential st priorities for crosscutting st initiatives that task force be created cutting across committee lines in the house and senate to examine the st budget as whole that appropriations committees review crosscutting st priorities and that congress initiate biennial congressional budgeting for st the academy and ota reports were prepared during an inflationary cycle and at time when rd budgets were expected to be constrained because nondefense discretionary real spending was anticipated to increase only about 2 annually large increases were projected for big sciences projects including the space station the superconducting super collider ssc the human genome project and doubling of nsfs budget over five year period which could foreclose increases 31 us congress house committee on science space and technology subcommittee on science research and technology the

in the ota report concur with and elaborate upon those in the nas report the ota report contains eight chapters totaling 260 pages and eight appendices it is an extensively documented description and analysis of major issues in funding research and development it contains considerable data references to contemporaneous studies on science policy and rd decisionmaking and case studies and descriptions of agency rd decisionmaking processes it incorporates the results of expert workshops and contractor reports individual chapters focus on the value of science and the changing research economy the federal research system the executive and legislative branches the federal research system the research agencies priority setting in science understanding research expenditures human resources for the research workforce and data on the federal research system issues the report described the overall increase in federal funding for research from roughly 8 billion in 1960 in 1990 dollars to over 21 billion in 1990 this was due initially to escalation of the cold war and the presidential commitment to land men on the moon followed by slight decrease and leveling off from the late 1960s to about 1975 then an increase in funding due in large part to the expansion in health and life sciences research p 5 during the 30 year period the number of academic researchers grew steadily so that there will always be more opportunities than can be funded more researchers competing than can be sustained and more institutions seeking to expand than the prime sponsor the federal government can fund p 7 the objective then is to ensure that the best researchers continue to be funded that full portfolio of research is maintained and that there is sufficient research work force of the highest caliber to do the job p 7 findings four major issues would challenge the federal research system in the 1990s according to ota including 1 setting priorities in the support of research 2 understanding research expenditures 3 adapting education and human resources to meet the changing needs of the research work force and 4 refining data collection analysis and interpretation to improve federal rd decision making recommendations the report offered issues and options for each issue which largely were recommendations even though ota was statutorily prohibited from making recommendations on the first issue setting priorities in the support of research the report found that federal priority setting falls short in three ways criteria used in selecting various areas of research and megaprojects are not made explicit and vary widely especially in highlevel office of management and budget omb and congressional decisionmaking there is mechanism to evaluate the total research portfolio in terms of progress toward many national objectives and the issues of developing human resources and regional and institutional capacity need to be considered along with the principal criteria for selection scientific merit and mission relevance p 11 ota suggested numerous executive and legislative actions to cope with these problems crs13 congress cannot look only to the scientific community for guidance on setting priorities warned ota due to the absence of scientific tradition for ranking research topics and investment choices across fields and subfields thus like the 1988 academy report ota stated that congress should hold biennial hearingson the state of the research system including crossfield priorities in science and engineering and the criteria used for decision making within the cognizant research agencies p 21 this would require the research agencies ostp and omb to present coordinated budget plans that cut across scientific disciplines and research areas coordination among relevant committees of congress would make this most productive p 43 as will be discussed below other types of congressional action were recommended to deal with the other problems ota emphasized that to effect changes in the research system congressional action must be comprehensive and sustained posture hearings with the science advisor and agency directors will not suffice p 44 when establishing priorities executive branch agencies could provide the congress with more transparent and iterative planning information that makes tradeoffs and reflects the application of criteria of merit program relevance and other goals that reveal the relationships among new and continuing projects the support of new investigators and the changing costs and duration of research in relation to capacity building congress could also initiate specific changes in the executive agencies that would increase their ability to respond to changing priorities p 21 including measures to encourage flexibility risktaking strategic planning coordination and new methods of funding the second issue understanding research expenditures addressed the observation that federal expenditures for individual components of research projects have increased faster than inflation understanding and coping with these increases is imperative in research decision making p 43 according to the report there are inconsistences in defining what is meant by the costs of doing research both in terms of inputs which vary because of salaries indirect costs which are the largest component increase in research project budgets p 24 stage of the research process equipment costs and likelihood of competitors and in terms of outputs such as performance or cost per unit output ota discussed various options to lower costs including fixedprice grants and congressional pursuit of programs to develop permanent grantreducing measures to slow or limit increases in research expenditures on individual research grants greater costaccountability by performers and more accuracy in developing estimates of costs for megaprojects p 2627 congressional actions presumably in the form of hearings could explore costaccountability efforts at the research agencies and throughout the research system p 43 the government should also try to balance the demand for more research output by its performers especially in academia where researchers are driven by the need to publish in order to advance professionally against the actual need for more research the third issue that ota examined adapting education and human resources to meet changing needs focused on the controversial topic of supply and demand for scientific personnel ota concluded that thencurrent predictions of shortages of scientific personnel were overstated and should not be used to formulate public policy demand for personnel even outside of government may depend on levels crs14 of federal funding in order to maintain required capacity government should continue programs to expand the number and diversity of students in the education pipeline and to prepare graduate students for career paths in or outside of research p 28 ota endorsed legislative action in support of minorities and women setaside programs and other activities to enlarge the diversity of the workforce the report addressed the issue of selective augmentation of academic research capacity by encouraging havenot institutions to concentrate excellence in select research programs departments and centers and build from there p 33 priority choices have to be made when expanding academic research capacity because acrosstheboard enhancement of all research programs may lead to each program being unable to garner enough support to improve research capability p 33 the report endorsed programs to build capacity in lagging states or regions like the experimental program to stimulate competitive research epscor program and noted the tension between research and teaching in academia and the need for universities to play greater role in diversifying the careers of recent phds it concluded that it was important to share research equipment space and people in teams or interdisciplinary centers what it called larger more industrial model with shared infrastructure in discussing the fourth issue refining data collection and analysis to improve research decision making ota said that four categories of data could be useful in decision making 1 research monies how they are allocated and spent 2 personnel characteristics of the research workforce 3 the research process how researchers spend their time and what their needs are eg equipment and communication for research performance and 4 outcomes the results of research gaps and uncertainties characterize these kinds of data with nih and nsf being the agencies that collect the best data other agencies rarely collect the kinds of internal statistics needed to inform research decision making and identify problems ota recommended that all agencies that support research should provide comparable data using common definitions to identify the size of the research workforce expenditures including salaries equipment and indirect costs the size of research groups and research production units and their relative dependence upon the government and other funding sources and numbers of proposal submissions and awards p 40 congress could instruct every research agency to develop baseline of information direct nsf to expand its focus and coordinating function for data collection and analysis and direct ostp in conjunction with omb to devise plan to increase the reporting and use of agency data in the budget process especially cross cutting information in priority research areas p 41 congressional hearings ought to be held to examine the state of data on the research system and improvements needed to inform congressional decisionmaking p 43 the ota report also addressed the issue of measuring the evaluation of research outcomes and said that while there is merit in quantitative measures such as degrees awarded and citation rates it also was important to include peer and expert judgments using such criteria as the originality of research results the projects efficiency and costs impacts on education and the research infrastructure and overall scientific merit p 39 this discussion evoked debates still in progress crs15 about how to implement the government performance and results act in federal research and development activities science technology and government for changing world carnegie commission on science technology and government science technology and government for changing world new york carnegie commission on science technology and government april 1993 94 p overview this is the 1993 summary report of the fiveyear effort of the carnegie commission on science technology and government established by the philanthropic carnegie corporation of new york in april 1988 the commission was composed of over 200 st experts organized into several task forces it included number of distinguished scientists industrialists lawyers politicians and former government officials including presidents ford and carter the commission produced 19 reports and about 12 other background and related studies it also sponsored six books and studies published by others from 1993 through 1996 the commission staff continued followup work and task force chairmen discussed many of their reports recommendations with government officials in 1996 the commission met for the last time and approved final report on science and technology and the president for the next clinton administration the formal reports of the commission are listed in an appendix of the summary report reports were published in 15 major science and technology policy areas in 14 of these areas one or more formal commission reports were published in the area of recruiting and retaining federal scientists and engineers formal report was prepared by the commission although reports were published by other organizations issues the 15 st policy areas addressed by the commission dealt with the president the congress the federal judiciary the states us international affairs global development international st decision making by governments and intergovernmental organizations us national security the nations economic performance and technology base k12 science and mathematics education environmental research and development the role of st in regulatory decision making nongovernmental st organizations federal scientists and engineers and longterm national goals for science and technology findingsconclusions the impetus for the carnegie commission on science technology and government came from david hamburg president of the carnegie corporation of new york who was concerned about the profound difficulty of meeting the challenge of accelerating scientific and technological developments with mandate to study this broad subject the commission in its summary report calls for transformation in the way science and technology policymaking is organized in all branches of government in order to meet the challenges of the human future encouraging longterm economic growth sustaining the environment and creating and maintaining peaceful relations among nations in the postcold war world33 to contribute to such transformation to 33 carnegie commission on science technology and government carnegie continued crs16 meet the challenges of the future the commission in its several reports made over 300 recommendations recommendations this summary report includes 15 short two to three page chapters each authored by commission leader in one of the 15 st policy areas each chapter summarizes major findings and conclusions of the commissions previous report or reports in these areas according to spokesmen for the commission many changes have been made in federal science and technology policy as result of these recommendations examples of implemented recommendations include the elevation of the presidents science advisor to cabinet status and the reestablishment of the presidents science advisory committee psac as the presidents council of advisors on science and technology pcast in the bush administration the early appointment of the presidents science advisor in the clinton administration and the formulation of its technology policy which is very much in tune with the recommendations of the commission and increased collaboration between the national science foundation and the department of education on federal efforts for k12 mathematics and science education which was agreed to formally by these two agencies in 1992 the commissions view on the need to link the economy energy and the environment in the development of national policy now has become conventional wisdom and contributed to the decision to eliminate the council on environmental quality and create an office of environmental policy34 examples of other major recommendations mentioned in the summary report and in few cases from the individual reports many of which recommend specific changes in executive branch agencies follow the white house in addition to implemented recommendations such as those noted above the strength of the office of science and technology policy should be maintained highlevel mechanisms must be strengthened to enhance crosscutting analyses in such policy areas as environmnt energy and the economy the federal coordinating council for science engineering and technology should be convened regularly at cabinet level with the participation of the director of the office of management and budget congress three reports on obtaining expert advice for the congressional decisionmaking process improving the congressional support agencies congressional research service general accounting office and congressional budget office and improving the internal organization and procedures of congress for dealing with st issues include recommendations for reorganizing congressional committees shifting to multiyear budget cycle reducing earmarking through the use of merit review and establishing congressional science and technology study conference as legislative service organization and nonprofit science and 33 continued commission concluding report calls for changes in the way government organizes science and technology policymaking information bulletin 1 april 1993

complex strelated cases nongovernmental science and justice council should be established to monitor and initiate changes that may have an impact on the abilities of courts to manage and adjudicate such cases in addition to the judicial reference manual already prepared by commission task force to help judges better manage st issues improved st reference materials and resource capabilities should be developed for the entire judicial system states with the end of the cold war there is need to strike new balance between the federal government and the states in applying science and technology to national needs the states should become full partners with the federal government in st policy making such as by being represented on federal st advisory and decisionmaking organizations including those defining missions for federal laboratories each state should establish science advisors to their governors and st advisory boards for their legislatures and aim toward the establishment of national organization to assist the states in st matters international affairs congressional and presidential decisions are required to better integrate international policy and actions with science and technology and to clarify international st responsibilities across federal mission agencies and particularly in the department of state the position of science and technology counselor to the secretary of state should be established and the number of science and technology officers in us embassies should be increased35 global development science and technology are powerful tools for international development but their effective application requires presidential leadership in addition national action roundtable for international development should be established to mobilize the government the private sector and notfor profit institutions for specific challenges and the us agency for international development should increase its access to american science and technology and improve its operations in many ways international science advice because international st decision making is becoming increasingly important especially in big science and global projects the advisory capabilities of international nongovernmental scientific organizations should be strengthened in regard to the especially important area of international environmental research and cooperation consultative group for research on environment cgreen should be created and existing organizations like the international council of scientific unions should be strengthened 35 the department of state recently eliminated its highestranking st position the deputy assistant secretary for science technology and health and reorganized the bureau of oceans and international

science and technology advisor in the white house and broaden the charter of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa from its exclusive emphasis on defense economic performance and the technology base to shape and implement federal policy related to economic performance and the national technology base including movement toward single dualuse commercial and military technology base technology policy in the executive office of the president should be enhanced the department of commerce should play more active role by forging strong partnerships with business labor and universities including an expanded role for the advanced technology program of the national institute of standards and technology and darpa should be transformed into the national advanced research projects agency narpa36 as step toward creating broader national technology base mathematics and science education k12 education is mainly state and local responsibility but the system has proven to be inadequate in regard to science and mathematics education presidential leadership and bipartisan commitment is necessary if the nations educational system is to be improved significantly although number of the commissions recommendations have been adopted see above continued federal leadership in k12 mathematics and science education policy will be required for the next two or more decades environmental research and development although some commission recommendations have already been adopted see above the governments environmental rd system impressive in many ways but diffuse and uncoordinated should be further reorganized and integrated by for example establishing us environmental monitoring agency by combining the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the us geological survey by presidential environmental research and monitoring initiative and by consolidating 12 laboratories of the environmental protection agency into four regulation the executive office of the president in cooperation with the other two branches of government should take the lead in providing broad policy guidance to regulatory agencies and in setting and implementing coherent regulatory priorities the food and drug administration the occupational safety and health administration the environmental protection agency the consumer product safety commission and other regulatory agencies should compile risk inventories and conduct risk analyses nongovernmental st organizations this task force surprised that 2000 to 4000 strelated nongovernmental organizations ngos exist in this country and acknowledging them as facto fourth st policy player along with government 36 defense was dropped from darpas name in 1994 but was restored later to emphasize its continued close relation to defenserelated rd crs19 industry and the research universities stressed that the governing bodies of these scientific and technical ngos should monitor the independence objectivity and accountability of their organizations in their interactions with government however providing policy advice is not appropriate for every ngo governments technical leadership although the commission did not produce formal report on this subject four books including three published by the national academy of sciences recommended improvements in recruitment and the reduction of barriers to assure that the most qualified scientists and engineers fill the approximately 80 top technical presidential appointments and that agencies in the executive office of the president and the congress develop improved personnel policies including salaries comparable to the private sector for the approximately 200000 scientists and engineers employed by the federal government the single largest employer of scientists and engineers in the nation longterm st goals to encourage longterm thinking about goals linking science and technology to society both within and outside of government mechanisms for institutionalizing longterm st goalsetting should be instituted within the policymaking and budgetmaking processes of congress and the executive branch nongovernmental national forum on science and technology goals should be established as forum for the exchange of ideas about future st policies and goals among all major sectors of society science technology and the federal government national goals for new era national academy of sciences committee on science engineering and public policy science technology and the federal government national goals for new era washington dc national academy press 1993 54 p overview science technology and the federal government claimed that major changes over the last decade and more have changed the framework for science and technology in the united states it examined how the us st enterprise can best respond to the new framework and in particular what should be the role of the federal government the report was written by the committee on science engineering and public policy cosepup joint standing committee of the national academy of sciences the national academy of engineering and the institute of medicine the committee consisted of experts in range of fields in st most members were from academe the report is often called the griffiths report after the committee chair phillip griffiths it divided the st enterprise into three parts research technology development and education and training the report addresses the first two parts issues the changes that the griffiths report identified include the increasing prominence in society of the products of science and technology the end of the cold war the information revolution major medical advances and increasing intensity in international economic and scientific competition corporate research and development also has been changing in particular it has decreased in the united states especially with respect to other countries there also have been changes in how st activities are performed the number of largescale major projects has crs20 increased and the nation is experiencing possible saturation of the market for new phds in the sciences furthermore some people are questioning the historical assumption that st makes needed contributions to national objectives for example some question how continuing increases in government investment in medical research can be justified with health care becoming more expensive despite or perhaps because of that research others point out that environmental problems persist despite substantial investment in research findings the report found that us economic and national security depends on making better use of us global scientific leadership and engineering capabilities us strength in st has contributed fundamentally to the rise of the country to its current position of global leadership and can continue to contribute to it industry health care the military and environmental protection all depend on st and will continue to do so in addition the advances in knowledge from scientific research have changed and enriched society in profound ways beyond the material science and technology are used in different ways to meet different societal needs many industries are born out of science eg biotechnology the semiconductor industry but industries depend less on science as they mature eg aircraft automobiles hightech industries do not necessarily depend on current fundamental research eg semiconductors defense has become more dependent on civilian technologies which is shift from previous decades it is impossible to predict reliably which areas of science will contribute new technologies therefore resources currently used for research to advance knowledge if redirected to more immediate or practical research goals would reduce the potential for new discoveries that would advance society and the economy and would not necessarily solve the immediate problems being addressed to continue and enhance the us global leadership position the federal government needs improved ways to judge the health of the st enterprise and its various components it must also respond to changing workforce needs as the economy develops further the information revolution continues st and the industries they support become increasingly internationalized and us education continues to evolve recommendations the report made several recommendations aimed at ensuring continuing and enhanced us global leadership in st the two core ideas were the call for an explicit national goal of maintaining global leadership in st and the idea of identifying position of leadership through the deliberations of independent panels of experts investment in st to guide us investment in the wide range of possible st activities the report recommended that for some major areas of science the united states should be the global leader and that it should strive to be among the world leaders for all major areas of science areas means broad disciplines and their major subdisciplines such as biology and neuroscience being among the leaders means that us capabilities and infrastructure in the area should not be exceeded by other countries crs21 by ensuring such excellence the us can bring knowledge to bear within and across disciplines on needs relating to national objectives can take advantage of advances made in other countries and can attract the best talent in st among the areas in which the united states should be the leader are fields for which national objectives can be met only if the nation is leader or that capture the imagination of the public or that affect other areas of science disproportionately the choices should involve comparative assessment of different fields they should involve different mechanism than decisions about the best direction within field which should be made by the scientists in that area the report asserted that these goals can be met within current total federal funding levels the reason given was that the united states is already leader in many areas and small reallocations could have major effects on others measuring national performance the griffiths report recommended that the united states perform fieldbyfield peer assessments via panels of independent scientists of us research compared with that of other countries those assessments would help identify strengths and barriers within and among fields and help resolve debates over megaprojects they would be used to guide priorities for investment but steps should also be taken to make the federal budgetary process for science more coherent using mechanisms already in place such as ostp committees one question about this recommendation is how one would designate an area to be examined the delineation of areas might be difficult and contentious once such designations occur there is also the risk that they could also lead to an unintended rigidification of fields and create the very barriers to interdisciplinary work that the report criticizes to test the idea cosepup is engaging in series of bench marking exercises in which committees of experts will assess chosen areas of research in the united states in comparison to other countries three areas currently being examined are mathematics materials science and engineering and immunology37 other recommendations establishment of leadership will also entail use of merit review to ensure quality research adequate stable funding for qualified investigators involving minimum administrative burden mechanisms to encourage interdisciplinary work and emerging fields and investment in education to ensure the continuous development of the research workforce in cooperation with the private sector the federal government should work to ensure that the united states maintains position of technological leadership p 33 in areas of major broad industrial and economic impact that goal cannot be achieved primarily through federal policies but the government should create an environment in which technology flourishes p 37 the federal government should support the development of promising new technologies in cases where industry will not because the necessary research and development may be too costly lengthy or risky for an individual company p 38 examples where the 37 deborah stine cosepup staff officer telephone conversation with author 12 august 1997 crs22 federal government has performed such function in the past include aeronautics semiconductors computers and satellite communications they were supported for national security reasons but other projects such as synfuels and breeder reactors failed allocating federal funds for science and technology national academy of sciences national research council allocating federal funds for science and technology washington national academy press 1995 96 p overview the national research council produced allocating federal funds for science and technology in response to congressional request to examine the criteria that should be used in judging the appropriate balance of funds to research and development activities the appropriate balance among different types of institutions that conduct such research and the means of assuring continued objectivity in the allocation process38 the report was written by committee of 18 experts from academe and industry including former government officials and chaired by frank press it is often referred to as the press report issues perhaps the major issue influencing the committees deliberations was the increasing current and projected constraints on federal funding for rd resulting from sustained efforts to balance the federal budget additional considerations included the reemergence of proposals to create department of science and the changing environment for rd created by the end of the cold war and increasing global economic competition findings many people consider the federal governments investment in research and development to be essential for meeting many national needs major strength is the breadth of fields supported and the diversity of agency involvement making resources available to respond quickly to unforseen problems such as aids in addition to meeting missionspecific needs universities have been an especially important locus of investment stable thoughtful investment can solve many problems costeffectively but it is often not possible to predict what specific investment will lead to major advances especially in technology the current system of funding and managing rd evolved during times of funding growth and mission expansion because it has progressed by building new structures rather than changing old ones it is not as wellsuited to times of constricting budgets while individual scientists and engineers can readily adapt to changing priorities adaptation is much more difficult for large research institutions in 1994 the federal government invested 70 billion in rd of that amount 35 to 40 billion went to federal science and technology fst with the rest 38 the report language cited p 87 also states that the senate appropriations committee was concerned whether the federal research and development budget is designed to meet new national security concerns military economic and health that confront our nation in postcold war world the committee is concerned for example that medical research is not at its optimal level of priority and support relative to its importance to national security crs23 being spent on projects that were neither longterm investments in new knowledge nor investments in creating substantially new applications p 57 those shortterm activities included initial production maintenance and upgrading of largescale weapons and space systems at the department of defense department of energy and the national aeronautics and space administration p 52 the pooling of these two very different kinds of expenditure masks federal investment in science and technology at time when focus on such investments is especially important p 54 the department of defense has begun to distinguish between the two it considers basic research and development science and technology and its other expenditures systems development39 other agencies do not make similar distinctions most agencies traditionally distinguish between basic and applied research however that distinction is often difficult to make in practice and is usually not as important in decision making as other factors the relationship between the two kinds of research is complex and most federally funded research is at once both applied and basic p 77 in addition federal investment in science and technology has complex relationship with industrial involvement with government support central to creating national economic advantage p 81 recommendations the report has 13 recommendations altogether several focus on the budget process and several parallel recommendations made in the griffiths report40 the central recommendation was that the federal government should create specific fst budget and use it in making funding decisions the budget would include the 35 to 40 billion identified above as science and technology investment the report envisioned that the fst budget would be presented by the president and considered by congress as part of the allocation process the premise for this recommendation was that coordinated approach to budgeting is necessary in time of budget reduction different fields of st depend on each other and comprehensive fst budget would permit consideration of how cuts in one area could affect others it would thereby lessen the risk that cuts in one programmatic area could inadvertently damage the health of another higherpriority field the proposed creation of separate fst budget was the most central and original recommendation in the report the strength of the fst budget concept is that it corresponds to the set of research and technology development activities typically conducted in the science and engineering departments of us research universities many of the federal laboratories and ffrdcs federally funded 39 dod currently uses seven numbered rd categories research 61 exploratory development 62 advanced technology development 63 demonstration and validation 64 engineering and manufacturing development 65 management support 66 and operational system development 67 the first three are classified as science and technology programs 40 national academy of sciences science technology and the federal government national goals for new era washington dc national academy press 1993 also discussed in this crs report crs24 research and development centers and some private firms p 54 the approach would focus on the investment aspects of federal science and technology in period of severe constraints on the federal budget and reduced allocations for rd p 54 the concept has been criticized on the grounds that it would not have the desired effect41 on the one hand it might be considered largely irrelevant to the political process through which the budget is allocated the comparative priorities within the fst budget might carry little weight compared to other considerations within agencies and congressional committees on the other hand it might set up zerosum game situation for st funding whereby the amount identified in the budget acts essentially as cap alternatively it might actually reduce the connection of st investment to national goals by focusing on comparisons within the st enterprise rather than with respect to other means of achieving the goal the national academy of sciences has used the proposed fst budget approach to produce analyses of the administrations budget request to congress for fy1997 and fy1998 however those analyses are essentially posthoc crosscuts and do not indicate how decisionmaking would be affected by adopting the approach the academy is currently considering using an fst budget analysis to determine the impact of changes in the federal budget on science and technology42 this report repeated the recommendation of the griffiths report that the united states should be the global leader for at least some major areas of science and that it should strive to be among the world leaders for all major areas the nation should also pursue international cooperation especially for large and expensive projects review of research proposals and programs should be competitive based on merit and involve external evaluators funding should focus on researchers and programs rather than institutions to that end investment in academic institutions would be preferable to extension of federal laboratory activities beyond their assigned missions federal laboratories serve important functions but should not seek new missions unless they offer both critical advantage over other performers and the new mission better meets national needs p 19 the federal government should encourage the development of commercial technologies by the private sector but it should fund them directly only in pursuit of government missions such as defense or new enabling or broadly applicable technologies for which government is the only funder available p 21 good management of science and technology is important however regulation imposes costs and federal agencies must strike balance between the need for accountability and the burden of regulation research and development 41 gary d krenz ed the future of the governmentuniversity partnership ann arbor university of michigan p 161174 summarized elsewhere in this crs report 42 stine

academy press 1995 207 p overview an important aspect of us efforts to improve economic competitiveness is the existence of capable scientific and technological workforce the emergence of the global markets deals not only in products and services but in highly trained human capital however there has been debate on whether us colleges and universities are producing the graduates needed to power the american economy in an increasingly technological and competitive world widespread downsizing by the defense and aerospace industries the end of the cold war off shore improvements of research and development activities newly revised immigration laws private sector restructuring and slowdown in productivity and economic growth have translated into diminished job opportunities for some scientists and engineers in addition budget constraints in academia have limited the number of faculty and postdoctoral offerings in the fall of 1993 cosepup proposed comprehensive study on the status of the graduate education and research training being offered in us colleges and universities43 issues colleges and universities are facing the task of better educating graduate students in the scientific and engineering disciplines by restructuring their curricula to increase the versatility and employability of the graduates it is held that scientists and engineers possess problemsolving skills that are broadly applicable in business and finance however selected doctoral degree programs are being challenged as too analytical and too oriented toward subspecialities an increasing number of employment positions for doctorate holders are found in industry rather than in academia and are becoming more removed from the basic research skills that earned them their doctoral degree44 critics have called for limiting enrollment in certain graduate programs and the phasing out of others the nature of industrial work is changing and so the training offered by the many postdoctoral positions must be altered as well industry wants graduate students who will better meet their rd needs and compete effectively with their counterparts worldwide in rapidly evolving job market 43 the

colleges industry and government are experiencing simultaneous change the total effect is likely to be vastly more consequential for the employment of scientists and engineers than any previous period of transition has been broader concern is that we have not as nation paid adequate attention to the function of the graduate schools in meeting the countrys varied needs for scientists and engineers there is clear human resources policy for advanced scientists and engineers so their education is largely byproduct of policies that support research the simplifying assumption has apparently been that the primary mission of graduate programs is to produce the next generation of academic researchers in view of the broad range of ways in which scientists and engineers contribute to national needs it is time to review how they are educated to do so45 findingsrecommendations the discussion of the major related issues focused on the right number of science and engineering phds including current employment situations and limitations of supplydemand models for forecasting science and engineering personnel needs the issue of foreign students including support of foreign graduate students where they go following graduation and what are the effects if any on the us labor force time to employment and information and analysis needs following consideration of alternative approaches cosepup presented national strategy that was intended to emphasize both versatility and information several of those recommendations were as follows to produce scientists and engineers who are versatile graduate programs should provide options that allow students to gain wider variety of academic and other career skills to foster versatility government and other agents of financial assistance for graduate students should adjust their support mechanisms to include new educationtraining grants that resemble the training grants now available in some federal agencies to implement changes to promote versatility care must be taken not to compromise other important objectives graduate scientists and engineers and their advisors should receive more upto date accurate and accessible information to make informed decisions about professional careers broad electronic access to such information should be provided academic departments should provide employment information and career advice to prospective and current students in timely manner and should help students see career choices as series of branching decisions students should not be encouraged to consider discrete alternative pathways when they have met their qualifying requirements 45 reshaping the graduate education of scientists and engineers p 3 crs27 the national science foundation and the national research council should continue to improve the coverage timeliness and analysis of data on the education and employment of scientists and engineers to support better national decisionmaking

governmentuniversity partnership proceedings of the 1996 jerome b wiesner symposium ann arbor university of michigan february 26 1996 251 p overview this conference was held in hopes of moving toward consensus on principles that would underpin new partnership between the government and the nations research universities as stated in the conferences opening address the major focus of those principles should be the expectations that the public should have for the nations research universities and what the research universities need from the government in order to meet those expectations report was issued prior to the conference from the committee on institutional cooperation that arrived at set of draft principles arranged in four thematic areas research and scholarship in support of the nations wellbeing education for the next century responsible allocation and utilization of resources and stewardship of the public trust the questions addressed by the principles are concentrated on the what universities can do to meet visions enunciated for these four areas these draft principles were summarized in the conferences opening address opening remarks were also made by rep ehlers and rep rivers about what each hoped to get out of the conference rep ehlers hoped it would serve to begin development of new model for universitygovernment relations rep rivers hoped it would address the direction in which the nation should move to ensure productive academic enterprise and healthy economic future the conference was oneday event featuring speakers from government university and industry the keynote address was given by dr charles vest president of mit sessions were entitled the university in national science and technology policy outputs research and education for the 21st century and inputs responsible allocation and stewardship of resources issues certain themes or issues appeared in several of the presentations and are presented here there was general agreement that changes in the relationship between the federal government and universities were taking place these changes resulted from number of forces including the decline in available funding resources growing demands on universities to meet regulatory requirements growing skepticism by the public of the value of university research and the lack of clear science and technology policy direction following the end of the cold war while there is 46 reshaping the graduate education of scientists and engineers op cit p 7888 crs28 general acceptance that universities have made significant contributions to the nation during the cold war period there does not seem to be the same feeling about the importance of university research to the nations future many newer members of congress are challenging assumptions long held about funding university research the speakers agreed that funding university research was an important investment for the nation the rate of return on rd in general and university performed research in particular has been shown to be high that it is an investment compared to other calls on federal funds however is not accepted by all policy makers further there are questions about how new knowledge generated in universities can most effectively be transferred to those parts of society where it is needed how can partnerships be expanded to effect greater technology transfer several speakers brought up the interaction between research and education while most believed they are naturally supportive of one another many felt that there are forces that are straining this synergy the failure of the government to pay the full cost of research is causing universities to divert funds that otherwise would have gone to education at the same time the public is led to believe that research and education are often at odds with one another universities are viewed by some as not doing enough to contain costs to ensure access to all bright and talented students others argued that support of education on the k16 level needs to be increased to expand the capacity of society to accommodate an increasingly complex world further some felt that the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers is not getting the attention it needs many of the speakers commented about the changing research policy environment policy goals for research seem to be undefined since the end of the cold war the rationale as to where research goes next has not been clearly spelled out global economic competition has contributed to those changes as consequence the innovation system fostered by the universitygovernment partnership appears to be coming apart the important midtier of the research hierarchy precompetitive research largely carried out by industry has all but disappeared with industry concentrating on shortterm productoriented research and universities continuing to focus on longterm fundamental research the flow of knowledge between industry and universities has been severely hampered as result finally efforts to balance the federal budget and reduce the size of government are having profound effect on the research environment while research funding has not suffered nearly as much as first feared the future still appears bleak several speakers brought up the role of the states as many federal functions devolve to the states it is reasonable to ask whether they should also contribute more to university research support there can be an important role for the states in certain research areas states could become part of the governmentuniversity partnership some argued however that it is not reasonable to expect much from the states since they are already providing substantial amounts for general university support findingsrecommendations while the conference did not arrive at collective findings there were themes shared by several speakers that served as findings and crs29 are presented here these findings usually contained explicit and implicit recommendations which are also included where appropriate the universitygovernment partnership has proven to be of great value to the nation over the last several decades that partnership was based on the premise that new knowledge was fundamental to the nations well being and the most effective way to develop new knowledge was through federal funding of basic research at the nations universities in the future new knowledge will be even more important for meeting the needs of society universities in partnership with the government and industry will continue to be primary source of that new knowledge without actions by both universities and the government the partnership might falter in the future public support is critical to the partnerships success at this time public support is not strong without better understanding of public concerns and taking steps to address them universities are in danger of further erosion of support universities need to be accountable they must recognize the need for greater efficiency and cost control strengthening peer review and maintenance of the research infrastructure funding constraints will make it essential that universities share existing resources with all research performers including the national laboratories the federal governments responsibilities include more predictable and flexible process for determining funding levels particularly with respect to large projects while the government has the responsibility for ensuring accountability and ethical conduct of research administration of the regulations governing research performance which now often acts as disincentive needs to be more efficient and less burdensome finally the federal government needs to move toward the goal of funding the full cost of research it supports advocacy of the importance of university research appears to be lacking on the part of both universities and the federal government all partners must do better job of showing that science is in the common interest universities have an especially important role in engaging congress in discussions about the importance of science and investment in research corollary is the importance of aggressively pursuing the transfer of new knowledge and the scientific process to help society achieve its goals without better links to industry technology transfer will not be effective both universities and the government have responsibilities in enhancing this transfer crs30 endless frontier limited resources us rd policy for competitiveness council on competitiveness endless frontier limited resource us rd policy for competitiveness washington council on competitiveness april 1996 145 p overview the council on competitiveness is nonpartisan nonprofit forum of chief executives from the business university and labor communities the councils primary mission is to set national action agenda for maintaining us leadership in global markets technology innovation education and training that will raise the standard of living of all americans the council was established in 1986 and is supported by private contributions foundations and other granting organizations the council regularly produces reports benchmarking us competitiveness in general and in specific technology areas issues this report discusses the changing global environment in science and technology the challenges these changes create for the us rd establishment and what institutions in each of the three sectors government private and academia need to do to meet those challenges the report also provides more specific discussions on six industrial sectors aircraft automotive chemicals electronics information technologies and pharmaceuticals the following discussion highlights the general part of the report findingsconclusions the global environment in science and technology has been undergoing fundamental change the council described four changes that impact the structure and policies of the us rd establishment tighter budgets shift toward nearerterm research globalization and changes in the innovative process itself the rd establishment in the united states is undergoing budgetary pressures that are not likely to be relieved in the nearterm in 1986 the united states had the highest rd intensity rd expendituregross domestic product gdp equal to 28 in the industrialized world in 1995 the rd intensity of the united states dropped to 24 the council estimated that in 1996 the intensity could drop to 22 federal support for research and development peaked in 1989 in real dollars and is expected to continue to decline as the government seeks to balance its budgets private sector support for research and development has been relatively flat since 1988 although there is some expectation that private sector investment in research and development will increase soon it is not clear whether it will increase enough to offset declines in federal support while the unites states still spends more on research and development than any other country and more than many of them combined the united states has fallen behind in some areas also in terms of nondefense rd intensity the united states trails japan and germany the council also noted that if japan doubles its governmental rd expenditures by the year 2000 as it has said it will try to do it will spend more than the united states on nondefense related research and crs31 development flat or declining budgets mean that the united states must make painful choices about what it will fund related to this decline in research intensity is shift in emphasis to research with shorter time horizons this shift is driven primarily by industry as it has sought to concentrate on core capabilities many firms have either done away with central laboratories or support more of their central laboratory research and development with funds from business units firms still support longerterm research but rely more on government laboratories or universities to do it this is also affecting the time horizon of those institutions research and development is becoming increasingly global advances in science and technology are not only coming from traditional sources in the industrial world eg germany and japan but also from new sources india israel china and other asian countries us firms are increasing the amount of research and development bought or conducted overseas foreign firms are increasing the amount of research and development bought or conducted in the united states this trend presents both challenges new competitors and opportunities new partners the council suggested that the united states should encourage as much rd to be done in this country as is possible including us multinationals that might find benefit in doing research overseas the innovation process itself is changing technologies are becoming more sophisticated and complex requiring interdisciplinary teams to conduct research development and innovation also product cycles are shortening putting premium on speed and incremental improvements this presents challenge to find the resources to continue conducting the longterm research needed to discover and exploit more revolutionary advances the council came to two primary conclusions called findings first increased partnerships can help meet the challenges of the changing environment government the private sector and universities must continue to find ways to form partnerships not only with each other but with their counterparts in other countries the second primary conclusion was that the current debate over what role government industry and academia should play in the nations research and development enterprise is polarized detrimental to making progress and based on an outmoded distinction between basic and applied research the complexity of technologies today does not allow for clear distinction between basic research and applied research nor is the linear model for innovation which describes innovation as following an orderly flow from basic research to applied research to product development adequate to describe the real process by which innovation occurs recommendations the council made two general recommendations although it does not identify them as such the first is that all institutions within the three sectors must prioritize by concentrating on their core missions and capabilities and then make sure their internal policies facilitate partnerships in order to leverage their investments as much as possible the report goes into little more detail on what each sector needs to consider crs32 the second recommendation is to restructure the framework upon which the roles of government industry and universities are determined it suggested doing away with the notion of basic and applied research as an organizing concept and go instead to the relative timehorizon and the amount of risk associated with particular research and development see the figure below government should support longerterm research basic or applied with higher risk research that needs to be done but which private industry is unlikely to do without government support type of research responsibility for conducting research primary secondary shorttermlowrisk industry notforprofit midtermmidrisk industrygovernment universities longtermhighrisk universitiesgovernmen governmentindustry t the council stated that industry is leading the way in focusing its efforts and facilitating partnerships at least among industrial firms and perhaps with universities but to maintain momentum industry needs to increase its contribution to research and development industry too still needs to take better advantage of what government laboratories and universities have to offer the federal government has had harder time focusing its efforts primarily due to political pressure to keep current programs going in rather bold statement the council suggests that government must meet its long standing obligation to stimulate civilian research among its core missions along with national defense and public health should be the stimulation of research that is required to keep the united states economically competitive government industry and academia should select these technologies together the council notes that doe nih nasa and nsf have made efforts to be more responsive to industry needs but that these programs are relatively small and politically vulnerable the federal government also needs to redefine the mission of its laboratories onethird of the federal investment in rd goes to federal laboratories doe laboratories account for about onequarter of that most of the rest goes to dod nasa and nih while stating that federal laboratories should be preserved the council recommended that their missions be narrowed that unnecessary overlap be eliminated bureaucratic oversight reduced and that culture of partnering be more firmly established the council noted that these are not new suggestions but that consensus has emerged on how to do them the council did not make any specific recommendations the federal government also must maintain its investment in university research in 1970 the federal government provided universities with 70 of their rd support by 1993 this dropped to 53 universities are the key to basic research they attract industrial laboratories and investment and they train future crs33 scientists and engineers however maintaining investment should not necessarily mean expanding the number of research programs the council made three other more specific recommendations to improve the environment for innovation government needs to reduce those regulations that raise the cost of innovation for example some regulations of the food and drug administration associated with clinical trials government should also eliminate the treasury departments regulations that require us multinational firms to treat portion of their domestic research and development expenses as having been conducted abroad and the federal government should make the rd tax credit permanent cutting costs will be particularly hard for universities after of 50 years of significant growth the tasks of universities are made more difficult by their having conflicting missions universitys primary mission is to educate however they also receive industrial or federal funding to do research they are increasingly being relied upon to do the countrys longterm research but are being contracted to do more shorter term research also while universities are supposed to be the storehouse of public knowledge more and more of their research is considered proprietary either by the firms providing the funds or by the universities themselves finally the national rd establishment must rely increasingly on interdisciplinary efforts but university tenure policy department structure and program offerings are becoming more specialized although federal government research funds are declining universities still rely heavily on them and are vulnerable to further cuts in federal rd spending universities need to define their own priorities more clearly and reassess their links to industry and the federal system evolution of us science policy harvey brooks evolution of us science policy technology rd and the economy edited by bruce smith and claude barfield washington the brookings institution and the american enterprise institute for public policy research 1996 1548 overview this book is publication of papers given at conference sponsored by the national science foundation and hosted by the brookings institution and the american enterprise institute in october 1994 the aims of the project were to assess the role of rd in the economy to identify promising new areas of research and analytical approaches and to contribute to the public debate as the nation seeks to define new framework for its rd policies in the postcold war era issues the primary issue addressed by dr brooks was whether is it desirable and feasible for the federal government to take more explicit role in directing science and technology resources to meet specific social objectives in this case to improve us economic competitiveness and performance findingsconclusions dr brooks did not answer the above question directly but puts the question in the context of long historical debate about the feasibility and desirability of planning the agenda of the science and technology enterprise to crs34 meet explicit societal or economic goals in the 1930s michael polyani and jd bernal had this debate polyanis position was that society could benefit most efficiently over the long run by giving the science and technology community large degree of autonomy to set its own research and development agenda bernal argued that the enormous potential benefits that science and technology held for society could only be realized through publicly discussed and debated flexible plan involving government and many other representatives of society dr brooks described what he considered to be different phases of science policy in the united states defined in part by shifts in emphasis from one of these models to the other he argued that the united states was currently october 1994 in phase where the bernal model is in ascendancy the key social objective now guiding us science and technology policy aside from public health which has enjoyed continuous and increasing government support since the 1950s is economic competitiveness and performance dr brooks cites as evidence of this latest shift the clintongore position paper entitled science the endless resource taking off from the vannevar bush report entitled sciencethe endless frontier the clintongore position paper suggested that governments role is not just to create new knowledge but to ensure that it is accessed and used to better society dr brooks identified nine issues associated with this shift toward the bernal model and the social objective of improving economic performance that were as yet unresolved national laboratories especially the large doe laboratories probably are better positioned than universities to meet the social objective of improving economic performance they have experience in mobilizing highlevel interdisciplinary teams to solve specific problems also they do have some manufacturing experience upon which to draw universities however which typically explore even appliedoriented problems in more depth might actually provide more net social benefits through the additional knowledge generated by doing that what are the implications for university priorities and policies which respond to calls for greater synthesis and diffusion of science and technological knowledge rather than just the creation of that knowledge giving greater weight to knowledge synthesis and dissemination implies everything from radical changes in instruction methods to development of hardware and software as aids to knowledge access and retrieval the practicalities of doing this at universities or at intermediate organizations have not been worked out what will or should be the impact of increased interest in economic performance on participation of foreign entities in governmentsupported research and development programs the productivity of the us technical work force has become steadily more dependent on students scientists engineers and skilled practitioners from all over the world however there are many inconsistencies in the legal mandates of new programs regarding the participation of foreign nationals and foreignowned companies reverse brain drain where more foreign nationals are returning to their native countries than are coming here makes any us techno nationalism even more crs35 counterproductive the issue can longer be treated by the scientific and technical community with benign neglect what should be the ground rules criteria and procedures governing state and federal agencies involvement in international cooperative research and education programs the united states is acquiring reputation as an unreliable international partner declining federal rd budgets will likely make this issue worse if job growth is the ultimate goal what institutions and what technologies are the best ones to support and by what processes will this goal be translated into concrete and reasonable objective project selection criteria that command widespread support in the community the federal government has yet to develop clear rationale for public support of projects in collaboration with industry for the benefit of economic development and job growth what are the public benefits sometimes higher profits and jobs are considered to be the public benefit how can it be ensured that government funds for research and development are not simply displacing private funds for research and development in trying to assess this there should be realistic allowances for displacing potential private investment such allowances might include better diffusion and exploitation of the knowledge generated by cooperative program what are the longterm implications of this emphasis on economic performance on the allocation of resources to universities national laboratories nongovernment nonprofit laboratories and private laboratories and to what extent should resources be channeled through political subunits ie state regional or local governments except for shortterm increase in the share of federal rd investment going to universities in the 1950s and 1960s the relative allocation of that investment between the different institutions have varied little since the end of world war ii is that allocation still appropriate will increased emphasis on economic performance and cooperative research with industry alter the allocation will emphasis on economic performance split and disperse not geographically but administratively the technological capacities now accumulated in national laboratories are the large centralized organizational structures of national laboratories appropriate to the economic performance mission without wellthoughtout restructuring plan laboratories may simply be closed and the skills and experience scattered what does rapid downsizing of the federallyfunded rd system mean for institutions whose primary mission is to train and educate new scientists and engineers and what changes are needed in the nature of their training even if funding to universities is sustained if graduates cannot find jobs outside academia where will they go it is unlikely that the private sector can or will absorb those people quickly because of the different nature of the work typically done at national laboratories as compared with private sector laboratories crs36 recommendations dr brooks did not offer any specific recommendations but he did caution that the debate between openended university research versus appropriable science cannot and should not be resolved rather he argued that society benefits most from the tension and interplay between the two investing in innovation toward consensus strategy for federal technology policy lewis branscomb et investing in innovation toward consensus strategy for federal technology policy cambridge harvard university center for science and international affairs april 24 1997 26 p and lewis branscomb et technology politics to technology policy issues in science and technology v 13 spring 1997 4148 overview the harvard report is result of project undertaken by the science technology and public policy program at harvard university which was sponsored by the competitiveness policy council bipartisan federal advisory commission many of the recommendations originated from diverse set of experts who participated in policy conference held jointly by harvard and the competitiveness council in washington dc on november 1819 1996 the harvard report which is an interim report as well as the issues in science and technology article reviews the debate that emerged between the republican congress and the clinton administration regarding the appropriate federal role in fostering technological innovation according to the authors much of this debate has been based upon the linear model which depicts technological innovation as distinct threestep process involving basic research applied research and development however the authors noted that the experts who have studied this process contend that technological innovation is much more complicated process the report suggested that the president and congress should abandon their attempts to differentiate between basic and applied research the authors concluded that single overall science and technology policy must give way to policies geared at better defining the roles that industry government both federal and state and universities can play in contributing to the nations technological innovation the report concluded by outlining six key principles the authors believed could help end the debate between the administration and congress and help revise americas technology strategy during the next four years as well as into the 21st century issues when president clinton took office in 1993 he called for significant funding increases for the advanced technology program atp as well as other federal costshared programs with the private sector including the partnership for new generation of vehicles the defense departments technology reinvestment program and later the environmental technology initiative according to the report when the republicans took control of congress many members in the majority party voiced strong opposition to the presidents technology initiatives they called for the elimination of the atp as well as other similar technology programs the authors contend that it is fortunate that the most strident voices did not prevail because to reverse course to that extent could have had disastrous consequences for the united states the report stated that the partisan conflicts and ideological rifts of crs37 the past few years while helping to clarify the terms of the debate over public investment in research have made it difficult to develop much needed consensus on the nature and scope of government investment in and promotion of innovation harvard p4 however the report noted that the end of the cold war the decline in corporate support for longterm highrisk research growing international economic competition and declining federal rd budgets provide the administration and congress with unique opportunity to set new course regarding the appropriate role of the federal government in fostering technological innovation the principal guide to governments role in helping the nation innovate is rather straight forward government should try to help us firms respond to the competitive challenge of fastchanging global marketplace and should be able to do it without meddling in domestic markets or favoring selected competitors issues p 42 while the reports acknowledged that ideological difference may be difficult to overcome there has been strong support for government research investments where private institutions underinvest because they cannot capture the full benefits but the return to society is greater than the public cost this has been the rationale for public support of basic research where the benefits are widely diffuse further the report noted that when political debate divides the world of rd into basic scientific research on the one side and lumps everything else from applied research or basic technology research definition to follow and product development together on the other side sight is lost of huge and important gray area in between needdriven creative research into new kinds of materials new processes or ways of exploring and measuring and new ways of doing and making things harvard p8 findings the authors concluded that innovation is the product of intellectual creativity and broad based collective efforts they argued that the process of innovation grows more complex as countries around the world join in global effort to create and exploit new possibilities the authors found that the united states requires carefullycrafted broadlysupported approach to this global challenge the report concluded that the current single overall technology policy must give way to comprehensive sophisticated technology policy based on widelyshared consensus that is continually evaluated and adjusted to meet changing competitive markets recommendations in that light the report outlined six principles which reflect the view that the most appropriate and effective role for the federal government is to ensure that organizations and individuals have the knowledge skill and incentives to generate private investment in innovation the report stated that these principles are entirely consistent with the governments central economic strategy to encourage savings and investment rather than driving consumption principle 1 encourage private innovation leverage private investment in innovation to spur economic growth improve living standards and accomplish important government missions by creating incentives for and reducing barriers to technology development and researchbased innovation crs38 the central thesis of this recommendation was that the engine of innovation and productivity growth is in the private sector wherever possible the authors argued the pursuit of technology policy should favor the use of market mechanisms such as tax incentives and creating markets for nonmarket entities such as tradable permits for sulfur emissions over direct government funding of rd however policymakers should realize that private firms underinvest in longerrange research and in research to meet public purposes therefore federal interventions must encourage private investment in technology development rather than substitute for it the report contended that cost sharing arrangements should be basic precept of federal technology initiatives where both public and private value is produced cost sharing requirements might be reduced in those cases where firms allow or even encourage the technology to be widely shared however the report stated that industrys cost sharing requirements should be raised as the investment area is closer to the market principle 2 emphasize basic technology research focus direct government investment in science and technology for economic purposes on longrange broadly useful research in basic technology as well as basic science both of which produce benefits far in excess of what the private sector can capture itself in terms of direct or matching support of federal research the report recommended the government continue to focus on traditional basic scientific research as well as basic technology research both of which produce benefits far in excess of what the private sector can capture itself basic technology research includes activities which involve investigating fundamental processes complement to basic scientific research of specific technologies such as blue lasers biosensors and the wearable computers such activities usually start early in the innovation process and lead to knowledge that is often nonproprietary and widely diffusible though clearly on course for industrial applications basic science and basic technology research are inextricably linked and dependent upon one another further companies have become more reluctant to put resources into basic technology research that is long term and high risk or both even though this research could eventually pay handsome returns to society as whole the report noted that more narrowlytargeted or shortterm research with clearly defined goals like product and process development should be funded by the intended beneficiary which might be private firm or in the case of technology needed primarily for government purposes by federal agency the report also contended that publicprivate technology partnerships should be structured so that it is clear how the results will reach broad range of users and benefit the public at large this implies using consortia of private firms universities and national laboratories in almost every case except where the government is the customer for the end product the report noted that mixture of institutional performers may be best since industry universities and national laboratories have their unique ways of ensuring that new work reaches variety of potential users principle 3 make better use of available technology promote effective use and absorption of technology across the economic spectrum with special attention to the role of higher education and the states in technology diffusion crs39 essentially this recommendation focused on the need for stronger federal and state efforts to improve the transfer of technology to the private sector primarily smaller firms primarily because many small firms have limited ability to choose among technologies and to make effective use of them the federal government working closely with states and regions should develop closer links between technology policy and workforce training and development this will help spur the diffusion and use of technology and create strong links between technology and the creation of highwage and highskill jobs the report noted that the national institute of standards and technology nist manufacturing extension partnership mep program is an effective model of federalstate partnership in technology diffusion and regional economic development the report also recommended that the states should play role in shaping nists advanced technology program atp for example atp should longer focus its grants to single company but should focus it resources on establishing multi company consortia so that groups of companies can benefit from new ideas such as techniques for creating new polymers materials for semiconductors and new systems for managing information principle 4 use all policy tools not just rd support utilize the full range of relevant policy tools eg tax incentives regulatory reform standards and intellectual property rights recognizing that different industries technologies and regions may call for different mixes of these policy tools one size fits all technology policy is almost certain not to be successful rather the report argued every industry is different and government agencies must be sensitive to these differences which calls for different policy tools and different mixes of science technology and systems research for example strong patent protection is essential to business success in pharmaceuticals but less so in the computer industry where most large firms are crosslicensed internationally biotechnology companies draw directly on forefront basic research while chemical and materials firms are more dependent on advanced process technology besides directly funding rd the federal government should support an array of indirect incentives to help foster technology development and diffusion including besides those mentioned above facilitation of standards development federal procurement antitrust law and competition policy and consensus building and policy analysis like that performed by the defunct office of technology assessment for example direct federal funding for the national information infrastructure nii is not as important as the role the federal government is playing in ensuring that regulatory hurdles are cleared and technical projects are funded so that programs such as the secondgeneration internet can be useful for both public and private sector customers principle 5 leverage globalization of innovation encourage us led innovation abroad as well as at home and enable us firms to get maximum benefit from worldwide sources of technical knowledge essentially us technology policy must encourage and facilitate globalization and transnational collaboration not impede it the united states must learn to crs40 cooperate as well as compete given the rapidly growing technical assets in other countries assets which in many cases are the product of public investments the report noted that resolving trade conflicts tends to get more public attention than investments in transnational collaboration and cooperation in the development of new science and technology which often brings even larger benefits according to the report the global information infrastructure gii where us firms and institutions enjoy commanding lead today is an excellent example of the need for us leadership in developing harmonious international environment principle 6 improve government effectiveness make government stable and reliable partner in longrange national research effort through more effective institutions for policy development strong and stable bipartisan support and stronger participation by the states in policy formation and execution the final recommendation called for strong and stable bipartisan support for technology policy primarily because of the longterm nature of most government investments and the policies recommended in this report american science and technology thrives because it is supported by pluralistic system there are many sources of support many types of performers and maze of linkages among funders performers and users of science and technology further there is not and should not be centralized technology policy process that undermines the value of pluralism technology policy should be explicitly experimental continually adjusted and informed by access to expert advice the executive office of the president must provide the locus for linking broad national policy objectives such as economic and security policy with the technology agenda congress on the other hand must be an active but patient and sophisticated participant congress also has central decisionmaking role adjudicating among technology policy experiments policies that fail should be terminated policies that succeed must be maintained or expanded however most importantly policy experimentation must be tried for sufficiently long time and under sufficiently reasonable conditions in order to be judged the authors noted that the administration in its first term may have moved to expand its technology policy initiatives too rapidly while congress may have moved too fast to hamstring or authorize these initiatives the authors hoped that all sides will show more patience during the next four years the report also has an appendix which contains number of policy recommendations including calling for the national science foundation to support basic technology research establishment of an information technology policy council under the white house national science and technology council strengthened technology advisory role for the white house national economic council an overhaul of the environmental protection agencys environmental technology initiative and greater utilization of the critical technology institute within the office of science and technology policy pasteurs quadrant basic science and technological innovation donald stokes pasteurs quadrant basic science and technological innovation washington brookings institution press september 1997 175 p crs41 overview this book analyzed the basis of postworld war ii science policy in the united states the author first described the policy framework as it was developed by vannevar bush in his 1945 report science the endless frontier he then assessed how well that framework described the federal rd funding system that emerged after the war after discussion of the historical basis for the bush research model the author proposed new model that he claimed more accurately portrays how rd is performed next he examined how this new model can be the used to restore the compact between government and science the book concluded with discussion of the role of scientists in developing science policy issues the bush report set forth models describing basic and applied research and the connection between basic research and technological innovation that became the foundation of us postwar science policy bushs first model classified research in terms of onedimensional linear spectrum defined by the motivation of the researcher at one end is curiositydriven basic research motivated by the desire to seek new understanding and knowledge about nature at the other end is usedriven applied research motivated by the desire to use that knowledge in practical way the more one is concerned about application or use of research the farther one moves from basic research toward applied research bushs second model proposed that the new knowledge spawned by basic research will eventually be converted through applied research and development in linear sequential fashion into technological innovations that lead to economic growth and other societal benefits despite the broad acceptance of model separating basic research from any applied goals actual experience argues that it is unfounded much of the fundamental knowledge generated in the last century has been the result of basic research with specific applications in mind basic research can be both use and curiositydriven bushs second canon the linear model of technological innovation is also suspect first it is too simple the connections between basic knowledge and innovations when they exist are much more complex than simple linear flow second not all innovation is derived from science often innovation will arise by tinkering with existing technology third not all connections when they do exist flow from science to technology there have been numerous cases where science developed to explain already working technology findings while belief in the bush framework has guided science policy over the last 50 years it has come under increasing attack in the last several years as many longer believe that heavy investment in pure curiositydriven research will by itself guarantee the technology required to compete in the world economy and meet full spectrum of other societal needs reconsideration of the framework is gaining adherents as interest in applying science to economic growth increases the problem is that linear onedimensional spectrum running from basic to applied research is inadequate to the task new model can be formulated as box with four quadrants the quadrants are defined on one axis according to whether the research is useinspired or curiosityinspired and on the other axis by whether it seeks fundamental knowledge or not the upshot is the appearance of new crs42 category or quadrant that is characterized by basic research driven by desire to solve practical problem it is called pasteurs quadrant because much of the basic research he carried out that advanced fundamental understanding of the biological sciences was motivated by trying to solve specific public health problems two other quadrants correspond to the bush framework in that they characterize pure curiositydriven basic research and applied research for entirely practical ends these are called bohrs quadrant and edisons quadrant respectively because of the type of research carried out by each the quadrants are not isolated from one another however and there is complex array of possible linkages between them new model of technological innovation is also needed the new model must account for two trajectories the path of technology innovation leading from existing to new technologies and the path of scientific understanding leading from existing to new knowledge the two paths while independent are loosely coupled at times they will influence each other quite strongly with the interaction moving in either direction quite often the linkage is useinspired pure science although there are other connections as well the connection between science and technology is more completely described in this model showing that each can drive the other but that the most important drivers are usually internal to the individual paths recommendations the postwar compact between science and the government appears to have fallen apart as result of three developments 1 end of the cold war perhaps the major factor in establishing and sustaining the compact was the desire to invest in science in order to maintain technological edge over the soviet union with the end of the cold war that stimulus longer exists 2 integration of the world economy some countries notably japan have become very competitive in number of hightechnology areas without having strong science base as result many have questioned the concentration on pure research if the major driver of economic growth is rapid technological innovation 3 the budgetary legacy of fiscal and economic policy the pressures brought on by efforts to reach balanced federal budget in 2002 have made it clear that rd funding will likely decline in constant dollars recommendation i recognition of the reality and value of useinspired basic research can help develop firmer st policy the compact can be renewed by joining the inspiration basic science can draw from unmet societal need with the high value the policy community places on the problemsolving capacity of science p 107 recommendation ii process that brings together the scientific judgements of research promise and political judgements of societal needs p 108 can realize new compact if that process adheres to the following crs43 1 system for appraising scientific promise and social value at the project level should enlist the insight of the working scientist into the nature of the social goals on which his or her research bears p 118 2 scientists should not be excluded from the discourse that seeks to make judgements about social value or else the creative insight of the scientist for defining and judging social goals would be lost and funding system with the potential for great conflict would be created 3 public funds invested in useinspired basic research will bring greater return if they are allocated among alternative projects through peer review by panels capable of judging scientific promise and the societal benefit from the resulting scientific knowledge p 123 recommendation iii the national institutes of health more than any other agency has put the use inspired basic research model to effective use in defining its research agenda nih has accommodated policy direction for more attention on specific diseases primarily by expanding usedriven basic research in the evolving arrangements for funding useinspired basic research attention should be given the possibility of replicating the nih model in other areas where research promise is felt to match societal need with the field of environmental science leading candidate p 144 recommendation iv the national science foundation could provide leadership role in advising the administration and congress on science policy if so nsf must make it clear to congress that the key to turning the power of basic science to national needs is to build agendas of useinspired basic science funded by agencies across the government that bear on the nations needs p 154 the need to bring science to bear on national needs is still important if based on the premise that good basic research can be performed even if it is directed toward practical ends crs44 analysis of major crosscutting themes introduction the ten reports summarized in the preceding section47 although they cover many issues and resulted in hundreds of recommendations represent only fraction of the efforts expended on assessing us science policy they were selected because they cover the subjects of federal rd budgets and priorities and universitygovernmentindustry issues they do not cover in detail many important topics or issues of current st policy including for example international st federal laboratory reform assessment of the peer review system or proposed changes in the role of the national science board in making recommendations to the president on national science policy some additional projections and issues although not specifically discussed in the ten reports are assumed or implied for example the nation has moved far beyond the era of the bush report when the united states was the unchallenged st power in the world consequently it was generally implicit in the reports that were summarized that priorities for national science and technology should be determined in both domestic and international context likewise constraints on the federal rd budget generally were treated as likely to continue48 the reports revisited many of the themes that have arisen time and again in the st policymaking efforts of the last 45 years such as legislative and executive branch st reorganization and st priorities but in the context of the current problems and opportunities facing the nation 47 for ease of reference abbreviated citations are given here full citations are given in the report summaries in the preceding section ota federally

indicate 9 decrease in federal civilian rd funding from fy1997 through fy2002 crs45 this section identifies major crosscutting themes that emerged from the ten selected reports all noted that significant national and international changes are affecting the nations st system they discussed three kinds of responses new mechanisms for determining st goals priorities and budgets new models of research development and innovation and refinement of the roles of government industry and academia in each and changes in university research and the universitygovernment relationships these points are discussed in the following sections significant changes affecting the nations science and technology number of major changes are occurring in the world at large and in science and technology the end of the cold war is one such major change as is increasing international economic and scientific competition these changes provide both opportunities and problems for the us st system the major impetus for example of the carnegie commission on science technology and government study was for society the profound difficulty of meeting the challenge of accelerating scientific and technological developments49 as well as the challenges of economic growth sustaining the environment and living peacefully in the postcold war world because of such changes the summary report called for transformation in the way science and technology policymaking is organized in all branches of government as well as in nongovernmental organizations the 1993 griffiths report of the academy stated that major changes over the last decade including the end of the cold war the information revolution and the increasing intensity of international economic and scientific competition already had altered the framework for us science and technology the press report of the academy two years later also noted these same changes the council on competitiveness report discussed four changes that affect the us st system including globalization of rd tighter rd budgets and the changes in research and innovation noted in the section on new models below the branscomb report identified these changes as providing an opportunity for the government to determine its appropriate role in technological innovation through for example its policies on transnational collaboration the stokes book identified these changes as contributing to the weakening of the postworld war ii compact between science and government in this nation new mechanisms for determining st goals priorities and budgets the reports made many recommendations as to how the us st system and specifically the us government rd establishment can respond to the major changes occurring in the world and in science and technology these recommendations centered on the need for new mechanisms to determine national 49 quotations unless otherwise noted are taken from the report summaries in the preceding section citations are not repeated in this section crs46 st goals and priorities and federal rd budgets the reports discussed aspects of national st policy that are contentious including the proper role of government in guiding the nations st for social purposes specific case being national technology policy the ota report concluded that mechanisms for federal st priority setting need to be improved because for example criteria used in selecting research areas generally are inadequate there is mechanism to evaluate research progress toward many national objectives and human resources and regional and institutional capacities need to be considered along with scientific merit and mission relevance the griffiths report also raised questions about the historical assumption that st is making needed contributions to national objectives in some cases specifically in regard to some current medical and environmental research the ota report addressed the need to better understand the costs of conducting research which have increased faster than inflation and concluded that rd data collection and analysis including the results of research need to be improved to aid in decision making the ota reports focus was on cooperation across federal agencies the griffiths report made recommendations repeated in the press report that the united states should aim at being the world leader in some major areas of science and among the leaders in all major areas of science the report also recommended steps be taken to make the federal budgetary process for science more coherent the press report responded to congressional request to examine the criteria to be used in evaluating the balance in federal research and development funds and between rd institutions in an st system which evolved during time now past of funding growth and mission expansion it recommended that the government establish federal science and technology budget eliminating from consideration activities like systems development in dod doe and nasa and that the entire fst budget be presented by the president and considered by congress in its budget allocation process the academy is continuing its work on how to apply the fst concept to decision making the proceedings of the conference held at the university of michigan on the future of the governmentuniversity partnership noted that the changes occurring in the historic governmentuniversity partnership are in part due to the lack of clear federal st policy direction since the end of the cold war the brooks article discussed the historical debate about whether society benefits most by giving the st community large degree of autonomy to set its own rd agenda or by public participation in and governmental planning of the nations rd agenda arguing that the second model is in its ascendency and that the key social objective guiding the nations st policy today aside from public health is economic competitiveness and performance the article outlined nine unsolved issues that must be addressed if this social objective is to be achieved including the changing relationships among government industry and academia the branscomb report called for carefully crafted comprehensive sophisticated and adaptable technology policy to replace the current one size fits crs47 all technology policy it sets forth six principles incorporating what it believes to be the governments appropriate role in technology policy defining new models for rd and innovation since at least from the time of the bush report basic and applied research and innovation have been considered to be connected in linear fashion questions were raised in the reports analyzed here however that go to the very heart of what may be termed the standard model of rd and innovation several recommendations for new understanding of these terms and new models of their relationships were offered stokes proposed new model that he claimed more accurately portrays how rd actually is performed than does the bush model of curiositydriven basic research and applied research entirely for practical reasons stokes proposed new model that allows for basic research driven by desire to solve practical problem such model should be used in selecting areas of research to be funded by federal agencies stokes also argued that new model of innovation is needed that considers the paths of technology innovation and increased scientific understanding as largely independent loose connection exists with research stimuli going in either direction often the coupling is usedriven basic research the press report questions whether the traditional distinction between basic and applied research is useful in practice or as important in decision making as other factors because most federally funded research is at once both applied and basic the university conference noted that research is divided into three tiers shortterm productoriented research carried out by industry midterm precompetitive research also conducted primarily by industry and longterm fundamental research carried out mostly by universities the competitiveness council report also stressed that the complexities of modern technologies do not permit clear distinction between basic and applied research nor does the linear model of innovation directly from basic research to applied research to development reflect reality these views were expressed in the branscomb report which discussed the importance of government conducting basic technology research as well as basic scientific research the council report recommended reorganizing the rd roles of government industry and academia according to shorttermlowrisk primarily industry midtermmidrisk primarily industry and government and longterm highrisk primarily universities and government categories the university conference also warned that the innovation system fostered by the universitygovernment partnership appears to be dissolving and that without better links among academia government and industry technology transfer will not be effective the branscomb report recommended increased governmental efforts in technology transfer at both the federal and state levels crs48 changes in university research and the governmentuniversity relationship the changes discussed in the reports have affected academia significantly including its funding by the federal government the balance between teaching and research in universities and the increasing need for example for doctoral degree holders in industry and government the ota report addressed the supply of and demand for scientific personnel the report concluded that the thencurrent estimates of shortages were overstated but also stated that the nations research capacity should be augmented in specific institutions of higher education specific scientific disciplines and underrepresented groups such as minorities and women the academy report on reshaping the graduate education of scientists and engineers addressed whether academia is producing the graduates necessary to power the us economy in an increasingly technologically competitive world it concluded that due to number of factors including economic immigration and international changes more broadlybased graduate programs are required to prepare students not only for careers in academia but for positions in government and especially for the increasing number of positions for doctoral degree holders in industry the ota report had arrived at similar conclusion the university conference noted that changes are taking place in the universitygovernment relationship due to number of factors including declines in federal funding and growing skepticism by the public of the value of university research those changes also are affecting the interaction between research and education decreases in federal funding for rd are causing universities to divert to research funds that otherwise would have supported education the conference argued that both the government and universities have responsibilities in rebuilding the partnership the council on competitiveness report recommended increased partnerships not only between government and academia but also including industry it noted that the primary mission of universities is to educate and that although increasingly relied on to conduct the nations longterm research they also are conducting increasing amounts of shorterterm research primarily for industry these views were echoed in the university conference report the council on competitiveness report recommended that the missions of the federal laboratories be narrowed and their overlaps be eliminated the press report while not calling explicitly for downsizing the federal laboratories emphasized the importance of funding university research crs49 appendix st studies currently underway selected list of st projects currently underway or recently completed follows america association
