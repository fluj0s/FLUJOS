statement by greg zielinski regarding the arctic records in any case the article by dominique and kieth was just rough draft we have pointed out the mistake to them and i expect we will all see final version anyway regarding the subject of the hihol paper we agree that there are already many papers published that dicuss the temperature interpretation of isotopic records during the holocene what has not been done however is to include the best holocene records from both polar regions in single paper nor to make specific comparison of the timing and magnitude of the optimum or optima for example the elevation effect on the longterm trends for east antartica has been discussed masson et 2000 but not quantified of course quantifying this effect is difficult but our paper could put useful error estimates for example on the amount of cooling in the late holocene we do not of course wish to compete with sigfus but his paper will be more limited in geographic focus than ours and will include new data that we will not use it would be good to include ngrip borehole temperatures if we can but this is not necessary even the grip and gisp2 records show very clearly the holocene optimum our suggestion would be to let dorethe decide on that in consultation with sigfus in our vision one of the key features of the holocene article will be its deliberately limited scope and confinement to observation rather than speculation about causes of climate change we think that to involve modelers and oceanographers makes it difficult to keep the focus and is rather beyond the intended purposes of the holocene volume keep in mind that modelling was looked at separately at the hihol meeting and we believe that the modelers at the meeting are planning their own contribution to the volume as mentioned earlier we think the best way to get the paper going is to begin soon the process of simply collating data sets and putting them all on one graph we can then discuss the details of the paper with the same image in front of each of us we hope that you can agree moreorless with the above and that others on our email list will also provide some input we are of course open to further discussion further comments eric and tas at 1207 pm 121300 0100 valerie massondelmotte wrote dear eric and tas dear collegues first thank you for your initiative in motivating comparison of ice isotope and borehole temperature records from both hemispheres from the holocene we think that it is important to position this work with respect to other related studies there are in particular several papers already discussing the temperature interpretation of isotopic records during the holocene see below for greenland correcting the isotopic profiles in antarctica from trends due to sst or ocean isotopic composition changes based on the deuterium excess as dorthe will probably confirm there is an ongoing work conducted by sigfus johnsen to be submitted to journal of quaternary sciences next year aiming at comparing all the greenland holocene temperature and isotopic profiles including north grip therefore we think that it important to better define the scope of the hilol possible paper comparing north and south holocene isotopic records and discussing the climate mechanisms involved more than discussing the temperature imprint on water isotope records for instance second we are still under the shock of the hilol conclusions mentionning widespread antarctic temperature optimum supposely seen in all ice cores between 9 and 7 ka bp in our paper published in quaternary research in november 2000 data presented by francoise at hilol we had careful comparison of 11 existing holocene antarctic isotopic records but without dome f so without ice cores in the atlantic sector although we had control on the independent time scales of these ice cores they are all precisely dated during the transition and there is doubt from the simple view of the raw isotopic deuterium or oxygen 18 data that they all exhibit clear optimum from 115 to 9 ka bp followed by relative minimum at around 8 ka bp now the sites located around the ross sea show mid holocene optimum 8 to 6 ka bp whereas in east antarctica apart from dome c and taylor dome third warm interval can be seen later 6 to 3 ka bp this is why we were quite surprised to hear about an optimum between 9 and 7 ka bp in antarctica last if the hilol possible paper is supposed to discuss the different timing of the major optima in the north and the south high latitudes then it would greatly benefit from including climate modellers using intermediate complexity models such as climber and oceanographers to discuss the possible role of changes in the north atlantic circulation in the first half of the holocene in such framework we are obviously willing to participate in the climate mechanisms discussion and of course provide the isotopic data measured at lsce eg dome b vostok old dome c and epica
