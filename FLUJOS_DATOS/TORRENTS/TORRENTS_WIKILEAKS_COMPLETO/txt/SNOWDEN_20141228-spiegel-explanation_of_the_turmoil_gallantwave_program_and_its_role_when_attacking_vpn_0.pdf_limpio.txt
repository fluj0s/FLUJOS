dnscpromotionfilterengine is part of fspfprocess and should not be x7it000 54264 kpr2013 the gwmodule as delivered start the dnscpromotionfilterengine as part of the fspfprocess according to the turmoil core team processes should be added to the fspfprocess as this strictly forbidden due to this configuration we have observed number of occurrences where the message queues for dnscpromotionfilter are not created and this results in 100 loss of dnsc misson for the affected fspf medium state fixed gw 40030 fixed with the release of gw 40031 mf109912 xks httpdemux problem at

correction to the previous statement tjse t3 does in fact have xks 1510 installed and guerying in xkeyscore has 1 of 2 turmoil gallantwave wikilnfo shown that for the past week there have been successful gallantwave decrypts that have resulted in hits on compressionhttp decompressed but not any results that are still in the gzip compressed state thus we can feel confident that xks 1510 also
