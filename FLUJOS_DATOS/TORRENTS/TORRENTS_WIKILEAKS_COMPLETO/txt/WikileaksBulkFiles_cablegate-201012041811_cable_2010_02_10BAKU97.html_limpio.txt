cant go on like this ref baku 91 b b baku 30 c c 2009 baku 972 d and previous classified by rob garverick politicaleconomic counselor reasons 14 b and d 1 c over the last ten days baku iran watcher has met with over dozen iranian contacts to obtain their insights and expectations on the upcoming 22 bahmanfebruary 11 opposition demonstrations in iran contacts polled included iranian bankers wealthy businessmen ngo figures journalists management consultants and students the polled group includes several professedly apolitical interlocutors and two opposition skeptics as well as several opposition supporters and activists massive tehran protest demonstrations expected 2 c most baku iran watcher contacts including several iranbased interviewees predict massive demonstrations in tehran and significant protests in tabriz mashad isfahan and some smaller cities many asserted that predemonstration planning propaganda and organizational activities by opposition supporters especially students is far more noticeable and fractionalized compared to previous demonstrations several commentators claimed that while promoussavi and prokarroubi websites are still important sources of information and encouragement they are longer the only or even main reference points for determined oppositionists neither moussavi nor karroubi can stop this opposition protests now one social activist contended opposition turnout efforts 3 c businessman pointed out that for the first time the reformist fraction in the majlis the reformistaffiliated islamic iran participation front and similar groups have issued calls for large turnouts clearly aimed at protesters two student sources and journalist related that small group of university students and others have traveled from tehran to their hometowns to help promote broader protest turnouts and coordination while businessman from isfahan claimed that opposition organizations are increasingly perceptible in his city other interlocutors expressed skepticism that such activities will have measurable impact in the short run tehran university lecturer stressed that opposition organization and planning in urban areas is spreading he conceded lack of commensurate rural protest but dismissed this as unimportant since radical change comes from cities not villages rural populations were also not factor in the overthrow of the shah he stated teams put up posters graffiti 4 c tehran student who has participated in all the postpresidential election protests claimed that former dropoff in his friends willingness to participate in demonstrations was reversed in the ashura protests and is picking up steam almost all of them will turnout on 22 bahman he said he said that he is part of fourman group that regularly travels on two motorcycles looking for places to paint antiregime graffiti or put up posters two of us act as lookouts while the others draw the graffiti he described this as common model for young people putting up slogans the student called himself pacifist favoring nonviolent protest but claimed that many people are talking about bringing clubs and knives with them to defend against the basij mashad resident also expressed fear of 22 bahman violence but noted that popular antiregime clerics there are promoting nonviolence father knows best 5 c the same student related that few days before ashura he and friend were caught by police sending protest emails over the internet from closed office he said that he police said that they didnt want to arrest them but needed to eat after receiving bribe delivered by his sister the police let them go without any questions about my identity or where i live the student added that after this incident his father complained that i cant afford your revolution khameini not as powerful as you think 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx who is friendly with supreme leader khameinis family xxxxxxxxxxxx told iran watcher bluntly that khameini is not as powerful as you guys think according to this source khameini is subject to severe bouts of depression and takes morphine not opium regularly he claimed that khameini is unable to function half the time and relies totally on his advisors khameinis mojtaba he dismissed as complete idiot who is easily manipulated and has future after khameini leaves the scene see septel 7 c though stressing that he is not an opponent of the islamic system he warned that the revolutionary guardbased faction which stole the election and is now seeking total control is extremely dangerous to both us and you he repeatedly characterized this group as criminal cult motivated by its fanaticism ignorance and the monetary selfinterest of its members he added that the group is intent on exporting revolution according to source both ahmedinejad and ayatollah mesbahyazdi are affiliates rather than leaders of this group and neither will likely end up with significant power if the group successfully consolidates control over the state and its economy see reftel iran cant go on like this 8 c xxxxxxxxxxxx placed the 22 bahman protests within this context as part of an innerregime coalitions effort to split khameini from ahmedinejad and retake power from the antidemocratic cult note other iranian sources expressed doubt that protesters will accept maintenance of khameini in office khameini must go whatever karroubi says and whether or not he breaks with ahmedinejad student asserted end note 9 c xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed that extrajudicial murders undertaken by cultrelated elements are being stepped up and placed the recent bombing death of an iranian physicist and the alleged killing of noncult generals directly in this context he claimed that irans economy is approaching crisis and predicted that iran is likely on the road to greater violence and unrest while not certain of the ultimate outcome he opined that 22 bahman may well move iran closer to political endgame he explicitly rejected suggestions that iran can continue indefinitely going through periods of mass protest followed by crackdowns he stressed that events are moving forward instability fractionalism and factionalism within the country are increasing and iran simply cannot go on like this lu
