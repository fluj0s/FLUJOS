from employees and pensioners whose payments were recen tly boosted by the government the high ostensible electoral support for ilkham aliyev also may have refl ected voter endorsement of his main

about azerbaijans political future and urged that the contest be free and fair and eschew warmongering the administrations interest in stability and cooperation with az erbaijan seemed apparent in president bushs letter of congratulations to ilkham aliyev when he became prime minister and his brief meeting with the azeri at the general assemb ly in september 2003 some in azerbaijan criticized these overtures as us endor sement of dynastic handover of power the administration response to the electi on appeared mixed perhaps reflecting the complexity of us interests or an evoluti on of views the state department on october 16 and 20 seemed to take mild stance regard ing the election and its aftermath according to some observers it concurred with the findings of the oscecoe observers that the elections were orderly but marred by problems with voter lists coercion and other irregularities and it voiced cern over reports of violent cl ashes after the election it also averred that deputy

violence by both police and civilians and politicallymotivated arrests and urged independent investiga tions of both electoral defi ciencies and the violence nonetheless the state depar tment spokesman stated that the united states did not view the deficiencies as discrediting ilkham aliyevs strong win and explained that we are strongly committed to promoting democracy at the same time we

azerbaijan encourages it to democratize helps it bolster its sovere ignty and independence and safeguards other us interests in this view policy of less engagement in response to the problematic election might harm us interests if azerbaijan becomes unstable moreover such problems in azerbaijan could exacerbate instability in the whole south caucasus region however many us policymakers and others question to what extent the united states should assist the ilkham aliyev government to maintain stability particularly if the government commits more human rights abuses these observers stress the harm of overly linking us interests to one leader particularly if the new president becomes more authoritarian rather than cultivatin g ties with other political figures and groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21661crs6 they warn that such links could eventually backfire if disa ffected populace views the united states as supporting authoritarianism they stress that us efforts
