emeter tips lecture given on 29 november 1961 well here we are whats the date audience 29th twentyninth of november ad 11 year drawing to close drawing to close well the process of going clear is new technical term it has to do with after you find the terminal and you are feeling fine and so forth then you go the rest of the way and that is process known as being pushed through the knothole and frankly its pretty ghastly pretty ghastly well were really not going to talk about that tonight im going to talk about emeters your particular tool of the trade this is not comprehensive or broad review of the emeter this is bits and pieces how can you be that stupid sort of lecture you see i have just learned why there arent any clears over in america i received cable and you know the old american meter that was the old blue meter that was made prior to 58 thats all right but they havent been since they havent been since none of them give an instant read meters made in 59 60 and 61 not under my supervision give sporadically noninstant read theyve got delaying damping action in them that sometimes operates to do weird things thats very interesting isnt it so sometimes it happens at once and sometimes it doesnt but basically what happens is that you dont get an instant read theres delay and its different apparently from meter to meter so i think thats all very interesting and thats why i cancelled out that particular type of meter construction and were using this mark iv now actually ive got lots of mark ivs coming up the line so it wont be too bad theyll be easy to get hold of theyre cheaper than an american meter but basically the thing will read and that i can guarantee it will read and thats all we require of an emeter is that it read we dont require that it has hot and cold running water we simply require that it reads now where you get lot of squirrel meters around or lot of oddball meters or lot of non supervised meters and that sort of thing you apparently can guarantee nothing this has been quite shock to i just received it by cable i have now handled it i was getting checkup on this actually i didnt ask him for checkup but he sent one gratuitously and it means that america where we had floods of offball meters and where we had this more modern american meter which wouldnt read we havent got any clear in that area dont have nobody see so thats weird one oddly enough the last clears for what its worth it may not even be wellcoordinated fact were made with the original meter which breeding and wallace and so on and myself were sweating the midnight oil over and i was keeping breeding from changing it and breeding was keeping wallace from changing it and so forth and that was the last batch of meters actually we got stack of those still back in the fcdc should still have them well those are very reliable emeters and apparently everything since that time hasnt been on that same order which is quite interesting and in england here we have frankly hardly any standard meters of any kind whatsoever we got an old potentiometer that somebody got off of spitfire and its connected up to couple of radial props and it stirs up the pc from behind or something of the sort and its sold at cut price but of course you reminds of story you know of the old pitchman who was selling watches down in new orleans and was perfectly good watch beautiful case beautiful case and you hold this watch up to your ear and you could hear it tick and it had marvelous solid gold case and it had hands and everything was fine and he was just selling these things like hotcakes you see but the trouble is the things ran down after few days because the cricket he put in them died so thats kind of the way it is you know this mark iv has this liability if it is shipped to you by air with its batteries in it in these new stratospheric jet planes your baggage goes through hotcold cycle every time it lands its hot you see because of the various air routes usually particularly the commonwealth areas and then it goes straight back upstairs you know and drops to 30 40 degrees below zero in the baggage compartment because its not warmed like the passenger cabins and the batteries burst which as ive told you before in lecture are just liability of that so if youre going to ship it in your suitcase for heavens sakes take the batteries out of it and put them in your pocket and put them back in when you get at the other end nothing else is going to happen to it just the batteries are going to burst and itll be unworkable at the other end possibly for that reason unless somebody put it up against container of uranium being shipped to the atomic energy commissions advance headquarters in australia or something why youve had it you see of course youve had it then too because at the other end its radioactive but weve now got these things down so that they have simple battery which is everywhere procurable and its very easy to put the battery in an emeter theres the newest issue of these mark ivs are supposed to have design underneath the little lid and you lift it open with if you dont have electronic equipment why go to your wife and get her nail file or pick out your own nail file or buy one for change and unscrew the top plate on the little battery compartment which is right underneath the can compartment but if you get those batteries in backwards it wont operate and its very complex way the batteries go in they had to be plusminus minusplus and ive never been able to do it myself i always send it back to the factory when i but im trying to get the battery design doing it so if you have to open up one of these meters to change its battery why when you take that wooden plate off of the thing sketch the pluses and minuses see just sketch it dont touch the batteries just sketch exactly where they lie in it draw picture and show even where the dial is so that you wont turn the picture upside down and put the batteries in reverse end to you got the idea so draw this little picture and when you put the batteries back in fold up the piece of paper and shove it in underneath the cover and youll always have it and youll be able to get the thing straight its very easy to change batteries in one the way you test for batteries in the thing is switch over here and it says test and if your emeter is functioning your test brings it right straight over to the pin see all you do is turn this thing over to test and it goes over to the pin now when that needle on test you turn the meter on and you swing its other button over to test and when you do that sometime and you find that this needle here is not in this little last test range you see there are two lines here in the last test range see those all right when its not inside those your meter wont function it hasnt got enough juice left in it to drive the pc somethings got to drive the pc so make sure that that needle is well within the test and frankly when it gets to about t on test you ought to be going down to the drugstore and investing four or five sixpences or some vast sum or forty cents or something and buying yourself some new batteries for the thing and throwing them in because its not going to read well after that and when its completely outside those two bars well it just hasnt been operating for some time and that was why you didnt do much for the last pc you were auditing but you can suddenly look up with start and wonder whats happened to your emeter and in view of the fact that the batteries are changed so seldom thats one of the difficulties of this mark iv you almost never change the batteries in it you see that you get out of the habit of testing for it and then you one day swing the thing i havent been having good luck lately pcs have been blowing you know and you find out when somebody else gets one of your pcs that them rudiments were all out and the pc had many missed withholds well thats about the time that you took this little black button down here to the right of the sensitivity knob and turned it over to test because probably itll come up to set and the battery the thing will appear to be operating you know but it just doesnt operate there just isnt enough juice in it now theres reason to put red light on it to show that its always charged up because it would consume more juice than the whole meter so there is way to put an additional indicator on it except this test switch now when you carry this meter around put it over here on transit and actually at the end of session if you really want to take care of your meter turn your meter off and turn your set over to transit in other words vertical knob in other words you have to do those two actions to turn an emeter off mainly just turn it off and then turn it over to transit and that keeps your meter from being jumped up and the needle banging around and so forth thats all that does but its easier on the meter doing that actually you should do it at the end of session even carrying meter downstairs emeter will last longer all right now another tip on this meter is setting the meter to exact clear read now this one quite by accident since you saw fiddle with the knob moment ago is sitting here very nicely at set you turn this to number 2 sensitivity deadon and you turn it to number 20 on the tone arm deadon exact and then you take this little knob down here at the bottom and this thing is called the trim knob and you bring the needle to set and you bring that needle right to set and that is with the cans unplugged you actually can have the pc on the cans and set up your meter but in order to do that you have to pop out this meter connector just halfway it can still remain in the socket in other words if you want to test this thing suddenly all you have to do youre sitting there the pc is on the cans dont ever fool around with the meter or set it up after youve got session started by the way just leave it alone thing busts why sit there interestedly and finish the session you really need the data of the meter to finish the session which you normally do then just run end rudiments paying close attention to busted meter and end the session and during the break get another emeter borrow or something or bang it against the radiator or something and make it work but dont go fooling with meter so can leads breaks during session well thats just rough just leave the pc sitting there holding broken can never even make gesture toward repairing it fixing it up nothing because it is serious error when pc particularly is running process or hes deeply interiorized hes very much insession all of sudden the auditors interest is on the meter and the second the auditors interest is visibly on the meter the pc knows that the auditors interest is not on him the auditors attention is longer helping the pc plow through his bank and it yanks the pc straight out of session i dont care how the pc said he didnt mind it look at your tone arm reads if you could or fooling around with busted meter suddenly shaking it you know and saying oh well what the hell is soonandso on youve had it your pc is youve just laid in nice juicy interruption of session it can be far more important than you realize so when your meter busts your cans break anything of this sort of thing happens if you can carry on the rest of the session without an emeter why just do so come to normal conclusion of the thing run your end rudiments with your eye on the pc and you know keep an eye on him glance at your meter if you want to dont make fake out of yourself and bring your session to close if you can do anything about the meter why do it during the break see dont monkey with the meter during session ever that is just hallmark of nervous auditor who just doesnt know his business because smack the pcs attention comes off blang the bank goes in on the pc boom and its cruel thing to do now when youre testing for set then the pc could have been given the cans but you couldnt possibly have started the session yet well the least commotion you can make if you notice the jack that goes into the side of mark iv here is quite long well all you have to do is pull the jack out just to that degree that it isnt connecting you see thats very short in see just its just not connecting theres only maybe half an inch of jack shaft showing and that is plenty in order to set your trim knob in other words you just pull that out till you feel it unsnap thats all you have to do and bring it over here to 20 and then bring your trim knob down here and snap that jack in and its functioning right this minute got the idea so to test you just feel that thing unsnap dont take it out just when you test the thing just feel it unsnap and now you can set the thing to set now snap it back in its very fast action that you can take there it doesnt take very long now these mark ivs are the first meter that doesnt have drift this is the first meter that doesnt have drift the mark iii the mark i in the progress of session would go off as many as four or five dial marks it would drift those mark is would drift that far off this isnt important of course unless youre testing for clear but youve got to have some kind of idea of it if youre auditing somebody whos getting blowdowns and that sort of thing youve got to have some idea of what that thing is accurately session by session otherwise your tone arm reads are all different session by session your tone arm reads are different but in the course of an hour or two the 1957 american meter by warming up and there is some slight warmth that goes into the transistors in spite of this but the american meter of course burns much more juice than this mark iv enormously this thing will run for year or so without any battery shift and that other one actually if its used if you happen to leave it on accidentally overnight why youve probably had it anyway to get back to what i was talking about when you set this thing up it will stay that way because the mark iv is the first meter which has got counterbalance now theres way to set this up so that it will never drift but this is sort of taking micrometer caliper you know to measuring ladys dress you just dont need that quite that much accuracy there are two separate components which set up the trim on this its very tricky little arrangement on the thing and i knocked out the first one i would not okay the first arrangement it would have driven you mad because you turned on one knob and set it and then waited for minute and then trimmed it with another knob and it had two trim knobs well that for sure never never would have drifted it was there with clank but its just like measuring ladys dress with micrometer caliper its just too much precision this one has solved that situation by putting both of these components into the same trim knob in the first few seconds that your meter is on youre going to get drift because your current is adjusting through the transistors thats just the first very short period that the meter is on you will sometimes see bit of drift youll see it expressed by the tone arm it has to be shifted you put the pc on the cans are icecold and its really the pc gets the cans warm more than it is the meter but the moment that these aluminum cans adjust to his hand temperature and the transistors got that first surge of juice through them the set then remains now even up to the mark iii you had condition occasionally where the meter audited itself and it would develop rock slam all by its lonesome without any slightest assistance from pc auditor or anybody else which i think was pretty smart but it was anticipating things little bit and so on well now what thats all about is dust in the pot now these terms are not my terms they are terms from that unlikely race called electronics men and this unlikely crew managed to name things f24rs if you ever have any complaints about scientologese and its nomenclature and so forth get into electronics sometime thats really ball listen to couple of hams burning up vast amounts of electricity talking to each other from canada to panama and one may be talking with an english accent and one may be talking with spanish accent but inevitably it will be well ive fixed this rig with an f4r now and it condenses far more better but theres leak going through the sixseven i listen to it by the hour because its sort of theres wonderful fascination to listening to total gobbledygook theres end of these terms i thought well after youve been ham for while you see why you could run off maybe fifty sixty of these terms you know and you just had it cold and you could lean casually up against the set and say well know ive just transferred the f4r and the sixseven is operating very smoothly i thought you could do that but holy cats theres sixsixes sixeights and sixnineandahalves but there is sixnine you know i mean its they sure have good time i mean you can turn them on here if you can get them on the air on your portable radio and you can listen to them sawin away about their sixsevens and f4rs its all they ever talk about the whole area could be burning down in total flood and thousands of people dying you see for lack of communication and theyd sit there and say well their sixsevens did not adjust now well with their f4rs its marvelous ive had battle by the way in progress with an electronics operator on my end as my talker to combat craft that were in action and all they could ever talk about was i am hearing you sail one how how am i coming through have you adjusted your sixseven and so forth and im trying to tell him listen are you talking to that guy at all well my 4r is at listen are you talking to him at all can you hear him at all oh oh yeah yeah well not very good we havent got it tuned in can you hear him at all can he hear you oh well yes yes well goddamn it tell him right standard rudder and get out of there hes about to be sunk oh well okay well now my sixsevens are poor coxswain on the other craft he doesnt even know anybodys trying to get in touch with him now ive had time with this sort of thing undoubtedly developed overts in one lifetime or another on this subject so anyway i always consider that bit out of my province ive had enough overts on it so ive kind of backed out of it if i was ever in it but anyhow the thing is called pot which sits underneath this tone arm and this is pot and they have carbon pots and wirewound pots and carbon pots wear out and god help you if youve got some squirrel meter with carbon pot its very hard to get wirewound pots they have to be specially made and theyre very specially made for these mark ivs theyre wirewound so that the component parts of the thing dont wear and loosen on earlier american meters as i understand it and anybody should forgive my ignorance in this particular line because i just designed the thing i didnt make it i didnt really design it either i just made sure that whoever designed it followed his first ideas you know that sort of thing and then made sure that he redesigned it so that it worked too i did the sjambok work on it anyway the pot here can on carbon pot which you get on cheap meter is wearable it wears then dust gets in it and one little tiny particle of dust in that pot which is the pivot and set capacity here on this sunkin area one little particle of dust in there and it wont connect straight it has interference in its own lines so you busily set it up here and you get wobble wobble wobble wobble wobble wobble wobble on your meter see you got interference into the pot furthermore the dust gets into it as i understand it because of the wear if theyre ordinary carbon and nothing but carbon the wear factor is great enough to permit dust to get into them and if theyre wirewound you dont get that much wear and you dont get this same dust interference in other words that audits itself apparently comes out of this pot now there is way to take an old meter and stop it from auditing itself you take some lighter fluid and squirt it down here on the pivot underneath this tone arm and work the tone arm rapidly but sometimes in session if it started auditing itself one of the oldtype meters if you simply shiver the tone arm this way itll stop rock slamming and sometimes wont but some lighter fluid squirted in there on that sudden rock slam there it is now the way would fix it up but the way to find out if meter is working is not to leave it hooked in dont leave the meter hooked in and so forth on the leads if you want to find out whats happening with the meter if its the meters fault just snap that lead out im not recommending you do this while youre auditing pc this is during the break you just snap that just unsnap that thing and then set the thing over here to set and if its doing something weird and if the meter itself is off and is wrong why of course the pc isnt connected to it now and if it goes on rock slamming or goes on doing something peculiar it must be the meter because there is nobody else on it its gremlin in it thats being audited so thats your first action if you want to find out if your meters auditing itself or something of that sort or if it was the pc just disconnect this thing over here just disconnect it disconnect it and you then have your pc off of it and if the meter is doing something why there it is now the first thing you want to know about an emeter and this is serious this is actually such simple piece of stupidity that you wouldnt think anybody could ever do it but ive done it and for sure you can do it every once in while you will because the more reliable meter gets the less attention you pay to the actual meter and every once in while you pick up meter and you put the pc on it and you wont realize that youre auditing the pc on broken meter and just nothing happens and the last thing you look at is the meter because it doesnt happen very often you see so you want to know first and foremost at the beginning of every session if the pc is reading on the meter do you have the pc hooked to the meter thats what you want to know and thats about the end of the test see is your meter sitting there quietly with pc on it well you learn that when you put the trim knob to set until you set it up here with sensitivity 2 tone arm 20 bring it over here to set with the trim knob bang bang bang one two three see and of course if you had your transit in the proper place you turn your transit to set click the meter on on the sensitivity knob put it to 2 put the other one to 20 and then trimmed it over here to set all right now you can understand thats not hooked into the pc see you havent got that lead snapped in so if the meter is dancing or the meter is wildly swinging or youre getting marked rise or something else is going on on the meter well it must be in the meter because the pc isnt hooked to it see thats your first adjudication so if thats just part of your drill why one you find out the meters all right it is sitting there quietly if you wanted to make doubly sure except it isnt worth testing except very infrequently you just swing it over here to test bang and it goes way up by the way you know i made mistake in the original drillout on this when i was testing this i gave the manufacturers of this thing theyve been in conference after conference they consider very trying fellow and so on and then one day i got one of them on the meter and i showed him reactions on the meter and i audited black area he was stuck in and moved him with tremendous sensation of speed that is to say he had this fantastic sensations and theyve been very respectful of the meter ever since that they do good job now but they consider im pretty picky picky petty i want leads that dont come off the cans all the time and other petty things you know hardly worth it the last wire they offered for testing before we went into the present production run by the way smelled just like hospital you could smell it all over the room it was some new kind of plastic wouldnt that have been lovely to audit anybody with and so on you more than break out your emeter he goes into the engram of the operation i dont know where they got that plastic wire i made them knock it off they did so but it was very petty of whod mind an odor like that anyway theyre good fellows they got this thing into state of steadiness and somnolence and all of that sort of thing and i tested it out and then accidentally left the meter on because it was just test meter and i wasnt doing anything with it didnt mean to really test it and left it on for day or two or three and all of sudden its well ill show you what it is cant make this one do it they fouled up i cant make this one do it they this ones too live the original model of mark i they gave it to and after the thing was over here at set you could turn the trim knob and bring it down off the test area if your trim knob was totally out in other words the meter would test as though its batteries were flat got the idea you could shift the trim knob so that youd get zero battery charge you had battery in it obviously the batteries were run down so i said what the devil how much stuff is this thing consuming you know and big ruckus you know about it peter handling the correspondence on it you know and calling up on the phone calls and back and forth and so forth meter is wearing out you know batteries wear out in this thing in twentyfour hours its good pile of junk you know thats why we got to cut down its battery consumption well sometimes of course youd turn it on and it would show full charge but then because you could vary the set position with the trim knob of course your test over here could be varied too and i notice now on the mark iv theyve disconnected it so we cant make that mistake anyhow so they left one on for weeks and weeks and weeks and they couldnt get it to run down so we were having terrible argument i was sure the thing was running down and they were sure that the thing was lasting for weeks and then we finally found out what was going on the meter was being set up in certain fashion that its trim knob could vary its test over here wonder if theres any way under the sun i can make that do that now by george you know pretty smart fellows they fixed that up so it wouldnt do it they said well if the old man can do it we better do something about that and they did by golly it wont make that mistake anyway just to get on with this youd snap it over here onto test see if it landed for full battery charge see make sure your batteries were charged by the needle going on over and being in the proper area bring it back over here to set adjust that sensitivity knob to 2 adjust the other one to 20 bring your set up here on your trim knob to set and then thats halfway out theoretically snap it in and then tell the pc to squeeze the cans he thinks thats for him that isnt its for you you want to see how much hes dropping you set him with thirdofadial drop well if this meter is out of operation and it isnt connected to the pc youre not going to get any needle behaviour when he squeezes the cans and youll never make the horrible error of running pc on dead meter see youd never make that mistake it isnt likely to happen with these new meters but it sure was likely to happen with the old ones and it could happen again now there you are cheerfully sitting there being an auditor left and right and center and somehow or another the pc is seems to be over here around he seems to be he uh hmmmm huhhuh where is he at or the pc gets reaction and tone arm action so the process must be flat process must be flat i mean there it is see that could be disconnected just lookahere but supposing you just sat there and you audited something on this order and you just went on auditing you just went on auditing you just went on auditing you just went on auditing yeah i know the can isnt plugged in female voice what if youve got your jack partially plugged in well you see youd even get some motion occasionally see what you could do and it wouldnt have anything to do with the price of fish you know youd say well i dont know id never get that down oh yeah actually getting very live there we are you go nuts you know so frankly if you were going to make thorough drill that would never get you in any kind of trouble of any kind whatsoever what you do you see is just plug it in you just take it up to set here very nicely true true true then snap it in and tell your pc tell your pc to squeeze the cans whats the matter with this meter hmmm meters off it isnt reading at 30 with on it anyhow i must have been working hard today but anyhow it isnt off the first action is is the meter working and the second action is it working on the pc and if you keep those two things in order and always keep them in mind you wont make some silly mistakes occasionally as almost any auditor sooner or later has made one is the meter working well of course thats easily told because you set it up here for set 20 and so on now just look at it moment dont you see and say well i dont know is it doing anything peculiar see is it racking around is it doing anything peculiar its just sitting there being good meter furthermore battery test if you wanted to do something like that that would tell you even further that it was charged up except i assure you its not going to run down but about once year if that you know you can leave this thing on day and night in the box it burns up just about the same amount of current on that it does off thats one of the most fantastic things i wouldnt have believed it i wouldnt advise you doing this because it cans might be shorted or something out you know if you did this im sure it would burn more current supposing we had this see thats great now you got your cans together thats dead short well of course thats going to consume more current but with your cans apart as far as it goes with the cans apart and your lead unplugged the thing will just sit there actually with the cans connected to that degree the thing will just sit there endlessly it wont burn any more current on than off which is remarkable fact then youd make sure your meter was okay and then you turn it over to the pc here you put the pc on the cans and youd say to the pc its off the same way and you say squeeze the cans see and all right to the degree that he squeezes the cans you got the idea see to the degree that he squeezes the cans coordinates with the meter in other words you see the meter act when he squeezes the cans you know you see him squeeze the cans and you see the meter act well now you are absolutely certain that the meter is reading the pc and thats for your own assurance now you say fine see do something like adjust the pcs chair and get the rudiments in but that is the end of your meter worry now you dont worry about that meter from there on and if the meter suddenly does something weird goes utterly flat one of two things can be wrong the meter can read at 70 between 60 and 10 70 is located between 60 and 10 because of the construction of the meter itself it wont go to 70 actually person can read at clear read of about 20 and be totally dead thetan get your emeter essentials and when the case starts to improve he improves by going down to 15 10 70 65 and you occasionally in running people will have meter which has to be caught between 10 and 60 and 10 and 60 and all of sudden the pc isnt on it anyplace and you think the meters busted itd be very rare probably wont stay there more than half session or something like that blahda deblehzzh where is he in order to keep the meter at all you were probably going like this already see and then all of sudden uhuhuh uhuhuh pc cannot be found on the meter the pc is at 70 he might stay there for while he might stay there only for few minutes he might stay there for while but its apparently very rare position its very difficult to maintain that much density is very hard to master and its almost an intolerable position so he wont be there very long i think its happened on this course once hasnt it suzie female voice yes yes and an auditor was sitting there going batty who was that somebody they were sitting she was sitting there going mad because she thought her meter was out you see thats one chance in years of auditing it happens because its very hard position to maintain i dont know how people can evidently maintain 15 on the sensitivity on tone arm they can maintain 15 and just sit there they can get to 12 and thats all right and get down here to 10 or little bit below and it becomes very unstable they become unstable that is to say theres too much density they cant tolerate it and their next stopping ground is about 60 but they can very very rarely get hung up on 70 youll think your meter isnt operating if you want to check your meter just check it as meter unsnap your jack over here and is your meter operating see meters operating and all of sudden you put him on you wont be able to get him on the dial with the tone arm see but he shouldnt stay there very long itll happen to you very rarely if your meters gone out of operation youre usually aware of it from other sources and causes the thing is still on in some fashion and so on and just isnt operating but the chances of the meter going out in the middle of session are quite rare the meter is usually knocked out not by sessioning meter is knocked out by being dropped sat on and used to eat ice cream with and somebody pours quart of wine into the thing because they havent got cup or to oil up the works during drunken new years eve party or something of course youd have to run it as an overt afterwards youve got bad situation with the meter normally when its out of use and the meter is usually in far more danger out of use than it is in use very seldom does meter get beaten up very badly in session but just casually you put your meter back with your baggage in the back end of car you dont know what that meters doing during that trip that meter might be shifting away from the suitcase and it might be going up against the spare tire and maybe its sort of hitting the edge of the spare tire and bouncing onto the rim and off you know during the whole trip and you get at the other end your meter isnt operating well youll catch that before the session begins the other thing is is they dont half break meter never half breaks it either its kind of yea or nay it works or it doesnt work well theres reason to hold your head in your hands over whether is the meter working and dont develop any big anxiety because i think ive only run one session in my life where meter started doing something weird and that was with an old american meter with carbon pot and about the middle of the session the pc started to rock slam and rock slammed continuously matter what i did and i finally got smart enough to realize there was something wrong with the meter turned the meter off and finished the session and that was when i first learned about lighter fluid and that fixed up the dust in the thing and it operated all right afterwards now in other repairs in other repair factors or detection factors on meter youve got this this to consider once in blue moon you will see any meter drift it starts drifting now all of the old meters drift and you just cant do thing about it in other words with the cans unplugged here and with the thing on set properly youll see that needle start to depart in reverse rise itll start to go away from set toward fall its unplugged see and you havent got anything plugged in and itll just start going in the direction of fall it looks something like this oh much slower than this and its very even it just starts drifting up very evenly in the direction of fall the word fall there just evenly drifting and itll just go on drifting its all unplugged and so forth thats because its transistors and so forth arent well equalized and it wont settle itself down maybe it stops it after couple of minutes at which time thats all right in other words the old meters the old mark is mark iis mark iiis and the old american meter and lord knows what the last three years worth of meters american meters do or dont do but here is this thing will always drift you turn them on the cans are not plugged in the jack isnt in and itll drift well dont worry about it dont worry about it because thats just normal to the meter and its going to drift for two three five minutes and if you want to do clear checkout youve got to reset them and if they havent got any reset on the thing well the best thing to do is to get 5000 ohm and 12500ohm resistor and plug it across the cans and find out how much your meter is off and remark it with piece of sticky plaster thats all you can do you can find out what is the resistance across the two cans 12500 ohms you just plug it plug resistor across and then set the tone arm here exactly where its supposed to go and then 5000 ohms across the two cans and set the tone arm where its supposed to go mark it in those two positions and it will give you the clear read for that particular meter you can get these resistors they look like little piece of lead or something with couple of clips on the end of them you can buy those things they cost you practically nothing at an electrical shop they have resistors like mad theyre always having resistors electronics men deal mainly with resistors and so you got lots of them anyway you can set one of those old meters but its going to drift dont think that it wont its going to drift that isnt serious well now listen when one of these british meters starts drifting when mark iv starts drifting get it to somebody to fix it because theres something wrong with the meter theres something wrong with the meter you dropped it or its got transistor shaken loose or theres something gone wrong in the meter you notice as i sit here this thing is not drifting you can turn it off cool it that is it goes totally cold turn it back on again itll be right there bang but my own personal meter which you can imagine gets some of the roughest of use as far as auditing is concerned was mark iii and that was pretty well adjusted and few weeks ago i looked at it and it was drifting i sent it back to the manufacturer and had it fixed up and well its just it had aged it had aged it had lived long and active life and it is longer keeping its set mark but there was something wrong with it there was disconnection inside of it now how do you get missed one of these things repaired well frankly weve had to send them to the commonwealth areas so often that we have pretty well full set of specification of what gets wrong with them because the commonwealth areas have had to make these up and joburg for instance has whole rundown on what gets wrong with this meter they know far more about what gets wrong with all the old mark is mark iis and mark iiis than the manufacturers did because they had to take them down there and whenever theyd repair them why one of the instrument people in the immediate area they gradually assembled this information they got its circuits from the manufacturer they checked it out and they finally got so they could snap meter back into action faster than scat but im just trying to tell you that repair manuals for an electronics man someplace or another will be in existence and at the moment are obtainable your easiest method of getting one fixed usually you send it to central organization theyve already got somebody all contacted to fix up the emeter with snap or hco ww we send it to fowler and allen with sneer theres always sneer enclosed with the return you send it to us we put the sneer in and send it back to fowler and allen you see and they can fix them up theyre good boys its taken them quite while to get this meter so it can be shipped so it can be dropped so it can be kicked and booted around and arrive at other ends of things one of the major things that happened to the mark i ii and iii for your own interest is the little transistors in the things became disconnected in shipment actually extreme heat or cold or something it had something to do with the solder they were using or something but actually it popped out theyd arrive at the other end with disconnected transistor or break but they were not in proper packing at the time and they now come to you in very sleek latex or cardboard pressboard form fit cover when theyre shipped airmail your first action on receipt of one of these things of course is to put the batteries in it and so on or get some batteries and put them in we of course hco ww will always put batteries in your meter for you free of charge we couldnt care less that is the wildest manufacturers guarantee you ever heard of not that were manufacturers were not but you could always make this kind of claim because you put in maybe one shilling worth of batteries every couple of years that doesnt seem to be much of an action we said that early when we were putting in an odd kind of battery but these new kinds of battery are very stable but im just giving you some odds and ends of background maybe its interesting to you maybe it isnt but it has been quite fight trying to get meter and trying to get it stable and trying to get it so it can be shipped and trying to get it so it can stand up to some of the pcs that look at them and you need something thats quite close to indestructible and this meter takes quite beating and weve gradually worked those bugs out of the thing just in time too because apparently well have to replace nearly all of the meters in central organizations in the united states here in england and so forth weve got to get rid of the rest of these meters the old ones because they wont clear anybody and they apparently dont operate sufficiently accurately on sec check well you ask somebody have you ever murdered your wife hes just got through with it the grave dirt is all over his shoes you see and it falls by the time the next question is asked you know have you ever powdered your nose thats an exaggeration and dirty crack but you can see that your instant read law doesnt apply to them well now the use of the meter depends mainly on the operator this particular meter cannot be influenced by looking at it or putting pieces of energy into it i do have meter however that is right here i think we have meter the beep meter and ill have to break that out and show you all about how you can influence meter because you really can influence meter you cant influence this meter to make it read or to do something peculiar but dont think you cannot influence another persons body with energy that is once you get the knack of doing it by the way nonscientologist just cant do it you can give them all of the understanding they possibly can have you can make them do it all right they can follow all the directions but they just dont have enough horsepower and its called beep meter and you put it up against somebodys cheek it detects pain chiropractors used it and you can put it around and where fellow has pain or on his spine or something you know old piece of beer bottles lodged in the spine i dont know quite what theory they go on but anyway they have pain and you put this beep meter over the area of pain and if its tuned right and the exact area where the pain is the patient is feeling pain you put the meter on it and the meter says beeeeep and you take it off the area of pain and the meter ceases to beep fascinating its an interesting piece of electronic mumbojumbo well thats fascinating because the first time i started playing around with one of these things back in phoenix long time ago i took look at one of these things and i wondered what made it do that you know and i absentmindedly it was against somebodys cheek and i just absentmindedly said well that ought to be well connected you see and it went beeeep well i went around for several days you know thinking i was the only one who wore ostrich plumes you know and i showed some of the boys around the place all about this and so on and they got very interested and theyd grunt few times and grit their teeth little bit and all of sudden beep they could turn it on on anybody else in other words they take this electrode and mr doakes having nothing to do with the person who was performing it puts this little button against his cheek he could feel tingle of electricity in it but the meters dead null now the operator is over there several feet away and at will can make the meter turn on by connecting this to mr doakess thetan get the idea and hed connect this up and make current go through it you know hes several feet away and he can look at him and just go errr hmm click you know actually what you do is turn any black area you see white you know you quote see the black area or see the barrier quote unquote and you just see it and then just turn it white you know and you make it connect see and the meter will go beeeep and you can turn it off and then turn it on and turn it off and turn it on and finally even you realize youre doing it the first moment that you realize youre doing this it makes you quite nervous because youre not even near the meter and youre not even near the person who is holding it and youre not in him at the moment and yet you can turn that thing on and off on and off on and off so since then subsequently i have shoved this beep meter at lot of people who were not scientologists ive tried to show them you know id turn it on at will you know id have to move my hand you know saying well i make the thing beep along with my hand and so they realized what was doing it and they couldnt what you know and id say well you go ahead and do it all you do is look you see and you just connect the thing through you know its an easy trick you just connect the electrodes through to the person you see theyd say yeah all right and theyd grit their teeth you know and they would grunt and ohhh the beep meter sits there quiet as mouse wont do thing just wont do thing its quite interesting i also ran into this on testing corn on testing the liveness of plants and that sort of thing newspaper reporter can actually come along and take the leaf of the plant and crush it in his hand bap it touch it so forth and nothing happens to the meter thats connected to the plant i walk by the plant and the meter goes boom just touch one leaf with my little finger you know just clich and it goes znnnn see the meter reacts and you could do it i suddenly realized that this was something scientologists could do and people couldnt that was my first detection that we must be of different crew but people actually cannot turn this beep meter on unless they themselves are in fairly good shape its not that theyre into trained skill they just have less horsepower they can see these things yes you can show them to them yes they can see them and they grunt and they grit their teeth to get it to connect to get it to connect and the meter sits there you come along you glance at the electrode it goes beep masters voice we have that meter ill have to bring it out and set it up for you practically electrocutes you its mathison if you want to thats not dirty crack necessarily thats hallmark of all of these mains meters not only do they vibrate as well to the elevator going up and down as they do to the pc but they also vibrate very splendidly very gorgeously to any slightest interference inside the meter itself and they make the pc very nervous because they throw i dont know 340 or id think its about 240 volts go through the electrodes you can really tell theyre on and the more youre processed the more youre aware of things in general as your awareness goes up of course these things become almost intolerable i hate to hold them myself its all right i was holding 240 volts the other night i had dryer in the darkroom on some pictures i was making and it decided to short out and it 240 volts i didnt mind anything but the force involved with the thing its quite an amount of force in that much dead short but some pcs it actually feels that bad to them on some of these mainsconnected meters and this thing you get burning sensation off of the electrode theres just too much juice going through it we never were able to cure the manufacturer of pouring the juice into the pc not into the valves so probably could be sued for libel for saying so but i would prove it in court he wouldnt dare sue for libel id put him on one of his own meters and say is it actually true that you have an overt against us you see now whom have you shocked with electricity and of course hed get the just restimulate the motivator because he wouldnt ever give the withhold you see and then hed multiply the amount say thats pretty good idea you know any one of these days ill go back to practicing law anyway its an easy life you never never really have to do anything anyway not just to tire you out on the subject the meter itself is uninfluenceable from standpoint of looking at it from the back and sitting there and making it read like an emeter should read you understand making it read like an emeter should read therefore youve got to do body motion drills and youve got to know what an emeter looks like when its reading on pc you understand its requires that kind of view now ray made film several months ago and i finally reviewed the thing which is training film on emeters just an experimental film he didnt intend anything more than that for it i learned quite bit from the technical manufacture of the film what well have to do in order to square it up and make it read one of the things i learned that we dont dare use faked read we dont dare use animation in other words to get our emeter reads in the training film they look like what they are body motions and if you learn to read body motion if anybody were doing this which is quite unlikely i assure you but if anybody were doing this theyve got the back of the meter to them so its very difficult for them to find the needle theres sense in going into the guts of the thing and pushing currents around in the guts of it thats silly when really the way you can influence it and make it read you can as thetan knock the needle with beam and it looks just exactly like body motion and you see im using my finger to show you but you actually get this thing in some kind of state and you just knock the thing back and forth more force and you can actually make it tick but its jerky tick you know it is you not your body but it is you and you can actually put beam on the side of the needle and slap it you can make it go click click and ive practiced on it quite bit i can never make it look like anything but body motion i cant even make it look like good healthy rock slam itd never fool an auditor it might fool somebody who doesnt know much about emetering but it would never fool an auditor first place i wouldnt use it to fool anybody im just trying to find out about moving around objects and one of the easiest objects to move around is the emeter needle if you stand back looking at the dial and make it go ting ting ting dont you see thats an easy thing to do but it should never fool you as an auditor because it looks like just what it is which is mechanically influenced motion now as far as influencing the emeter is concerned you dont have to worry about the pc influencing the meter if you put in end rudiments have you influenced the emeter that should take that off of your mind now factually for any read that youre going to get consistently on the thing for somebody throwing the emeter so that an experienced auditor couldnt tell it hed have to be pretty smooth because he has to get to the same speed of reaction of the reactive mind which is instantaneous and you always get latent reads on an influenced meter so you never pay any attention to them anyhow the fellow has to hear willow wand then he has to think oh yes thats the terminal i want oh all right now i will wiggle my toes and the way it looks to the auditor of course is willow wand click see willow wand click willow wand oh that was the one click and it doesnt look like an instant read and furthermore it always looks like body motion now i saw very experienced auditor fooled with body motion one time fooled with body motion you talk about influencing the meter actually pc said i cannot keep my hand from trembling when you say that word and was flickering their little finger on and off the can see knowingly see flickering their finger on and off the can you know dah dahdahdah and youd say willow wand or waterbuck or whatever it was and youd say willow wand and well theres there it is you know i just cant keep my hand from trembling when the auditor finally detected it your hands trembling when i say that well yes i just cant keep it from trembling and do you know that the auditor actually told you know its funny thing that she cant keep her hand from trembling whenever i say that three or four or five sessions later when additional assessment had been made on this pc it all of sudden came up as withhold they had knowingly been trembling their finger on and off of the can while their hand couldnt be controlled get the idea but you will get latent read because they cant hear it and put the thing into action as fast as the reactive mind hears it and puts it into action you see and its always bit late therefore you shouldnt ever monkey around with meter with latent reads now theres damping action put into most offball offbeat meters meter i have ever okayed has ever had damper in it ive found lot of meters that had dampers in them the old green and gold english meter had damper in it so that it was guaranteed to read one and onehalf seconds late and before an acc got going i had poor electronics man around there with pair of snippers taking these dampers off of them and man there was wire lying all over the floor when they finally got loose but those green and gold meters always afterwards providing i had they had gone under my notice at all had dampers in them and they would read instantly but there are many meters that this has not happened with there are many offball meters and nearly all of them have dampers in them so you say waterbuck comm lag read have you ever burned down house comm lag read maybe all right now the latent read would be have you ever burned down house read you just havent got that much time in other words you couldnt even assess with one you could go down an assessment list and by the time you would hit the second read you would get the first read see you would say waterbuck waterbuck and youd get read only its the read for the first waterbuck you said got the idea so you wouldnt know what it is now lets look at the additional complication you would say has waterbuck shot you you know thats your test question all right has waterbuck shot read you oh it was waterbuck that read if shot was alive it would have come in well after you so you would have had has waterbuck shot read you read see and all of sudden you dont know whats reading and if you notice in your prehav assessing you have to carefully say and if you hadnt realized this you realize that your terminal is active and that the activeness of your terminal interferes with the prehav level read you notice that so youve got to have an instant reading meter and youve got to have the prehav level distinctly read different than the terminal so you say has waterbuck let the read get out of the road you see shot you well you actually dont have to pause after shot because you is not charged usually so you say has waterbuck shot you well that lets waterbucks read get out of the road before we run into shot you see and when youre assessing like that you have to pay attention to that because you get sporadically reading terminal that you say you test it out in the first place say waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck waterbuck and youll see that it reads see all right thats constant read thats fine you could always tell that but waterbuck read waterbuck read waterbuck read and of course your terminal is getting weak at this time and its fading out and its not reading well and youre trying to assess for the thing so you wouldnt quite know what was lagging and what wasnt lagging or if it wasnt or isnt so you just put in the pause anyhow and you have to have an instant reading meter you cannot assess on the prehav scale and nobody has ever been able to assess on the prehav scale in the absence of an instant reading meter now do you see why i say american clearing english clearing could very well have gone up the spout just on these factors you could never have assessed the prehav scale has waterbuck shot you read oh well shot is alive oh hell it was waterbuck that read way over there and you never could have disentangled them so that you always would have been running the wrong prehav level the least that would have been happening on the pc as far as security checking is concerned they just dont security check ive already tried to security check on an offbeat meter and have laid an egg and made one of the most serious errors i think i ever made in auditing trying to do some kind of security check to get rudiments in and get the pc in communication and i just missed like mad why i had every reason to i was using one of these old wooden potentiometer pieces of junk dc decca voltmeter practically nothing more than soldered leads into both sides of potentiometer you see and i didnt know that in that particular one the electronics man had built in damper not only was it lousy meter but he had also built in damper so that you would ask your question and you say well has waterbuck shot you read and it read like that on all of these questions and i couldnt sort out the read on the thing i didnt quite know what was the matter with it but i couldnt sort out withhold and not having sorted out the withhold i muffed on that pc i just couldnt get the withhold couldnt get it straight i couldnt get what the pc was all about because sometimes it was damping and sometimes it wasnt damping it was never instant reading but sometimes the damp was sufficient to take all the read off the question so i would think it was clear you see and it would ride like that for four five questions at which time i was perfectly happy to let go of it see subject comes up again in another five minutes i ask the question and its still live on lag read and i finally got wise to the fact that the confounded thing it isnt that the pc is reading sporadically on this at all the pc is reading wildly accurately on this but what the hell it is i cant find out because the meter is only registering the pc now and then ooooh that was nightmare i never did get the pc straightened out or in session anyway im just giving you little background music and little data on this thing and try to take the pressure off your brains at the present moment because the pressure on your brain must be considerable some of you are running terminals which are going up to 8 and it isnt even on the tone arm dial so that must be very rough indeed but where your handling of an emeter is nervous i can tell you just as summary here its because youre not familiar with the thing youre not familiar with it you havent slept with it and you havent eaten with it and youre still handling it as though its strange cat and just reach and withdraw from the meter i mean that just reach and withdraw from the meter for while just say what is this thing and all of sudden it will seem more like an old friend the next thing is is youre not sure its registering the pc well all right be assured of that by making the pc squeeze the cans and then youll find out that at least its registering his body motion so the probability is it will register something else at least assure yourself of that does it read the pc and if youre nervous ever get nervous about meters its because you have never reassured yourself that the meter is just sitting there idle that it doesnt do anything itself when its not hooked into the pc so if you take your drill and on the basis you pick up the meter i dont care if you give the pc the cans or not he hasnt got anything to do and hed rather you be handing him the cans than him be sitting there while you fiddle with the meter see and just dont plug it in just put it in little bit into the jack and then if you want to be very thorough click it over here to set click to test click it back to set turn the thing on here up to 20 set it right on 20 turn this over set it right on 20 come on down here set it there and sit there for just an instant and look at the meter is it sitting there quietly all right now squeeze it in and tell the pc all right would you please squeeze the cans and then have him squeeze the cans enough time for you to be absolutely sure youve got thirdofadial drop or dial drop whatever youre fishing for that time now you know that the meter reads null without the pc on it and you know now that the pc registers on the meter you know the meter is set up right and at that moment you can forget any nervousness about the meter and just go on about the business of reading the meter and thats all there is to that you just simply go on about the business of reading your meter and if your meter goes out and it all of sudden wildly rock slams and you cant explain it and you cant get the rock slam off or something like that you can always surreptitiously disconnect that thing halfway and throw the tone arm over here casually while carrying right on the session distracting the pc not at all and if that thing is disconnected and your meter is rock slamming itll only be doing this on some old meter but if your meter is still rock slamming just slide it back in casually and forget about it that is your safest action you can however on some of the old meters jiggle this tone arm two or three times here but now youre liable to be distracting the pc if you jiggle it two or three times and your meter now doesnt rock slam dont be at all sanguine that it wont start in another three or four minutes you see so the safest thing to do with the thing you slip that thing out smiling sweetly at the pc the meanwhile and you look at the thing and while its disconnected from the pc set it over here so that its near set with the tone arm its rock slamming heh heh heh heh its rock slamming just slide the thing back in go on carry on your session if youre assessing well god help you say well thats fine now well we made pretty good progress on this list we got three level we got well we got three items straightened out all right thats thats fine now were going to run now were going to run some havingness now were going to run some havingness and here we go we run some havingness now were going to run end rudiments and some more havingness well guess you got through the last fortyfive minutes that you had left of that particular session but dont get through the last fortyfive minutes by shutting it off suddenly and just say well just moment im not going to end the session now because this isnt going to take very very long i wonder whats the matter with this thing ive never and so forth and go rushing down into the other office you see and so forth joe have you have do you know whats wrong with this meter and so forth skip it that one action that one action has cost more pcs their aplomb than anything else i can think of now another thing is weve tried to get these cans fixed up so that pcs can direct orchestras with them but by george its hard thing to do you notice on the old ones however that the lead can be split further than they ever split them have you noticed that you can always pull that lead little bit further apart when the two wires are lying close together but on new ones with solid cord all the way you cant do this and sometimes theyre too close on so you have to split them somehow some way split your wire down get it far apart this meter by the way this particular set of cords if i were using this meter and making it my own instead of just the lecture meter down here there we are now you notice here that i have that that far apart do you realize that is not far enough apart because pc see he gestures out with one hand with the other one in his lap and he cant make full gesture the width you want this thing apart is enough to make full gesture you know and its exactly right its exactly the right width if with one can in the pcs lap the other can can be held at arms length by the pc and now youre not going to get into any trouble but if the pc ever goes like this youre not quite there again so if youve got pc who commonly stretches with the cans or something like that split the thing little further you might not notice that it is the shortness of the wire from the v split that gives you all the trouble of the can coming off of the end the cans will never come off the end if there is enough wire on each independent can you understand thats the only real trouble you have with that ive recently made the wire quite malleable in these particular leads so that its not brittle wire also the original british electrode was soldered and that was good because i could see my pretty girl auditors every once in while getting this thing torn out and not having soldering iron in their pocket like some of the male auditors had so these things these little on the electrodes here this screw you find on the electrodes of the mark iv and the little nut that you see inside is not crude manufactured item it is practically over the dead body of fowler and allen they dont want to put them on like that they want nice neat electronic job and i want job so that when the pc yawns sixfoot eightinch pc yawns you see and tears the thing apart at least youve got session break at which time all you have to do is take your nail file notice the width of that screw thats nail file width you can take nail file you can open that thing up you can skin down the wire very easily put new coil of wire around the nut holding the nut inside with your index finger screw it up again with nail file and you have done fast repair job which is quite permanent repair job so those things i insist on i insist that you be able to reconnect your own cans because if this thing is going to break down well lets have point of repair where its going to break some of the old meters and cheap meters have malleable wire which is pardon nonmalleable wire its brittle wire inside these insulation areas and the friction of the wire you know friction of the leads will sometimes make it break inside the wire and your leads wont connect to the emeter or connect sporadically and so on and its just lousy wire that is all its just bad wire in the emeter leads so we insist on that being nice soft wire but remember that can still happen somebody can come down on that with the heel of his shoe exactly right against concrete floor or something like that and manage to practically sever one of these wires or sever one and you would never notice it you would just never notice it because the insulation is still sound and whole but the wire inside the insulation is broken so if you got to desperate state as to why the meter didnt register on the pc if it sits quietly all by itself and the lead its when plugged in wont do thirdofadial drop its in these leads you very often just grab yourself off another set of leads plug it into the same meter and youre off to the races but remember because i insisted on repair doityourself repair is possible on these electrodes you can always because this is very simple jack here you notice how simple that jack is you can always get yourself another piece of ordinary house wiring wire preferably soft copper preferably covered with plastic which wont go brittle on you right away and you can fix up one of these jacks and one of these leads very easily matter where you are you can always get piece of wire if youre in hotel room someplace why just reach into the molding you know and get some of the telephone wire and snip it off and so forth might even tell the management about it when you leave anyway that is these are nonsense points that dont have very much to do with anything and you possibly havent learned very much today but i just wanted to talk to you about the gimmicks and nonsense of the emeter and give you few tips by the way i will say before i close the lecture there is something i am sure some of you do not know this is the older model isnt it these things when these leads get loose you can always tighten them up and you should or you can also get little lock washers and put on these things little tiny lock washers and so on i love british manufacturers its marvelous the only place it ever falls down is lock washers and gasoline lines they dont like lock washers and gasoline lines i always have to take whole car apart and put lock washers in everyplace and put in new gas line im joking now i never take them apart i have somebody else do it but you might not know that this meter is selfpropping meter its just chance that you might not know it these things come down and go over this pin its never been done with this one so therefore its all completely haywire did you see that did you know that meter did this well the meter makes little tent all by itself im sure you knew that but also im also sure that someplace or another somebody doesnt know it thats little invention thats one of these inventions i do by the process of telling people to do it in very firm tone of voice you know fix it up so it will stand all by itself for an auditor and they say but how i say thats your job after all i cant have total monopoly on all the thinkingness in the world so anyway somebody else dreamed this thing up and i think its pretty nice rig these meters stand up better than any other meters ive seen and sometimes these little hooks get off you can buy those hooks at any hardware store or dime store where you can buy these nuts and bolts and put them back together again if somebody treats your meter too rough okay well those are the nonsense parts of the emeter and if you ever get stranded in the middle of the gobi desert without an emeter dont try to clear anybody thank you very much
