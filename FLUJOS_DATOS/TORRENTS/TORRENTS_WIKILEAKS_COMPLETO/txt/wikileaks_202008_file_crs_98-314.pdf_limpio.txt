speaker has recognized will say for example mr speaker i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill hr 1234 by making that motion the member triggers the use of the suspension procedure under rule xv however this same procedure can be used for other legislative purposes for example member can move to suspend the rules and agree to conference report or concur in senate amendment to house bill or take some other action there are nine principal featur of the suspension procedure first the speaker controls the use of this procedure member has right to make suspension motion the speaker decides who to recognize for suspension motions second suspension motions re in order only on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays and during the final days of the annual congressional session the house sometimes agrees to consider suspension motions on other days by agreeing to either unanimous consent request or speci rule for that purpose third there are only 40 minutes of debate on suspension motion and the bill or other action to which it relates time control is usually divided between the chairm an and the ranking minority memberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98314crs2 2 legislative day begins the first time the house meets after an adjournment and ends when the house adjourns againof the committee or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the bill however if the ranking minority member supports the bill another member who opposes it can claim cont rol of half the time for debate fourth when bill is consid ered under suspen sion floor amendments are in order the member making the motion however can include amendments as part of hi s or her motion in that case the member moves to suspend the rules and pass the bill as amended fifth after the 40 minutes of debate there is single vote on suspending the rules and passing the bill the house does not vote first on whether to suspend the rules and then on whether to pass the bill both questions are decided by one vote sixth twothirds vote of the house is required to pass bill under suspension of the rules this is twothirds vote of the members present and voting quorum being present if suspension motion fails to receive the required twothirds vote the house can consider the bill in question again often under proce dures that require only simple majority vote to pass it seventh the speaker can postpone rollcall votes on suspension motions until later on the same day or within the next two legislative days2 and cluster them to occur one after the other when there is series of such rollcall votes memb ers have 15 minutes to vote on the first motion but they usually have only five minutes to vote on each of the other motions eighth there is re quirement that bill must be reported from committee before the house can consider it under suspension one advantage of the suspension procedure is that the committee to which bill was referred does not have to meet formally to vote on reporting it or to prepare written report on the bill ninth the suspension procedure automatically waives all points of order against the bill r other action and agai nst its consideration the procedure suspends all rules of the house except those that govern the suspension procedure itself there is suspension calendar instead during the last floor session of each week member of the majority party leadersh ip usually makes public announcement on the floor about the bills that have been sc heduled tentatively fo r consideration under suspension during the following weekhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98314crs3 for additional information see the
