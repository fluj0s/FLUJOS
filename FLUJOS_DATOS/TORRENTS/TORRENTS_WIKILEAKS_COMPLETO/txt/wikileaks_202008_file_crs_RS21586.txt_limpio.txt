the utility of gaos technology assessment work and options for design of an advisory body this report will be updated as needed office of technology assessment congress established ota in 1972 with passage of pl 92484 it was mandated to assess the consequences of applying technology by preparing comprehensive reports that discussed the pros and cons of policy options about an issue the law effectively augmented existing congressional resources by creating support agency dedicated to providing congress with objective and authoritative analysis of complex scientific and technical issues to aid in policymaking it was intended to facilitate congressional access to expertise and permit legislators to consider objectively information presented by the executive branch interest groups and other stakeholders to controversial policy questions from 1973 until 1995 ota conducted technology assessments requested by committee chairmen for themselves ranking minority members or majority of the committee by the technology assessment board body which was composed of equal numbers of house and senate members and of members from both parties or by the ota director in consultation with the board ota had authority to hire staff and to contract for personnel and studies peak funding in the early 1990s totaled over 20 million annually with about 140 hired staff plus additional contractors ota was effectively eliminated when congress did not appropriate funds for fy1996 for its continued operation and appropriated funds to close congressional research service the library of congress crs2 down the office its archived reports are available via the internet at httpwwwwwsprincetoneduota several reasons were given for terminating otas funding and numerous studies have been written about the rise and fall of the agency critics of ota cited such factors as difficulty in completing reports in time to meet congressional schedules lack of utility to congressional decisionmaking alleged bias toward liberal solutions or partisan politics1 some say that congress can turn to and fund studies by the national academies composed of the national academy of sciences nas the national academy of engineering the institute of medicine and the national research council nrc or utilize the services of gao and the congressional research service crs for information and analysis on science and technology issues2 others disagree and cite the utility of ota studies to decisionmaking and the need for congress to maintain its own support agency devoted to assessing technology3 some former ota staff members and science policy analysts4 have called for resumption of funding for ota or creation of legislative organization to perform otalike functions or to contract with outside groups to perform such functions some members of congress and others have said that if the ota were still operating it might have provided congress with information required to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21586 make important program and policy decisions relating to technological issues5 legislation to fund ota in the 107th congress representative rush holt introduced hr 2148 the ota reestablishment act it

ruled the amendment not in order6 legislation to create an otalike organization for congress since 2001 proposals have been made to create an otalike office in the legislative branch to provide technology assessmentrelated support science and technology assessment service section 153 of s 1716 the global climate change act introduced in 2001 by senator john f kerry would have created science and technology assessment service to provide ongoing independent science and technology advice within the legislative branch assessments would have been conducted using experts selected in consultation with the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21586 national research council nrc the policy research arm of the national academies7 ota had focused on providing information about technologys impacts notably early indications of the probable beneficial and adverse impacts of the applications of technology and other information in contrast the proposed service would have developed information on the uses and applications of technology to address current national science and technology policy issues it would have incorporated some features of ota including bipartisan and bicameral congressional board to govern activities director to carry out policies and manage activities and process to select studies using committee chairmen the board or the director but the assessment service would have used nrc to select experts to conduct assessments provision that was not in the ota law it would not have otas deputy director and technology assessment advisory council the latter which was composed of private experts the comptroller general and the crs director to advise the board on ota operations and on assessment reports it would have had authority to contract and use personnel but would have had less specific authority than ota to purchase and hold property detail personnel from other agencies or obtain information from them it would not have had otas authority to seek assistance from crs and the national science foundation nor to distribute reports language to create an assessment service was included as title xvi of s 1766 introduced in december 2001 s 1766

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21586 board with 12 members of congress 6 from each party and each body the comptroller general and as nonvoting members the crs director and the centers director operating the center would be director and deputy director empowered to act with the permission of the comptroller general to hire staff and enter into contracts to perform assessments the director would have been authorized to establish an advisory panel for each assessment the panels would not be subject to the federal advisory committee act faca 5 uscapp different from the earlier ota any member of congress would have been able to make requests to the board for assessments requests would have had priority as follows requests with bipartisan and bicameral support requests with bipartisan support requests from other members each assessment report would have been subject to rigorous external peer review before delivery to the director who would have sought release approval from the board the bill would have authorized 30 million annually to the comptroller general for the center for the fiscal years 2005 to 2007 in 2004 representative holt offered hamdt 667 to hr 4755 the houses fy2005

continued crs5 authorized 1 million for the study it was amended by samdt 1026 and passed in the senate the provision seemed to focus on study to be conducted by the national academies and on model that might lead to possible funding for small otalike organization to conduct assessments largely by issuing contracts to nonprofit groups the enacted legislative branch appropriations bill did not contain this language the conference report did not specify an assessment topic but three senators requested gao to assess technologies for us border control together with review of the technology assessment process at the same time six house members wrote to gao supporting the pilot technology assessment project after consulting congressional staff gao agreed to assess biometric technologies it used its regular audit processes and also its standing contract with the national academies to convene two meetings which resulted in advice from 35 external experts on the use of biometric technologies and their implications on privacy and civil liberties the resulting report was issued in november 2002 as technology assessment using biometrics for border security gao03174 fy2003 the

mission p 44 according to the conference committee gaos twoyear evaluation of the need for legislative technology assessment showed that such capability would enhance the ability of key congressional committees to address complex technical issues in more timely and effective manner the conferees directed gao to report by december 15 2003 to the house and senate committees on appropriations the impact that assuming technology assessment role would have on its current mission and resources hrept 108279 the bill became pl 10883 gao reported directly to the appropriations committees 9 continued oversight would be provided by the senate rules and house administration committees and through these committees the joint committee on the library of congress he disagreed with suggestions that the gao might be better suited to manage the pilot but said that it is better to start an initial pilot program rather than pilot program at all he envisioned small legislative branch staff using outside nonprofit groups to perform the indepth research rather than the larger ota model with staff of about 200 people and funding of about 20 million office of technology assessment congressional record july 20 2001 pp s8008s8009 crs6 fy2005 gao requested 545000 in fy2005 appropriations for four new fte positions and contract support to establish baseline technology assessment capability allowing gao

procedures to conduct technology assessment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21586 in 2004 senator bingaman introduced s 2556 cosponsored by senator joseph lieberman to establish technology assessment capability in gao the bill referred to the governmental affairs committee proposed to mandate the comptroller general to initiate technology assessment studies himself or at the request of the house senate or any committee to establish procedures to govern the conduct of assessments to avoid duplication of effort with other entities in consultation with the national academies to establish fivemember technology assessment advisory panel and to have contracting authority to conduct assessments it would have authorized 2 million annually to gao to conduct assessments10 further action was taken see also hr 4670 above fy2006 in july 2006 the house science committee held background hearings on the issue of providing scientific and technical advice to congress the url for the hearing is httpwwwhousegovsciencehearingsfull06july2025indexhtm policy issues the following issues could be considered when evaluating alternative technology assessment proposals 1 analysis of the need for more technology assessment information and advice 2 evidence of political support for enhancing legislative capabilities for technology assessment 3 with respect to augmenting gaos core capability to conduct technology assessment the availability of funds the timing and the utility of gaos technology assessments for congressional decisionmaking and the pros and cons of locating large assessment center within gao including its impact on other gao functions including auditing and evaluation activities and 4 the potential benefits and costs of establishing more independent legislative technology assessment function such as in separate otalike support activity or in an existing congressional support agency 10 congressional record june 22 2004 s7180s7182 sen bingaman also documented several reviews of gaos pilot technology assessments he added gao requested additional legislative authorities so that the assessments could be part of their annual budget process
