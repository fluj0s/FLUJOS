result of the conflict some observers estimate that up to 70000 people have been killed from 2003 to the present the government of sudan has denied or severely restricted access to international relief officials in darfur although some aid is now flowing to the area violence against civilians however continues unabated according to united nations officials us agency for international development usaid officials assert that up to 320000 could die by the end of 2004 irrespective of the international response in august 2004 the african union deployed 305 troops from nigeria and rwanda to protect an estimated 80 ceasefire monitors in darfur the mandate of these troops is to monitor ceasefire agreement reached in april 2004 between the government of sudan and two rebel groups the sudan liberation army sla and the justice and equality movement jem in late september 2004 the government of sudan agreed to accept 3500 more troops although the mandate of the african union force

the african union ended without much progress on july 30 2004 the united nations security council passed resolution 1556 calling on the government of sudan to disarm the janjaweed militia and to

sudan the darfur crisis and the status of the northsouth negotiations the crisis in darfur background the current crisis in darfur began in february 2003 when two rebel groups emerged to challenge the national islamic front nif government in darfur the sudan liberation army sla and the justice and equality movement jem claim that the government of sudan discriminates against muslim african ethnic groups in darfur and has systematically targeted these ethnic groups since the early 1990s the government of sudan dismisses the sla and jem as terrorists the conflict pits the three african ethnic groups the fur zaghawa and massaleit against nomadic arab ethnic groups periodic tensions between the largely africanmuslim ethnic groups and the arab inhabitants of darfur can be traced to the 1930s and most recently surfaced in the 1980s successive governments in khartoum have long neglected the african ethnic groups in darfur and have done very little to prevent or contain attacks by arab militias against nonarabs in darfur1 nonarab groups took up arms against successive central governments in khartoum albeit unsuccessfully in the early 1990s the nif government which came to power in 1989 began to arm arab militias and attempt to disarm the largely african ethnic groups the current crisis the current conflict in darfur burgeoned when the government of sudan and its allied militia began campaign of terror against civilians in an effort to crush rebellion and to punish the core constituencies of the rebels at the core of the current conflict is struggle for control of political power and resources the largely nomadic arab ethnic groups often venture into the traditionally farming communities of darfur for water and grazing at times triggering armed conflict between the two groups darfur is home to an estimated 7 million people and has more than 30 ethnic groups which fall into two major categories african and arab both communities are muslim and years of intermarriages have made racial distinctions impossible fighting over resources is one of several factors that has led to intense infighting in darfur over the years many observers believe that the nif government has systematically and deliberately pursued policy of discrimination and marginalization of the african communities in darfur and has given support to arab militias to suppress nonarabs whom it considers threat to its hold on power in 2000 after the ouster of the founder of the nif hassan alturabi and split within the islamist movement the government imposed state of emergency and used its 1 international crisis group icg darfur rising sudans new crisis march 25 2004 crs2 new authority to crack down on dissidents in darfur by 2002 littleknown self defense force of largely furdominated group emerged as the sla challenging government forces in darfur with the nif regime internally in turmoil and mounting international pressure to end sudans northsouth conflict the sla and jem were able to gain the upper hand in the initial phase of the conflict against government forces in early 2003 and appeared well armed and prepared the rebels also enjoyed the support of the local population as well as officers and soldiers in the sudanese army significant number of senior officers and soldiers in the sudanese armed forces come from darfur the sla reportedly benefitted from outside support including from fellow zaghawa in chad and financial support from darfur businessmen in the persian gulf the government of sudan has accused eritrea and the sudan peoples liberation movementarmy splma of providing support to the sla the government of sudan has also accused the founder of the nif hassan turabi of having links with jem some observers say that turabi through his supporters provides political and financial support to jem in late march 2004 turabi was arrested along with number of senior army officers the government claimed that turabi was behind an attempted coup although officials in khartoum seemed to back away from that claim by midapril 2004 in late september 2004 the government of sudan once again accused supporters of alturabi of an attempted coup the government arrested more than 30 people including military officials the military campaign and human rights abuses in mid2003 the government of sudan significantly increased its presence in darfur by arming arab militias collectively known as the janjaweed and by deploying the popular defense force pdf the janjaweed under the direction of regular government forces reportedly unleashed campaign of terror against civilians2 the arab militia engaged in what united nations officials have described as ethnic cleansing of the african ethnic groups of darfur men have been summarily executed women have been raped and more than 200000 people have been forced into exile in neighboring countries3 in early february 2004 the government launched major military offensive against the rebel forces and in mid february 2004 president omar bashir in nationally televised speech declared that the security forces had crushed the sla and jem and offered amnesty to the rebels the forceful expulsion of the mainly african ethnic groups from their homes was done in deliberate sequenced and systematic way according to briefing paper on the darfur crisis by the office of resident and humanitarian coordinator for the sudan the report describes the mechanisms used to cleanse the area of nonarabs by total disengagement of administration and suspension of all 2 office of the united nations high

communities the people are then accused of being rebel sympathizers and are targeted by government militias the janjaweed burn villages loot the properties of the nonarabs abduct children rape women and prevent people from returning to their homes5 factors contributing to the darfur crisis the timing of the darfur crisis caught some observers by surprise after over decade of international isolation and devastating civil war prospects for peace and comprehensive political solution to sudans long debilitating political impasse looked promising the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation movement splm had reached comprehensive peace agreement in may 2004 after two years of intense negotiations the country witnessed two years of relative peace and stability during the period of negotiations while the nif government emerged from its international isolation when the darfur crisis first erupted in early 2003 the government of sudan seriously underestimated the challenge presented by the sla and jem as it had with other political and armed groups in different parts of sudan at that time the government of sudan and the splm had signed only the machakos protocol 7202002 the first of several northsouth accords the violence in darfur began to intensify at the height of subsequent intense and acrimonious negotiations over power sharing security and wealth sharing arrangements for the interim period as agreed to in the machakos protocol in february 2004 first vice president ali osman taha the governments chief negotiator told the mediators that he had to leave the talks to deal with the darfur problem in february 2004 the government of sudan initiated major military campaign against the sla and jem and declared victory by the end of the month attacks by government forces and the janjaweed militia against civilians intensified between february and june 2004 forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee to neighboring chad some observers assert that the darfur crisis is directly linked to the northsouth negotiations senior members of the government of sudan opposed to the north south negotiations observers argue used the darfur crisis to divert attention from the negotiations and to obstruct agreement between the government and the splm since the beginning of the northsouth negotiations there has been rift within the ruling party related to the northsouth talks number of senior officials have been sidelined over the past two years and two coups were attempted against the government of president omar bashir the crisis in darfur intensified around the time when several important agreements had been reached between the government of sudan and the splm the 4 office of resident and humanitarian coordinator for the sudan briefing paper on the darfur crisis ethnic cleansing march 25 2004 5 flint julie refugees executed in desert of sudan the observer april 25 2004 crs4 government of sudan has been under intense international pressure to conclude peace agreement with the splm on number of occasions during the negotiations directly and through the mediators representatives of the government of sudan asked for political alliance with the splm during the interim period they considered an alliance with the splm as possible insurance policy for their own political survival expecting intense political challenge from northern opposition forces the splm rejected political alliance with the ruling party arguing that there are major philosophical and political differences between the two parties senior government officials reportedly made some concessions during the negotiations expecting that they would then forge an alliance with the splm some observers contend that the darfur crisis is now being used in order to delay implementation of the peace agreement reached in may 2004 since the signing of the nairobi declaration in june 2004 there has been progress in the implementation of the peace agreement the chief igad mediator general lazarus sumbeiywo concerned that the process has stalled traveled to sudan to meet with president bashir and vice president taha in august 2004 the government of sudan rejected sumbeiywos request for vice president taha to meet with dr john garang of splm to resolve outstanding issues many observers assert that khartoums response to the darfur crisis is similar in many ways to how the government of sudan has handled counterinsurgency challenges in other parts of the country the government of sudan used tribal militias in its counterinsurgency measures in southern sudan nuba and in eastern sudan for most of the 1990s the government of sudan used the nuer tribe from the upper nile region against the dinka tribe by arming and training nuer militia the nuer militia in coordination with government forces engaged in campaign of terror against dinka civilians and the spla for most of the 1990s there are over dozen nuer militia factions operating in southern sudan backed by the government of sudan in fact one of the contentious issues in the ceasefire negotiations in mid 2004 was what to do with these militia groups similarly the government of sudan used arab militias primarily from the baggara tribes in slave raids in bahr ghazal for most of the 1990s these militias were used to terrorize the civilian population by killing the men and abducting women and children in mid2004 the government of sudan deployed nuer militia to the shilluk kingdom killing thousands of civilians and forcing tens of thousands into refugee camps the attacks in shilluk kingdom followed the defection of former minister to the splm key players in the darfur campaign 6 the government of sudans response to the crisis in darfur is well thoughtout political and military strategy with multiple objectives according to some observers president omar elbashir stunned by the humiliating defeat in elfashir in 2003 at the hands of the rebels clearly sought to crush the rebels at all costs the defeat at elfashir left the army an important constituency of bashir on the sidelines and gave the security services the excuse to take the lead in the darfur campaign this 6 author interview with us officials sudanese leaders and regional officials in washington ethiopia eritrea and kenya august 2004 crs5 situation placed first vice president taha in charge of the darfur campaign since he controls the security services in sudan taha through some of his key allies in the security services managed to grab control and took charge of the offensive in darfur according to us and regional officials however at the height of the darfur crisis taha appeared more engaged in the northsouth negotiations and not actively engaged in the darfur crisis but us and regional officials point to taha as the key player behind the scenes even while he was negotiating in naivasha with the splm according to variety of sources vice president taha worked through key security officials considered to be taha loyalists and committed islamists of the ruling party these include salah abdalla gosh head of the national intelligence security service niss who reportedly has played key roles in coordinating the recruitment and training of the janjaweed and directing the security services in attacks against civilians in darfur dr nafie ali nafie the former external intelligence chief man long considered by us and regional officials as responsible for the governments international terror links and abdalla safi alnur state minister for cabinet affairs who is also considered key player in the darfur campaign ahmed mohamed haroun state minister and former head of the popular police force is also considered key ally of taha and an important player in the darfur campaign ali ahmed karti state minister and former head of the popular defense force pdf group created by the national islamic front movement as an alternative force to the regular armed forces tayeb ibrahim mohamed kheir security advisor to the president and mutrif sidiq undersecretary in the ministry of foreign affairs are all considered key players in the darfur campaign these key players in the view of us and regional officials constitute an important faction running the governments military campaign in darfur behind the scenes the bush administration has not decided whether to name some of these individuals publicly or impose targeted sanctions against them as proposed by the house of representative and the senate the bush administration has publicly named number of janjaweed leaders7 members of congress have named number of janjaweed leaders as well as government officials they consider responsible for the atrocities in darfur some us government officials believe that the above named individuals are directly involved in the darfur campaign but are concerned that publicly identifying them and targeting them for sanctions could lead to confrontation and help unify the government of sudan administration officials are also concerned that going after these individuals could disrupt cooperation on counterterrorism issues especially since some of these individuals have long been tied to international terrorism for example the head of the niss abdalla gosh is seen both as key player in the darfur campaign and an important actor in counter terrorism efforts although some observers have doubts about the value of the intelligence khartoum may currently be offering 7 see appendices crs6 the humanitarian situation and the us response humanitarian situation at glance

and us officials the situation in darfur is considered to be one of the worst current humanitarian and human rights crises in the world out of population of 7 million people 15 million are internally displaced over 200000 have been forced into exile and tens of thousands of civilian have been killed since february 2003 usaid has provided an estimated 218 million in humanitarian assistance for darfur moreover the senate foreign operations appropriations contains 611 million for darfur and sudan and an additional75 million was approved by the senate for african union peacekeeping operations usaid has also established disaster assistance response team dart for darfur although the government of sudan delayed the deployment of the team to darfur for several weeks recently the usaiddart has expressed concern regarding the government of sudans plan to forcibly return internally displaced persons to their places of origin meanwhile humanitarian conditions continue to deteriorate in large part because of continued government restrictions and violence against civilians by the progovernment militia the janjaweed according to usaid the gos has imposed rigorous registration requirements that hinder qualified health workers from entering darfur these regulations are severely affecting relief agencies capacity to respond to disease outbreaks anticipated in the coming weeks8 surveys conducted by ngos indicate high rates of malnutrition in many areas in darfur usaid reports that the general acute malnutrition gam rates for children under five in darfur are 1339 and 3639 for refugee children living in eastern chad the world food program wfp is supporting 19 therapeutic feeding centers for the extremely malnourished and 24 supplementary feeding programs to help reduce the number of deaths resulting from starvation the african union and the crisis in darfur the african union au has been slow in responding to the crisis in darfur the au became actively engaged during the ceasefire negotiation in chad and subsequently assumed central role in monitoring the ceasefire agreement and facilitating political dialogue between the government of sudan and slajem in late march 2004 the au sent team led by ambassador sam ibok director of the aus peace and security department to participate in talks in chad in the april ceasefire agreement the african union was tasked to take the lead in the creation 8 us agency for international development usaid darfurhumanitarian emergency fact sheet 15 fiscal year fy2004 july 232004 crs7 of ceasefire commission the commissions mandate consists of planning verifying and ensuring the implementation of the rules and provisions of the cease fire agreement in addition the commission was mandated to define the routes for the movement of the respective forces assist with demining operations and collect information about ceasefire violations the commission reports to joint commission composed of the parties to the agreement chad and members of the international community the african union mission does not have the mandate to protect civilians however the 305 troops from rwanda and nigeria are tasked to protect the au ceasefire monitors in darfur the limited mandate of the au force logistical and financial troubles of the organization and the size of the force have made the au mission inefficient according to many observers the deployment of the au force albeit small took more than four months after the signing of the agreement moreover even the limited mandate of monitoring of the ceasefire agreement has not been effective the mandate does not have any enforcement mechanisms aside from reporting the violations to the joint commission since the signing of the ceasefire agreement and the deployment of the au mission there have been many violations and only limited number of the violations have been reported to the joint commission moreover corrective measures have been taken by the au to end these violations in september secretary general kofi annan reported that it is clear that the ceasefire is not holding in many parts of darfur clashes were reported from 812 september in sayyah north of fasher and government aligned militia attacked the sla in abu dalek on 7 september9 president paul kagame of rwanda who came to power after the 1994 rwandan genocide had stated that his country would respond if called to end genocide during speech in april 2004 at the 10th anniversary of the rwandan genocide rwanda was the first to deploy troops as part of the au mission senior rwandan officials have also asserted that despite the limited mandate rwandan troops would defend civilians if they are attacked rwanda has not yet followed through its threat however despite continued attacks against civilians over the past several months rwandan government officials argue that it is better to have small force present in darfur than have nothing at all however kigali has made its views clear that the proposed expanded force should have mandate to protect civilians many members of the african union do not share the view that genocide is occurring in darfur and still consider the government of sudan as the central player in the resolution of the conflict and protector of civilians while us and officials hold the government of sudan responsible for the atrocities in darfur in late september 2004 as noted above the government of sudan and the au agreed to expand the au mission by over 3500 troops several weeks after the united nations security council endorsed an expanded mission for the au and threatened sanctions if the government failed to cooperate many observers contend that the proposed increase in the force protection is not enough since darfur is the size of 9 report of the secretarygeneral on the sudan pursuant to paragraph 15 of security council resolution 1564 2004 and paragraphs 6 13 and 16 of security council resolution 1556 2004 crs8 france moreover they argue the mandate of the au force is still not clear the government of sudan has rejected proposal to expand the mandate to include protection of civilians especially the internally displaced people idp in camps throughout darfur the government of sudan has also rejected the use of the phrase peacekeeping instead the force is likely to retain its current label protectors of ceasefire monitors rwanda has reportedly offered to send more troops to darfur but observers and us officials assert it will take months to deploy additional troops to darfur us officials are concerned that the au might not be able to deploy new forces until early 2005 given the number of complications that must first be resolved the african union and the government of sudan have to agree on the mandate and size of the new force moreover resources and logistical support to transport the troops have to be secured especially with donor governments with the capability to move these troops from their respective countries to darfur prospects for negotiated settlement in darfur in september 2003 the government of sudan and the sla signed ceasefire agreement mediated by president idriss deby of chad the agreement collapsed in december 2003 in early april 2004 the government of sudan and the slajem agreed to ceasefire and political dialogue to peacefully resolve the conflict the government of sudan agreed to negotiate with the rebels after considerable international pressure the negotiations were conducted under the auspices of president deby of chad and assisted by the african union the united states and other international participants played an important role in facilitating the negotiations although the government of sudan delegation walked out of the talks in protest when the head of the us delegation began to deliver his opening remarks on april 8 2004 the parties agreed to observe ceasefire for period of 45 days renewable automatically if both parties were to agree in late may the parties renewed the ceasefire agreement however attacks by the progovernment militia have been verified by the ceasefire commission established under the april 8th accord these violations by the government of sudan and the janjaweed militia have stalled the peace negotiation process leaders from the justice and equality movement jem and the sudan liberation movement slm initially refused to participate in talks in july in addis ababa ethiopia because the gos failed to uphold the core elements of the april 8th ceasefire agreement in late august 2004 the parties resumed negotiations in abuja nigeria there has been major breakthrough as of september 2 2004 although the parties were expected to reach an agreement on humanitarian related issues political agreement between the rebels and the government of sudan appears unlikely at this juncture the sla and jem are demanding fundamental changes in the political structure in khartoum and the disarmament of the janjaweed the april ceasefire agreement see text box provided framework for negotiated settlement between gos and the slajem but the agreement has not been fully implemented the african union and the united nations have documented series of violations by the government of sudan including bombings of civilian targets and continued support for the janjaweed militia by the government crs9 of sudan recent report by the secretary general of the united nations states that the united nations continues to receive reports of militia activities in all three states of darfur of particular concern are several militia attacks on villages in the yassin area northeast of nyala during the second half of august10 the report notes that to the extent the militias that carried out these attacks were under the influence of the government the wanton destruction of the villages and the killings of large number of civilians constitutes serious breach of the governments commitments highlights of the ceasefire agreement april 8 2004 the parties agreed to find political solution to the problem cease all hostile media campaigns accept 45day ceasefire renewed in may 2004 establish ceasefire commission and joint commission free all political prisoners control their allies and ensure compliance with the agreement facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance some observers contend that there are also serious structural problems in the negotiating process the april ceasefire agreement accepted the sla and jem as legitimate political actors and called for political solution to the problem facing darfur but recent measures by the security council and proposals by the african union mediators suggest that the sla and jem would be cantoned and disarmed in similar fashion as the disarmament of the janjaweed security council resolution 1556 imposed arms embargo on nongovernment entities and individuals in darfur the nongovernment armed entities in darfur are the sla jem and the janjaweed the embargo exempts the government of sudan and does not provide mechanisms to ensure that the government of sudan will not continue to arm and support the janjaweed reportedly the government of sudan is inducting the janjaweed into the popular defense force pdf an arab dominated irregular force united nations and african union reports clearly indicate that the government of sudan continues to provide support to the janjaweed and coordinate attacks against civilians the current negotiations observers contend treat the slajem in the same fashion as the janjaweed the sla and jem have stated on number of occasions that the april ceasefire agreement is being rewritten to accommodate the government of sudan the rebels argue that if they are forced to surrender or be cantoned in security zone the government of sudan will have interest in finding political solution to the darfur problem thus political settlement appears unlikely in the immediate future although the rebels lack of experience in negotiations and possible defections could lead to temporary agreement moreover recent agreements between the united nations and the government of sudan can be seen as undermining the april 2004 ceasefire agreement and 10 report of the secretarygeneral pursuant to paragraphs 6 and 13 to 16 of the security council resolution 1556 august 30 2004 crs10 impeding the work of the african union ceasefire commission article 2 of the april agreement on humanitarian ceasefire on the conflict in darfur calls for both parties to refrain from any military movement and reconnaissance operations and article 4 of the ceasefire agreement empowers the commission to approve the movements of the forces of the two parties to the agreement but joint communique signed between the government of sudan and the august 2004 permits the government to deploy police force in all idp areas as well as in areas susceptible to attacks this means the government of sudan could deploy forces near or in slacontrolled areas where there are an estimated 130000 idps in addition the darfur plan of action august 2004 another agreement between the and the government sudan authorizes the government to secure areas in darfur within 30 days giving the government of sudan the authority to deploy security forces in the contested areas without the approval of the au commission in september 2004 after several weeks of talks between the government of sudan and darfur rebels negotiations ended without progress although talks are expected to resume in late october 2004 some observers are concerned that conflict might erupt once again in darfur visits by us secretary of state colin powell and secretary general kofi annan in june 2004 secretary colin powell became the first us secretary of state to visit sudan in 26 years the purpose of his visit was to witness and express concern for the people of darfur who he said are subject to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world the secretary discussed with sudans president omar albashir the necessity of dismantling of the janjaweed militia in order to restore security to region he emphasized that the idps and refugees could return to their homes only when security is restored in darfur and that until then they should remain in the camps at this meeting the government agreed to list of objectives and time line in which they will be accomplished objectives included the removal of all restrictions on visas for humanitarian workers the unimpeded movement of humanitarian supplies relief convoys and vehicles for the monitors in darfur the commitment of participating in political resolution of the darfur crisis facilitated by the african union the disarmament of the janjaweed and the provision of security to the displaced persons so they can return home on june 30 secretary powell visited darfurs abushouk camp with sudanese government representatives the abushouk camp is regarded as one of the best camps in the darfur region although ngo leaders still expressed the need for more shelters and clean water to powell upon his return to khartoum secretary powell met with secretary general kofi annan who had arrived earlier that day to begin his own threeday factfinding mission during the meeting powell informed annan about the steps the united states wanted sudan to implement in order to resolve the darfur crisis in turn annan briefed powell about his earlier meeting with cabinet ministers prior to powells departure from sudan that day the following day annan was scheduled to visit three idp camps to make first hand assessment of the situation in darfur while at the zam zam camp in northern darfur annan crs11 listened to first hand accounts of the human rights abuses committed by the janjaweed including the targeted rape murder and destruction of african villages however when he arrived at his second destination the meshtel camp he found it deserted he was later informed by sudanese representatives that the 5000 idps were moved to better living conditions in abushouk sometime between the afternoon of june 30 and morning of july 1 relief workers at abushouk later reported that they received prior notification and were unprepared for the massive influx of new arrivals annan echoed the us demands for the disarmament of the janjaweed militias and the removal of all impediments to humanitarian relief upon returning to khartoum from chad the secretary general had one final meeting with president bashir to discuss what was observed in the camps at that time he also presented the president with draft joint communique that committed the government of the sudan and the united nations to taking specific steps to alleviate the suffering of the sudanese idps and refugees during the visits of the secretary general and the secretary of state the government of sudan carried out number of attacks against civilians according to several newspaper accounts and reports by united nations officials in late august two months after these high profile visits and demands by the international community to stop these violent attacks secretary general kofi annan reported to the security council that recent actions by the government of sudan armed forces involve level of violence that seems at odds with the principle of restraints it promised to observe under the plan of action the international communitys response the international communitys response to the darfur crisis has been characterized as slow and ineffective in part because of the government of sudans repeated refusal to allow relief workers into darfur it was not until late 2003 almost one year after the crisis erupted that some members of the international community began to speak about gross human rights abuses and widespread humanitarian crisis in darfur according to some analysts the bush administration did not consider the darfur crisis to be priority instead the administration was largely focused on the talks between the government of sudan and the splm the first statement on darfur by the white house was issued in early april 2004 others point out that us agency for international development usaid officials spoke of growing humanitarian crisis and visited the area in late 2003 administration officials were reportedly concerned that forceful statements or measures against the government of sudan might undermine the peace process between the gos and the splm since late 2003 however some officials have been forceful in their statements and have publicly expressed concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in darfur by may 2004 the international community was paying greater attention to the crisis in darfur as violence against civilians continued on july 26 2004 in an effort to press the government of sudan to protect citizens in darfur against the janjaweed the us and eu signed joint declaration on sudan this declaration condemned the human rights abuses and called the gos to immediately stop the crs12 violence disarm the militias protect humanitarian workers and civilians and allow access to darfur by humanitarian groups the following day july 27 2004 britains top military commander gen mike jackson said his country could send 5000 troops to intervene in darfur australia also pledged to send troops to darfur the government of sudan responded that it would use force against any attempt at outside military intervention in darfur highlights of the sg report to the security council august 30 2004 the disarming of members of the pdf has started the united nations continues to receive reports of militia activities in all three states of darfur to date the government has not identified any militias that are currently outside the pdf recent actions by the government of sudan armed forces involve level of violence that seems at odds with the principles of restraint it promised to observe under the plan of action forced return of the idps is taking place in accordance with the commitments made by the government however local authorities continue to apply direct and indirect pressure an active and systematic effort to end impunity does not yet seem to be in place source report of the secretary general pursuant to paragraphs 6 and 13 to 16 of security council resolution 1556 august 30 2004 on july 30 2004 the security council passed resolution 1556 2004 demanding that sudan disarm militias in darfur within 30 days or face measures outline in article 41 of the united nations charter the resolution passed by vote of 13 in favor and two abstentions china and pakistan however the resolution stopped short of overtly calling for sanctions against the government of sudan compromise deemed necessary for passage following the passage of the resolution 1556 french president jacques chirac announced that france would make aircraft available from its military base in chad to assist in the transport of humanitarian supplies and deployed 200 troops near the sudanese border to assist in securing the area meanwhile the african union deployed 300 rwandan and nigerian troops to darfur as military observers and force protectors the au plans to deploy several thousand additional troops to darfur although final agreement has not been reached with the government of sudan crs13 unsc resolution 1564 september 2004 expresses grave concern about lack of security states that gos is responsible for the security and safety of the population declares the situation in sudan as threat to international peace and security deplores recent ceasefire violations by gos supports the african unions plan to enhance and augment its monitoring mission in darfur calls on member states to provide financial and logistical support to the au mission threatens the gos with sanctions including measures targeting its petroleum sector if it fails to comply with the councils demands source united nations on august 30 2004 in his report to the security council secretary general kofi annan stated that the government of sudan has failed to fulfil its commitment to disarm the janjaweed militia jan pronk the secretary generals special representative for sudan however stated that the government of sudan has made some progress in disarming the janjaweed and asserted that there were recent attacks by government troops against civilians in darfur us ambassador to the and former bush administration special envoy for sudan senator john danforth publicly rebuked pronk for downplaying atrocities and government complicity in attacks against civilians in response to criticism as to why he did not include the findings of african union monitors about recent attacks pronk stated that the au report is preliminary and that he was awaiting for final report some observers believe that pronks lukewarm criticism of the government of sudan has given prosudan security council members an excuse to reject us calls for sanctions against the government of sudan in september the security council once again passed another resolution 1564 calling on the government of sudan to cooperate with the african union and end the violence against civilians the resolution stated that measures against the government of sudan or officials in the government could be taken if they failed to meet the councils demands the debate over genocide11 on july 22 2004 the us house of representatives and the senate unanimously passed resolutions hconres 467 sconres 133declaring the crisis in darfur to be genocide based on the five criteria for genocide enumerated in article 2 of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide wide array of american and international nongovernmental 11 for more on genocide see crs report rl32605 genocide legal precedent surrounding the definition of the crime september 14 2004 crs14 organizations human rights activists and newspaper editorials have termed the violence in darfur genocide although the united nations and the african union have refrained from officially declaring the atrocities in darfur to be genocide the bush administration sent team of investigators to chad to interview victims of the darfur atrocities the team submitted its draft report in august and the final report was released in september the report is based on interviews with 1136 randomly selected refugees in 19 refugee camps in eastern chad according to the report analysis of the refugee interviews points to pattern of abuse against members of darfur nonarab communities including murder rape beatings ethnic humiliation and destruction of property and basic necessities many of the reports detailing attacks on villages refer to government and militia forces preceded by aerial bombardment acting together to commit atrocities respondents said government and militia forces wore khaki or brown military uniforms roughly onehalf of the respondents noted gos forces had joined jingaweit irregulars in attacking their villages approximately onequarter of the respondents said gos forces had acted alone another 14 percent said the jingaweit had acted alone twothirds of the respondents reported aerial bombings against their villages fourfifths said they had witnessed the complete destruction of their villages sixtyone percent reported witnessing the killing of family member about onethird of the respondents reported hearing racial epithets while under attack onequarter witnessed beatings large numbers reported the looting of personal property 47 percent and the theft of livestock 80 percent12 on september 92004 secretary powell in his testimony before the senate foreign relations committee declared the atrocities in darfur genocide secretary powell stated that after reviewing evidence collected by the state department team genocide has been committed in darfur and that the government of sudan and the jingaweit bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring powell further stated that because the united states is contracting party to the geneva convention washington will demand that the united nations initiate full investigation shortly after powells testimony draft us resolution 1564 was adopted the resolution requested the secretary general of the united nations to establish an international commission of inquiry in order immediately to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in darfur by all parties to determine also whether or not acts of genocide have occurred and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable the declaration of genocide by the bush administration has not led to major shift in policy nor threat of intervention to end genocide instead bush administration officials continue to support negotiated settlement between the rebels and the government of sudan some observers and government officials have described the atrocities in darfur as ethnic cleansing and reject that genocide has occurred in darfur the term ethnic cleansing originated during the bosnian conflict of the early 1990s evolving from military term meaning to clear the land over time the term has come to be used generally to describe certain targeted acts of violence against noncombatants 12 state department report documenting atrocities in darfur september 2004 httpwwwstategovgdrlrls36028htm crs15 in conflict situations including their expulsion from their homes an act of ethnic cleansing may rise to one of the following charges under international law war crimes crimes against humanity or genocide international law experts assert that proving that group not only destroyed substantial part of another group but intentionally did so makes prosecuting genocide challenging in the case of prosecutor v radislav krstic the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia convicted krstic of genocide against bosnian muslims in srebenica stating that it is not only bald numbers that need evaluation within the context of the overall size of the group but also the targeted portions prominence within the group some human rights lawyers and experts in international law contend that specific part of group can easily qualify as substantial portion of group if that part is emblematic of the overall group or essential to its survival in rendering judgment in the case of the prosecutor v georges anderson nderubumwe rutaganda the international criminal tribunal for rwanda stated that genocide is distinct from other crimes because it requires dolus specialis special intent the perpetration of the act charged therefore extends beyond its actual commission for example the murder of particular person to encompass the realization of the ulterior purpose to destroy in whole or in part the group of which the person is only member the dolus specialis is key element of an intentional offence which offence is characterized by psychological nexus between the physical result and the mental state of the perpetrator to convict an individual of genocide it is necessary to prove the targeting of specific ethnic group or groups and efforts to prevent the group or substantial part of it from surviving in the case of darfur specific groups have been targeted by the government of sudan and its allied militia according to many sudan advocates the target of these attacks have been three african muslim ethnic groups belonging to fur zaghawa and massaleit those who carried out the attacks against these groups come primarily from sudans arab muslim ethnic groups article 2 of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide states that in the present convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part national ethnical racial or religious group as such killing members of the group b causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group c deliberately inflicting on the groups conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part d imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group many observers including the us house of representatives and the senate contend that the atrocities in darfur meet the criteria outlined in the 1948 convention they argue that members of particular group have been killed serious bodily harm had been inflicted on the group b the groups conditions of life had been deliberately destroyed through burning of villages and poisoning of water wells there has been systematic and widespread rape of women c and children have been abducted and forced to flee their homes others argue that the crisis in crs16 darfur is conflict between tribes triggered by number of factors including resources and political power the darfur crisis and impact on the northsouth negotiations on may 26 2004 the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation movement signed three protocols on power sharing the nuba mountains and southern blue nile and on the long disputed abyei area the signing of these protocols resolved all outstanding issues between the parties although the parties must still negotiate and agree on comprehensive ceasefire and modalities for implementation on june 5 2004 the government of sudan and the splm signed the nairobi declaration on the final phase of peace in the sudan the declaration restated that the parties have agreed on the following the machakos protocol 7202002 agreement on security arrangements 9252003 agreement on wealth sharing 172004 agreement on power sharing 5262004 protocol on southern blue nile and the nuba mountains 5262004 and protocol on the disputed abyei area 5262004 since the signing of the nairobi declaration the talks have been stalled in part because of the crisis in darfur some observers fear that the peace agreement may collapse if progress is not made soon both sides are beginning to rearm and violations of the ceasefire agreement have increased in recent months the troika norway britain and the united states have not been not actively engaged in the northsouth negotiations since the signing of the nairobi declaration the two principal actors dr john garang and vice president taha have not met since the signing of the nairobi declaration in early june 2004 meanwhile tensions are mounting in eastern sudan with the beja congress poised to launch military offensive against government forces senior commanders in the spla are reportedly also raising questions about the delay and the commitment of the government of sudan others argue that it would be difficult if not impossible to work with the current government of sudan after what has happened in darfur the splm leader dr john garang argues that swift implementation of the igadled naivasha accords will help end the violence in darfur13 in his view implementation of the accords will lead to new government of which the splm and other political forces will be part in his view this powersharing deal will enable these forces to check the political power of the current government and prevent military actions against civilians since such measures will require the approval of the splm in coalition government as agreed to in the power sharing and security arrangements at naivasha kenya the splm has also proposed the deployment of 30000 troops to darfur to disarm the janjaweed and provide protection to civilians according to the splm the force will consist of 10000 troops from the spla 10000 from the sudan armed forces and 10000 from the african union the proposal has been rejected by the government of sudan 13 author interview with dr john garang in nairobi kenya august 2004 crs17 although the splm and the government had agreed on the security arrangements for the interim period to set up joint integrated units moreover senior government officials see the spla as an ally of the sla the government of sudans refusal to engage other sudanese political groups in an effort to find political solution in darfur raises fundamental questions about the governments intent to implement the naivasha accords and its commitment to negotiated settlement of the darfur problem the government of sudan has strenuously resisted outside intervention to deal with the darfur problem and has threatened jihad against such intervention by outsiders an alternative to outside intervention some observers maintain is to bring other sudanese political groups into the process but senior government officials in khartoum see the darfur crisis as conspiracy by the west to overthrow the government although many in the international community hold the government itself accountable for the crisis in darfur by rejecting splms proposal resisting international interventions and delaying implementation of the naivasha accords the government of sudan may risk an allout war since opposition forces including the spla are unlikely to wait indefinitely such scenario may pose not only serious consequences for sudan but also for the entire region many observers believe that the parties could start implementation of the already signed agreements the two remaining issues are finalizing ceasefire agreement and negotiating implementation modalities the parties with the help of igad united nations and the troika have reached agreement on framework for permanent ceasefire what remain unresolved are three issues brought up anew by the government of sudan that had been settled in the nairobi declaration the status of armed militia had been settled in the security arrangements the parties agreed to disarm all armed elements outside the two principal forces the sudan armed forces and the sudan peoples liberation army the government of sudan would now like separate agreement for more than dozen progovernment armed militia the parties also agreed that the two principal armies would be treated equally and as the national armies of the country in the ceasefire negotiations the government of sudan raised objections concerning central government funding to the spla another issue raised by the government as new during ceasefire negotiation was the status of the joint integrated unit in eastern sudan the parties agreed to discuss this issue during ceasefire negotiations the government of sudan now claims this issue had been settled in the security arrangement agreement policy options on darfur and the northsouth negotiations the united states has number of unilateral and multilateral policy options to consider in dealing with the darfur crisis and the stalled northsouth talks these options are complicated by number of factors members of the international community are divided over sudan since the late 1990s the european union has adopted policy of engagement instead of containment as the united states pursued policy of isolation and containment of the government of sudan sudans neighbors are also divided relations between eritrea and sudan are poor while crs18 ethiopias relations with the nif government have improved significantly over the past several years for the number of the options outlined below to be successful close cooperation and coordination between the united states and the international community especially the security council and sudans neighbors is pivotal engagement one option is engagement with the government of sudan the government of sudan is eager to appease the international community as long as it can avoid punitive sanctions and ensure its own political survival in this scenario engaging the government might yield some positive results short of full cooperation and accountability by the government past engagement with the current government however has not succeeded in changing the behavior of the national islamic front government working with moderates another option is working with the socalled moderates within the sudan government us and regional officials assert that the international community should work with the socalled moderate elements in the government by isolating hardliners within the government there are number officials in the sudanese government who prefer to work with the international community in order to ensure the regimes political survival strengthening the position of these more moderate elements however entails great risks and possible backlash from the extremist elements in the regime sanctions many observers assert that the current regime only responds to real pressure the threat of sanctions in july 2004 by the united nations security council may have led to khartoums reluctant cooperation in recent weeks the clinton administration imposed comprehensive economic and trade sanctions in 1997 the impact of these sanctions are mixed but targeted sanctions including an oil and arms embargo travel ban and asset freeze might have serious psychological and political impact on the regime but the government of sudan has survived years of sanctions imposed by the united states and the united nations moreover many countries oppose sanctions against the government of sudan especially those countries with business interests in sudans oil sector regime change some observers and sudan opposition leaders argue that the regime is incapable of change they argue that since the nif government came to power in 1989 it has committed war crimes in south sudan the nuba and now in darfur they also point to the regimes known ties to international terrorism and osama bin laden regime change in khartoum they argue could bring swift end to the crisis in darfur help implement the northsouth agreement and end the regimes support to extremist and terrorist groups some observers argue that opposition forces could topple the nif regime without outside support but 20years of war has led to stalemate moreover opposition groups are divided along regional and ethnic lines implementing the northsouth agreements sudanese opposition leaders and regional officials argue that better alternative to forceful or violent change in government is expedited implementation of the naivasha accords which could lead to peaceful change in government in khartoum implementation of the naivasha accords as agreed between the government of sudan and the splm crs19 would lead to coalition government with new first vice president from the splm new national assembly new cabinet and revamped security apparatus international intervention another option is military intervention by the international community the international community could disarm the janjaweed and provide protection to civilians in darfur by deploying large numbers of peacekeepers with chapter vii mandate the has been working on peacekeeping force for sudan as part of the naivasha agreement over the past year the proposed 10000 troops for the south could be modified for deployment to darfur especially in light of the fact that the current au force even if increased by several thousand may be incapable of providing protection to civilians or disarming the janjaweed the au force is mandated only to protect au ceasefire monitors us officials and human rights organizations have documented attacks on civilians by government forces and janjaweed militia even after the deployment of au peacekeeping monitors crs20 legislation hres 194 capuano
