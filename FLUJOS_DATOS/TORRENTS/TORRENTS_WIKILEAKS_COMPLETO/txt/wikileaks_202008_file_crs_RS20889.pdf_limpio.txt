nuary 1 2005 focusing on implementation issues and phaseout consequences the report will be updated as events warrant context textile and apparel ma nufacture and international trad in their products have been important elements of economic activity nd growth since the industrial revolution major reasons for this are 1 textiles and apparel are basic items of consumption in all countries and 2 apparel manuf acture is laborintensive re quiring relatively little fixed capital to establish production facilities thus with fiber and fabric esse ntial inputs to apparel these industries are major generators of jobs modest capital requirements contributed to textiles and pparel being major industries at the start of the industrial revolution and being important to developing countries now the percentage of total manufacturing value added accounted for by tex tile and apparel pr oduction among developing countries in 2002 was two and lf times that for industrialized countries1 lower wage rates in devel oping countries together with the laborintensiveness of textile and apparel manufacture tend to gi ve developing countries comparative advantage in textile and apparel manufacture thus textile and apparel manufacture is shifting to developing countri with textiles and appare l constituting large portions of their exports developing countries share of world xtile manufacture measured by constantdollar value added increased from 215 in 1980 to 375 in 2002 and their share of world apparel manufacture rose from 184 in 1980 to an estimated 30 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20889crs2 2

developing economies expor ts in 2002 versus 3 for developed economies3 because of their importance to both industrialized and developing country economies textiles and apparel have been major issues in trade relations among and between many countries in attempts to resolve conflicts betw een the interests of exporters and importers large number of agreements multilateral and bilateral mainly between developing and devel oped countries were signed over the years bearing on and generally restricting the quantities of textiles and apparel traded the multifibre arrangement in 1974 virtually all of the principal existing multilateral and bilateral agreements were combined into the multifibre arrangement mfa common set of rules was applie d which among other things provided for quantitative restrictions when surges of imports of particul ar products caused or threatened to cause damage to the industr of an importing country the mfa did not adhere to the basic rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt intended to be temporary the mfa was extended several times agreement on textiles and clothing the agreement on textiles and clothing atc replaced the mfa on january 1 1995 the atc provided for tenyear fourstage transition period for producers in veloped countries to plan for and adjust to prospective intensified comp etition from developing countri ultimately placing textile and apparel trade under the rules governin g other products and it aimed to improve access to the tex tile markets of developing c ountries the atc which was under the supervision of the world trade organizati on wto was approved by congress as part of the uruguay round agreements act and signed into law by president clinton the atc called for reductions of 16 j anuary 1 1995 17 january 1 1998 18 january 2002 and 49 january 1 2005 of the quotas pert aining to specified textile and clothing products based upon 1990 volumes also the growth rates of quotas of products not liberalized as above or of products otherwise restrained were increased during the first three steps of the phaseout period there were numerous exceptions and in the process of liberaliza tion importing countries had the choice of how much of each product category to liberalize at which step th ey could and did defer liberalization of the most sensitive products until the final stag of the atc many developing countries saw the atc as an unfair constraint on their economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20889crs3 4 this was anticipated at least by 1995 see for example j michael

and effect s of the quota phaseout completion of the phaseout of quotas on textile and appare l trade removes hindrance to industries in countries with competitivelyadvantage ous characteristics to win markets from their counterparts in other developing countries and in industrialized countries exporting country industries that had some assured ma rket access along with restricted quantities by virtue of an agreem ent with an importing country now faces more open competition partic ularly in laborintensive pparel manufactureassembly the actual extent of implement ation of the phaseout has been curbed however implementation caveats if implementation is defined as the ability of countries political leaders to permit the quota pha seout to take full effect it can be argued that complete actual implementation may be difficult for at least three reasons 1 the final stage of import quota pha seout was large in terms of the volume of textile and apparel items that were freed from quotas 2 the final stage covered items that were left to the end because of their domestic sensitivitie s and 3 the phaseout is major symbolic as well as actual step toward further globa lization considered by some as economically and environmentally oppre ssive andor an intrusion into their economic or personal lives the actuality of the consequences of the phaseout may aggravate those negative feelings with respect to procedure it is likely that parties that are harmed by or perceive threat from goods produced abroad will use the safeguard mechanisms available4 chinas wto accession agreement allows the united states and other member countries to impose temporary quotas on textile and pparel from the people s republic of china if they determine that chineseorigin imports of product are causing market disruption moreover trade in textiles and appa rel still is constrained by tariffs competitiveness factors while low labor costs ar important numerous other factors in one country can combine

declaration by turkish and us textile industry trade associations of march 2004 later joined by others asked for an emergency wto meeting to review the possibility of extending the phaseout mauritius

other than talks under its auspices the wto took action in mid2003 three us industry associa tions petitioned with respect to certain product categories for safeguard relie f available under ch inas wto accession agreement and the united states notified ch ina that it intended to do so in mid2004 some members of congress reque sted president bush to support an international effort to get the wto to reexamine the scheduled ending of quotas5 shortly before expiration of the quotas some us industry associations petitioned for invocati on of safeguard relief on some other products china announced incr eases in tariffs on its exports of wide range of textile and apparel products and th rescinded them after january 1 2005 particularly chinese but also other asian exports of textiles and apparel to european and us markets increased steeply leading to importlimiting actions by european union eu countries and further calls by us manufacturers for import quotas the bush administration has been receptive to industry petitions to invoke safeguard quotas and number have been imposed6 implementation of safeguard quotas by the us and the european ion provoked strong objections by china euchina negotiations led to june 10 2005 agreement to limit 10 categories of chinese textile exports to the eu to sp ecified growth rates until the end of 20077 subsequent intermittent uschina talks during which the united states at least twice delayed safeguard decisions led to nove mber 10 2005 agreement effective january 1 2006 and expiring december 31 2008 it places quotas on more categories of products than currently subject to quotas 34 versus 19 for three years specifying some flexibility effects on developing countries developing countries as whole were expected to gain from the phaseout of textile and apparel quotas re moval of textile and apparel quotas tends to remove an obstacl to industries in lowerlaborcost nations generally developing countries to win ma rkets from their counterparts in industrializedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20889crs5 8 crs estimates 9 these points are taken from building export capabilities in textiles and clothing case studies of german and italian

on and development paris 1995 10 us international trade commission dataweb compiled from us departments of commerce and treasury datacountries elimination of quotas tends to provide more scope to countri whose industries are more efficient to gain at th expense of countries with less efficient industries in this context efficiency pa rticularly connotes the ability to produce at lower cost measured in common currency inasmuch as industrialized countries still account for about 65 and 70 of world tex tile and world appare l output respectively8 it is reasonable to expect that the shift of textile and apparel production from developed to developing count ries will continue in some cases there will be offsets to whatever gains in sales volume developing countries may derive as result of the quota phaseout under quota regime which limits competition and tends to raise prices developing country textile and apparel producers benefitted by receiving higher pr ices on smaller volumes in many cases derived effect of the sh ift of textile and apparel production fro m industrialized to developing countries has been shift smalle r so far than the product shift in textile machinery manufacture from industrialized to developing countries this in turn stimulates the development of supplier industries to the veloping country machinery industry another benefit is the associate d even required improvements in technological and managerial skills and busin ess networks these include 1 process product and industrial engineering capabilities 2 the ability to locate purchase and install equipment and 3 the ability to establish li nkages with other firms suppliers designers customers and with institutions9 all of which benefit the economy as whole china by virtue of its rapid industr ialization large economy fast economic growth and large population china is an pecially vigorous and strong competitor in world textile and apparel trading regimen with fewer restraints now that it is member of the wto which it joined in decembe r 2001 major factor is chinas quasi privatization of its agricultural sector nd consequent gain in productivity which is releasing portions of its large rural popula tion from agricultural work for employment in urban industrial centers large availability of worker s tends to restrain wages thus in contrast to initial expectati ons that the quota pha seout would result in increased exports of textiles nd apparel by developing count ries as whole which were the primary proponents of the phaseout under the atc it increasingly appeared and has come to pass that china will be major beneficiary at the expense of most other developing countries for exam ple in the first nine months of 2005 us imports of all textile and appare l products on value basis from ch ina were 50 greater than in the comparable 2004 period accounting for 28 of to tal us imports of textiles and apparel compared with 20 in the comparable 2004 period percentage ga ins for some products were considerably greater total us imports of textiles and apparel rose 810 china also has made large inroads in european union textile and pparel markets in 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20889crs6 however us and other major market importers are expected to reduce the risk of sourcing from only one country india has large versatile strongly competitive manufacturing base with low labor costs and pakistan banglade sh and vietnam have sufficiently low labor costs to compete well in some product market s vietnam has sharply increased its exports of clothing r ecently but it will be subject to quotas until it becomes member of the wto us producers and the us economy imports of textiles and apparel especially the latter into the united states increased steeply in the early 1960s winning sizable portions of us markets from us pr oducers and such pene tration has continued since then us textiles and apparel output has risen nevertheless albeit modestly employment in us textile and apparel manufacturing has fallen markedly however part of the decline in us textile and apparel jobs is attributable to increases in imports but part is linked to substantial productivity gains us tex tiles have fared less badly with respect to trade than apparel textile production is ss laborintensive more easily automated and as major input to apparel can be exported to serve as inputs to foreign made apparel that then is exported to the united states with textile and apparel imports alread increasing us textile and apparel manufacturers particularly apparel makers already are being affected by the quota phaseout it is likely that textile and apparel manufacturing employment will decrease further perhaps faster than in the past in contrast us textile and apparel importers domestic apparel manuf acturers that use or hope to use foreignmade textile inputs domestic apparel wholesalers and large chain stores will tend to benefit visàvis competitors who use less imports there will be benefits to the overall us economy and eu economies as well from acceleration of imports of tex tiles and apparel to the extent that the increase in competition from foreignproduced goods reduces prices of textiles and apparel to fall or become lower than they would be without the phaseout us industrial users of these products and us consumers should benefit also subs titution by foreignmade goods will tend to facilitate the ongoing long term shift in the united states from lower to higher value added industries and ra ise average wages in the process value added per worker in textile and apparel pr oduction is considerably lower th an in us manufacturing as whole at the same time there are calls for assistance to us workers adversely affected by increased imports in the short run app lication of quota safeguards and the 2005 us china textile agreement probably is limiting the effect on us producers countries with tr ade preferences inasmuch as tariffs were not phased out along with mfa quotas countries eligible for dutyfree us tex tile trade preferences have potential advantage over some othe r potential suppliers depending to great extent upon beneficiary countries geographical proximity to the united states it is unsurprising that the caribbean countries c onstitute the largest market by far for us fiber yarn and fabric among the three us trade preference regions andean caribbean and subsaharan africa but geog raphy is not the only factor regional trade agreements generally it would app ear that the phaseout will tend to diminish the benefits of regional agreem ents to the participating parties on the other hand the structural relati onships formed as result of such trade agreements may limit the hoped for gains of the xtile and appare l quota phaseout
