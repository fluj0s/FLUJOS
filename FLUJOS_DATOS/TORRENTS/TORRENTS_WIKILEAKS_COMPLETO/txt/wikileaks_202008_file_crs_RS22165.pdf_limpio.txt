section 101 of hr 1279 as passed by the house amends 18 usc 521 in its present form s ection 521 calls for sentencing enhancement of not more than 10 years for anyone who is criminal street gang offender the bill would replace 18 usc 521 with new separa crime it would reduce from 5 to 3 the number of gang members required for cove rage under the section it would outlaw attempts and threats to commit street gang offense and would raise the penalty for conspiracy to commit such an offense it would enlarge the sections predicate offense inventory that is the crimes that qualify as street gang crimes it would add section 521 to the list of money laundering predicates it would require criminal forfeiture of property derived from or used to facilitate the commission of violation of the act and it would establish increased maximum and mandatory minimum penalties for the misconduct it proscribes where section 521 in its present form makes criminal street gang offenses punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years hr 1297 would make them punishable by imprisonment for life or any term years not less than 10 years by not less than 20 years if the offense results in serious bodily injury by not less than 30 years if the predicate offense is kidnaping aggravated sexual assault or maiming and by death or imprisonment for life if death results s 155 would make any violation of its version ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22165crs2 18 usc 521 punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 years by imprisonment for any term of years or for life if the predicate offense carries life sentence s 155 would call for neither mandatory minimums nor the death penalty section 102 increased travel act penalties the travel act would outlaw interstate travel or the use of the mail or facilities of interstate or foreign commerce in order to distribute crimegenerated proceeds or to commit crime of violence or otherwise operate in furtherance of illegal gambling drug trafficking or various other racketeering offenses hr 1279 would increase travel act penalties so that violation involving the distribution of racketeering proceeds or to promote racketeering activities is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 5 nor more than 20 years up from not more than five years violation involving crime of vi olence is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 30 years up from not more than 20 years or if death results by death or imprisonment for any term of ears or for life up from imprisonment for any term years or for life it would establish the same penalties for conspiracy to violate any of these provisions conspiracy is now punishab by imprisonment for not more than five years s 155 would increase the travel acts promotion and pr oceeds penalties to not more than 10 years and authorizes use of th death penalty where violation results in death it would also amend the travel act to prohibit interstate or foreign travel or use of the mails or facility of interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of obstructing justice misconduct which it make s punishable by imprisonment for any term of years and if death results by death or imprisonm ent for any term of years or for life section 103 violent crime amendments federal law outlaws carjacking if the crime is committed with intent to cause death or rious bodily harm subsection 103a would make the offense punishable regardless of wh ether it is committed with such an intent it would also increase the penalties for violations imprisonment for more than 20 years up from not more than 15 years if the offense results in serious bodily injury imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 30 years up from not more than 25 years and it makes conspiracies subject to the same punishment as the underlying offense up from not more than five years s 155 would only eliminate the specific intent requirement subsection 103b would amend 18 usc 924h which outlaws transfer of firearm knowing it will be used in crime of viol ence or of drug trafficking to establish five year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment and increases the maximum to imprisonment for not more than 20 years up from not more than 10 years s 155 would simply add possessed in furthe rance of language so that as in the case of the hr 1279 amendments the prosecution would not need to show that the firearm was affirmatively used it would add jurisdictional elem ent it would establish mandatory minimum and it would allow the existing 10 year maximum term of imprisonment to stand as sentencing alternative or s upplement to fine under title 18 subsection 103c would amend 18 usc 3582d to permit federal sentencing courts to restrict those with whom defe ndants convicted of racketeering drug and criminal street gang offenses may associate or communicate including their attorneys upon showing of probable cause that the association or communication is for the purpose of directing or partic ipating in criminal enterpri as subsection 3582d now stands it exempts attorneys from the orders reach and does not include street gang offenses s 155 would permit the authority of subsecti on 3582d to be used forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22165crs3 defendants convicted of criminal street gang violations but keeps the attorney exception to the bar subsection 103d would increase the pena lty under 18 usc 371 for conspiracies to violate the laws of the united states or to defraud the united states from imprisonment for not more than five years to imprisonment for not more than 20 years there are scores and perhaps hundreds of federa l felonies the majority of which carry maximum term of imprisonment of less than 20 years fo r these crimes subsection 103d would mean that planning to commit them would be puni shed more severely than committing them there is comparable provision in s 155 section 104 murder and other violence for hire increased penalties for use of interstate commerce federal law now condemn s interstate travel or the use of the mails or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce in furtherance of the commission of murder for hire section 104 would amend th law to include crimes of violence other than murder within the proscription and increases the sanctions for those violations that are not capital s 155 would adjust the ge neral maximum term of imprisonment from not more than 10 years to not more than 20 years the maximum in cases where bodily injury results from not more 20 years to not more than 30 years and the maximum in cases where death results from death or life imprisonment to death or imprisonment for life or any term of years section 105 violence in aid of racketeering penalty increases federal law prohibits murder and other forms of violence committed on behalf of racketeering enterprise either for hire or when motivated by reasons of membership in the enterprise the sentencing increases in section 105a for vi olence in aid of rack eteering mirror those in section 104 for murder or violence for hi re imprisonment for life as standard maximum sanction with escalating mandatory minimums often set at what had been the previous maximum sanction hr 1279 would permit prosecution of violation of 18 usc 1959 either in the district in which the crime of violence or in any of the districts in which racketeering activity of the enterprise occurs the constitution might constrain the sections reach here s 155 has compar able venue feature and would establish mandatory minimums but it would impose an calating series of increased sanctions section 106 violence committed during and in relation to drug trafficking section 106 of hr 1279 would create new federal crime 21 usc 865 which would prohibit the commission of or attempt or conspiracy to commit crime of violence during and in relation to drug trafficking offense violators would be subject to series of penalties if death results by death or imprisonment for life otherwise by imprisonment for life or any term of years but not less th an 10 years as general rule not less than 20 years in the case of an assault resulting in rious bodily injury and not less than 30 years in the case of kidnaping aggravated sexu assault or maiming s 155 has corresponding section which contains venue subsection whose reach might be constitutionally constrained section 107 multiple interstate murder section 107 would make it federal crime to travel in interstate or foreign commerce or to use the mails or other facilities in interstate or foreign commerce to commit two or more murders in violation of state or federal law or to attempt or conspire to do so th crime would be punishable by death or life imprisonment if death results by imprisonment for life or any term of years not less thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22165crs4 20 if serious bodily injury results and by imprisonment for life or any term of years not less than 10 in all other instances s 155s tr eatment differs in number of respects it would only apply if the defendant travels in interstate or foreig n commerce although the offense would apply in the case of one or more murders the defendant must either conspire to commit or actually commit the murder it would not cover attempt if death results violations would be punishable by death or imprisonment for life or for any term of years otherwise conspiracy would be punish able by imprisonment for not more than 30 years for each murder plotted section 108 rico predicates federal racketeer influen ced and corrupt organizations rico law prohibits using the patterned commission of certain crimes called predicate offenses or racketeering ac tivity to acquire or conduct th activities of an enterprise whose activities affect intersta or foreign commerce th underlying predicate offenses consist of designated fede ral crimes and b various fel onies under state law these state crimes may provide the basis for rico prosecution anywhere in the united states where state law applies state law does not apply without federal acquiescence however in any federal enclave within the state that is subject to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the united states as are portions of certain indian re servations section 108 would amend rico so that these state cr imes might serve as rico predicates when they would have qualified but for the fact th ey were committed in indian country or some other federal enclave subject to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the united states it would also place the multiple interstate murder offense created in section 107 among the federal rico predicates s 155 has provisions similar to those of section 108 section 109 bail for firearms offenses those arrested for the commission of federal crimes are entitled to release subject to thos judicially determin ed conditions necessary to assure public safety and their subsequent appearance at judicial proceedings in the case of crimes of violence and certain other serious crimes the judicial officer must hold hearing to determine in light of statutor identified factors whether any combination of conditions will assure pub lic safety and appearance of the accused in the case of serious drug trafficking and child abuse offe nses there is rebuttable presumption that conditions with provide the necessary assurances among the statutory factors to be consider ed are the nature and circumstances of the offense charged including whether the offense is crime of violence or involves narcotic drug section 109 would enlarge this category so that it embodies the nature and circumstances of the offense charged including whether the offense is crime of violence or involves controlled substance firearm explosive or destructive device it would also expand the grounds for rebu ttable presumption of detention numbering among them the fact the person has been charged with crime of violence or possession of firearm by member of certain disqualif ied classes s 155 differs in that it would afford the government the right to move for detention hearing when the accused is charged with unlawful firearms possession unde r any section 922g disqualifications but limits its firearm possession enlargement of the rebuttable presumption to cases of possession by felon convicted of drug offense carrying 10 year maximum term of imprisonment section 110 venue in capital cases section 110 would replace the requirement in 18 usc 3235 that capital cases be tried in the county in which they occur if possible with permission to prosecute capital cases where they are committed begun continued orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22165crs5 completed or b in cases involving importati on or other activities th at affect interstate or foreign commerce where the activities occur the constitution may limit the amendments reach s 155 has comparable provisions section 111 statute of limitati ons for crimes of violence federal capital offenses may be tried at any time most other federal crimes must be prosecuted within five years hr 1279 would establish 15 year statute of limitations for noncapital crimes of violence by virtue of the amended definition of crimes of violence the new period of limitations also applies to drug trafficking there may be some question whether the bill supercedes the longer statutes of limitation for crimes against children or for terrorism crimes involving an injury risk s 155 would establish 10 year statute of limitations for crimes of violence or eight years after the crime is discovered if long er it begins with the enigmatic phrase except as otherwise expressly provided by law it is unclear whether this refers to the general five year statute of limitations provided by law or to the specific periods for terro rism offenses child abuse offens arson offenses and the like or to all of them or to none of them section 112 definition of crime of violence federal law contains several definitions of crime of violence the most commonly used is found in 18 usc 16 hr 1279 would add drug trafficking crimes to the finition of crimes of violence s 155 has equivalent section 113 hearsay exception for wrongdoing the federal rules of evidence which apply in both criminal and civil cases make hearsay evidence inadmissible but include an exception for any statement offered against party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to and did procure the unavailability of the declarant as witness section 113 would amend the excep tion for any statement offered against party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing or who could reasonable foresee such wrongdoing would take place if the wrongdoing was intended and did procure the unavailability of the declarant as witness s 155 would grant an exception for wrongdoing engaged in acquiesced in or conspired for section 114 use of firearms in crimes of violence section 114 would supplement the sanctions for use of firearm during and in relation to crime of violence so that the offense would be punishable by imprisonmen t for not less than seven years up from not less than five years if the firearm is di scharged by imprisonment for not less than 15 years up from not less than 10 years and if th firearm is used to injure another person by imprisonment for not less than 20 years s 155 like hr 1279 would increase the general mandatory minimum for vi olations of 18 usc 924c from five to seven years and would treat the conspiracy the same as the underlying violations it would not increase the penalty for discharging firear m or that for wounding victim nor would it increase the penalty under the general conspi racy statute to not more than 20 years leaving it at not more than five years section 115 federal trial of juveniles as adults under existing federal law mandatory transfers of juvenile for trial as an adult are only available for 16 and 17yearold repeat offenders alleged to have committed crime of violence or drug trafficking section 115 would eliminate the requirement that the juvenile be repeat offender and would adjust the profile of the crimes th at require transfer s 155 would preserve the mandatory transfer limitation to repeat offenders else where it would permit trial of 16 and 17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22165crs6 yearolds as adults in the case of more selective collection of violent crimes but would authorize transfer back to juve nile proceedings in such cases section 116 law enforcement publicity campaign section 116 would explicitly authorize the attorney general to conduct publicity campaign to highlight the increased penalties under hr 1279 s 155 has similar provisions sections 117 and 119 illegal aliens in fbi database the federal bureau of investigations national crime information center maintains criminal records database hr 1279 contains two identical provisions sections 117 and 119 they would instruct the department of homeland security to provide the fbi with information on aliens who have overstayed their visas b een ordered removed from the us or have agreed to leave the us they would authorize the fbi to include information on immigration laws violations within the ncic systems s 155 has similar provisions section 118 crimes of violence by illegal aliens section 118 would establish an additional mandatory minimum sentence of five years 15 years in the case of alien previously removed for criminal misconduct for illegal aliens who commit attempt to commit or conspire to commit crime of violence as defined in section 16 or drug trafficking offense as defined in sec tion 924 s 155 has similar provisions section 120 study of any nexus between illegal aliens and gangs section 120 would direct the attorney general and the secretar of homeland security to study and report on the connection between illegal immigration and gang membership and activity s 155 has comparable provisions section 201 high intensity in terstate gang activity areas section 201 would authorize the appropriation of 60 million for each of the next five fiscal years to permit the formation of criminal street gang enforcement teams in high intensity interstate gang activity areas it would authorize the appropriation of 20 million for each of the next five fiscal years to allow the bureau of alcohol tob acco firearms and explosives batfe to hire agents and inspectors to be assigned to high intensity interstate gang activity areas to ensure impr oved reporting of gang weapons use and it would authorize appropriations of 75 million to employ additional assistant united states attorneys to be assigned to high intensity interstate gang activity areas the high intensity interstate gang activity areas would be designated by the attorney general in consultation with local area officials and the governors of the appropriate states the section would command the attorney general to establish an fbi national gang intelligence center to provide clearinghouse through which federal state and local law enforcement officials can share gang activity information and analysis he would also be directed to establish regional gang activity databases for each of the high intensity interstate gang activity areas s 155 has number of indivi dual grant provisions of its own section 202 gang and violent ffender technology and training section 202 would authorize appropriations of 20 million for each of the next five years for prosecutorial and law enforcement training and technolog to assist in the identification and prosecution of gang members and violent ffenders section 113 of s 155 is similar except that it would authorize 12 million ear for the same purposes as well as to create and expand witne ss protection programs
