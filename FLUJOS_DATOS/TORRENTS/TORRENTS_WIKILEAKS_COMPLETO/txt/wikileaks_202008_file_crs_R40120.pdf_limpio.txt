gasoline diesel fuel and home heating oil periodically draws congressional attention to the level of these exports recently observed to increase from 14 million barrels daily in 2007 to nearly 19 mbd during januaryseptember 2008 some policymakers have suggested that prohibiting oil exports would lower prices legislation introduced in the 110th congress hr 6515 s 2598 included provisions prohibiting some or all oil exports or would have reimposed the ban on alaskan oil exports but bills received major attention virtually all us oil exports are of refined products and crude is exported from the west coast trickle of crude oil in range of 25000 barrels per day during the first nine months of 2008 is sent to canada from the upper midwest however as canada is the largest supplier of crude oil to the united states providing nearly 19 mbd in 2008 also through september the us crude sent to canada is of limited significance the united states does export some gasoline to canada and mexico and middle distillates to latin america but some of this product would not meet us environmental standards an additional roughly 40 of us oil exports are of heavier products such as residual fuel oil and petroleum coke for which there is insufficient market in the united states because the market for oil is global prohibition on us oil exports would have negligible effect on price such restriction would only cause rebalancing in the movement of petroleum because countries that had purchased us oil products would need to fi nd them from other suppliers restrictions on exports might in fact create inefficiencies in the movement of world oil supplies that could foster less optimal distribution of oil and possibly lead to higher prices in some markets

us oil exports in recent years has led to perceptions that these exports are not in the national interest and have drawn congressional attention oil exports from the united states which averaged 14 million barrels daily mbd in 2007 and have increased to daily average of 19 mbd during the period of januaryseptember 20081 this represents roughly 10 of total daily consumption of oil products in the united states2 significant volume of these exports are of heavier oil products that us markets cannot absorb these include petroleum coke used in the making of steel and residual fuel that is often used as ship fuel exports of these products averaged respectively 40000 bd and 362000 bd annually during the first nine months of 2008 there would be advantage to keeping these products in the united states as it would be costly or impractical to further refine them into products that could be used in the automotive or residential heating sectors some have argued that restricting us oil exports would lower product prices however because oil is commodity in global market prohibition on us exports would not lower crude oil prices allowing for oil quality differentials regional anomalies and the policies of the governments of producing and consuming nations the price for crude oil and refined products is primarily set by world demand and not by nations dependence on imported oil 3 prohibiting us oil exports would compel those pu rchasing these products to seek elsewhere the supply longer available from the united states this would bring about rebalancing in the flow of oil worldwide but would have be aring on world demand and would not materially affect price however if the rebalancing in oil trade brings about higher transportation costs and other inefficiencies in world trade it is possible that some additional pressure could be placed on prices additional processing if feasible of heavier petroleum products for which there is insufficient domestic demand would also increase costs widespread but erroneous impression persists that the united states is continuing to export crude oil from the alaska north slope ans exports of crude oil from alaska ended in 2000 the only crude exported from the united states is an insignificant amount which does not originate from alaska it averaged 25000 barrels per day bd during the period of januaryseptember 2008 4 this report summarizes the history and current trends of us oil exports and examines proposals to restrict us oil exports as policy option to lower gasoline and diesel prices for information 1 us

oil development on alaskas north slope had not yet commenced oil at prudhoe bay was discovered in 1968 but agreement had been reached on pipeline destination two plans were under consideration one favored by many policy makers envisioned the oil transiting canada to chicagoarea destination proponents of this plan pointed out that the midwest had indigenous source of crude those opposing it cited the high cost of such lengthy and expensive pipeline construction project the other plan which ultimately became the route of choice for the transalaska pipeline system taps was to transport crude oil to the southern alaska seaport of valdez where it would be shipped to refiners by tanker proponents cited large cost savings and the timeliness of the smaller construction project opponents of this plan contended that taps sponsors true intent was to export north slope crude contention nied by taps supporters midwest destination proponents asserted that exports would run counter to the principle that us oil should be used domestically and remain available for consumption in the united states as matter of energy security 5 pipeline from prudhoe bay required transiting route where much of the rightofway was on federal lands the 197374 arab oil embargo brought new sense of urgency to the debate and legislation was required to end the stalemate over the route the compromise the transalaska pipeline act pl 93153 authorized rightofway for the shorter pipeline to valdez however the law included proviso that crude oil transiting the rightofway granted by congress would not be exported taps was completed in 1977 and initial oil shipments began to flow by yearend with continued oilfield development on the north slope production climbed steadily for 10 years peaking at 20 million barrels per day mbd in 1988 in subsequent years alaska north slope ans output declined falling to 15 mbd in 1995 and continuing downward to current flows of roughly 700000 bd during the mid1990s california produced about 800000 bd of crude oil the combination of californias indigenous production ans crude and foreign oil imports resulted in regional oil surplus in part because the west coast market is isolated from the rest of the country the local glut depressed prices for both california and ans producers since more crude was available on the west coast than was needed there at that time about 300000 bd of crude were shipped via the panama canal to the us gulf coast and us virgin islands 5 the notion that husbanding us resources for strictly domestic use promotes us energy security policy has deep roots prohibiting us crude oil exports has also been pr oposed as condition for opening up offshore tracts for leasing others have argued that there are greater us energy security benefits from consuming oil from abroad and keeping us supply in the ground both points of view are flawed and are discussed in greater detail in the section on oil export restrictions and price httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40120g23g495g21g495g561g17g146g149g561g7g161g153 g152g155g157g156g561 g561

producers who argued that the ban on the export of alaskan oil production was distorting the market and causing decline in the price of west coast production however this was much different oil market than witnessed in 2008the price for us production on the mainland had fallen to 1530 per barrel by 1993 california production was roughly 23 per barrel cheaper6 california oil producers argued that an increase of 12 per barrel would be sufficient incentive to increase production and create jobs june 1994 doe study exporting alaskan north slope crude oilbenefits and costs found that exporting alaska crude would increase producer receipts for both california and alaska oil the increased producer receipts would be the result of transportation savings realized by avoiding trip through the panama canal additionally doe estimated that lifting the ban would create 16000 jobs in the nearterm and predicted that larger producer revenues at the wellhead would result in 100000 bd more output from alaska and california than would be the case with continued export restriction interest in revisiting the statute prohibiting alaskan oil exports grew in 1995 when low world oil prices relatively benign level of net oil imports 80 mbd in contrast to current level exceeding 12 mbd and supportive department of energy doe coincided with renewed legislative efforts in both houses of congress bills introduced in the 104 th congress to repeal the ban hr 70 and s 395 passed by large margins 32477 and 7425 respectively the clinton administration supported ans crude exports and the president signed pl 10458 in november 1995 the first commercial tanker carrying ans oil to foreign country departed valdez on may 31 1996 approximately six months after the legislation lifting the ban was enacted 7 in 1999 report the general accounting office estimated that lifting the ban on alaskan oil exports had increased california crude oil prices by 98130 barrel higher than they would have been had the ban remained in place8 exports of ans oil totaled 36000 bd in 1996 they grew to 66500 bd in 1997 dipped slightly to 52900 in 1998 and rose to high of 74000 bd in 1999 according to unpublished doe figures during 1999 korea 50 japan 36 and china 12 imported nearly all ans exports the list of customers for this oil remained the same throughout the period before ans exports stopped in may 2000 the result of ownership changes and falling output about 7 of north slope output was shipped abroad viewed relative to total domestic consumption of 193 mbd in 2000 these exports comprised less than onehalf of one percent 6 annual crude oil prices by region may be found at httptontoeiadoegovdnavpetpet_pri_dfp1_k_ahtm 7 us general accounting office gaorced99191 alaskan rth slope oil limited effects of

would not lead to lower prices for products such as gasoline and diesel fuel except in nations where the price of petroleum products is controlled consumers worldwide pay the prevailing market price taking into account the quality of the crude the refining process taxes and distribution to pointsofsale in an unregulated market economic theory holds that commodities find the most efficient and economic pattern of distribution at market prices as has been noted most us oil exports are of products the us market cannot use or absorb additionally prohibiting us oil exports would compel customers for those exports to seek the supply longer provided by the us elsewhere this would have bearing on world demand for crude oil price is primarily determined by demand and by expectations that world supply will be able to satisfy it in the future consequently restrictions on us oil exports are highly unlikely to place downward pressure on world crude prices however upward pressure might be placed on oil prices the current worldwide import and export patterns would need to find new equilibrium and it could prove to be less economically efficient than currently for example the transportation costs of bringing products from elsewhere might be greater than from the united states while reduction in us dependence on petroleum imports could reduce anxiety about the adequacy of supply during an incident that reduced world oil production for time disruption in production from any supplier will affect the price for oil paid by all matter how dependent or independent they may be on imported oil 10 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 robert bamberger specialist in energy policy rbambergercrslocgov 77240 10
