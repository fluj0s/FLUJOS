development summary the energy and water appropriations bill includes funding for civil projects of the army corps of engineers the department of the interiors bureau of reclamation much of the department of energy and number of independent agencies including the appalachian regional commission the nuclear regulatory commission and the appropriated programs of the tennessee valley authority the administration requested 223 billion for these programs for fy1998 compared to 20 billion appropriated for fy1997 and 193 billion for fy1996 conference bill reported hrept 105271 on september 25 1997 agreed to 212 billion key issues involving the energy and water appropriations programs included full upfront funding for several construction projects proposed by the bureau of reclamation army corps of engineers and the department of energy the congress did not fund projects beyond the fy1998 period doe request to expand its privatization program for waste management and cleanup spending for the nuclear technology rd which involves electrometallurgical treatment of doe spent nuclear fuel the tennessee valley authority request to transfer authority over its nonpower appropriated programs and focus on its power programs in deregulated market starting in fy1999 the congress funded nonpower programs at 70 million for fy1998 and agreed to terminate funding after that the president signed the bill october 13 on october 17 he issued lineitem vetoes on eight projects funded by the bill five in the corps of engineers one in the bureau of reclamation and two in the

reclamation key policy issues in the west most of the large dams and water diversion structures were built by or with the assistance of the bureau of reclamation bureau where the corps has built hundreds of flood control and navigation projects the bureaus mission was to develop water supplies and to reclaim arid lands in the west primarily for irrigation today the bureau manages more than 600 dams in 17 western states providing water to approximately 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people the agency now views its mission as water management the administration has asked for an appropriation of 906 million in fy1998 current budget authority 131 million more than enacted for fy1997 the increase is largely due to 1433 million request for the california baydelta ecosystem restoration program calfed when this is subtracted the request results in decrease of 118 million for ongoing programs although funding for the baydelta program has been requested within the bureaus budget the appropriation will be allocated among several federal agencies it is expected that the majority of funding will go to the bureau and the corps the conferees provided most of the funding requested the fy1998 request includes 122 million less than the fy1996 enacted appropriations for water and related resources new category of funding which combines the old categories of construction operation and maintenance general investigations and emergency fund appropriations the water and related resources request includes 6 million for animasla plata controversial water supply project in southwestern colorado the house approved 829 million in fy1998 budget authority 77 million less than requested the senate approved 869 million 37 million less than requested the house approved 129

construction funding key policy issues research and development programs for fy1998 doe is requesting 695 billion for civilian and defense rd activities within the committees jurisdiction compared to 600 billion appropriated for fy1997 158 increase for civilian rd programs the request is 324 billion compared to 309 billion appropriated for fy1997 and for defense rd nuclear weapons programs the request is 366 billion compared to 292 billion appropriated for fy1997 the large increase most of which occurs in defense is mostly result of the switch to full construc tion cost funding without that change the fy1998 budget request would have been about 250 million or 42 above the fy1997 appropriation applied energy rd for applied energy rd programs doe is requesting an increase of 277 for in solar and renewable energy photovoltaics biofuels wind and electric energy systems and storage would receive most of the additional funds there may be debate over this increase however as result of different views about the role of the federal government in supporting research with potential commercial application the conference bill approved substantial increase over fy1997 but still well below the fy1998 request doe is also requesting 227 increase in nuclear energy rd in addition the program is shifting its goals from development of the next generation of light water reactors to support the nations existing power plants doe will establish an outside review panel to recommend strategic changes for the program the proposed change may generate debate crs7 about does relationship with the nations nuclear power industry large share of the request about 32 is for termination costs of various doe reactor facilities the conference bill funding level is well below the request primarily because it did not approve does nuclear security initiative request basic research programs for basic research doe is requesting small increase of 18 the basic research programs include general science and research basic energy sciences computational and technology research biological and environmental research and fusion energy science each of these programs is asking for small increase or decrease major issues appear although two items may receive attention in general sciences and research the highenergy physics hep program is requesting 394 million in advance appropriation for fy1999 to fy2004 for united states participation in the large hadron collider project at the center for european nuclear research cern this action could have significant implications for the rest of the hep program if future year funding is greater than level with this year which seems likely in fusion energy sciences doe is asking for 55 million for the last year of the collaborative engineering design of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter decision on construction will be made during fy1998 and debate about whether the united states should participate may take place this year the conference approved nearly all does request in these areas it expressed strong support for does basic science research activities it did not however approve advance appropriation for the hep program defense rd programs by far most of the increase in the doe rd request resulting from the change to full construction cost funding takes place in the stockpile stewardship program for fy1998 doe is asking for 876 million for remaining funds needed to construct the national ignition facility nif prior to the change the projected request for fy1998 for the nif was about 200 million in addition the request shows that the total construction cost of the project has increased by about 200 million to 105 billion the total project cost is now estimated at 12 billion up from 11 billion the request for the core stockpile stewardship program is about 05 below the fy1997 appropriation debate over this funding request may involve broader issues about the overall objectives of the doe efforts to maintain the nuclear weapon stockpile and whether these objectives can be met the conference provided substantial increase above the doe request for the core stockpile stewardship program it provided funding for fy1998 construction of nif but did not provide the requested full construction cost funding full construction cost funding for fy1998 the office of management and budget has instructed doe to request the full construction cost for any multiyear project which is currently under construction previously doe only asked for budget authority for the funds incrementally each year at level approximating the amount it intended to obligate that year doe argues that this change will allow the congress and administration to make decisions about projects with clearer view of their full costs in addition doe believes the new system will make it easier to crs8 ensure projects are completed on time and within budget outlays for these projects will still occur over their life as originally scheduled for fy1998 this change adds about 16 billion to the total doe budget request that would not have been there under the previous system of incremental requests about half of this addition occurs in the rd programs primarily in stockpile stewardship and the other half in nonrd programs primarily defense environmental restoration and waste management the conference declined to fund construction projects beyond the fy1998 period environmental cleanup and waste management cleaning up environmental contamination at doe nuclear facilities and disposing of radioactive waste continue to be the departments most expensive activities the fy1998 appropriations request for does environmental management program which manages those activities totals 72 billion up 12 billion from fy1997 the conference cut the total to just over 6 billion and transferred one of does cleanup programs formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap to the army corps of engineers most of the additional funding requested by doe would not have been spent in fy1998 but instead was to be held for gradual payout in future years about 1 billion in the fy1998 request would provide advance appropriations for privatized waste management contracts and 650 million would provide full funding for proposed construction projects if the future year funding in the request were subtracted the environmental management program would rise from 57 million in fy1997 to 576 million in fy1998 according to doe privatization doe requested 1006 billion in fy1998 to greatly expand the privatization of waste management and cleanup projects throughout the department congress provided 330 million for doe privatization in fy1997 conferees provided 200 million for privatization in fy1998 the doe privatization initiative is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting portion of project risks from the federal government to contractors profits to contractors would depend on their success in meeting project schedules and holding down costs potentially profits could be substantially higher than under traditional doe contracting arrangements in typical nonprivatized doe project contractor would be hired to build and operate facility with government funds doe would approve and pay all the contractors costs and then award the contractor profit based on performance under the privatization initiative contractor would be expected to raise almost all funding for necessary facilities and equipment for project the contractor would recover that investment and earn profit by charging previously negotiated fees to doe for providing services under the contract such as solidification of radioactive waste the contractor could earn higher profits by reducing costs but the contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expected or the required services were not delivered crs9 according does fy1998 budget request the privatization concept requires congress to provide sufficient budget authority in advance to cover contractors costs if project is canceled by the government without such advance appropriations according to doe contractors cannot raise money for privatized projects for example private financial backers of waste treatment plant would need assurance that if the plant were built and the federal government decided not to use it then doe would have funding available to pay all the projects costs to that point plus cancellation fee if project operated as planned the advance appropriations then would be gradually drawn down to help pay for the services specified by the contract in either case outlays from the advance appropriations for privatization would not occur until future years nearly half of the fy1998 privatization request 427 million would be devoted to the design and construction of two demonstration plants for treating highly radioactive waste now stored in underground tanks at does hanford site in washington state total costs of building and operating the demonstration plants are estimated at 46 billion with the majority of budget outlays expected from fy2002 through fy2007 doe estimates that privatizing the project will reduce costs by 1030 the conferees placed high priority on the hanford waste project the remaining 579 million of the fy1998 privatization request would provide advance appropriations for 11 other environmental projects throughout the doe complex among the larger projects are radioactive solid waste treatment facility at oak ridge tennessee spent nuclear fuel storage facilities at the savannah river site in south carolina and lowlevel liquid waste treatment facility at idaho falls idaho estimated cost savings range from 10 40 controversy over the doe privatization initiative has centered primarily on the future budget outlays that will be generated by the large advance appropriations being requested for the program in addition to the 13 billion sought or already provided doe plans to request about 500 million per year for privatization during the subsequent five fiscal years according to recent doe testimony concerns have been raised that large future outlays for privatized projects could have unpredictable effects on other programs in the energy and water appropriations bill other privatization issues include the accuracy of does projections of cost savings and the degree of risk to be borne by privatized contractors recent report by the general accounting office found some of does costreduction projections to be overstated although the agency agreed that substantial savings could be expected from the new contracting approach much of the success of the program may depend on the amount of real risk that contractors agree to accept and how much risk remains with doe because few privatized contracts have yet been signed that factor remains subject to uncertainty other environmental management funding excluding advance appropriations for privatized contracts and construction projects funding for doe environmental cleanup and waste management programs is to rise only slightly in fy1998 one exception is the formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap which would get boost from 75 million to 182 million fusrap cleans up nonfederal sites that were radioactively contaminated by us nuclear weapons work and other activities according to doe the accelerated funding would advance the completion of the program from fy2006 to fy2002 crs10 conferees transferred the fusrap program to the army corps of engineers an idea that has been proposed for all doe cleanup activities 37 million reduction is proposed for development of cleanup and waste management technology to 258 million the largest reduction is in the subsurface contaminants category which would be cut by twothirds and receive new projects in fy1998 in addition to the funding cut 50 million of technology development spending would be shifted to technology deployment initiative to help ensure that the most promising new technologies are actually used by cleanup contractors the senate cut funds to the technology further 25 million to 233 million the committee report declared that changes need to be made in the management execution and oversight of the program to improve the results of the technology investment the house energy and water subcommittee with similar negative comments cut the program 75 million to 183 million the conference agreement provides 220 million nuclear energy science and technology an increase of more than 80 million is being sought for the office of nuclear energy science and technology whose activities include development of nuclear energy systems international nuclear safety assistance termination of unused facilities and development of spent nuclear fuel treatment processes the fy1998 funding request for the office totals 415 million major issue in the nuclear energy budget in previous years involved funding for advanced versions of light water reactors the type of nuclear power plant currently in commercial operation throughout most of the world opponents called the funding an example of corporate welfare contending that the nuclear industry which shared the programs costs should develop new reactors entirely on its own according to doe the program will be successfully completed in fy1997 and only 55 million in closeout costs are being sought for fy1998 with the end of the advanced light water reactor program doe is proposing followon program that would develop technology to support continued operation of existing us nuclear power plants however the conference agreement provided funding for the initiative the proposed nuclear energy security program funded at 39 million in fy1998 would have helped assure the diversity of the nations energy supply and help reduce emissions from fossil fuels according to the doe budget request the program is intended to develop technologies to mitigate the aging of nuclear plant components develop advanced reactor control systems overcome obstacles to longer lasting nuclear fuel and study other nuclear plant operational problems as with the light water reactor program opponents contend that such research should be the responsibility of the nuclear industry another controversial element in the nuclear energy budget request is 25 million for nuclear technology research and development which involves the electrometallurgical treatment of doe spent nuclear fuel conferees provided 12 million in that treatment process spent fuel is melted and highly radioactive isotopes are electrically separated from uranium and plutonium according to the doe fy1998 budget request electrometallurgical crs11 treatment could be used to transform unstable spent fuel into safer forms for storage and disposal opponents contend that such treatment is unnecessary and that the process could be used for separating plutonium to make nuclear weapons they note that the process uses much of the same technology and equipment developed for the plutoniumfueled integral fast reactor which was canceled by congress in 1993 partly because of concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation lineitem veto on october 17 the president issued lineitem veto of two department of energy projects 4 million for

appropriated in fy1997 the agency has also indicated that this is the last year it will request funds for the appropriated component of tva federal appropriations do not support tvas power programs annual appropriations go to nonpower programs such as flood control and navigation management the agency wants to make smooth transition out of the nonpower programs and focus crs12 solely on its power programs in deregulated power market tva believes that the army corps of engineers could run its nonpower projects the senate cut the tva appropriations 20 million to 86 million and commented that tvas efforts have not produced consensus on way to achieve significant shift away from appropriations the house recommended cutting the entire 106 million appropriation instructing tva to pay for the nonpower activities out of its 58 billion power program the conference provided 70 million and accepted the administrations proposal to terminate appropriated funding for tva after fiscal year
