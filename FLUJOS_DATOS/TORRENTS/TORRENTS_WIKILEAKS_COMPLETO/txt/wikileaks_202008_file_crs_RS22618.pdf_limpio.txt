clean air act one ruling that the act allows the environmental protection agency epa to regulate vehicle emissions based on their global warming impacts the other that epa regulations validly impose an annual as opposed to hourly emissions change test in determining whether modiﬁcation of stationary source makes it new source requiring permit superfund act decision held that liable parties who incur cleanup costs beyond their fair share may sue for reimbursement despite another provision in the act restricting contribution actions another case dealt with the relationship between the clean water act and endangered species act holding that the formers mandate that epa shall delegate permitting program to state when statutory criteria are met is not subject to the equally unqualiﬁed command in the latter that consultation with federal wildlifeprotection agencies occur the remaining case involves constitutional issue it held that two counties ﬂow trol laws requiring that solid

consultation with federal wildlifeprotection agencies occur the remaining case involves constitutional issue it held that two counties flow control laws requiring that solid waste generated within the counties be taken to processing fac ilities within the counties did not offend the constitutions dormant co mmerce clause because the facilities were publicly owned the supreme court in recent years has accepted for argument only about 70 to 80 cases each term so it is matter of some note when several of them fall into single area such was the situation in the courts 20062007 term with the court accepting for oral argument five environmental cas out of 72 altogether this interest in environmental cases continues pattern of veral years duration indee d the court also decided five environmental cases in its 20032004 term the five environmental cases in the 2006 2007 term were varied lot two involving the clean air act one the superfund act one the relationship between the clean water act and endangered species act and one the federal constitutional limits on local solidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22618crs2 waste flow control the courts decisions in these cases were equally varied ranging from two unanimous decisions duke energy and atlantic research to two that were 54 massachusetts and national association of home builders in both of the 54 decisions justice kennedy was th decisive fifth vote the clean air act and greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles massachusetts v epa 127 s ct 1438 apr 2 2007 this case marks the debut of global warmin g in the supreme court it arose from petition asking epa to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles under the clean air act caa on novel ground their status as greenhouse gases ghgs promoting global warming in 2003 epa denied the petition arguing principally that caa section 202 does not authorize epa to regulate vehicle emi ssions on that basis twelve states and several environmental groups then challenged the denial in the dc circuit in 2005 the dc circuit rejected 21 the ch allenge to epas denial the two judges voting to reject did so for different reasons however one judge agreed with epa that the section 202 phrase in his judgment allows the agency to inject policy considerations into its decision whether to regulate vehicle emissions for example the administrations preference for economic incentives over regulatory mandates the other judge held that petitioners had not suffered the injury requisite for federalcourt standing ubiquitous issue in global warming litigation the supreme court decided 54 in favor of the petitioner states and environmental groups reversing the court below at the out set the majority opinion by justice stevens held that petitioners had standing explaining that the required injury in fact for standing was provided by massachusetts s loss of shoreland throug h globalwarminginduced sea level rise and that states seeking to establish standing in federal court are entitled to special solicitude on the merits the court held that caa section 202 empowers epa to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles based on their global warming impacts the statute being unambiguous on this sc ore also epa may not inject policy considerations into its decision to reject regulating such emissions as the agency had done the section 202 phrase in his judgment was not roving license to ignore the statutory text epas judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant might endanger public health and welfare in two fourjus tice dissents chief justice roberts rejected standing and justice scalia denied that epa had the requi site authority under the caa the courts ruling is likely to have seve ral effects most obviously epa may find it difficult to avoid regulating ghgs from new vehicles according to the court epa can avoid taking further action only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provide s some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion section 202 sa ys that once epa makes the judgment that pollutant might endanger public health or welfare it must issue regulations beyond the implications for ne w vehicles the courts decision pressures epa to move against ghg emissions from sta tionary sources under title i of the caa indeed lawsuit seeking to compel just that was stayed by the dc circuit pending the supreme courts decision in massachusetts v epa the decision also could influence congress to act on global warming partly because the default regulatory structure of the caa does not easily accommodate global phenomenon like climate change in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22618crs3 courts the decision could affect many ghg related cases now pending as by supporting finding of standing and could courage new suits to be brought the clean air act and new source review environmental defense v duke energy corp 127 s ct 1423 apr 2 2007 this case arises from caa enforcement action brought by epa against duke energy charging it with carrying out 29 m odifications to its coalfired powerplants without obtaining prevention of significan t deterioration psd permits required for new sources under the act environmenta l groups including environmental defense intervened as plaintiffs the dispute cen ters on how to measure the emissions from stationary source of emissions so as to termine whether physical or operational change in that source increases the amount in the caas words of emissions the existence of such an emissions increase is pivotal si nce it brands the physical or operational change as modification and the modified source in turn as new source requiring psd permit and stateoftheart pollution controls in the district court the united states argued that dukes refurbishment of its aging plants would allow them to operate more of the time resulting in increases in annual emissions and triggering under epas psd re gulations new source requirements however the district court held that those regulations impose an hourly standard under an hourly standard project modification allowing plant to operate for more hours but without increasing emissions per hour as d uke energy had done would not count as an increase in emissions and so would not tr igger new source requirements the fourth circuit affirmed explaining that since the caa states that modification for psd purposes means the same as for new source performance standards nsps purposes epa regulations elaborating on the statutory finitions also had to be the same thus it read the agencys psd regulations as rning on hourly emissions just as the earlier promulgated nsps regulations had done environmental defense but not epa filed petition for certiorari indeed the united states opposed the petition presumably becau epa had adopted the hourly standard in the fourth circuit ruling in its new psd regulations 70 fed reg 61081 then too the bush administration had long been unenthusiastic about the psd enforcement effort against utilities set in moti on in the prior administration in any event the supreme court took the cas over the united states opposition one of the very few times the court has accepted case solely at the request of an environmental group as with its global warming decision hande d down the same day the supreme court ruled for the environmental side this time unanimously the court concluded that just because the caa states that modification under psd means the same as under nsps does not require that epa regulations in elaborating on the statutory definition also have to be identical thus the fourth circuits effort to stretch the meaning of the the psd rules to conform them with the earlier nsps rule was misguided the wording of the psd rule said the supreme court does not support an hourlyrate reading accordingly the court vacated the fourth circuit decision and remanded the case to the circuit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22618crs4 the superfund act and contribution suits united states v atlantic research corp 127 s ct 2331 june 11 2007 the superfund act more formally the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla imposes liability for cleanup costs on wide range of persons connected with conta minated site two scenarios may occur in the first scenario there is government compulsion liable party such as the site owner waits for epa to clean up the site and then demand reimbursement or epa orders the liable party to do the cleanup itself in either case the liable party if made to pay more than its fair share may turn around and other parties made liable by cercla in contribution action in the second scenario the liable party cleans up voluntarily that is without waiting for government clea nup order or costrecovery effort and then seeks reimbursement from ot her cerclaliable parties two cercla provisions authorize or arguab ly authorize such actions and their relationship has been heavily litigated cercla section 113f1 authorizes liable parties to seek contribution from other liable parties during or following an epa action seeking cleanup or reimbursement order cercla section 107 ab makes liable parties responsible for n ecessary costs of response incurred by private entities the majority view in the lowercourt decisions is that liable parties may invoke only section 113f1 while innocent partie s must use section 107ab in cooper industries inc v aviall services inc 543 us 157 2004 the supreme court held that contribution actions by liable parties under section 113f1 may be brought only once epa has filed civil action agains t the liable party ordering cleanup or seeking reimbursement however the court expre ssly reserved the question of whether liable party such as one barre d from using 113f1 may sue instead under section 107ab the question is funda mental to the supe rfund progra m obviously owners of contaminated sites are more willing to clean up without waiting for epa attention if they can get re imbursement for cleanup costs they incur beyond their fair share because it is typical that contamin ated site never receive s epa attention given the large number of such sites this point is partic ularly important the eighth circuit decision held that private party that voluntarily undertakes cleanup for which it may be held liable under cercla thus barring it from seeking contribution under section 113f1 may seek contribution from another liable party under section 107ab in an opinion by justice thomas the supreme court unanimously affirmed the ava ilability of section 107ab ac tions to liable parties said the court is dictated by th provisions lack of any expre ss qualifiers to its reach nor does making section 107ab available to liable partie s render section 113f redundant courts avoid readings of stat utory language that make ot her statutory language mere surplusage rather said the court the two remedies complement each other section 113f1 authorizes contribution action to liable parties with common liability stemming from an epa action institute d under 106 or 107a and 107a permits cost recovery as distinct from contribution by private party that has itself incurred cleanup costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22618crs5 the clean water actendangered species act relationship national association of home builders v defenders of wildlife 2007 westlaw 1801745 us june 25 2007 06340 this case arises from the conflict between the literal commands of clean water act cwa section 402b and the laterenacted endangered species act section 7a2 cwa section 402 is the heart of th cwa it imposes permit requirement for pointsource discharges into waters of the united states this permit program is initially administered within state by epa until epa on the states request approves delegation of the program to the state section 402b states that epa shall approve such delegation if the state satisfies nine criteria which generally seek to establish that the state has the legal authority in place to administer as effective program as epas at the same time however section 7a2 requires each federal agency to consult with the fish and wildlife service or for marine species noaa fisheries in order to insure that any agency action is not likely to jeopardize endangered and threatened species or adversely affect designated critical habitat the question is does the consultation requirement act as tenth precondition for permitprogra m delegation even though cwa section 402b on its face mandates delegation if the nine criteria stated there are met this case arose from epas ultimate positi on in connection with arizonas request for delegation of the permit program that epas decision was not subject to consultation the immediate concern is whether an arizona permitting program and state permitting programs generally are as effective in protecting federally designated endangered and threatened species as the epaadministered permit program given that only epaissued permits are subject to consultation more broadly how much contraction in the scope of consultation would occur if other federal programs using nondiscretionary language are exempt from consultation the ninth circuit held that section 7 a2 stated an inde pendent criterion that had to be met 420 f3d 946 9th cir 2005 by 54 the supr eme court reversed justice alito writing for the majority recognized th at in cwa section 402b and section 7a2 the court faced clash of seemingly categorical and at first glance irreconcilable legislative commands to t up section 7a2 as an independent criterion for permitprogram legations however would be to countenance repeal by implication of the mandatory shall in cwa section 402b repeals by implication are disfavored by courts moreover the agencies charged with implementing the again the fish and wildlife service and noaa fisheries had resolved the tension between the two statutes through regulation stating that section 7a2 applies to all actions in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control emphasis added because the conflic ting commands of sections 7a2 and 402b create genuine ambiguity said the court and becau the regulations limita tion to discretionary acts is reasonable resoluti on it is entitled to deference thus concluded the court epa may pprove state delegations of section 404 permitting authority without consultation we are now likely to see federal government briefs filed in litigation over other nondiscre tionary federal authorities arguing that on the basis of national association of home builders consultation is requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22618crs6 solid waste flow control united haulers assn v oneidaherkimer solid waste management authority 127 s ct 1786 apr 30 2007 state and local restrictions on the interstate flow of municipal solid waste have long interested the courts which have repeatedly struck them down as incompatible with the dormant commerce clause the dormant commerce clause held to be implicit in the constitutions commerce clause art i sec 8 cl 3 addresses state and local laws that either expressly discrimin ate against interstate commer ce which are tested under strict scrutiny test and almost always struck down or b burden interstate commerce in nondiscriminatory fashion which are tested under lenient bala ncing test and often sustained the interstatewaste court deci sions including five from the supreme court have applied strict scrutiny to invalid ate state and local restrictions on both import of solid waste from other states and export of waste to other states the latter called flow control flow control ordinances typically require that all waste generated within locality be taken to locally designated transfer or disposal facility united haulers concerns flow control the case arose against the backdrop of 1994 supreme court decision stri king down town flow control ordinance applying the strict scrutiny test ca carbone inc v town of clarkstown 511 us 383 1994 the designated transfer facility in carbone was privately owned while the designated facilities in united haulers were public the question wa s does this publicprivate distinction make difference to the dormant commerce clause analysis the district court found the county flow c ontrol laws at issue here unconstitutional under carbone reading that decision to require stri ct scrutiny and reject nearly all flow control laws the second circ uit reversed finding the public private distinction to be dispositive thus allowing flow control in this case by 63 the supreme court affirmed writing for the majority chief justice roberts pronounced that flow control ordinances be nefitting public facilities while treating all private companies the same do not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the dormant commerce clause and thus do not trigger strict scrutiny treating public and private facilities diffe rently under the clause makes sens the majority explained for several reasons first public and private facilities have very different objectives only government has duty to protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens given this difference laws favoring local government facilities are less likely to be motivated by economic protectionism than those favorin g private entities second treating public facilities the same as privat ones under the dormant commerce clause would lead to unbounded interference by the courts with local government and third waste disposal has long been traditional function of local government suggestin g that federal courts should be particularly hesitant to interfere since strict scrutiny did not apply the c ourt moved on to the nient balancing test for nondiscriminatory burdens on in terstate commerce and found the test satisfied thus the flow control ordinances were upheld
