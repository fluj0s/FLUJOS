interoperability issues of competition and fair access jeffrey w seifert analyst in information science and technology policy resources science and industry division summary instant messaging im is one of the fastest growing internet applications the recent debate about im is related to the broad issues of open access rules and competition in the high speed internet service and cable television markets although im technology has evolved largely independent of formal regulation review of the aoltime warner aoltw merger brought issues of interoperability the ability to exchange messages between multiple im services among im services under scrutiny both in the us and europe concerns about open access and accessibility for the disabled have been raised by members of congress the federal trade commission ftc the federal communications commission fcc and the european commission ec these issues highlight the growing complexity of regulating converging technologies this report discusses the technology behind instant messaging and provides an overview of the issues it will be updated as necessary background instant messaging im is one of the fastest growing free services on the internet im combines the immediacy of telephone call with the network presence of electronic mail email to create an instantaneous system for exchanging messages between two people in its simplest form im applications are used for the synchronous exchange of text messages however recent developments in im technology also now allow users to exchange files pictures and even voice messages many industry observers are optimistic about the future of im suggesting that im software could become part of web browsers and will soon become available for wireless devices such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants1 1 barry nance instant messaging good for ecommerce computerworld 15 may 2000 p 74 john borland instant messaging moves to cell phones cnet newscom 23 february 2000 httpwwwcanadacnetcomnews010042001556076html congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the interest in im stems from the larger debate regarding the america online aol time warner inc merger concerns have been raised not only about the possibility of aoltime warner being dominant force in cablebased internet services but also that it could leverage its customer base against providers of alternative high speed internet services such as digital subscriber lines dsl which runs over telephone lines the im debate serves as case study of the broad issues of open access rules and competition in the high speed internet service and cable television markets2 as the internet continues to develop as medium for communications and entertainment it is possible these issues will be raised again in the context of related technology both us and european regulators expressed concern that the merger would create company capable of controlling significant portion of both the distribution channels for new media content cable tv internet access satellite broadcasts as well as the content itself digital music books videos the ec ftc and fcc all examined the im issue either directly or indirectly as part of their larger overall reviews of the aoltime warner aoltw merger in europe the ec was primarily concerned about the combined companys ability to shut out competitors access to distribution channels for the emerging market for the digital delivery of music sports and entertainment httpeuropaeuintcommrole_enhtm although some observers believed there was less potential for such monopolistic control by combined aoltw in europe than the united states other observers cited aol europes rapid growth as one of the leading paneuropean internet service providers isps as an indicator of its potential to create walled garden of digital media3 the proposed aoltw merger was further complicated by proposed 5050 joint venture between britishbased emi music and time warner which represent two of the five largest recording companies in the world in october 2000 the ec approved the merger on the condition time warner call off its merger with emi and sever its relationship with european media giants bertelsmann ag and vivendi sa the ec did not include restrictions regarding im deciding that aols dominance in europe was far weaker than in the united states4 in the united states where aol is the largest isp and time warner is the second largest cable television company there was greater focus on infrastructure questions the ftc review concentrated on the implications of combining different technical capabilities in one company particularly on open access as means to ensure competition between rival isps and choice of technologies5 in december 2000 the ftc approved the aoltw merger with conditions these conditions included requiring the merged company to open its cable system to competing isps before aol is allowed to 2 see crs issue brief ib10045

either the content or consumer access to interactive television services provided by nonaffiliated providers and requiring the merged company to continue to support and promote its dsl services at comparable level as it does its cable services6 the fcc which held hearings about the impact of the merger on im addressed the issue directly as part of its overarching concerns regarding the development and use of new communications technologies and preserving competition between service providers httpwwwfccgovcsbaoltw072700_enbancagendahtml in january 2001 the fcc also approved the merger with conditions in addition to reinforcing the ftcs requirement that aoltw open its cable systems to competitor isps and restricting its ability to enter into exclusive access agreements with att the fcc also restricted the merged company from offering advanced im services such as videoconferencing until it either implements an industrywide standard or enables interoperability standards between its im system and that of three other competitors httpwwwfccgovbureauscablepublic_notices2001fcc01011_factpdf who provides instant messaging services and who uses them most im services require users to download and install small program on their computers to use an im application users first create personal directory of buddies the im software alerts the users when one or more of the users buddies is online and available to chat via instant messaging users then send an invitation or short message to person to initiate the discussion im is more expeditious than email because the message immediately appears on the persons screen in contrast email messages are stored on central server until the recipient decides to check and download the messages although earlier forms of synchronous chat technology such as the unix talk feature and internet relay chat irc have existed for over decade the current incarnation of im did not become widely available until 19977 originally noted for its entertainment value im was seen as way for younger users often using unusual screen names8 to communicate however as im has grown in popularity and functionality some industry observers predict that im will grow into 6 billion market as it becomes an important business tool9 according to some estimates 29 of us corporations currently use im while 42 may begin to utilize im for business in the future10 there are number of potential business uses for im including providing live online customer service for shoppers and to support communication and collaboration in virtual office where 6

and negotiations during the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks many people turned to cellphonebased text messaging and internetbased instant messaging to get around the congested phone networks aol reported 20 jump in instant messaging volume handling 12 billion messages on september 1111 growing number of im services are now available most at cost to the user although an exact accounting of the number of people using im applications is not available based on the reported number of users some of the most commonly used im programs include aol instant messenger aol im icq i seek you yahoo messenger and msn messenger12 interoperability issues until recently im has evolved largely unnoticed and independent of any formal regulation since im is often free service offered to attract users to purchase other services such as internet access there has been commercial market to regulate however two qualitative changes in the im market may change this situation first the rapid increase in im users has helped draw more competitors into the field heightening the vested interest in the future of im as service second the advanced technical capabilities associated with im software programs such as file transfers and voice messaging suggest that im has the potential to evolve from the simple exchange of text messages to something more akin to telecommunications services regulated by the fcc consequently interoperability issues have arisen that could affect the future growth of im within the larger controversy over interoperability two interrelated issues can be identified open access and accessibility open access concerns have been raised mostly by companies who want to assure their ability to enter into certain markets for services accessibility concerns have been raised mostly by advocates who wish to maintain the internet as resource that is accessible to all people regardless of their disability the major question being debated at this time is whether there should be interoperability between different im applications at the present there is technical standard to guide the development of im applications unlike email programs which conform to certain industryled standards each company develops its im products as it chooses the result is that in order to communicate with another user both people must be using the same application for example an individual cannot use aol im to communicate with another person who uses yahoo messenger in response to growing concern over the lack of standards the internet engineering task force ietf convened the instant messaging and presence protocol working group imppwg in 1999 to define the protocols and data formats necessary to develop widely interoperable instant messaging system httpwwwietforgoverviewhtml in february 2000 the ietf issued minimum set of requirements in request for comments rfc alex daniels and brendan barrett saved by text messages washington techway 1 11 october 2001 p14 12 jill carroll fcc may open aol messaging center wall street journal 13 september 2000 a3 crs5 and continued to review the various industryproposed protocols and suggestions the ietf has since narrowed down list of ten proposals to three protocols that it is actively considering the ietfs review is focusing on the protocols ability to provide presence informationthe ability to locate other users who are online as well as the ability to communicate using different systems it is unclear if the interoperability protocol tentatively called the common profile for presence and instant messaging cpim will be approved by the ietf13 open access the debate over im interoperability focuses primarily on the issue of open access and is related to the original concerns over whether merged aoltime warner will provide access to time warners high speed cable lines to rival isps although estimates vary depending on the measurements used two of the most popular im programs aol im and icq are both owned by aol based on the global number of registered accounts which may or may not actually be used in any given month the wall street journal reports that icq has 73 million accounts and aol im has 655 million accounts the next mostpopular program is microsoft messenger with 18 million accounts14 these numbers also includes multiple accounts created by the same people in contrast media metrix estimates that aol im has 215 million unique users individuals using the service during given time period only being counted once icq has 91million users yahoo messenger has 106 million users and microsoft messenger has 103 million users15 at this time aol im and icq are not compatible with each other icq users cannot communicate with aol im users however it was widely reported that in september 2000 it was discovered that aol had conducted research and development tests that enabled individuals to use their icq username and password to log on and chat using aol im although it was reported these tests were successful aol has not extended compatibility for all users beyond this test phase16 since july 1999 several companies have tried to engineer their products so they can interface with the aol im user database without the permission of aol in its june 26 2000 response to the fcc aol stated that it has blocked these unauthorized attempts to access its user database on the grounds of protecting the computer security and privacy of its users aol also said it has licensed its im technology at cost to over dozen companies httpwwwfccgovcsbaoltwresp626txt although aol submitted plan for interoperability to the ietf in june 2000 critics claimed that the plan was not detailed enough and did not commit aol to specific 13 jennifer disabatino task force focusing on im interoperability

interoperable im system but it must address issues of security privacy and user authentication in testimony to the fcc in july 2000 president of aol interactive services barry schuler stated that it would take over year to fully develop the technology and perform quality testing18 in response some instant messaging competitors refute schulers claim noting their previous successes in temporarily making their products compatible with aol im before being blocked by aol as evidence of their position19 several companies critical of aols approach to im joined together to form an organization called freeim freeim is strong advocate for the development of open standards for im and directs most of its criticism at aol accessibility the accessibility issue has been raised primarily by advocates for the deaf such as the national association of the deaf nad and tdi formerly known as telecommunications for the deaf inc according to these organizations im is critical method for deaftodeaf and deaftohearing communication httpwwwnadpolicynetproactivenewsroomreleasevtmlid18761 they suggest it represents necessary alternative for communication in the face of the growth of voice telephony over the internet they believe im is important so that the deaf are not marginalized in terms of internet accessibility advocates for the deaf also argue that im is much easier and quicker means to communicate compared to using text telephones ttys they advocate that im technology should be developed under the principles of open standards and interoperability options for congress to date there have been hearings or bills introduced in the 107th congress regarding instant messaging however the outcome of efforts to achieve im interoperability could impact other internetrelated issues such as the merger of media companies broadband competition and the digital divide im technology is rapidly evolving and could be new platform for providing videoconferencing interactive gaming andor ebusiness services consequently congress may decide to revisit concerns about im interoperability and accessability in the larger context of these other issues 17 america online backs world
