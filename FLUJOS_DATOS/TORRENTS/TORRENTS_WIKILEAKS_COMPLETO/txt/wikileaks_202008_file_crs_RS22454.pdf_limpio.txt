defense logistics agency crafts concept for resupplyship program inside the navy november 28 2005ships for periods of up to 4 years and 11 months according to the american shipbuilding association asa trade association representing certain shipyards and shipbuildingrelated firms2 msc as of june 2006 had renewed the leases of four of these ships for additional periods of up to 4 year s and 11 months providing potential total lease periods of up to almost 10 years3 american shipbuilding ssociation asa position supporters of us shipyards particularly the asa are concerned that in addition to the four ships cited above msc in the future may renew or extend the leases of other foreignbuilt ships beyond 4 years and 11 mont hs and that the defense logistics agency dla another part of dod might so begin leasing foreignbuilt ships4 asa argues that leasing ship for period of almost 10 years indicates that dod has long term need for such ship and that in such cases dod should purchase ship and have it built in us yard asa argues that leasing foreignbuilt ship for almost 10 years effectively circumvents the requirement in 10 usc 7309 that us military ships be built in us yards the asa supports changing 10 usc 2401 to limit leases of foreignbuilt ships to more than two years including all options to renew or extend the contract asa says the proposal is intende d to encourage dod in cases where dod has longterm need for ship to purchase the ship and have it built in us yard rather than lease foreignbuilt ship the asa states that the department of defense dod is purchasing via longterm leases foreignbuilt ships to meet longterm military requirements the leases in question are 5 years in duration and can be and have been renewed for another 5year period the length of these leases indicate long term military requirement and results in facto purchases of the ships in contrave ntion of us acquis ition law section 7309 of title 10 usc which states that ships for th us military shall be built in the united states and the intent of the budget enforcement act of 1990 limiting leases of capital assets the budget enforcement act of 1990 placed limit on the duration of leasing contracts for capital equipment by the execu tive branch in an effort to impose budget discipline on future year contract obligations by the government and to encouragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22454crs3 5 asa point paper provided to crs on may 3 2006the purchase rather than leasing of capital assets to meet longterm requirements because of the higher cost associated with leasing to enforce this budget discipline the office of management and budget omb issued scoring guidelines stating that vessels and other capital assets leased for period of five years or longer would have to be scored in the budget year in which the contract was entered into and the budget request in that year would have to include authorization for the total multiyear lease contract this scoring rule eliminated th budget benefits of leasing versus buying americanbuilt ships additionally in the 1980s congress passed restrictions in defense appropriations bills limiting ship and other capital leases to not more than 18months in duration in an effort to deter leasing and discipline outyear funding obligations dod has been circumventing these leasing restrictions by entering lease contracts of 59months one m onth shy of five years ther eby avoiding triggering the requirement of scoring the entire cost of the lease in the first year as required by the budget enforcement act of 1990 many of these 59month leases are being renewed for an additional 59month period resultin g in foreignbuilt ships operating for dod for period of nearly 10 consecutive years while the budget enforcement act met its intended objective of ending longterm leases of usbuilt ships it has opened the door to leasing foreignbuilt assets most of the ships under lease are used commercial ships of south korean manufacture that have been modified to et us military speci fications dod states that it needs to have the ability to lease these ships for 59 months to provide the foreign owner of the ship access to private financing to convert commercial ship to meet specialized military requirement us shipbuilders cannot obtain bank financing to build new ships to meet the requirement unless they recover the entire construction cost in the five years of the lease making the lease payments for newly built ships noncompetitive with foreign ships of ten or more years old for which the capital cost has been significantly amortized while dod needs to have the flexibility to lease foreignbuilt ships to meet shorterterm or emergency requirements the growing reliance by dod on this practice is resulting in the defacto purchas of foreignbuilt ships to meet special dedicated longterm military requirements the asa recommends support for an amendment to the dod fy07 authorization and appropriations bills that will limit the dur ation of dod lease contracts of foreignbuilt ships to tw years including contract options5 dod position dod argues that its leases of foreignbu ilt ships are the most costeffective way to meet its needs for the ships in question and that limiting such leases to more than two years would make them much more expensiv and difficult to imple ment and therefore less cost effective dod opposes changing 10 usc 2401 to limit leases of foreign built ships to more than two years dod states that msc charters ships from the commercial ma rket to meet the requirements of dod components and respond to changes in the operational environment unfortunatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22454crs4 very few commercial ships with high milita ry utility have been constructed in us shipyards in the past 20 years consequen tly when msc has requirement to charter vessel nearly all of the offers are for foreignbuilt ships in cases where the need is immediate or subject to change due to the operational environment or other factors commercial charter is the only practical way to obtain the capability when requirement for particular type of vessel is known to be longterm as was the case with the large medium speed rollonroll off sealift ships lmsrs that were procured for dod in the 1990s the navy seeks authorization from congress for new construction program which can take up to five years for delivery of the first vessel in cases where there are long term consis tent requirements that are best satisfied by the construction of new purposebuilt vessels the navy upon authorization by congress establishes and funds programs such as the lmsrs and the lewis and clark take1 class dry cargo ships to meet these requirements we are also moving ahead with the acquisition of the joint high speed vessel jhsv as replacement for the capability currently fulfilled by the westpac express charter dod opposes provision to limit leases to more than 2 years as it would have severe negative impact on the ability of msc to carry out its mission of providing sealift support for wide variety of dod activities to support rapid deployment of military forces the military services maintain equipment on msc chartered vessels some foreign built converted in us shipyards all usflagged and uscrewed for periods up to five years and budgeted for operational requirements accordingly msc also operate s vessels chartered for periods up to five years for other unique military requirements having to conduct new charter solicitations biennially would greatly reduc the services ability to effectively plan and budget resources and would severely limit regional combatant commanders ability to maintain mission readiness especi ally for our nations prepositioning force and in support of the global war on terror additionally the potential necessity to return the ships to the unite d states for the purposes of transferring the equipment to newly chartered ship as ship charte rs changed would severely impact dod readiness this constant disruption and tr ansition on biennial ba sis would defeat the central purpose of the prepositioning progra m forward deployment of fullyloaded ships in strategic locations worldwide that are ready to meet warfighting needs at moments notice additionally such restriction would adversely impact the us merchant marine industry upon which dod relies to crew surge sealift ships since any foreign built vessel chartered by msc must ve all reflagging work performed in us shipyard and during operation must be crewed with us merchant mariners thus the charter of foreignbuilt vessels by msc has the added benefit of increasing the number of privately owned cargo vessels flying the us flag further any such restriction would be contrary to dods objectives of supporting vigorous and competitive domestic ship repair industry restricting the maximum leasecharter period for foreign built vessels to 24 months would not increase the number of usbuilt militarily useful ships it would increase the cost for msc to charter vessels responses to informal queries to the ownersoperators of msc chartered ships i ndicate that the government would likely have to pay twice as much per day for charters if forced from 59month to 24month charter periods this price differentia l results from the ship owners ability to amortize capital investment costs over long er periods of time for longer leases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22454crs5 6 dod point paper provided to crs on may 25 2006 regarding the impact of leases of foreign built ships on us shipyards and the us merchant marine dod also states in this point paper ships chartered to meet dod missions are required to be usflagged and crewed by us merchant mariners whenever foreig nbuilt ship is used for such charters that ship is required to be converted to us flag and crewed by us citizen mariners prior to the beginning of the charter mo reover any conversion work needed to bring the foreignbuilt ship up to usflag standards must by law be accomplished in us shipyards over the recent past the refla gging of foreignbuilt ships to usflag has resulted in the creation of thousands of jobs for us citizen merchant mariners and millions of dollars of us shipyard work presently 40 percent of privatelyowned usflagged ocean going vessels over 1000 gross tons are foreignbuilt including all of the vessels participating in the maritime security program the proposed legislation would result in exclusion of th and all other foreignbuilt vessels from competition for longerterm charters this severe restriction on full and open competition would substantially raise the cost to meet the dod transportation and prepositioning missionthis restriction would do nothing to courage us ship construction because building new vessels for dod use would involve unacceptable lead times for current requirements and require substantial additiona l funding that is not available dod is pursuing jhsv capability based on lessons learned from leased vessels6 potential questions for congress dods leases of foreignbuilt ships raise several potential ques tions for congress including the following if current ship leasing authorities are retained how many additional foreignbuilt ships might dod in the future decide to lease with renewals for total periods of more than five years if dod leases of foreignbuilt ships were limited to more than two years including all options to rene w or extend the contract in how many cases would dod purchase ship and have it built in us yard rather than lease foreignbuilt ship what would be the resulting impact on workloads revenues and employment levels at various us shipyards and on us merchant mari ne employment would this impact be in the national security interest what is the comparative cost ffectiveness of meeting dod sealift requirements under current ship l easing authorities under the proposed twoyear limit for leases of foreignbuilt ships and through purchase of usbuilt ships how much risk would there be of mismatch between dods sealift requirement s and dod sealift capacity if twoyear limit on dod leases of foreignbuilt ships resulted in decision by dod to purchase usbuilt ships rather than lease foreignbuilt ships what are the potential implications if any of dods leases of foreign built ships for acquisition of other dod capabilities such as capabilities provided by aircrafthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22454crs6 legislative activity for fy2009 fy2009 defense

that must be continued through the near term and into the future however the committee strongly believes th at the american shipbuilders must take advantage of this opportunity therefore the co
