issues summary agriculture requires energy as an im portant input to production agriculture uses energy directly as fuel or electricity to operate machinery and equipment to heat or cool buildings and for lighting on the farm and indirectly in the fertilizers and chemicals produced off the farm in 2002 the us agricultural sector used an estimated 17 quadrillion btu of ener gy from both direct 11 quadr illion btu and indirect 06 quadrillion btu sources howeve r agricultures total use of energy is low relative to other us producing sectors in 2002 agricultures share of total us direct energy consumption was about 1 agricultures shares of nitrogen and pesticide use two of the major indirect agricultural uses identified by the us dept of agriculture usda are sign ficantly higher at about 56 and 67 respectively us farm production whether for crop or animal products has become increasingly mechanized and requires timely energy supplies at particular stages of the production cycle to achieve optimum yiel ds energys share of agricultural production expenses varies widely by activity production prac tice and locality since the late 1970s total agricu ltural use of energy has fallen by about 28 as result of efficiency gains related to imp roved machinery equi pment and production practices despite these efficiency gain s total energy costs of 288 billion in 2003 represented 144 52 dir ect and 93 indirect of annual production expenses of 1989 billion as result unexpected changes in energy prices or availability can substantially alter farm ne t revenues particularly fo r major field crop production high fuel and fertilizer prices in 2004 and increasing energy import dependence for petroleum fuels and nitrog fertilizers has led to c oncerns about the impact this would have on agriculture high natural ga s prices have already contributed to substantial reduction in us nitrogen fertilizer production capacity over 23 decline from 1998 through 2003 in the short r price or supplyrelated disruptions to agricultures energy supplies could resu lt in unanticipated shifts in the production of major crop and livestock products with subsequent effects on farm incomes and rural economies in the long run sustaine d rise in energy prices may have serious consequences on energyintensive industrie s like agriculture by reducing profitability and driving resources away from

issues introduction agriculture as productionoriented s ector requires energy as an important input to production us farm production whether for crop or animal products has become increasingl mechanized and requires timely energy supplies at particular stages of the production cycle to achieve optimum yields several key points that emer ge from this report are agriculture is reliant on the timely availability of energy but has been reducing its overall rate of energy consumption us agriculture consumes energy both directly as fuel or electricity to power farm activities and indirectly in the fertilizers and chemicals produced off farm energys share of agricultural pr oduction expenses varies widely by activity production prac tice and locality at the farm level direct energy costs are significant albeit relatively small component of to tal production expenses in most activities and produc tion processes when combined with indirect ener gy expenses total energy costs can play much larger role in farm net revenues particularly for major field crop production and energy price changes have implications for agricultural choices of crop and activity mix and cultivati on methods as well as irrigation and postharvest strategies this report provides background on the relationship between energy and agriculture in the united states the fi rst section provides background information on current and historical ener gy use in the us agricultural sector and how this fits into the national energyuse picture energys role in agricultures overall cost structure is detailed both for present circumstances and for changes over time finally this section examines how agricu ltures energyuse pattern varies across activities and regionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32677crs2 1 see

level energy use is classified as either direct or indirect direct energy use in agriculture is primarily petr oleumbased fuels to operate cars pickups and trucks as well as machinery for prep aring

irrigation equipment electricity is used largely for lighting heating and cooling in homes and barns dairies also require electricity for operating milking systems cooling milk and supplying hot water for sanitation see table 1 for listing of various direct and indirect energy uses by agriculture in addition ils and lubricants are needed for all types of farm machinery indirect energy is consumed off the farm for manufacturing fertilizers and pesticides because of meas urement difficulties energy used to produce other inputs for agriculture such as farm machinery and equipment is not included in usdas definition of indirect energy2 agriculture as share of us energy use direct energy use in 2002 the us agricultural sector encompassing both crops and livestock production us ed an estimated 11 quadrillion btu3 of total direct energy4 this represents slightly more than 1 of total us energy consumption of 98 quadrillion btu in 2002 see figure 1 in comparison the nonagricultural component of the industrial sector is estimated to have used 314 quadrillion btu 32 while the transportation s ector used 265 quadrillion btu 27 as result of its small share significant changes in direct energy consumption by the us agricultural sector are unlikely to have major implications for the overall supply and demand for energy in the united st ates however within the agricultural sector changes in the supply and demand of energy can have significant implications for the profitability of us agriculture as well as the mix of output and management practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32677crs3 table

although direct use of natural gas by ag riculture is the smallest of any major energy source see figure 2 its importance is magnified by an indirect linkage with fertilizers partic ularly nitrogenous

energy use peaked at 24 quadrillion btu in 19789 the oil price shocks of the late 1970s and early 1980s forced the agricultural sector to become more energy efficient since the late 1970s the direct

composition of energy use has shifted over time gasolines relative share as source of farm energy s declined substantially over the past four decades falling from 41 share in 1965 to about 9 share in 2002 see figure 4 the direct use of natural gas and lp gas also experienced decline in share falling from combined 15 to 8 in contrast diesel fuel and electricity both gained substantially rising from 13 and 6 shares respectively in 1965 to 27 and 21 shares in 2002 the shift away from gasolinepowered machinery toward dieselpowered machinery underlies the rise of diesel and decline of gasoline diesel is better performing than gasoline in terms of miles per gallon and miles per btu diesel fuel also tends to be significantly ch eaper on gasolineequivalent basis11 the overall decline in total direct energy use also reflects an important decline in the stock of agricultural machinery equipment and motor vehicles that has occurred since total farm machinery inventories peaked in 197912 capital depreciation exceeded capital expenditure in every year from 1980 through the mid1990s the capital depletion was due to several factors including first increased machine efficiency and second shifts away from conventi onal tillage practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32677crs7 13 ibid pp 149150figure 4 composition of energy use in us agriculture 1965 to 2002which required working the soil many times prior to planting toward reduced and notill practices which requi re fewer passes over the so il and therefore less fuel consumption in addition conservation tillage practices have help ed to conserve soil moisture and nutrients lowering the need for commercial fertilizers and to prolong the useful life of tractors and equipment since 1965 fertilizer and pestic ide use have exhibited disjointed pattern as share of energy source for us agriculture rising from combined 25 share in 1965 to slightly above 46 share in 1986 then declining to 35 share by 2002 increasing use of precision farming ie computerized equipment that allows precise quantity and placement of inputs such as fertilizers and pestic ides conservation tillage and crop residue management have all contributed to lower fertilizer volumes without sacrificing yield gains13 plantings of genetically engineered crops such as bt corn and bt cotton which require fe wer pesticide applications also have contributed to reduced pe sticide volume in additi on improved pesticide products and expanded use of crop scouting services have contributed to lower pesticide volumes while maintaining or impr oving the level of pest control efficiency gains in farm energy use the large declines in agricultural sector use of direct and i ndirect energy sources since the late 1970s has not come at the expense of lower output agriculture ppears to have made dramatic efficiency gains in energy use the gains are measured by sharply declining energyuse per unit of output indices for both direct and indirect energy categories since 1980 direct energy use deu per unit of output has fallen almost continuously while total agricultural sector output has risen steadily see figure 5 indirect energy use ieu per unit of output has

section entitled fertilizer production costsdirect energy costs demand for refined petrol eum products such as diesel fuel gasoline and lp gas in agricultura l production is determin ed mainly by the number of acres planted and harvested w eather conditions and the prices for the various types of energy because the majority of energy used in the united states and the world is derived from either pe troleumbased sources such as gasoline diesel and lp gas or natural gas their prices tend to move together this limits the success of switching among fuel sources to reduce energy costs during the 1960s and 1970s direct energy costs for inputs such as petroleum products and electricity varied substantially as share of total farm costs ranging from 4 to 8 see figure 7 however since the mid 1990s direct energys share of total farm costs has averaged about 5 electricitys share of production cost s grew from about 07 in the mid1970s to 19 by 1989 and has held fairly steady ever since as technological efficiency gains in electricity use have essentially offset price rises see figure 8 in contrast fuel costs have declined as share of production costs falling from 64 share in 1981 to average 33 since 1994 due in larg part to efficiency improvements in farm machinery as well as adoption of or minimumtillage cultivation practices indirect energy costs indirect energy costs for fertilizers and pesticides have shown considerable variability over the past 40 years ranging between 8 and 12 of total farm production expenses the most notable costshare movement occurred in 1974 when indirect energy co sts experienced sharp upward spike due to jump in fertilizer prices in 1971 usdas economic stab ilization program had frozen us fertilizer pri ces at the producer level14 these price controls were removed on october 25 1973 and re sulted in rapid rise in us fertilizer prices and expenditures since 1996 indirect energys share of total farm costs has trended downward to about 9 share in 200315 agricultural chemical costs pesticides comprise the majority of agricultural chemical expenditures pesticides are commonly broken out into three major types herbicides insecticides and fungicides defoliants used primarily by cotton in the united states are anot her major agricultural chemical grouping pesticides share of farm production expe nses has grown significantly from less than 1 share prior to 1960 to high of nearly 5 in 1998 the cost share increase that occurred through 1980 was attributable both to increased total use and to rising perunit costs while the increase in cost share between 1980 and 1998 was due almost solely to higher perunit prices paid the total pounds of active ingredients of farm chemicals applied to crops rose steadily from early 1960 until about 1980 after which total pounds app lied remained relatively unc hanged however quality improvements in the mix of pesticide ingredients their ability to kill selected target pests and the increasing ability of farmers to better target pesticide applications have continued through the 1990s these and other quality imp rovements have limitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32677crs11 figure 7

million metric tons since 1991 see figure 9 of this total nitrogenbased fertilizers comprise the largest portion with 56 share compared with 24 for potash and 21 for phosphate the demand for fer

from routine application of commercial fer tilizers fer tilizers provide nutrients that enhance both plant growth and crop yield us farms use an average of nearly 12 million metric tons of nitrogen fertilizers each year since 1992 the united states has imported an increasing share of its nitrogen needs see figure 10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32677crs13 16 the fertilizer institute ava ilable at http www tfiorgcanada is the traditional source for most us nitrogen imports accounting for about 40 of total imports since 198916 however since 2000 the united states has increased the share of nitrogen imports from other sources particularly from middle eastern countries such as bahrain egypt kuwait qatar and sa udi arabia but also from bulgaria china russia poland ro mania netherlands norway ukraine trinidad and tobago and venezuela fertilizer prices are linked to natural gas prices us fertilizer production is closely linked to energy availa bility particularly na tural gas natural gas is the key ingredient in the produc tion of anhydrous ammonia anhydrous ammonia is used directly as nitrogen fertilizer and as the basic building block for producing most other forms of nitrogen fer tilizers eg urea ammonium nitrate and nitrogen solutions natural gas also is used as process gas in the manufacture of these other nitrogenous fertiliz ers from anhydrous ammonia as result natural gas accounts for 75 to 90 of costs of producti on for nitrogen fertilizers in addition natural gas is an important input in the production of diammonium or monoammonium phosphates accounting for 15 to 30 of production costs and potash accounting for as much as 15 of the production cost because fertilizer prices are closely linked to natural gas prices through anhydrous ammonia these prices move in tandem as anhydrous ammonia prices follow natural gas prices while the prices of other nitrogen fertilizers in turn follow anhydrous ammonias price see figures 11 and 12 phosphate and potash prices are less closely linked to natural gas than are prices for nitrogen fertilizers see figure 13 higher fertilizer prices encourage tw potential responses 1 lower fertilizer application rates on the

agriculture appears particularly vulnerable to energy price increases through both petroleum and natural gas markets as well as fertilizer markets during the last three decades of the 20th century the

fertilizer indus try supported by the american farm bureau federation afbf argue for chan ges in us laws and regulations that would either encourage increases in the supply of natural gas or that would discourage natural gas mand for power generation31 they suggest that increased access to federal lands that are curren tly offlimits to drilling and greater tax incentives for drilling could bolster domes tic natural gas produc tion alternately they contend that relaxing environmental restrictions on coal plants extending or expediting nuclear and hydro licenses prom oting use of clean coal technology and prohibiting or taxing the use of natural gas as fuel in power generating permits could all reduce domestic mand for natural gas as an energy source for power generation however broad range of environmentalist orga nizations renewable energy advocates and urban pollution c ontrol groups decry these suggestions32 in september 2003 the national petrol eum council npc produced report balancing natural gas policy that examined the policy options to address the problem of high natural gas prices the report recognized the likelihood of continued high natural gas prices for years to co and concluded am ong other options that energy conservation and greater energy efficiency would have the biggest immediate potential to hold down prices33 high fertilizer prices higher natural gas prices have contributed to substantially higher nitrogen fertilizer prices see figures 11 and 12 in april of 1999 the wellhead price of natural gas was 190 per 1000 cubic feet mcf while

price changes mean for farm incomes because individual farmers are pricetakers and lack the capacity to quickly pass on higher costs through the food marketing chain net farm income likely would be reduced in the short term by the equivalent amount of any rise in production expenses assuming composite fuel natural gas gasolin diesel etc and electricity prices are 21 higher fertilizer prices are about 10 higher and pesticide prices are unchanged in accordance with the usda ppi then total energy costs would be about 36 bi llion or 84 higher in 2004 than originally projected37 assuming roughly similar energy usage rates this would represent direct reduction from net cash income however the higher fuel costs would likely ripple through several other production expenditure categories such as marketing costs and custom services further cutting into the agricultural sectors net returns the bottom line is that the agricultural sector will likely feel the pinch of higher energy prices directly in the form of substantially lower net cash inco than originally projected in 2004 if farmers perceive the energy price changes as likely to persist into 2005 then substantial crop and activity mix changes are likely to ensue price responsiveness to energy price changes higher natural gas prices increase farm energy costs directly through higher fuel costs and indirectly through higher fertilizer nd pesticide costs how agricultural producers respond to energy price changes depends on both the time frame under consid eration ie within season versus across seasons and the produ cers expectation of whether the price change is only temporary or will persist into the future if producers perceive an energy price change as temporary lasting only for the current crop season their response may be limited to some smallscale efforts to economize on fuel use perhaps by switching to fuelsaving cultivation met hods such as minimum or notill production38 by applying smaller volumes of fertilizers and pesticides per acre than originally planne d or by switching between fuels such as from natural gas to propane if meaningful price differences exist however in the short run within single growing season once crops have been planted and major inputs such as fertilizers pesticides and fuels have been purchased producers response to energy and fertilizer co st increases may be fairly limited if an energy price change is perceived as permanent producer is more likely to adjust the farms activity mix and pr oduction practices from one season to the next to compensate for the ne w revenuecost structure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32677crs30 39 miranowski 2004figure 20 us farm fuel vs crude oil annual prices 19732003economic studies have attempted to measure yeartoyear producer responsiveness to changes in prices in th aggregate studies ggest that 10 rise in fuel prices is associated with about 6 decline in use39 fertilizer and pesticide use are also negatively related to changes in their prices 10 rise in prices induces 66 decrease in fer tilizer use and 53 decline in pesticide use as with energy use changes in fertilizer and pesticide use may be obtained by switching to less intensive production methods or to crops that use fewer inputs however the ability for producer to implement such changes is greatly diminished once crop is planted and the production strategy has been set in motion instead producers tend to respond to input price changes by alte ring their crop and activity mix from season to season as result unexpected within season price changes can have unavoidable impacts on farm income prices of most fuel sources tend to move together demand for refined petroleum products in agricultural production is determin ed mainly by the number of acres planted and harvested th production practice used to produce the crops weather conditions and the relative pr ices for the various types of energy because the majority of energy
