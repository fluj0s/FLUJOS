withholds lecture given on 6 february 1962 thank you well what did you think of the tv huh audience great good think that will work out audience yes did any of you shudder at the thought of your overts suddenly showing turning up on that circuit huh you did slightly huh yeah i think it will work out just fine providing we can find totally indestructible pc yeah okay and this is the what of what audience 6th of feb well make up your minds its the 6th the 13th audience 6th it is the 6th you guarantee this all right 6 february ad 12 saint hill special briefing course now i have some very interesting material here today completely aside from everything else thats happened to yousome very interesting material i finally equated why the missed withhold and the withhold is so interesting so this is lecture about withholds whats withhold how come and it equates right back to 1938 now you should realize that any truth that has any distance or is going to get anything done with cases and so forth actually equates against the dynamic principle of existence book one the dynamic prineiple of existence is survive if you look over scientology and dianetics youll find that that was the one breakthrough and although it was rather elementary and simple breakthrough it nevertheless is the basic pin of structure and i have found out over the years it didnt matter when that when principle finally went back to survive and all of sudden it was an amplification of survive why it suddenly worked like mad on pcs and was the cause of great deal of this and that with pcs and all of this became very interesting to when i put up my long ears and heard the back echo of this withholds equate to survive now this at the same time this is one of those points where great deal of theory falls together and at the same moment we have thiswe have this we have the reason why 3d criss cross works because we have the reason why an identity is aberrative it could be said that an identity is that accumulation of withholds which make an individuation amazing isnt it an identity is that accumulation of withholds which cause an individuation and therefore when youre auditing 3d criss cross youre doing class ii skill in gross lots you see you pick up an identity you isolate an identity on which other identities are appended and pinned and you have at once gotten rid of 8672945 to the 21st power withholds all in one fell list now you right where you sit right here at this moment have an identity so of course youve got one part of 3d criss cross already done when we look at the pc and we say whats your name and the pc says my name him joe youve got one 3d criss cross item joe shocking isnt it theres 3d criss cross item joe hundred thousand years from now somebody will be auditing him isnt that an entertaining thought you know theyd have to run you out of you well how come youre joe rather hightoned space opera societies and so forth you dont even read the numbers on their chests you see these doll bodies are turned out in gross lots you know like hightoned department store turns out bunch of identical dolls for the kids you know but these things are turned out just pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa they all look alike all of them are alike there isnt one shade of difference from one body to the next not hair and yet people in space opera recognize each other rather easily isnt that interesting how do they manage that well it must be they recognize person from his beingness not his identity so where you have to recognize person from his identity there cant be much beingness present see so thats what makes 3d item 3d item is maximal identity minimal beingness and every once in while you get identity crossed with beingness and you have an historic character but remember it isnt his identity that makes him an historic character its his beingness so an identity is always bringing up the rear its always minor affair an identity does not amount to hill of beans i myself have erred in this direction time and time and time and time again i used to have standard operating procedure over in europe what you do is accumulate yourself godawful identity see youd accumulate yourself an identity of this particular type of being able to go down to the lists and knock everybodys head off you see or you knowand you get yourself the current championship ladies stocking for europe you know they wore ladies stockings then they wear diamond belts today i mean about the same difference and just go down and every time there was any kind of aof tilt or anything like that you see accumulate yourself little more identity youd finally get it up to point where all you had to do was ride up outside of castle something like this you see if you were for the crown or something and youd say well im so and so open up the gates and whoever the robber baron was that was resisting all law and order you see he would say rooow and all of his young squires would say gee john l sullivans down there you know same atmosphere you know they wouldnt do thing for him theyd go down and open up the gates thats an identity wild bill hickok wyatt earp the television play this up to the nines you get the idea identity ive used it on other parts of track walk into the senate they say now shut up thats so andso talking see and immediately you had silence see other people talked and everybody else was talking at the same time bang you see identity did it thats the mistake thats mistake thats mistake youve made and thats mistake ive made on and on and on they didnt shut up because of the identity ever they shut up because of the beingness you could reach further and influence more than other people around so you did and thats as simple as that but the identity side of it was to be more of lump of than anybody else which totally defeats the reach so if you eonceive of beingness as the ability to permeate pervade communicate to fill up an area and identity as method of not having tosee it puts it on automatic doesnt it they say well he fills up an area because his name is bill or sir tristram or something so then as bill or sir tristram you dont have to go to any trouble youre just lazy on the whole subject you see because the eagle that youre known by painted on your chest or the typical cut of your toga or something like that is not going to fill up any area thats not going to fill up any area only you can fill up the area so what youve done is get substitute for communication substitute for reach so that you could qualify an identity as substitute for reachingness and beingness as reachingness so these two things are one against the other you see an identity is reach on automatic and beingness is reaching you know and by thisby beingness i mean our scientological aspect of beingness that is to say you know the fellow really does it he is doing it you get the idea its because he is somebody that you do something its because he is doing it thats entirely different now thats current activity beingness would be current activity and identity would be past activity this fellow climbed the matterhorn therefore he is famous his whole value is climbing the matterhorn when he is climbing the matterhorn that is his beingness you got it but identity is the fellow who climbed the matterhorn now in view of the fact that the only thing that this universe punishes is being there and communicatingthe only things this universe punishes is being there and communicating universe is incapable of punishment in the absence of those two factors if person isnt there he cant be punished and if person doesnt communicate he cant be punished you see so the universe is an antibeingness universe and proidentity universe this universe favors identity so it can punish all right now lets equate withhold what is withhold withhold is notreachingness its many other things dont make that into technical thing because theres more here thats not all of it whats withhold elementary my dear watson withhold reversely would be holding onto piece of information which would damage survival preservation of identity the self preservation of an identity now you have to remember that thetan cant be hurt thetan can only get connected with something that connects with something that connects with something and then he gets himself onto the circuit so here is the thought involved in this that person withholds to preserve himself you do not tell the police that you really did park three hours in the parking zone you see you say i just arrived now why do you withhold that information that is the police could lessen your survival if they found it out correct all right the police could lessen your survival if they found it out now therefore the withholds which you have are things which you feel rightly or wrongly that if you let them be known they would reduce your survival that is they would decrease your reputation or identity people would think less of youthis is all part of the same thing you seepeople would think less of you if they knew and so on so that withholds go into that category weve made the step now above the idea of withhold being totally matter of mores now weve gone little bit further and we have little bit better rationale and that rationale is that withhold is something person believes had better be withheld because if he didnt withhold it it would reduce his survival as of course an identity if you were building an identity on reputenothing wrong with this its standard trick of the universe your credit is good people think well of you you see all of those various things which go into repute its standard trick of the universe i mean you cant even live in this universe without this trickin body and if youreif you are working to enhance your repute to be good citizen member of the community person on whom people can depend person who has good job references you got theall of the rest of this sort of thing you got your nose clean with the government so itll pay your oldage pension you know that kind of thing all of these things youve never been known to vote for law and order you always wanted what the government wanted andbut what are you doing there youre building up survival identity all these things build up survival identity nothing wrong with this of course all right so you withhold those things which would depress this survival identity so you withhold such things as you always upheld the government except that time you refused to go to the polls and vote refused to pay your taxes refused to uphold the governments desire to savage somebody you see all these things that you didnt do you dont let the government in on see you tend to tuck those in against your bosom because this would hurt your reputation with the government you see in other words it would injure your selpreservation so therefore you withhold them if these things were known you wouldnt be worth two whoops in hell you think well now thetan goes on the cautious side of this so he always withholds more than he has to and naturally all withholds then are built uniformly on the basis of selfpreservation the source and cause of any withhold is selfpreservation thats it i mean thats your technical fact withholds selfpreservation selpreservation withhold well lets put it as graphically as this youve got body and youre facing buzz saw and you withhold your body from the buzz saw and you dont lose body see but if you didnt withhold your body from the buzz saw it goes bzzz and you havent got body you got that its that elementary well its built on the mechanical force factors of this universe trying to preserve form trying to preserve the form of body trying to preserve these things about body you see and therefore you withhold and protect take care of be responsible for all the other things stem out from that that were so accustomed to using in processing all these other things parade out from this fact selpreservation now selpreservation of course is misnomer thetan doesnt have to preserve himself it would be silly for thetan to even try to preserve himself thetan is only involved in preserving an identity so self preservation is misnomer in that it shouldnt be selpreservation it should be theidentity preservation preservation of an identity so now lets cross straight into 3d criss cross and say with one fell swoop then any identity which remains in suspension in the bank is the direct product of identity preservation see thats sayingwell it proves itself its there isnt it you can find this identity in the individual you find this 3d criss cross item in the individual so therefore the basic denominator in that item must have been it was preserving itself if it was preserving itself its there if it wasnt preserving itself it isnt there in other words the basic effort then of any identity is to preserve itself hence we find these suspended 3d criss cross items starting with the persons own identity right now joe bill pete mary agnes it doesnt matter what it is this person is busy preserving joe bill pete mary agnes you see right now to give you reality on this have you done anything in the last week answer this questionhave you done anything in the last week whatsoever to prolong your life audience yes you have all right now what do you suppose is going to happen to the mental energy mass which is this life when you contact it it will be prolonged of course now think of this last week as section of time which somebody contacts thousand years from now well look it over now thousand years from now they contact this little minute section of track of course it doesnt amount to hill of beans you see it isnt aberrative in any way but actually those things that would be stucknow lets be very technicalwould only be those points where you failed to preserve your life that would really be stuck because its the failed postulate see but the postulate impulse of course was to preserve your life whether it won or lost you see how that would be therefore death hangs up more than life you see heres persons full integrity his full power as being his full power as thetan regardless of what this power could go into its almost unthinkable right now to you that power could go into anything but selfpreservation if youre looking at it and i got this all restimulated with you you see well what would thetan concentrate on if the thetan wasnt concentrating on the preservation of self or one of the dynamics what would he be concentrating on you see of course hed be concentrating on one of these things you can say to yourself but at the same time only those points would hang up where the individual has postulated it and has failed and those are always the hangup the failed postulate mechanism is of course senior to all of these mechanisms that im talking to you about at the moment it is much worseyoud probably get repercussion whatsoever for knocking gorgons head off because you see that whole cycle of action came out you intended to preserve yourself and not to preserve the gorgon and your intention of course was carried out in that you did preserve yourself and didnt preserve the gorgon see so therefore we try to find something wrong on the track when we collide with the knockout of gorgon find an incident knocking the gorgons head off and so on it doesnt hang up at all see the expectancy is carried along the time track one expects to knock the gorgons head off he does knock the gorgons head off and thats all there is to it all right now lets just get little bit more complicated about this and one attempts to knock the gorgons head off and misses and the gorgon goes chomp and that is that now that was not in the cards that was an alteris of the persons own postulate and being an alteris of the postulate it tends to then make its own time track and so hang up in time failing to knock the gorgons head off is the only unlessnow lets go over and look at this other little mechanismunless it was to knock off gorgons heads supposing it was the kings private gorgon and huntsmen are riding north and south and east and west gamekeepers and so forth wanting to know who knocked the block off of the kings gorgon because theyre gonna ang im they have special piece of emp preserved for is ead and the person who knocked the gorgons head off makes the immediate survival computation the immediate survival computation is of course to withhold i will not tell him i knocked off the gorgons head because they will hang they will hang this identity was much more accurate statement so i better not tell them because they will hang this identity see so thats that it doesnt hang up right now doesnt hang up one identity but it sure hangs it up on the time track now youre galumphing down the time track as an auditor looking around for pieces to snufflacate and all of sudden you get this odd picture of the head of gorgon see individual goes up and down the time track and every time he comes around this section of anything heres this gorgons head all right there was nothing aberrative about knocking off the gorgons head see the gorgon was going to eat you up or you were going to eat the gorgon up and you wound up your strong right arm and you whopped the gorgon and it knocked his head off and thats what you intended to do and thats what happened and so forth you see theres notheres hangup there i mean that will just slide right on through on the time track because its the postulate and so forth one has to have considerations about the evil of knocking off gorgonseads now instead of running the incident if you just did this the whole thing springs free what was wrong with knocking gorgons eads off or we just find this head floating in space we ask some nebulous question such as well what would you withhold about that picture thats all wed have to say and all of sudden the whole incident would just unreel rrrrrrrr youd have the kings huntsmen riding up and down the land saying heres this specially treated piece of emp in which were going to insert somebodys ead and you have the individual and this and that and youd get this whole identity hung up because hes had to hide the fact the new identity the man who knocked off the gorgons ead only this is now submerged identity and he cant advertise the thing you see hed love to go out and tell all of his pals well you fellows think you can strike nifty blow some moments i have doubt in the middle of battle and so forth you have been able to assume certain strengths im sure youve knocked off some soldier or manatarms helmet im sure but myself i was out in the woods the other day i met gorgon and pfftssa just like that you try it see hed like to brag about it because it could be survival point all of his friends he feels thereafter would say the man who it off the gorgons ead see see all kinds of value every time you go into the pub somebody buys you drink because youre the man that it off the gorgons ead see sooner or later they call the pub the gorgons ead you know in other words youve got all sorts of survival computations kicking around here on the whole subject of having done this fantastic deed you see you cant tell about them you must tell about them you see you really shouldnt withhold it because its survival characteristic you should compulsively outflow it to one and all you should go down and beat your chest at the crossroads and tell the passersby you see at the same time you mustnt tell anybody because if you did the kings huntsmen would have something to put in that noose they have been preparing you know so what do you do well the thing to do is not solve it at all just hang it up on the time track and let some auditor find it if anybody ever finds out about auditing thats about the way it adds up dont you see its an inadmissible fact now you get the withholds off of this and then you get the compulsive outflows off of this you couldyou could almostthis isnt absolutely factual but you can almost free up the track by asking person what should you have told people about see at first they equate it on the basis of what they shouldnt have withheld and then they get into these brags they get into big brag sector you know well i was on thisin this war couple of hundred thousand years ago and there were fifteen enemy fighters and they were coming down out of the clouds and i was all by myself and i was flying this little triplane you see and it was up on this other planet and as matter of fact they were flying more or less the same kind of plane i was and i had machine gun there and through superb acrobatics and through the ability to shoot the like of which nobody has heard of before or since i shot down all fifteen and after that they called the plane killer and i was an ace and as matter of fact i was the only ace that emerged from that particular war all the rest were killed you see brag you know big deal but he just withheld it so hard afterwards because you see he wasnt supposed to be carrying mark 15 type machine gun that was something he got out of the commanding officers hut just before he left the field and it was firing atomic type ammunition which wasnt supposed to be used in that war they had united spittoon organization on that planet which said that everybody but us must not use anything that is effective you see and we who are upholding civilization are going to destroy it as fast as we can and they had forbidden this particular type of ammunition so he was using this type of ammunition and he stole the gun and also he never neglected to tell anybody about this but the airplane he was using also was the commanding officers and the commanding officer was on leave at the time you see and he didnt have any plane at the moment his had been crashed so if he admitted to having taken the plane up and the mechanics of the field admitted to him taking the plane up he would have been courtmartialed you see so this big mystery stands in the middle of this two hundred thousand year war is how come all of sudden fifteen enemy planes disappeared they disappeared with slightest explanation there wasnt even anybody flying in that sector at that time all official records show this so theres big withholds on this subject while there should be big brags on this subject and you get wonderful hangup and you see theres youryour facts of survival are equally matched its almost worth the same amount to brag about it as it is to withhold it you survive you see if you brag about it your survival is enhanced they make you colonel and put you in charge of all of the flying girls you see and if you withhold it why you can go on holding your present rank of sub captain to the subgroups you see and drawing your pay and your old age pension you see so thats good survival but of course if you did tell them about it they would courtmartial you you see and you wouldnt any longer be subcaptain even far from being able to brag about it you see and you get the most preposterous hangups so that you could say that any difficult situation is an unequated or unresolved problem in survival so any hangup on the track is an unresolved problem in survival person couldnt figure it out there were balanced factors involved if he admitted it he didnt survive but it would be good thing to admit it because then you really would survive but if he didnt admit it then he would survive but it was bad thing not to admit it because then of course this made liar out of him you see so it stands right in the middle of that little crossroads and youll find each hungup part of an identity are these things and when you get one of these black bundles called 3d criss cross itemwhich is some old former identityit is all hung together and totally interwoven with just these computations it should talk it better not and if it talks its nonsurvival if it doesnt talk its nonsurvival if it does talk its nonsurvival you see and if it does withhold its nonsurvival and in fact all things are nonsurvival at this particular point there is answer to how to survive there is answer to thethis problem and these are the things which you find hung up naturally by pulling withholds off of the case you release all of these things now an individual withholds an identity and withholds and withholds and withholds an identity until it parks on the track and when you find 3d criss cross identity you of course have got this tremendous key to tremendous section of track when you find one of these real items that proves out you see youve got an identity there that should have been known that mustnt have been known and the fact that you found it of course takes great deal of charge off the case because the identity itself is dedicated to hiding the identity has now gone into hiding and that you find it of course brings it out of that category so actually disclosure of an identity destroys withhold and you will see pcyou will see pc every once in while you will be tracking down the line and all of sudden the pc says ohoh oh oh oh oh hmhmm you say whats the matter well mmmmmm nothing are you withholding anything well i was going to mention something well what were you going to mention well i didnt want to really tell you you can go round and round on one of these things and the pc will get some kind of computation that will say well theyre probably looking for yet that is almost the cliche that goes along with each one of these situations they are probably looking for yet if they were to find then oh man what would happen now this pc has got this identity that he was trying to make famous you see and trying to make it survive and trying to make it all polished up and good citizen and then it didnt see so your intention was to become good survival name that would go on and on and total failure of that of course puts person on total withhold of something thats supposed to be totally surviving so he should have been exhibiting it he didnt dare exhibit it and so it gets hung up and you come on the edges of this thing and this pc starts to get very alert the pc says oooooooooh they are probably still looking for someplace he gets the idea of his name being on sheriffs boards and headquarters bulletin boards you knowwanted for mopery and dopery on the high seas you see shoot on sight if ever found dont bother to return except mangled you know this type of thing george aloisious preclear wanted for the mopery of the dopery at the lefthand sector of the right front cross of the secondhand universe and he will hell all of sudden oooooooohooooooooh i dont know if i i dont know if i ought to tell you or not you know oh my god this thing hes telling you see is three trillion years ago and it was on some little old secondrate planet that didnt have anything to do with anything and he was selling grain to troopers horses or something you know it just works out its just nothing its horrible sensation you know of i better not talk because theyre still after and of course this still after is this thing of guilt that everybody was trying to get into in the field of therapy of course you couldnt get into it from the viewpoint of guilt it does give the aspect of guilt the person looks guilty and they are i mean why not accept it but entering it on the basis of what have youwhat are you guilty of thank you what are you guilty of thank you what are you guilty of thank you now just lie back on the couch take some more sodium pentothal very very nice now breathe deeply now youre all amongst friends here put these electric shock electrodes on you now what are you guilty of now arearent you guilty of something and so forth all right you feel like youre guilty of something you think youve killed your father well were here to tell you conclusively you didnt kill your father so therefore you are not guilty thank you very much bzzzzzt this is psychotherapy you see and it isnt psychotherapy at all because this feeling of guilt is as much brag as otherwise so thats always throwing the psychiatrists for loop he wants to know why this patient is going around bragging you see about being napoleon or something while withholding the subject that he is napoleon hes bragging about being napoleon its the persons idea that hes still being looked for he is still wanted someplace or another with exclamation points that he is very guilty of something and this guilt feeling is simply that he should have talked he didnt talk and either way he wouldnt have survived there was resolution to the problem of survival on any dynamic and when youve got one of those on case itll come right straight forward to present time and itll really knock somebodys head off he really gets in mess on this one ah god well i was supposed to have the regiment charge you see there we were at balaklava and somebody issued the orders and if you disobeyed the orders you see you would have gotten courtmartialed but if you charged you would lose everything so what were you supposed to do well whatever he did was wrong you see he couldnt survive matter what he did so any way he solved the problem equaled nonsurvival and youll get one of these computations coming up and the pc has an awful time now when these things come off the whole identities come off and withholds come off of identities and when youre pulling the identity you see you will get withhold at the same time the withhold there the person oooooohi mean when you have that type of thing coming up now pulling any identity you should realizeoff of case you should realize theres probably withhold connected with it otherwise it wouldnt be hung well let show you it is surviving isnt it there is an identity in the bank and it is floating forward to present time right all right now if that identity is floating forward to present time it must have withhold connected with it see it inevitably has to have withhold connected with it if it is in the bank and here now and therefore this is true of all phenomena to be found in the reactive bank each phenomena has withhold connected with it thats unisorm these phenomena were prompted by efforts to survive and of course efforts to survive are very very silly and lie themselves because thetan cant do anything else how people work to survive you see they work like mad to survive well actually theyre not working to survive at all theyre working to get an identity to survive of course they try to get this identity to survive theyre sweating away at it trying to get this identity to survive and they cant do anything else but survive now of course if theres any effort involved in this thing it must be built around lie which the person doesnt recognize or realize and thats the first thing he doesnt recognize or realize that his beingness is one thing and his identity is quite something else that he is one thing and that this identity or body or designationno matter if its number 6077859thats still an identity but this is something else it is not himself you see so he has himself associated with the identity you see and then hes got thealso he does another cross he gets the beingness crossed with the identity he says my beingness is totally over the basis of being joe doakes thats my beingness that isnt his beingness his communicatingness is not dependent upon being joe doakes as matter of fact it is quite deteriorated because he is being joe doakes now therefore all things have withhold connected with them now whenever you miss withhold person is volunteering to tell you something or person is ready to tell you something or person could tell you something and doesnt person gets restimulation of withhold the withhold restimulates and the individual then gets the idea that he is in danger there isnt any more rationale to it than that now if you look any ffirther than that rationale youll have difficulty understanding it it is qanda stimulusresponse mechanism if the person has withhold that he must then withhold he of course is in danger do you follow that through you see you can always enter one of these dangerous situations from two sides person must be in danger because there is piece of hemp hanging over tree now that is restimulation has nothing whatsoever to do with anybody hanging him but he knows piece of hemp hanging over tree is for hanging so therefore he can do thishe can actually think he has done something to be hanged for you see any timebecause the reactive mind is aaa the conclusion can then put into action the causation id ask you to grab this all in one minute this is quite interesting we put george in wrecked car you see the car has been wrecked theres blood all over the placesomebody elses from some other place this car is pitched off of curve and is lying in ditch and we take george and we put him in the wrecked car now lets go little bit further supposing george were dead drunk and just getting sober and were sound asleep and couldnt be disturbed and we simply picked george up and we took him down this bank and we put him behind the wheel of this wrecked car and scattered some dust over him and let him wake up his immediate conclusion is that hes been in wreck isnt that right well it isntyou could defy this all sorts of ways you see it wasnt his car he wasnt out driving all of these things dont have to be present at all hes simply sitting in the car and he can actually sit there and be totally convinced that he has been in wreck he can even exhibit psychosomatic injuries to prove that hes been in this wreck hed argue with you about being in the wreck if he woke up in this car and hed explain to you how he had driven from home in this car hed even explain to you how he had borrowed the car he would defend anything to try to make it agree with reality this is an interesting fact the least he would get out of it would simply be little shock about should he tell anybody what is this are there any consequences to having wrecked this car you see this he neednt have been in the car wreck at all for him to think some of these thoughts to greater degree or lesser degree you get an impression of having been in car wreck in extremis he would argue with you hed tell you where he borrowed the car he would give you the places where he was injured he would show psychosomatic bruises you see thats in extremis and the lightest thing is hed feel just little bit guilty about having gotten himself into that position although he had responsibility for it of any kind whatsoever he had been drunk he had been sobering up you picked him up out of his bunk or off of sofa someplace and took him down and put him in the car and hed blame himself for having gotten there and hed go back under long chain of circumstances trying to figure out how he was to blame for being in that car you find it so that you give person any result of chain of responsibilities you give him the end product of any responsibilities and he will attempt to assume some of the earlier responsibility i could give you its very nebulous thing illlet see if i cant think up one for your particular case right at the moment oh i know i know youve got picture of an army so you assume you must have been in that army see youve got picture of an army so you assume you must have been in the army got that you hardly even question it sometimes and then youre very startled several sessions later to find out that you were provision merchant and never had anything to do with the army see but you did have picture of the army you get the idea thats jumping to conclusion all right let give you another example your rib aches so you must have psychosomatic picture of some kind you got an aching rib so you assume you must have psychosomatic picture and then some of you girls sometime get home and find out that if you just loosen up the bra or something of the sort that it was totally twisted and had been so all day did you ever have this happen to you you find out there was some actual fact of why you had pain there and you had been going around tryingas scientologist trying to explain this pain away got the idea you couldnt have had any pain because it was only button and totally twisted hook or something of the sort digging into your live flesh you see so you figure there must have been psychosomatic incident connected with it you see you know that this is natural and that it should be this way and you normallyto get such pain without causeyou see naturally it would take something like psychosomatic incident so you get the rare one where you had the actual pain which is right here and right now and you say it must have been psychosomatic you get the idea in other words because youve got b you conclude with evidence you see so youll get spook factors on bankin bank of this particular character and because certain conditions are true then the pc assumes that other conditions must have been true adding up to these conditions you see and boy can some pcs write script on this subject and youll find them tearing off in some direction writing script all over the place and during the session their bra was turned you see in such way that hook was inserted deeply in the flesh you know and theyve been trying to figure out the whole session on who they must have stabbed in the back now the reason person does this is consequences justthats all and you can have the consequence occur and then have the person figure out what the act must have been as well as do the act and then figure out what the consequence must have been you see it works both ways now individuals do this first one we understand this and everybody knows about this first one is you go to the store and you get dozen eggs and on the road home why you break every single egg well you know darn well when you get home itsaugh somebody is going to be upset with you see thats easy you see so somebody is upset with you and you get to wondering about the eggs being broken see and you werent to the store and this is very puzzling you see it can work both ways so pcs get put into mysteries because of consequences the accomplished consequence and some of the hangups on cases is the reverse of the withhold and that is to say the pc doesnt know what led to the consequence so he figures he must have withhold from himself now everybody has betrayed everybody see hes betrayed himself hes withholding from himself and all of that so he doesnt know now where he is supposed to wind up and he gets into tremendous puzzle and you get withholds on the first dynamic as well as the remaining seven one of the most interesting things you can do is sometimes go over with pc and findif you could do this very directly itd be very nicebut you can actually find the material that he must be withholding from himself but isnt you see that his anxiety about identity would cover the whole picture if you ask something when have you contributed to well lets say we findwe find this terminal an angry man lets say weve sorted this out with 3d criss cross and we get an angry man now this will be whole bunch of angry menjoe pete bill and colonel stewpot and everybody else that hes run into and so on its covered whole series of identities that more or less came along in one chain and you could say what responsibility have you taken for the continued survival of an angry man and you would see the package angry man just start falling apart into identities and into all sorts of bits and pieces and separate identities and so on all right welets say this individual is in great deal of trouble with the gendarmes and so on now lets go further than that if the individual can have any trouble with the gendarmerie he must at one time or another have been identified with the gendarmerie some gendarmerie someplace he must have been identified with it you cannot have motivator without having caused something now thats the other point but the cause which you normally haveif you have been responsible for something and then ceased to be responsible for something you can get your block knocked off thats about the only way you can get your block knocked off you take great responsibility for the welfare of the british isles and then kick the bucket as prime minister or something of the sort and come back your next life not caring as street cleaner and you wonder why youre always being arrested it is perpetually you cannot park your dustbin on any corner of any street without getting ticket without being told to move on without being threatened with this and that if any bank robbers ever wished to get rid of the evidence of having robbed bank theyd drop it in your dustbin you see and then you get arrested and this is just fate at work thats all and guys like this in this shape can sit around forever and say well just fate is against thats all i mean its just fate is against you see youve taken wide zone of responsibility and then ceased to be responsible for it by postulates you see so youve taken wide identity and then have killed the identity by postulate you got tired of being prime minister or something you see you get tired of it so you say all right next life im not going to be the prime minister i dont want anything to do with it well this is the decline of coursethe declining days of being the prime minister is when this occurred not between lives all during the last five years of being the prime minister guy would rather have been shot than be the prime minister you see it was all fine for the first ten years but then the socialists got to work you see well we start tracing this back and we find out that the socialists could get on his nerves because he had been socialist being prime minister could get on his nerves because he had been revolutionary at an earlier time you see and now having been prime minister and taken responsibility for the british isles hes street cleaner and takes responsibility for anything except one street of the british isles that leaves the entirety of the british isles permeated but responsibility for them matter what his identity is because it is only beingness after all people can try to shift their identities try to change everything but it is only their beingness that counts now if hes got beingness hung up in his background which is associated with his identity and then he suddenly cuts his beingness down to nothing in order to limit his identity hell be in trouble every time every other street in the british isles can be the enemy of this street sweeper he getshe gets mott street beautifully cleaned up i mean its just slick as whistle and then the bordering streets and the crossroads and everyplace anything intersects mott street blows dust and dirt into mott street and hes got it all to do again thats the way it looks to him he cannot function on this limited sphere because he has already accepted much larger sphere so hes always in trouble so we could ask him this auditing question hes always always in trouble with the british isles let us saythe government of the british isles or anything and if we by any means were able to isolate what he was really against we could say to him what responsibility have you taken for the survival of whatever the sector was well call it the british isles and hell go zooooooom wog thud and it gets very incredible to him this tremendous zone of responsibility hes all of sudden staring at because you see having been responsible for something he leaves an area in his reactive bank which iswhich now has an identity and it can kick his head in i like these guystheyrethetans are always doing thishaving taken responsibility for the whole of europe and having battered the whole of europe to pieces in order to liberate it all nations who took part in that activity you see now all draw back and say were going to have peace and let the whole of europe go to hell they did that in 1914 1918 they just skipped it after 1918 they told the british they pardon the germans were told by the british and the americans you see theyd all be patched up and the weimar republic was finally put together and nobody would take any responsibility for the weimar republic and there wasevery measure that was proposed in order to maintain peace in europe was responsibility for any of the allies but remember that the allies had taken full responsibility for peace of europe and then one fine day we hear mutter of guns and we have world war ii which is just about twice three times as violent as world war i and did occupy much more area now these powers having done this and having they did learn lesson at versailles and they got up to point now where theyre totally supporting all of europe see theyre into europe theyre afraid to pull out see they say immediately therell be world war iii if we pull out of europe havent you heard this we get kennedy standing up and saying well britain must join the common market were not going to join but britain can join the common market you see because we must have somebody take responsibility for europe and then pretty soon you will hear him getting anxious about it and say well the united states must take responsibility for the common market and weve got to go into the common market too because weve got to take responsibility for europe he knows better theyre now dreading you see cessation of responsibility for europe they learned that in world war i world war ii came along proved it so they dont take any responsibility for japan and i think the either the prime minister or the war ministeri think hes the prime minister of japani think is the same officer that attacked the us fleet at pearl harbor which i consider rather interesting and the president didnt dare visit japan because it was too turbulent few years ago and japan all of sudden is on full autonomy so we must obsessively continue to take responsibility for europe you see but we mustnt take any for japan wheres the trouble going to come from all of sudden the united states fleet gets up some morning at pearl harbor you see how it would be in other words having taken responsibility and then taking responsibility we get consequence and actually thats what consequence is were withholding responsibility for that we should take and that of course is withhold of magnitude because its withhold of ability so withhold can be withhold of anything that we have had permeation into or communication with so when communication is followed by nocommunication the advent of the nocommunication operating as withhold of course reduces survival and an effort to carry forward survival is knocked in the head so it comes down to survival weve made huge area survive now were only going to make little part of it survive do you follow that were going to make all of europe survive and all of japan and asia everything is going to survive except were going to ignore china mongolia look at the fight they had in korea because they wouldnt really take responsibility for the japanese empire see theres war after war developing over in this quarter cause nobodys really taking any responsibility for it thats pretty gruesome but not in europe they wont let down that responsibility area in europe so thatll go on but theres going to be some contrasurvival in other words if you had large responsibility zone and then you suddenly take small zone of responsibility in that large zone you tend to set up the area youve had full responsibility for as an opponent to what you are now taking responsibility for thats your mechanics of individuation and the mechanics of individuation are first communication into and then refuse to communicate into now because its communicate into you already have commonness with it or oneness with it you have established oneness with it by responsibility or communication into it you follow that point do you see that well all right ill give you an idea you live in big house you live in big house and you take responsibility for every room in this house and the basement and the attic and everything and youre taking responsibility for the whole house very nicely and then you decide to live only in one small room do you know the noise from the remaining rooms as they pound against the wall of your one small room is going to be absolutely deafening and do you know eventually your little room will completely fall to pieces because nobody took care of the major house you see and as its walls fell down so did your walls fall down do you see that in other words you cannot segmentalize responsibility into smaller plane or smaller zone without consequence of some kind or another you cant take responsibility for the physical universe and then take responsibility for one room in boarding house in two successive lives and not have planets hit you in the head itd be the most mysterious thing youll be going down the street and meteorites always seem to land exactly where you are you see and theres hardly ever any air where you are and all sorts of wild things happen to where you are all kinds of randomity is occurring weatherweather seems to be totally random all over the world it is totally dry except right where youre standing itll be raining see heres your huge sector suddenly cut down now if its cut down by sequence of withholds which it always is you of course have energized what youre not now taking responsibility for and because that is now energized it can kick your head off because its right on your wavelength man you did it see see you energized this whole house and now you say well the whole house now energized and im only going to energize this little tiny room in this house man the rest of the house is alive where youre concerned see you could have walked into brand new house that youd never been in before and moved into one small room and you would have been all right but thetans never do it that way they usually get much broader and bolder they usually walk in occupy the whole country then occupy county then occupy town then occupy big house then occupy first floor room and then occupy basement room see and then eventually haunt the graveyard as ghost and wonder why if it is raining anyplace in the whole country it is raining where they are you see you know it sort of looks to them like everything is agin em thats sort of the way it appears and its absolutely true it is see youve always been writing script on the basis of well theyre really not after they are but only those guys who could cut your throat effectively the only fellows the fellows that could do it bestlet put it this wayis your own palace guard when you have stated thereafter that you will longer occupy the palace you see you were king for number of years everybody was happy with you you were happy with them you were executing people and they were bringing people for you to execute and everything was just going along swimmingly and splendidly and one fine day you said well boys im going to retire and at that moment six spears sort of magically appeared in your chest yeah im not going to do this anymore its almost as though you pull everything in on you the second that you take that zone out so therefore survival process discharges all withhold processes so therefore the principle of survival is senior to all overtmotivator sequences in other words the superior process is responsibility as we already know and survival type processespersistency processes identity processes see these are all types of processes now you can take apart fellow by the name of joe who is sitting in the pcs chair in front of you you can take this person apart you can make this person much more functional as joe but you keep wondering whats kicking his head in why hes getting somatics why threequarters of his stomach is missing all the time you know hes got this hollow feeling where his ears should be you keep wondering where these are coming from well thats whenthats when he was agnes and he as joe will now take responsibility for women women is something he doesnt want to have anything to do with at all thank you you see how that would be in his last life his name was agnes he was woman and he was very strong powerful woman that hated men because in his life before that he had been man you see that hated women of course any time you start to charge up or energize the bank or have him look at it in any way he confronts nothing but opponents but the most horrible opponent man can have or being can have of course is himself because its got his wavelength hasnt got his number its got his wavelength so you say with truth man is his own worst enemy and scientology is that study whereby were making man his own best friend thats true wouldnt you like to be friend of yours now do you see what withholds are do you see what withholds are all about withhold is an effort to survive if you find yourself withholding you must be trying to survive is the conclusion that you could reach at that moment you see youve done it so often this way its such grooved pattern that you must be trying to survive so therefore you must be in danger now we have pc 16ing and tearing the roof off in strips the pc has found himself or herself withholding what are the immediate conclusions that run off automatically from that first conclusion what are conclusions two and three that they must be in danger see they found themselves withholding so 1 they found themselves withholding 2 they must be in danger and 3 therefore that they must survive thats sort of the actions that they take so you miss withhold on the pc he gets two and three automatically bang bang it doesnt matter which we call two and which we call three but those are the conclusions he comes to oh i am sitting here withholding something and the auditor hasnt pulled the withhold the instant reaction is i must be in danger and the immediate response is i must survive by which he means defend myself so he takes defending actions he gets defensive actions at once you miss withhold on pc you get defensive action wild animals are savage for only one reasonbecause nobody ever pulled their withholds wild animals are not natively savage they arejust happen to be in state where they can longer get off their withholds thats all see theyre individuated wolf is being wolf that he is being wolf means he has withholds so therefore if he found himself withholding something he would attack you or oddly enough if he found you withholding something he would attack you any withhold will restimulate wolf he goes savage instantly but do you know wolves arent necessarily savage you know theyre the best fathers in the whole animal kingdom theyre rather interesting beings but when they get the identity of wolf straight down the groove they are very easily led to believe that theyre withholding that they are in danger and that they must attack and these conclusionsit doesnt matter where you enter that trianglethey interpret almost anything that theyre in danger they interpret almost anything that they must attack they interpret almost anything that theyre being attacked and therefore they must interpret anything may kill them so that they must withhold in the vicinity of almost anything so you seldom run into them i havent seen any walking down piccadilly circus for long time along about 565 ad the total population of rome was two wolves in the forum total population but its been better populated since and it was better populated before that but they just dont show up in public they very seldom come in and say how do you do and thats because they couldnt say how do you do if they had to now in order to handle wolf so that he wouldnt bite you you would have to demonstrate to him conclusively that he was not withholding anything isnt that interesting and do you know that i handle wolves that way very successfully that there is point in withholding anything that theres just point they get into very jolly frame of mind they tackle you and you pick them up on both sides of their jowls and you throw them about twentyfive feet and you go over and pick them up and pet them well it sounds absolutely incredible doesnt it but theres point in withholding anything because theyre not going to damage you any and also youre not going to damage them its quite remarkable you get right down to it you get an ideathere is meeting ground at which nobody is hurting anybody its just jolly good fun as we wrap each other around tree trunks you know wolf will take an awful lot of punishment you walk up to wild animal as though youre withholding something and youve had it youve had it right now you walk up to wild animal as though youre not withholding anything and he stands there and looks at you and wonders what youre doing so you show him what youre doing you very carefully always show him what youre doing you dont excite his curiosity so you dont have withhold involved and you can actually walk right up to one hell never attack you it iswas not any magic that kept daniel alive in the lions den its just he never gave anybody the impression they were withholding all right now youve given the pc the impression in security checking that the pc is withholding and then you didnt pull the withhold to show the pc the pc wasnt now withholding what do you think the pcs going to do hes liable to leap out of the chair with all fangs bared and does not that pcs are wolves but the onetwothree applies to the pc if the pc is withholding then he must be in danger then he had better defend himself and thats how the missed withhold makes pc so savage and what makes it such deadly mechanism and why youve toyouve got to handle this mechanism and stop fooling around with it if youre going to pull pcs withholds which is the only thing that keeps himpulling his withholds is the only thing that keeps him from totally individuating dont you see and he can now communicate and everything looks better and so on but you just miss pulling the withhold and the fact that you are pulling withhold or could pull withhold restimulates the withhold so he adds the consequences or the conclusions you see that he must be in danger and that you must be attacking him and that he must attack you and he does too he might not attack you rom the auditing chair he simply goes out in the hall natters to somebody else about you you see but hes in danger and thats the mechanism of the missed withhold and of course the missed withhold is far more deadly than the withhold see if you dont pull withhold thats pretty easy so you dont pull withhold so you dont pull withhold you didnt ask for it you didnt restimulate it it wasnt important and you didnt pull it the pc stays in there perfectly well otherwise youd have to pull all the withholds the pc has had in the last two hundred trillion years in one session otherwise hed tear your head off if that werent true that i just said you couldyou can actually not restimulate or pull withhold providing it isnt restimulated you dont have to pull it and you can have session now youve got reality on that but how about restimulating withhold and then not pulling it oooooh thats what were talking about were talking about missed withhold one that was restimulated and we didnt pull ooooh now what do we see so when we talked about missed withholds were always making this one remark were asking the auditing question have i missed withhold on you has anybody missed withhold on you has any withhold ever been available that nobody ever pulled in that session emeters or emeters were you ever in session where some information was available from you and was not asked for by the auditor you get the idea i mean this is how far downstairs this can go emeters or emeters now at any time in life were you in possession of certain information somebody else could have had by asking but didnt ask and you will find immediately sources and areas where the person could have been angry at somebody thereafter its the missed withhold its missed see thats different thing than withhold these are different things one of the hardest things to teach i think there could be because you say to somebody well did you pick up the missed withholds and the person goes in and says well yeah i picked up the missed withholds yeah of course and you say well what did you do well i asked him if he was withholding anything you have to say did you pick up the withholds that had been missed well heyes yes well how did you do this well i said was he withholding anything you say the withholds that had been missed that had been restimulated the withholds that were available that werent picked up and the auditing question would be when you were being audited by joe doakes did joe doakes restimulate any reprehensible activities or something that you were withholding and didnt ask for it all the way and didnt get the dope missed withhold joe doakes session with you when he didnt pick up the information that he restimulated and you finally will get it through but itim sure that its going to cause trouble because you say missed withhold everybody knows exactly what you mean unless theyve been here for training they know exactly what you mean naturally youre talking about withhold missed withhold is missed withhold its missed it has been restimulated or asked for in some prior time to the time it is being asked for if you run session on missed withholds you never ask for anything the person is withholding during the entire body of the session you dont ever say are you withholding anything you just say has anybody missed withhold on you have i ever missed withhold on you all right who was the first person to audit you the first person was joe doakes joe doakes ever miss withhold on you got the idea did your mother ever miss withhold on you did your father ever miss withhold on you did your father at any time ask you where you had been after school and if he had asked just little bit more insistently you would have told him where he was and you told him something different and you didnt tell him right and you told him wrong and you were thereafter mad at your father well i see what you mean yeah oh yeah some information that your father restimulated in other words on you which he then didnt get oh thats what you mean well yes we can oh yea well lots why didnt you ask something now you say well were this is an entirely different thingwere you withholding anything from your father did you ever withhold anything from your father did your father not know something about you what did you do what was there about you that your father didnt know see you could ask all these questions and not get missed withhold answered ever what didnt your father know about you what didnt your father know about you what didnt your family know about you what didnt your father know about you you go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and never pick up missed withhold now at any time was it possible that your father could have found out what you really did in high school was there any period there when the information was available and your father didnt ask for it and all of sudden why the pc remembers having hidden the liquor wine bottle under the bed suddenly before his father walked in the door and the room was reeking with wine and his father never said what is that smell and he was always mad at his father afterwards and never knew why do you see how far this goes see the information was available but papa didnt ask for it so therefore papas guilty of missed withhold information available and not asked for that is the thing which makes wild animal out of pc now i want you all to get reality on it that when pc gets upset you have missed withhold not that you have missed withhold that you have missed withhold you in the beginning rudiments said all right are you withholding anything oh thank you very much good do you have present time problem and the pc was just on the verge of saying you know theres something ive been doing lately thats out oh do i have present time problem half an hour deep into the session the pc says why do you keep repeating the auditing question over and over youre about to drive mad whats happened here youve restimulated him you have told him that he is not going to survive you have told him that he is going to have to defend himself and youve put him into the state of wild animal he cant do anything else but fight you asking for one and not getting it is the only real that you can commit as an auditor except not auditing its asking for one and not getting it is what we mean by missed withhold we dont mean all those withholds that the pc has got we dont mean all those withholds hes goti can guarantee you ten to the twentyfirst power binary digits squared cubed and then after that to the twentyfirst power again would not begin to count the withholds hes accumulated in one trillion years see hes just got scillions of them but restimulating one and not pulling it you got savage beast on your hands thats the whole source of arc break and auditor upsets with pcs actually your auditing poise and ability to handle the pc and so on is not anywhere near as bad as you think it is it is better than you think it is in actual fact but you believe that it is worse than it is because youve missed withholds and been chewed out by pcs so often the pc was never concerned with your auditing skill he was only concerned with your having missed withhold that you might have gotten now you just put that down in your book and if i can teach you that and get you to audit by that principle and at the same time to get you to audit perfectly wow will you sail okay all right well thats what there is about withholds thats why they work and thats why they turn people savage thats how they function and where they fit okay audience yes any value to you audience yes good enough thank you
