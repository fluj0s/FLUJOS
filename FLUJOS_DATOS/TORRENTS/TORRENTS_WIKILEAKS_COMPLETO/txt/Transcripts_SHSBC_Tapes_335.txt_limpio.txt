shsbc306 ren 335 11 sep 63 service facs and gpms service facs and gpms based on the clearsound version only lecture given on 11 september 1963 well whats whats this today audience 11th of september i didnt mean that thank you for the date but yeah just taking look at you i supervise lot of your cases more than you think and every once in while why with horrible shudder vou realize ive been looking over your shoulder but i always take look at you my perceptivity on pc is pretty good i know how youre getting along and as auditors same way i know how youre getting along see its very easy how caved in does your pc look so you see if you have dominant number of the class caved in why the auditors arent doing so good now whats the date audience september the 11th eleven september ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and this lecture slightly exceeds its normal scope of lectures have lot of bad news for you lot of good news for you lot of bad news and on may the 8th the nature of the gpm says that the early gpms contacted on the pc are implants and it says down there its tenth twelfth paragraph something like that this does not mean that the pcs own gpms do not exist do you remember that audience yes the pcs own gpm has the power and velocity over an implant gpm of somewhere between thousand or hundred thousand to one actually much greater figure of magnitude i just threw that in just to give you an idea that theres magnitude difference see now hold your hats the whole of the implanted gpms betweenlives area screens implant gpms the minion goals the helatrobus implants and the train goals all this sort of stuff all those gpms all those implant gpms are one ri in one of my gpms audience hmmm wow whew interesting huh one ri one ri the name of the ri is goals oppterm goals which is one of something on the order of hundred ri personal gpm which extends from trillionsthirty to trillionstwenty on the time track but which is actually still going now several things are need clarifying lot of you have been protesting this you wonder why this is part of the service fac well youll get around to that in minute but several things need clarifying and one is the length of the time track and lot of you have had considerable protest on the subject of the length of the time track because trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of years you know ttttttt tttt you know and ohhh my god hohoho ohhh hoho dear getting so long dadsadyadyadya ohhh uhhhh you hear that around every once in while you probably felt like that yourself you know well i just have good news for you in that particular department what i would choose to call modern times extends from trillionsthirteen till now thats modern times the stuff thats more likely to influence the preclear in present time well this is very germane because you now have your paws on scientology iii just about the handsomest little package of stuff you ever had anything to do with called service facsimile first introduced as routine 3sc correct audience mmm yes what youre doing is fooling around with the pcs current ri in his existing goal line of his current truncated goal and youre fooling around with one little ri see and youve got this and its in present time and of course theres an opposition to it and you can get your hands on the opposition and you can get your hands on the ri and you can fumble and fool around with this and almost any way you look in it or almost any way you carve on the edges of it youre going to make clear well what are you doing youre actually clearing dumbbell pair of the pcs own gpm out of sequence on the track see thats all youre doing youve got your paws on what he is doing right now well of course in fumbling around itd be very easy for some of you to lay your paws on what he was doing last night oh take or minus trillionsfive years ago see last night you know what he was doing youre liable to get your paws on that see but thats still all right but of course the pcs goal is going to fall out of this thing with thud like anns did last night listed goals and one rocket read and so forth wasnt listing goals listing ideas on the service fac you see and one of them rocket read well its the greatest probability that while youre looking for the service fac that which rocket reads is the pcs own goal so now at this point you should however be very wary as i told you in the last lecture ive been aware of this ive been holding out on you for couple of days here ive been aware of this but i didnt believe it i really didnt believe it very hard and i had to do some more looking at the thing that is to say i just didnt believe the magnitude differences ive been looking for enough if you are powerful character lets put it this way if you are powerful character that once had muscles and played billiards with planets and weve got to look for some order of aberration to reduce that power thats comparable to that power right the degree of aberration necessary to reduce that much power must be comparable to the power reduced and we have there law or rule do you see that audience mmhm yes you dont take you dont take you dont take big john from the north woods you know that was customarily picking up douglas firs hundred and seventyfive feet tall and picking his teeth with them you know the paul bunyan type legends you see and drop tack hammer on his toe and have him crippled for life you see that just doesnt happen im afraid you would have to have you would have to have quite few forests fall on his head see for him to get headache well the forests that have fallen on the head of the thetan of course are these gpms now we look it over and so they put you on monocycle and you went pockating down between couple of rows of things that spat at you see and great great day fine all right all right i dont even care if i key you in because what am i keying in you can always scratch mosquito bite see if you went down the line with these things barking and firing at you and that sort of thing and they said that you were absolutably good and that sort of thing bull the only thing they did was get you very confused as to which was your goal and which was their goal and that little tiny gpm that they installed had the power of being installed backwards and being installed according to the actual pattern of gpms had the power of getting thetan confused so he didnt want to really look over that he didnt want to have too much to do with that you see why its backwards you know they implanted them from the top to the bottom well an actual gpm is run from the bottom to the top the way it was lived see you dont run an actual gpm from its top oppterm down to the goal at the bottom you take the goal at the bottom and you list it back up to the top oppterm you got that otherwise it doesnt make any sense at all they will list backwards but youll find yourself being thrust forward in time and its hard to do the liability of reaching the goal is of course the goal is the furthest item from present time being the bottom terminal and when you get your pc to reach down for that goal this is what i wanted to give you as just little tip i didnt want you getting too adventurous here because when you have the pc reach for that goal and examine that goal he actually is to some slight degree moving through time between that goal and present time dont you see and he lives up the whole track and the wild part of it is it looks just like well i dont know if any of you have ever looked down the helatrobus implants and just looked down between the row and it was all nice it was all clean you know you could see all the stuff and you looked down to the end and you say i wonder what that item was or that one what happened see you got sort of tunnel of blackness occurs the whole way along if you had some sensation of that particular character well thats what happens when you reach down the gpm well the same thing happens when you make pc reach down his gpm channel only this is something of the order of you can reach down gpm in the helatrobus implants you see and the pc manages it it isnt so good he doesnt like that he didnt think that was so good i mean thats his that would be his ordinary reaction dont you see but he looks down his own goal channel like this and scrapes up and down his own goal channel and mucks around in it any length of time reaching back to the goal and reaching something else and so forth and its something like having your head shot off with sixteeninch cannon see because the residual charge is oh id itd be almost impossible to state the difference of magnitude the charge is great im not trying to scare your own gpms but im just giving you an idea as auditors now lets say lets say that somebody has goal to be sexual or have sex or something like this you see or to create create my own universe or something like this see lets say thats the pcs own goal see and youre clobbing along here with service fac see youre looking at service fac and he lists it its to have my own universe or something like this you take this up and you put it in red with great big square around it on the auditors report you understand so its big so that nobody can miss it while theyre going through folders and that sort of thing you put it up there because thats very important its infinitely more important than any implant goal see put it up there so its big and then dont start mucking about with it on any process except 3m2 oh you can list it and get its oppterms and oppterm that and so forth youve got all the technology itll be back on your checksheets tomorrow morning but you get the all the technology exists for this stuff you see well what if you used that to have my own universe as the service facsimile hohohoho youre running something back at maybe trillions twentyone youre not running service facsimile youre making the guy look down this channel see because that the goal clean statement of you see is the first ri in the gpm pardon pardon it isnt there is an probably an earlier one which would be something like being with the idea that to have my own universe the being with the idea to have my own universe may come previously to that dont you see because he hasnt become the postulate yet but nevertheless youve got something thats down there at the beginning of this track see and theres at least hundred ris between where you are and it at least hundred ris and you go charging down there to run this as service fac and yeah itll make lot of sense and yeah youll get free needle yeah youll get some tone arm action yeah theres nothing like that but sooner or later somewhere along this line the pcs scuffing back and forth commuting you see hes gonna rough up the rest of his track and oddly enough it lies in channel which looks not unlike one of these implant goal channels of course there arent any firing mechanisms or anything like that but thats all arranged pcs own gpm looks like black island ive already given lecture on this and described all these and so forth long time ago spring i guess it was and but they they look like black island floating and so on and theyre quite meaty and they have specific distinct sizes and all of this sort of thing well you get the pc scruffing back and forth recognize that youre running him from the bottom of an island of solid mass maybe threefeet thick by seventyfive feet long by maybe thirtyfeet wide and youre just running him up through the middle of this thing you know and youre running him back through the middle of the other and youre running him back up there again and uhhh hey hey and all of sudden tone arm action nothing else you wont be able to continue your activities with service facsimile you see that fortunately not all is lost all you would have to do in this particular regard is just break out your little pencil and hundred and seventyfive reams of paper and go to work with 3m2 with all of its various complicated laws and that sort of thing taking the first item you found down at the bottom of it such as the goal and working on through and working out the gpm in actual fact the beauty the beauty of the pcs own gpm as compared to an implant gpm is the pcs own gpm disintegrates and the pattern of the needle action you get quite bit of tone arm action when you start in its kind of stiffish and then the needle starts getting freer and the tone arm starts waving more and as you get down about threequarters of the way toward the top of the thing just as its given on your early plots those early plots to scream and that sort of thing theyre all quite valid you see theyre your own gpm patterns you see thats the way they look foreshortened but nevertheless those releases are all quite accurate and you get up you get up about threequarters of the way and you all of sudden start seeing that thing start rocket reading blowdowns rocket reading blowdowns psssww psssww psssww psssww then you start watching this tone arm come on down here toward clear read psswwpssww and itll just go on that way itll go on and itll go on and itll go on then you find another ri you see and then it starts going some more and it starts blowing down and this thing practically disintegrates youve got an automatic disintegration is what happens sometimes your pcll sit there in session hell look at one of these huge islands which has been black and is now turned grey and itll be buckling and quivering and buckling thats the wrong word its shaking something begins to buckle youve got something on top of it but youll see it shaking and shivering and fraying it looks like it looks like some jello it looks like piece of opaque jello that somebody has left in the sun it ceases to be so hard and fast and it sort of drips away and it shatters well actually that charge isnt going through your meter or through the pc fortunately youre only getting small indication of the amount of charge going off i dont know how much charge is going off one of these things but i should think an early track gpm is probably losing megatron or something like that id say at least but its simply disintegrating into the nevernever land and you dont notice it but you do see it on this meter and the pc is fended off from the thing dont you see hes its over there its over there maybe eight ten fifteen feet away from him and its going apart rather quietly but its that much force that is dissipating and you just get kickback on the meter which is almost telepathic in its lightness see theres hardly any kickback coming at the pc you understand well theres enough charge to make paul bunyan into punk see see theres enough charge to take guy with the total capabilities of an ot and reduce him down to somebody that when the medico trims his fingernail or something like that he has an awful time you get the idea see theres enough charge to aberrate aberration must be equivalent to the amount of power aberrated and its the pcs own gpms now theres various various data extant in this particular field its covered under the techniques called r3m and r3m2 was its final consolidation that technology all exists now what you what this lectures principally about the technology all exists the lectures exist and so forth pc has his own goals his own gpms and these ris have tremendous amount of mass one ri you see is maybe hundredth or twohundredth of big gpm see and this reliable item is the pcs own reliable item is floating round here in present time in fact hes busy busy busy busy busy the nut making himself making himself an ri and it has an opposition hes busy busy busy busy busy see now it has central postulate of its own and its dependent on the goal also in other words all these ris oppterms or terminals have in common the goal they all have the goal in them because theyre part and parcel of the goal but they have their own significance with regard to the goal lets take the goal lets imagine there is such goal to go to school such goal would never exist so we just take it so its nonrestimulative all right well youve got an ri up toward present time got an ri up toward present time thatll make you very very upset you see because it apparently wont have anything to do with anything and you dont understand it really until you get the goal but the confounded thing is baffling to auditor and pc alike because its to to ring bells or to ring the bell or something like this you see what the hell what does it go up to the guy wanted to be fire engine laddie or whats he want to be you know i mean what is this thing what is this thing service fac to ring the bell see it nevertheless will run because its part and parcel of to go to school naturally why in small schools why the better pupil was called on to ring the bell in the morning and thats see there he is you see you might find something to get gold star and you think of gold star mothers and that sort of thing and its some confounded innocuous thing like you know to get or youre liable to get an oppterm of people who bring their lunches creak your brains you know how in the name of common sense is this an aberrative factor in anybodys case you know well you dont have the gpm goal so of course the ri all by itself doesnt make much sense but its hanging out everyplace and you can come around the perimeter of it and you can take your techniques which are given in r3sc and theyll land you somewhere in the perimeter of the oppterm or terminal of the pcs own gpm as it applies more or less to pt or some old one thats in restimulation in pt and will be the source of his present time restimulation as per the graph i gave you yesterday and of course you can knock that thing in the head and get yourself lot of nice tone arm action wonderful tone arm action particularly because its in formation dont you see its an ri in formation and you can knock it all to pieces and you can pull its central postulate and so forth and you get all kinds of interesting meter phenomena and all that sort of thing but when you try to make it make sense it very often doesnt and it may not make sense it may clear the pc up very nicely but make sense at all until someday hes run on r3m and we find out this bing to ring to ring the bells is the goal to go to school and hell let out war whoop in the session and suddenly add it all up dont you see well the gpm will be somewhat disintegrated already youve already tackled this thing obliquely so thats actually what youre auditing i thought you might like to know now well youve got tremendous complexities enter into this situation i hit one last night i might as well tell you about now you actually can assess for service facsimile without meter on this basis only write list until the pc seems easy and thinks its complete and then just look on the list for the one that makes the least sense and you should know that as an auditor because itll help you great deal you dont have too much to do with significance on this sort of thing but its the one that makes the least sense its lie it isnt true and so forth and we had list going last night i was being audited and one appeared on the list abandon all help as solution to anything that was gone now you add that up i couldnt but it tore somatic off of my jaw the like of which i havent felt in long time you see and the auditor went on another column of listing and nulling and so forth and it went in and it went out because it was being suppressed it was worrying see not necessarily because it wasnt sensible but because it wasnt sensible i suppressed it and it stopped reading so another one or two which were only locks on it started reading they read momentarily you see because id abandoned it they were reading by the bypassed charge on it thats an interesting solution isnt it abandon all help if something is gone you abandon all help well it didnt make any sense at all to but i happened to know what gpm that its coming from its the gpm to be free and its simply an ri and it becomes completely sensible one of the ways of being free is to abandon all help see perfect method of becoming free if you need help from anyplace why naturally you can be free so you see it makes sense in its own gpm but doesnt make any kind of sense at all and yet would audit yet would audit very nicely pc cognited on it all over the place and straightened it all out and free up the needle and free up the tone arm and everything go along fine even though it didnt make any sense and wasnt compared to the goal dont you see because the ri that it was being listed against was not the right ri probably but it just popped up because its pt solution see of the gpm line so therefore its an ri of the gpm line to be free method of being free abandon all help well that wasnt actually an ri i dont even know what ri it is out of but its the central postulate of the ri see what i mean and what youre handling is the central postulate of the ri when youre handling service facsimile so you get disintegration i see ive left you adrift here you thought the central idea of an ri made the ri well thats perfectly valid but it all too often simply describes what makes the central postulate see we know little bit more now about the ri lets take lets take the ri lame man see weve never really gone into the anatomy of reliable item of gpm because we were dealing so many months now with these confounded implant gpms and that sort of thing i never bothered to go forward on the thing well what makes this lame man ri hold together why does he assume the identity of lame man see well he assumes it because its got solution in the middle of it which is an idee fixe which then prevents him from looking at anything else and it may be lameness see although the item is lame man the postulate which brings that into action you see is lameness do you see that its not quite safe now sometimes they are more distant than that you see not walking let us say is the principal idea and you get that perfectly validly as lame man dont you see or an immobilized person youve got that as an ri now that characterizes simply the identity of the ri that is the beingness of the ri what is the thinkingness of this ri the thinkingness of the ri might be different not always because sometimes the ri comes up as its own thinkingness dont you see but particularly beingness ri or some conditional ri may have at its core an idea and its this idea which is an automatic solution well an ri always has an idea at its core but sometimes its new idea which makes the ri dont you see and that whole mass come together is gpm so you have this huge mass huge block of energy with its separate items and so forth in it its hardly distinguishable as separate items because its all squashed together theres been so much attack and so little inspection and this whole gpm is dominated by one idea let us say to go to school see thats one idea and that is common to every ri or identity in that see which is what accumulates it but that idea all by itself is inspection solve all problems to go to school see see if you have headache go to school you see if you have something of the sort and if you didnt know something go to school and so forth you get the idea see its totally uninspected totally uninspected solution so because its uninspected and automatic and fixed it then generates into it this second step of identities which have this as central idea but the identities already have their own characteristics see theyve got this idea is dominant see but their characteristics of the identity would be something like way up at the line up here some place you know terminal after hes longer able to carry out the postulate becomes something on the order of an idiot child see and you go into the basis of an idiot child to find out what it is is people like unintelligence see or just unintelligence seems to solve everything so the central idea of this ri an idiot child may be unintelligence but the ri is an idiot child and the reason it could get formed in the first place is he already had the idee fixe of the goal so youve got actually three ideas in connection with this thing one is the gpms central goal which is the first postulate of that gpm plus the central idea of the ri which in itself in its peculiar way forbids inspection and the resultant mass caused by the goal noninspection and the ri central idea noninspection we have as an identity or an individuality we have this as the third step so we would say the goal to go to school central idea unintelligence results in the ri see an idiot child do you see that well thats characteristic of all of all ris and that is the anatomy of an ri and it also happens to be the anatomy of what youve got as service facsimile that which is not inspected tends to persist and that is your basic rule this little hobsonjobson on one of our earlier ones that which is not admired tends to persist and your little rule there that which is not inspected tends to persist why because its never asised that which you look at will tend to and inspect tends to become well it doesnt tend to remain in an aberrated state dont you see but that which is never inspected of course has this factor of uninspection which adds mass now because it is not just because i just used this because it is actually quite unintelligent what happens well person gets hell knocked out of him thats what happens and he can never attack the right enemy hes got some idea you see an idiot child is liable to attack bright kids see something like that well anything thats characterized as bright kids he attacks see so its perfect invitation to attack and because theres constant attack and constant overts going on and constant withholds going on and constant battle going on it of course accumulates an awful lot of mass and theres where the mass comes from of an ri its quite interesting that an idea is most easily substituted for thetan you an idea doesnt have any mass connected with it basically and it appears to be have some wisdom in it and that sort of thing its very easily substituted for thetan so somebody can walk around as the guard see he isnt thetan hes the guard got the idea and you probably had something to do with guards and they have rather unintelligent activities you say well i left my lunch on the counter in the washroom and id like to go in and get it yes hmmm do you have pass hmmm what department do you work for hmmm have to call the security chief im sorry i have young lady out here wants to get back into the building security section you can see it now it goes straight up to the president of the company the fbi is called in and so on the federal government is justified for its existence dont you see theres telegrams going out in all directions and so forth and youre standing there you left your lunch in the washroom see i mean that was all there was to understand there but not the guard hes the guard see and so he doesnt its not his to understand anything hes just there to be the guard do you understand that well thats an identity which is substituted for thetan see well now similarly any idea is liable to become substitute for thetan because thetan does it himself he has some bad luck see hes had some bad luck last three or four mountain ranges he built fell down bad luck overbalanced the planet and it started going in the other direction you know the poles appeared at different places than they were supposed to you see so on the idea of planets never build mountains that solves it doesnt it well now all the confusion of the accident which has just occurred is now prevented from ever occurring again by never build mountains and that holds in place then all uninspected all of the confusion he just got into by building three mountain ranges where he shouldnt have built them see so all that confusion and randomity is held in place because it isnt inspected its solved never build mountains see thats it now hes got it all taped you see and thats his idea now if we go along and follow his career its sooner or later why well find him running society which prevents the building of mountains society for the prevention of building of mountains you see he shifted his identity only to the point where hes the president of it you see but you see youve got the substitute of an idea for the being in this particular case he just had this as solution but this solution he kept working at and it itself then gets battered and hammered by the environment the environment that has solution in it you see never build mountains rather tends to push against this bloke see so that accumulates more mass you see by reason of this thing and then he fights back and that accumulates more mass and then eventually he becomes the idea never build mountains dont you see and it might appear as some different ri but you look there and youll find never build mountains has been substituted for thetan you see so thats the history of persons lessening abilities see these ris these substitutions all of this sort of thing all of his ows and various things all get piled up on one of these idees fixes the biggest idee fixe that person can have is goal biggest one that develops into gpm not all goals develop into gpms but those hes got have developed into gpms so heres gpm floating there and finally life becomes completely unlivable and he doesnt want anything to do with it anymore so he abandons all that and gets new goal if you want to see the helatrobus implant people did an interesting job of tracing the deterioration of the thetan but actually the bear and gorilla goals are better one theyre better model and those which we turned out in the last year here that dont have the positive items in it you know those that just show you the you know like to scream you know those gpms which came out theyre graduates up the line well thats what pcs own gpm looks like because he keeps moving off of these idees fixes abandons those and has to have new idee fixe to solve the situation which hes just solved but which wouldnt stay solved once you start solving things in this peculiarfashion you eventually wind up with gpms thats all you can say about that now you find this pc with r3sc im not talking to you too much about gpms although they come into this naturally and because im also telling you what the score is with regard to them horrible feeling of exhaustion just swept over in the idea of having to cover all the ground that we have covered before on the subject of r3m and the pcs own goals and gpms and just to help you out on this that ground is all there im talking about reevolving it the only part of it that needs reevolving perhaps is mostly done and thats how do you find the pcs own goal and how do you separate it out from an implanted goal because they both read the same when you first find them on the meter and its much easier to find implant goals than it is own goals and you try to run an implant goal as though it were the pcs own gpm and he doesnt have goal under that heading but theres only an implant goal and youre running the helatrobus implants with the wrong items dont you see this is all very involved but if you keep an eye very cleanly out while youre doing service facsimiles why the helatrobus implants and other implants of that character didnt have the power actually to do very much to generate the ri which you find as service facsimile they might have monitored it somehow made the guy resentful of hockey sticks or something like this or monocycles he probably cant stand monocycle acts in the local vaudeville but whats your whats your application here that you must be very alert to anything you find that rocket reads while doing r3sc and you must be very careful not to tackle it headon as the service facsimile why because it doesnt run well with your service facsimile technology youre going to run gpm with your service facsimile technology i rather think not but you can run one ri with your service facsimile technology see you can run an ri with it you understand what im talking about now do you that thing that rocket reads pssw every time he gave you this solution which hes selling you as the service fac and cogniting on well dont shut him down in his cognition but dont let him wander too much on the track either because youve got your hands on something which lies trillions multiple in the past see and you havent got anything have anything to do with his present time youve got something that belongs and can only be handled in scientology iv but there are other ways of attacking this situation now the beauties of r3sc is it doesnt matter which side of this orange you start peeling see heres this ri thats monitoring his present life it doesnt matter which side of it it doesnt matter if you take out that little green thing at the top or the navel at the bottom or peel off some slabs or actually blot the oil off of it youre going to do something dont you see and next thing you know youre going to start cutting up this ri because itll chop up just like anything else and charge is going off of this thing madly in all directions and so forth and hell eventually become very calm about it now if you leave if you find one of these things heres another liability if you find one of these things if you find an ri and youve got yourself pc on whom energy is going nnwwaaam waaaooww waaaooww waaaooww rrrrr creak rrrr brrrr brrrr hes left session you see and hes walked out three doors only theres only one you see and he lays down at night in bed after the session and hell fowndeh and its started going whooooo wawwwwhoooooo and he got up and hastily turned on the light and four oclock in the morning hes still sitting at his window looking out into the street and trtryingnottotobreathetoodeeply becauseeverytimehedoes he goes whoooooo wwwwllll whooooo its ghastly most ghastly sensations you can feel like you know these suction cups they clean out wcs with you know you could feel like youre inside one of those things you know being spronged and bonged or inflated and deflated rhythmically by an air pump or something like this and things go around creak the guys shoulder for instance moves over into the middle of his chest and wont go back and his chin suddenly moves up as far as hes concerned looks to you to be mostly in fact he might even look better but from his point of view the chin is apparently at the top of the crown of his head just occupational hazards factually not even very dangerous but they certainly are frightening because youve come in close to the middle of gpm now your first your next reaction from this pc youre entitled to know what it is the gpm is something else i mean the ri the thing is something else you havent got the guys service fac its all been mistake actually his service fac has to do with not liking patagonians thats far enough away from what hes just been in see hes got himself hes got himself qualm this is new new illness that occurs in scientology and that is the qualms qualms and the cause of it is getting into or into the fringes of the service facsimile and deciding that we have come close enough see he wasnt close enough in to be pulled into the thing but he was close enough to be whooooo ohhhh nooooo hoho and he wants to change his mind and hell give you another service facsimile so you get an invalidation of what you found going on almost continuously in rssc and you can qanda with that invalidation you can qanda with that invalidation just so much without restimulating the living daylights out of the case the way to repair it if you restimulated the case and hes apparently getting worse or something under r3sc is go back and pick up everything that has been found on the pc one of the first requisites is to keep good records and pick up everything that has been found on the pc and guessed at as service facsimile and finish it off according to the rules of the game just finish everything off elementary now the best way to finish these things off is with the with the lot you give it the lot thats all of r3sc steps if you find blackberries and i know youve said it was wrong and it wasnt an idea and it wasnt postulate and actually it was an identity and it was an item and it just turned on turned on pain and then didnt do much and it was abandoned and then you found and you found going down for some reason or other and that was just touched up lightly but the pc couldnt see how it made anything wrong dont you see so that was abandoned you look for another one and then the pc went into the qualms and you found one that had to do with to be little or something of the sort and this was awful close to it and you decided that you and he both decided that must be gpm because it was too gruesome to be confronted and about the fifth or sixth one along the line youll have gotten tone arm action but youll also have an awfully confused pc but you should realize that what youre doing is picking up stable datum and leaving the confusion alive and the net result is this the pcs memory will quote tend to deteriorate unquote in other words hell just get foggy dont you see because youve left half or threequarters of the confusion attendant upon that stable datum still around youve taken the stable datum out somewhat and youve left the confusion but the stable datum couldnt be all the way out or the confusion would have disappeared so the pc who feels confused on r3sc is either in the process of having stable datum audited out or youve or some other auditor has abandoned stuff that is close in to the case and has left it in confused restimulation the repair on it is just take everything thats been found on the case and worked at in this particular way and simply give it the lot that is all the steps of r3sc just give it the whole works now let say something here about running this because its very germane its not out of place at all because youre dealing with ris the postulate is so far downscale if you find the center of the ri that postulate is so far downscale that it is probably twenty tone arm divisions below hide thats not just hyperbolical statement thats probably where it is its an idea thats turned into mest way down scale and it runs to cognition you only run it to cognition but it enters at any one of these stages solution making good record of this solution rightwrong process make you right others wrong domination survival it enters anyplace anyplace and you run it to cognition now you say to the guy you say to the guy well would that make others right oh yes it would make others right it would pardon make others wrong hed say yes itd make others wrong so forth but hey itd also make them right you say well it cant be the service facsimile because it didnt make others wrong and make him right and abandon it haha wait minute the run was only the run was twelvesecond run it ran twelve seconds to cognition before it changed that level of that scale i just gave you understand in fact one of you poor zed students got sent to siberia for doing that the pity of it is is the zed students that that happened to you know they didnt have the data on what they were supposed to have disobeyed yet unjust isnt it now the upshot of this process now this is i should give you practically whole lecture on just this process and probably will youll be hearing lot more of it but if you consider this process here as this picture of survive you know i mean thats help own survivalhinder the survival of others you know that sort of thing dominate which is help you escape domination and achieve the domination of others and rightwrong and if thats the way you look at it and you always enter here at rightwrong and then expect it to go to dominate and expect it to go to survive thats only gonna happen if youve got first cousin to the service facsimile ri of the pcs present time gpm series in other words youve got something that does him lot of good dont you see and he gets some automaticities on it and everything is going along fine but if youve got real honesttopete honesttogoodness gpm it doesnt go at this level the idea doesnt come in here at rightwrong and then proceed up to dominate and then go to survive see actually this is what the picture looks like much more germane it goes solutions well lets take this at this level it goes solutions dominate pardon solutions rightwrong dominate survive dominate rightwrong solutions horrible isnt it and here of course is your next rightwrong and your dominate and your survive you understand this female voice yeah and so that it actually actually just builds up into you understand it might enter here anyplace because it goes on thats your top one let us say here see that band is okay and if it were light perimeter idea which is still intelligent and if you start abandoning service facsimiles because theyre not sensible you will only get this light variety because real service facsimile is about as sensible as an admirals hat on cow see and so your entrance point here your upper entrance point would only be in that proper exact order nicely nicely nicely if the idea were still intelligent or still knowable or still sensible ah but the gpm does not look very sensible and when its rather weird solution of some kind or another as it would be if it were the center of the ri its liable to enter in almost anyplace down here so whats the net result of this you find this thing to kiss cows you see or something like that or cows are kissable or something of this sort and its on list its on list of how to repair motor vehicles how would you go about repairing whats safe solution to motor vehicles and we get cows are kissable well now if we were psychologists we would of course throw that one out because it doesnt fit the rest of the data but thats whats wrong with it it doesnt fit the rest of the data its the service facsimile now cows are kissable the pc may sit there for little while and say rightwrong eh wouldnt make anybody right wouldnt make wouldnt make anybody right or wrong well you say well all right then lets just abandon it or lets just prepcheck it oh the only thing hes done here is give you this scale and you say well how does it fit in with domination do anything with domination do anything with survival is it just solution oh survival well of course its total survival theres question about its being survival thats it oddly enough hes answered the question and cognited in that one sentence and hes simply said it is which of course is cognition because its recognition it is survival see and you say well how are we going to run process on this you know were auditors so weve got to run processes well the way you run process is try to find out what level you can run process on and not cut the pcs itsa line while youre doing it because you then spring back to him you spring back to him well has this been solution oh yes solutions oh my god its solution all ive ever done is just solve this solve that solve the other thing and so on and so on and when i was getting prepschool and so on and solved that solution and so forth and i always use this solution and so forth when i have to do when it has to do with buying peanuts every time i buy peanuts i use this solution of course its just been solution and so on its been solution been solution been solution its been solution its been solution its been solution its half an hour later you see its been solution and he says you know i dont think its ive just taken look at this and i i really dont think its the best solution in the world to buying peanuts it isnt quite applicable cognition see all right now lets shift it now lets shift it and we say well how would it how would it make you right or how has it made you right oh ive used it quite bit it it does it it makes right thats why i use it it makes right that was the cognition thats the end of that process all right how would it make others wrong oh well now thats another thing it really its kind of hard to re realize maybe but it makes others wrong and it so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and fifteen minutes later why and so on it also makes wrong i didnt really realize that but it also makes wrong somewhat thats your cognition all right you say how would it help you dominate others it wouldnt well how would it help you escape domination wouldnt all right well how would it help you survive oh well thats something else twelve minutes later you have now found out cognition see of some kind or another like it helps everybody survive thats why i picked it up you see it helps everybody survive youre back there chipping it apart you see well how would it hinder the survival of others well it wouldnt well when have you used it as solution well ive been damn fool enough to use it for solution for long time but i answered that question while ago didnt you hear youve had it whatd you stick your foot in that for all right lets check this over now lets check this over now lets check it on the meter survival domination rightwrong and solution wrong still reads how would it make wrong oh well yeah i ive been kind of withholding that theres some other ways this works that makes lot of other people wrong dont you see if they had it it would really make them wrong if they had an idea like that all right thats fine thats fine very good all right how is this thing going now well youve put in little whatsit line there and he tells you all about it and so forth and you uncork your prepcheck and you just give him an eighteenbutton prepcheck on the subject and your tone arm action somewhere along that line starts to die down gives you little bit more yipyap about it and that is it that is the end of it do you see how thats run unfortunately unfortunately the auditor is always in the liability of hitting the gpm and as long as this technique is around youre going to have auditors grab to go to school and run with the ball and have pc not going clear on the service fac and get all chopped into something thats only resolvable with 3m2 and why well actually they didnt pick up this pcs service fac they got the pcs goal this is counterbalanced by the fact that if you got the pcs goal youre rich because its very very hard to sort the pcs ozun goal out of the implanted gpms its because they both rocket read going to somebodys going to ask the question im sure does the pcs own goal and own ris rocket read and the answer is yes in fact that is probably what makes implant goals rocket read theyre probably rocket reading off the top of the pcs own ris secondary rr and thats the only thing that makes them rocket read pcs own goals rocket read now every ri including the one that the service fac may be in may rocket read and the gpm goal that the pc is sitting in is going to rocket read that goal is going to rocket read but your gpm does not need to rocket pardon your gpm to run it has to rocket read ris to be acceptable have to rocket read and not turn on mass when they do but just slide some 3m2 sideways in there but the service fac doesnt have to rocket read youre under compulsion to accept rocket reading service fac as matter of fact theres some liability in doing so it isnt necessarily true that you should reject all rocket reading service facs but be perfectly calm about accepting service fac that just goes on little eighthinch tick perfectly calm youre not going to do anything to this character anyhow youre just going to have him straighten out his survival and youre gonna loosen up the needle and free up the needle and youre going to get some ta motion now you actually have to be pretty knuckleheaded to do r3sc wrong even though it has the liability of being part of the pcs gpm and so forth you really have to work at it to do it wrong and the best way to work at it is to be completely unthorough go over little things and little things and little things and little things and pick up this idea and throw it away and not put it through the grinder you know and get that idea off of him and pitch it overboard and not put it through the grinder you see and then knock this one out and i mean push it into view and pc says well hes cognited on its service fac so you say well we dont have to run that then because the end product will be very confused pc his youve half see every time you restimulate stable datum which is what service fac is very aberrated stable datum theyre sufficiently aberrated stable datum to wonder make you queasy about ever getting another idea so long as you live i know i was thinking the other day damn if i ever solved anything again i ought to kick myself i mean you see how much trouble you can get into with solutions that fortunately is not the case dont you see you can go on and live life but the point the point is that every one of those things that are perimeter solutions on the center of service facsimile which is simply the pcs current ri if you want to get very technical about what it is its his current solution see monitored by the goal see thats all it is hes generating it thats for sure its his solution and its aberrated as you can come because its an uninspected solution he actually was perfectly decent solution when he first got ahold of it but now its living his life for him dont you see and therefore it doesnt take care of the environmental restimulation doesnt even vaguely take care of his life for him doesnt write any letters for him it doesnt issue him any paychecks it doesnt box any policemen it doesnt do anything it just sits there and keeps him from doing anything well when you move that thing all the policemen hes not boxed all the letters hes not written all the inspections hes not done start hitting him in their aggregate so all youve got to do is disturb it and move it slightly out of the way and some of this confusion starts generating and the pc starts feeling confused and youll running r3sc youll have some of the most confused pcs in sessions you have ever seen youve got to adjust to this as an auditor youve got to adjust to this as an auditor dont go arguing back at the pc because he says but you havent started the session yet and youve said end of session so that the two teams on both sides of you are going to ask that you calm down and so forth and the pc just knows you never started session thats all just knows you never did and pc is going to walk out and then suddenly come back and ask you to end the session you know and leave his books you see leave his books on the chair leave his books on the chair and then get taxicab to go home for them you watch this see well that is simply ordinary that would be ordinary in running r3sc quite an ordinary state of mind now if thats an ordinary state of mind what is the state of mind of the bloke who has had five service facsimiles picked up partially run and thrown away by the auditor now hes got five zones and areas of confusion which are knocking his block off well man if he can tell the time of day he would be very very lucky its not terribly dangerous but its useless to put pc into this particular frame of mind its silly now youll find out inevitably that this happens accidentally just in sorting them out you miss one you miss two you see something like that you couldnt get one to run yesterday something is sitting in the middle of what you are trying to do and you cant get the pc to talk about it something like that so you go on with your assessment and you think youve now got one for that session youve got the second one for that session dont you see pc is so confused and stony he actually cant tell you about the one he got see the first one you got now youre already route to the second one without recognizing that you have found the first one you understand so its very good thing to review the auditing youve done every now and then and clean up what youve left behind theres crime in having three service facsimiles up in the air like indian clubs as long as youre on the stage to eventually catch them you see theres crime in having three in the air the only crime is not being there to catch them as they come down you see finish them all up in other words youre going to be fooled on lot of service facs because theyre so far downscale that they dont run according to the steps of r3sc you have to jumble the steps dont you see well actually you dont really change the steps but it just doesnt hit at this level or hit at that level and so the pc says it isnt and it isnt and then you tell the pc all right well then it cant be service fac you see because it didnt enter at the level of rightwrong well this is serious blunder in actual fact itll very often enter at the level of solutions itll very often enter at the level of domination quite often enter at the level of survival you see when it wont enter at any other but the level it enters in on thats the one thats the entrance point now thats real service fac behaves in most outrageous fashion in that regard and something that isnt service facsimile but simply gives you fine tone arm motion is more likely to behave perfectly you still follow the steps of rssc see you still do all those things but just because the pc cant do one of the steps is reason to abandon it as service fac and simply prepcheck it or something like that try to enter these other points try to enter these other points and you all of sudden will trigger the automaticity on occasion that youve been looking for youll all of sudden realize that youre running some perimeter thing the main thing is to get tone arm action thats the main thing for you to get thats the big thing for you to get tone arm action administratively remember to keep your weather eye peeled for the pcs goal because this is the best goal finding method that weve had to date the best goal finding method youre actuallv unburdening the bank to the pcs goal and all you do is run service facs if youre actually hitting you run service facs until the pcs in pretty good shape see and has handed you his goal elementary means some pcs will be on long run see before they do but if thats the case then they should be they should have been on long run now youre cutting down the environmental restimulation of the pc constantly and continuously as youre addressing the service facsimile chronic present time problems hidden standards the other things the very things which attract present time problems to the pc are of course contained in the ri of his own gpm which he is now in the process laboriously of forming by being blind nut naturally hes got an ri lover thats the ri hes forming in this lifetime see on the goal to be famous not the goal to be sexual see and there he is forming up this ri lover see and its central postulate doesnt have too much to do with this its to be good thats its central postulate you find to be good you dont connect it with lover see and you certainly dont connect it with to be famous you see youd naturally say its sexual goal you see and to be good is disciplinary goal of some kind or another and all kinds of ramifications and we dont dare run to be good it doesnt rocket read but it sounds like goal dont you see in other words you can have picnic walking through this forest of spears you can have picnic but of course thats nothing because naturally the pcs whole bank is boobytrapped with these gpms that have been implanted so they read like goals too thats the one you worry about dont worry about doing these rssc things just go right ahead and do them get lots of tone arm action and so forth youll get action tone arm action on the pcs own goal line much much much much better infinitely better tone arm action than you ever got on any implant gpm and actually this whole thing has been resolved on the basis of looking for tone arm action we finally come back to tone arm action is best found on the pcs own gpm channel you can use almost anything you can use almost anything in the way of ris to do this rssc stunt you can do this stunt on any gpm ri found the best way of handling it however is to oppose it with 3m2 if its backtrack thing run it as gpm but youre not looking for that right now youre trying to get down the environmental restimulation of the pc calm him down cool him off and so on so as to cut down the session environment restimulation and square him away and you best do this with rssc r3sc will eventually lead in to differentiation by the pc and by you as the auditor of which is and what is the pcs own goal when youve got that you can run 3m on it and actually the pc will fly like bird you wont have seen tone arm action the way you see tone arm action on real gpm the only thing that puts it in the shade is r3m2 is complicated it is delicate to run it is hell on the pc you can miss items like crazy and the fact that youre running those gpms over the top of falsely implanted gpm probably makes it picnic the like of which we never heard of so lets just quietly worry right now about r3sc and meet the other dragon when we turn the corner of the road okay thank you end of tape
