promulgated by the department of educa tion define cafeteria as food dispensing facility capable of providing broad variety of prepared foods nd beverages including hot meals primarily through the use of line where the customer serves himself from displayed selections cafeteria may be fully automated or some limited waiter or waitress service may be ava ilable and provided within cafeteria and

unreasonably in applying the term cafeteria to the military troop dining facilities at fort lee11 nish also argued that the jwod act applied to the awarding of the military troop dining facilities contract at fort lee because the competiti on in contracting act cica precluded application of the randolphsheppard act12 cica requires that the military use full and open competition when contracting for property or services except in the case of procurement procedures othe rwise expressly authorized by statute13 the court ruled that the procurement provisi ons found in the randol phsheppard act

concerning the proper in terpretation of the randolph sheppard act in its appeal to the tent h circuit nish argued that congress did not intend to include military troop dining f acilities in th randolphsheppard acts definition of vending facilities17 the court rejected this argument by ruling that the plain language of the statute is unamb iguous with respect to the inclusion of cafeterias18 nish further argued that the randolphsheppard act did not grant authority to the department of education ed to regulate military mess halls19 but the court ruled that congress did grant this authority

persons be given priority for operation of vending facility on federal property included dining facility attendant services contracts36 but the court held that the armys interpretation that operation did not include dining facility attendant services was not arbitrary or capricious37 however in mississippi department of rehabilitation services v united states 38 the court of federal claims held
