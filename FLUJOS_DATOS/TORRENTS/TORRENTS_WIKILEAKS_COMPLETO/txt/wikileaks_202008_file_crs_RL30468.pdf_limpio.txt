independent counsel law while the provisions of the independent counsel law expired on june 30 1999 such that independent counsels could be appointed for new matters by the special threejudge panel upon the request of the attorney general the provisions of the entire law continued to remain in effect for those pending matters before an independ ent counsel1 one of those provisions of the independent counsel law allows for the reimbursement from the government of reasonable attorneys fees sought by an individual who was subject of an independent counsel investigation if that individual is not indicted and if such expenses would not have been incurred but for the requirements of this chapter2 while the independent counsel statute does not expressly state precise time when the statute should be deemed to be longer in force with respect to any particular investigation that was ongoing when the statute had lapsed it is assumed particularly since the independent counsel has express statutory duties with respect to the evaluation of attorneys fees requests that this portion of the law would be continued that is is one of those pending matters before an independent counsel until all such matters including the final report and appeals of convictions and other judicial decisions arising from the investigation have been finally resolved the text of the attorneys fees provision

of an independent counsel originally called special prosecutor were enacted by congress as part of the ethics in government act of 19783 there were in the original 1978 legislation provisions for the reimbursement of attorneys fees incurred by subjects of independent counselspecial prosecutor investigations in 1982 however the permission to seek attorneys fees was added in the reauthorization of the independent counsel provisions to reduce what were considered additional and unfair financial burdens upon public official subject to the independent counsel law4 the amended provisions of the ethics in government act concerning reimbursement for attorneys fees applied when the official was not indicted and when such official had incurred attorneys fees that would not normally have been incurred by private citizens or by other public officials not subject to the independent counsel provisions in investigations of allegations of similar nature an explanation of the new provision was provided in the senate report on the ethics in government act reauthorization of 1982 an officer who is subjected to special prosecutor investigation incurs expensive burdens both financially and professionally when special prosecutor is appointed the subject of the investigation often bears staggering legal expenses and potentially devastatin g publicity even if the special prosecutor ultimately decides to forego prosecution for example hamilton jordan incurred legal fees exceeding six figures despite the fact that the special prosecutor concluded that indictment was warranted in order to reduce this burden section 5 of the bill gives the court discretion to award attorneys fees to the subject of special prosecutor investigation if indictment is brought and if the court determines that the fees would not have been incurred by private citizen in an investigation of the same allegations the court should award only that portion of the fees if any which it determines would not have been incurred in the absence of the special prosecutor law the bill does not authorize reimbursement for expenses incurred during the preliminary investigation as these expenses would most probably be incurred by ordinary citizens5 during hearings held the previous year in may of 1981 by the subcommittee on oversight of government management of the senate committee on governmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30468crs3 6 subcommittee on oversight of government management senate governmental affairs committee 97th cong 1st sess special prosecutor provisions of the ethics

in in re meese 907 f2d 1192 11961197 dccir1990 affairs the recommendation concerning the permission to seek reimbursement of attorneys fees was made the report of the subcommittee explained in similar manner as the full committee report that the intent of the provision was to reimburse an official of the government who had incurred attorneys fees that because of the application to the official of the independent counselspecial prosecutor law private citizen would not have incurred given the similar circumstances the subcommittee recommends reimbursement of attorneys fees to the subjects of special prosecutor investigation this recommendation received nearunanimous support at the hearing as the purpose of this amendment is to compensate for the extraordinary costs caused exclusively by this statute the subcommittee finds that reimbursement should not cover costs which would have been incurred in similar investigation of private citizen to accomplish this goal the subcommittee recommends that the subject of special prosecutor investigation be authorized to apply to the court for attorneys fees in making its determination the court should consider to what extent the fees incurred were caused by the special provisions ie whether such fees would have been incurred by private citizen in private investigation of the same allegations the court should award only those fees if any which it determined would not have been incurred in the absence of the special prosecutor laws6 in addition to adding the attorneys fees provision in 1982 congress amended the special prosecutorindependent counsel statute to address the concern that the law created unfairness by applying higher standard of criminal law for those under the independent counsel provisions than for the general public and that the legitimate discretion and prosecutive authority of the attorney general and the department of justice were being undermined7 the 1982 amendments thus adjusted the socalled triggering mechanism of the special prosecutorindependent counsel provisions to allow for more discretion on the part of the attorney general to not ask for an independent counsel in the first instance the standard for further investigation and thus the standard for seeking the appointment of an independent counsel was changed from requiring the attorney general to seek the appointment of an independent counsel in the face of allegations unless the allegations were so unsubstantiated that further investigation was warranted8 to requiring the attorney general to find reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted9 secondly in deciding whether to seek an independent counsel the attorney general was expressly instructed to follow written or other established policies of the department of justice as to the enforcement and potential prosecutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30468crs4 10 28 usc 592c 11 srept 97496 supra at 3 1415 12 srept 97496 supra at 15of particular offense10 that is one of the factors for the attorney general to consider in determining whether the matter warrants further investigation is the consideration of justice department policy concerning enforcement of the particular statute and prosecution of the conduct in question this consideration was added to the law in 1982 to deal expressly with the triggering of the special prosecutor provisions during the carter administration for allegations about certain presidential aides and social cocaine use which even if true would not normally have been prosecuted by the united states attorneys office exercising its prosecutorial discretion within the district in which the allegations arose11 the senate report on the matter explained in determin ing whether reasonable grounds exist the bill directs the attorney general to comply with the written or other established policies of the department of justice with respect to the enforcement of criminal laws the attorney general must justify his decision that special prosecutor should not be appointed upon showing to the court that the department of justice does not as matter of established practice prosecute the alleged violation of federal criminal law alternatively he may state to the court that it is the practice of us attorneys for the district in which the violation was alleged to have occurred not to prosecute this violation12 since in theory an independent counsel under the amended statute would not be appointed to investigate or prosecute matter regarding public official that would not also be treated in similar manner with respect to private citizen the drafters of the provision regarding attorneys fees believed that on only rare occasions should the subject of an independent counsel investigation be able to show under the but for standard that attorneys fees should be reimbursed by the government the provision was placed in the law however as safeguard in those rare instances when an independen t counsel investigation did occur even when similar investigation of private citizen in similar circumstances would not have gone forward as explained in the senate report in 1982 the changes s 2059 makes in the standards which trigger preliminary investigation and an appointment of special prosecutor are designed to ensure that covered officials will not be subjected to more rigorous application of the criminal law than is applied to other citizens thus the committee believes that reimbursement of attorneys fees would be warranted if at all in only rare instances this amendment is included however as safeguard to compensate officials in the event that they do incur extraordinary expenses during special prosecutor investigati on which eventually absolves them of any wrongdoing reimbursement may be warranted for example in instances where the special prosecutor duplicates actions which have been taken by the attorney general during the preliminary investigation

reimbursement should not become routine event13 when the independent counsel provisions of law were again reauthorized in 1987 there were concerns expressed that the allowance for attorneys fees was becoming too routine and overly costly the senate had proposed capping the fees payable to private attorneys to an hourly rate comparable to what government attorneys received14 this provision however was not accepted in conference and the attorneys fees allowance continued in the independent counsel provisions with clarification that such fees are limited to reasonable fees and that the justice department is to be notified and provided an opportunity to evaluate for the court any attorneys fees request15 the conference report again emphasized that congress had intended to allow the reimbursement of attorneys fees only when officials were subjected to harsher standards than ordinary citizens and thus incurred legal expenses they would not have incurred but for the provisions of the indepen dent counsel law16 the independent counsel provisions and the provision for reimbursement of attorneys fees were reauthorized for the last time in 199417 the attorneys fees provisions were again modified slightly at this time by providing for required notification by the court to the independent counsel as well as to the attorney general concerning subjects request for reimbursement of attorneys fees and by adding requirement for the independent counsel and the attorney general to provide written evaluation to the court of such request18 furthermore the specific criteria and factors for the independent counsel and the attorney general to consider and address in the evaluation of the attorneys fees request were set out in the law19 congress again in the legislative history of the revised attorneys fees provision emphasized that the court had been too generous and routine in awarding attorneys fees requests and reiterated that the attorneys fees provision should be construed narrowly since such an award is warranted if at all in only rare instances and should not become routine event20 although not willing to put such standard in the statutory language itself since it was stated in the conference report it is not necessary the conference report noted that attorneys fees should not be awarded in instances of independent counsel investigations of matters where were it not for the existence of the independent counsel statute the department of justice may wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30468crs6 21 hrept 103511 supra at 14 22 hrept 103511 supra at 1415have investigated these same matters21 in conference congress was also unwilling to place specific cap on what would be considered reasonable attorneys fees in an independent counsel investigation to be reimbursed but expressly criticized the court award of attorneys fees in the amount of 370 an hour the conference report explained that reasonableness should be construed not only in reference to what highpriced private attorneys could charge wealthy clients in private practice but also with respect to what attorneys are paid or reimbursed from tax dollars in other statutory contexts congres s did not intend that properly recoverable attorney fees under this statute be construed to be what the market will bear in the private sector rather congress intends that the reasonablene ss of attorney fee requests under the independent counsel law be judged not solely with reference to the rates commanded by expensive legal counsel but also with reference to what cost is reasonable for the taxpayers to bear three statutes provide the special court with the guidance it seeks in evaluating the reasonableness of attorney fees requested by defense counsel under the independent counsel statute first by law the independent counsel is compensated at the per diem rate equal to the annual rate of basic pay for level iv of the executive schedule which is currently approxim ately 55 per hour second the equal access to justice act public law 96481 which allows federal courts to award attorney fees to private parties in suits against the united states limits the amount of attorney fee recovery to 75 per hour unless special factor justifies higher fee 28 usc 2412d2a third fees to private defense counsel who are paid by the united states pursuant to the criminal justice act of 1984 public law 88455 to represent indigent defendants in federal criminal cases are currently limited to 60 per hour for time expended in court or before united states magistrate and 40 per hour for time reasonably expended out of court unless the judicial conference determines that higher rate of not in excess of 75 per hour is justified 18 usc 3006ad1 these three statutes identify hourly rates ranging from 40 to 75 per hour which congress has determined are reasonable and may be fully reimbursed with taxpayer dollars although by design the independent counsel law does not impose specific ceiling on the hourly rates payable to defense counsel hourly rates of 300 and 400 generally so far exceed other statutorily approved rates that they should not be fully recoverable under the independent counsel law while individuals remain free of course to employ any defense counsel they choose they should be on notice that the independent counsel law may not authorize payment of taxpayer dollars to reimburse fully all of the fees they incur22 judicial interpretations there has been substantial amount of litigation and judicial interpretation of the provision for reimbursement of attorneys fees under the

conduct comes within the scope of an investigation such that the individual could reasonably believe25 reasonably expect 26 or where there is realistic possibility27 that he or she would become criminal defendant or that an independent counsel might reasonably be expected to point the finger of accusation at him28 then such person may be considered subject of the independent counsel

the investigation an absence of such notification is not necessarily dispositive of the issue29 fees incurred during investigatio n reimbursable fees must have been incurred during an independent counsels investigation and thus could not be received for legal services rendered prior to the time the independ ent counsel was appointed30 nor for those services subsequent to the time that the independent counsel had filed his final report and the response to that final report had been submitted on behalf of the subject of the investigation31 while subject of an investigation could recover attorneys fees up to the time the independent counsel notified her that charges would not be sought against her thus indicating that she was longer subject of the investigation and then for the time

428 442 dccir1991 34 see 28 usc 592c1 requiring attorney general to follow department of justice guidelines and policy the court noted joining the reasonable grounds standard of the 1982 act with the departmental policy of probable cause as the standard that must be satisfied before considering whether to request or conduct further criminal investigation according to the latest interpretation of probable cause by the supreme court requires determination that reasonable grounds exist to believe that there is fair probability or substantial chance of criminal activity citations omitted the reasonable grounds cannot be based on mere association casual rumor speculation or mere suspicion in re meese supra 907 f2d at 1197 activities during the period between the notice that charges would not be sought and the beginning of the comment period32 but for requirement the most difficult showing in an attorneys fees request may be the requirement that the subject of the investigation requesting reimbursement demonstrate that he or she would not have incurred those attorneys fees but for the provisions of the independent counsel law the court has noted that the adoption of the reimbursement provision by congress was motivated by congressional intent to correct an unequal application of the criminal law when high public officials were investigated under the act in circumstances where private citizens would not be investigated33 the but for requirement may thus necessitate showing for example that the standards employed by the attorney general in requesting an independent counsel andor the decisions and the actions of an independent counsel resulted in the application of different criteria and standards of procedure proof or prosecutorial discretion than those normally applied by federal prosecutors in the department of justice concerning persons not covered by the independent counsel law such as private citizens or lower level government officials investigated for the same offense the court has found concerning the attorney generals request for or referral to an independent counsel for example that the but for provision was satisfied in independent counsel mckays investigation of former attorney general edwin meese since the standard in referring the matter to the already existing independent counsel by the attorney general did not meet the reasonable grounds standard of the statute or the probable cause standard for furthering criminal investigation normally followed in the department of justice with respect to criminal investigations of private citizens which policy was intended by congress to be observed and followed by the attorney general in deciding whether or not to apply for an independent counsel to further criminal investigation34 the court found that even good public policy reasons such as public confidence in the administration of justice or an appearance standard because of mr meeses past

found in in re segal 151 f3d 1085 1089 dccir1998 where the attorney general expressly noted that although the department of justice would in all likelihood exercise its discretion to decline to prosecute this case as criminal matter i am nonetheless compelled by the terms of the independent counsel act to apply for the appointment of an independent counsel all three reasons for reimbursement under the but for standard outlined in nofziger were found in the case of the clinton passport search regarding janet mullins in in re mullins mullins fee application 84 f3d 459 465 dccir1996 where the imminent expiration of the independent counsel law led to truncated preliminary investigation by the attorney general and duplication of an investigation by the state departmentrise to the level of reasonable grounds to investigate as there lacked any specificity of any information of criminal conduct on the part of mr meese35 in in re nofziger36 where the court denied the request for reimbursement of attorneys fees the court described the types of cases in which the reimbursement had been granted up until that time first the court has awarded fees in cases in which the subject is prejudiced by the department of justices failure to comply with the substantial protective features of the act see eg in re meese 907 f2d 1192 dccir 1990 second fees have been awarded because independent counsels investigation constituted substantial duplication of prior investigations see eg in re olson 884 f2d 1415 dccir 1989independent counsels investigatio n massively duplicated house judiciary committee and department of justice investigations third the court has awarded fees in two cases in which if the requirements of act restricting the attorney generals preliminary investigation did not exist 28 usc 592a2 the case could have been disposed of at an early stage of the investigation without seeking appointment of independent counsel see eg in re donovan 877 f2d 982 dccir attorney generals inability to subpoena the key witness to determine his credibility upon which the entire allegation rested resulted in appointment of independ ent counsel and subsequent fruitless investigation 37 cases subsequent to nofziger particularly the fee requests arising from various subjects of the irancontra investigation demonstrated that subjects of independent counsel investigations may also satisfy the but for requirement by showing that the independent counsel was pursuing theory of criminal law violation in their cases that would not normally be pursued by the department of justice or the united states attorneys in several of the in re north fee application cases the court noted that the but for requirement was met because the independent counsel was pursuing prosecutorial theory of conspiracy to circumvent the boland amendments whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30468crs10 38 teicher supra 48 f3d at 1270 dutton supra 11 f3d at 1080 in re north gadd

considered violation of criminal law38 in applying the but for test in this way in some of the fee application cases concerning the irancontra investigation however the court it has been argued seemed to diverge from past formulations of determining whether federal prosecutor would have pursued similar matter with respect to private citizens39 or to others not covered by the independent counsel law and instead specifically looked to determine if politically appointed attorney general as the representative of the executive would have subjected such attempts to criminal prosecution40 this seems to be different formulation of the but for requirement it may be argued because it appears to take into consideration certain political realities of justice department prosecutions of high level executive branch officials directed by the attorney general such as the political factors of loyalty to the president and the administration by politically appointed attorney general rather than merely considering the concept of the evenhanded application of the criminal laws reasonableness of fees the court will direct reimbursement only of reasonable attorneys fees which has meant reasonable both in the rates charged by attorneys and others such as paralegals and in the time that ones attorneys had expended on the various legal matters within the case41 all requests from subject seeking reimbursement must be adequately documented and detailed and the burden of proof to establish all of the elements of reasonableness is on the subject seeking reimbursement42 the rates that have been deemed reasonable in the past have taken into consideration whether they comport with the prevailing community standards for attorneys of similar experience and skill dealing with legal matter of comparable complexity and importance and the amount that the lawyers charge other clients in comparable matters43 as noted above in the legislative history of the attorneys fees provision however congress in the last reauthorization of the independent counsel law expressly criticized the award by the court of attorneys fees of 300 400 an hour and stated in the conference report that the court should compare the reasonableness of the rates not only to the highest price private counsels in the community but also compare the rates to what the government has agreed

private parties in other statutes allowing for reimbursement of attorneys fees44 despite this language in the legislative history the court in assessing the reasonableness of rates charged by attorneys in independent counsel investigations found that the language of the law had not been changed by congress in the 1994 reauthorization thus ignoring the suggestions in the legislative history and applying the same formulas and guidelines based on the skill experience and reputation of the private counsels employed by the subject and the comparable fees charged in the community and by those counsels to other clients45 in addition to weighing the reasonableness of the rates charged and the time spent on matters the court will look to the reasonableness of particular activity and its connection or necessity to the subjects legal defense against criminal charges the court has noted that reimbursement will only be made for attorneys fees rendered in asserting the merits of the subjects defense against the criminal charges being investigated46 certain expenses have thus been found not to be reimbursable as not reasonably related to ones legal defense such as media expenses of the attorneys representing the president47 the issue of necessity also arose in the questions concerning reimbursement for travel by attorneys where the court has found that the travel expenses of outoftown attorneys would not be approved unless the subject could show that comparable competent counsel could not have been retained locally48 while other expenses have been disapproved because they were for duplication of effort49 for legal maneuvers which the court did not deem reasonable50 or where billing times or other expenses claimed were not adequately detailed and documented51
