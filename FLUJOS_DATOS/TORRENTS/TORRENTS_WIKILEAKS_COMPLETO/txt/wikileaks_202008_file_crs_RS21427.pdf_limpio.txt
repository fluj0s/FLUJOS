consumer is given an opportunity to prevent disclosure ie opt out but it contains prohibition on sharing of customer information among affiliates it requires each financial institution to notify customers of its privacy policies and practices including those related to information sharing with affiliates4 fcra prescribes standards that address information collected by businesses that provide information used to determine eligibility of consumers for credit insurance or employment it imposes requirements for accuracy limits purposes for which such information may be disseminated allows certain rights for consumer access and includes civil and criminal penalties for its violation it generally defines consumer reports and limits the purposes and conditi ons under which consumer reports may be furnished by entities that it refers to and regulates as consumer reporting agencies5 apparently in response to concern that information sharing among affiliated companies might be interprete d as providing consumer repor ts thereby subjecting banks insurance companies and securities firms to all of the obligations imposed upon consumer reporting agencies under the fcra6 the fcra was amended by the consumer credit reporting reform act of 19967 under these amendments8 the fcras definition of consumer report was amended to exclude communi cation of transaction and

authorization for interaffiliate sharing of customer information14 the legislative histor shows congressional intent to establish national standard for interaffiliate sharing of information pertinent to the consumer credit industry in the interest of operational efficiency for industry and competitive prices for consumers in the credit reporting and credit granting

discrimination insurance law requirements the 2003 amendments require the agencies to conduct regular joint studies of information sharing pr actices of affiliated companies and make reports to the congress every three years with the first report due later than december 4 2006 glbas prohibitions deal only with sh aring of nonpublic personal information by financial institutions with nonaff iliated third parties there is direct authorization of sharing such information among affiliated financial institutions in essence therefore glba indirectly authorizes interaffiliate sharing of information by provision disavowing an intent to supercede the fcra16 it therefore preserves the conditions placed upon interaffiliate sharing of information in the fcra 1 that information other than experience or transacti on information may be shared only upon providing customers an opportunity to optout and 2 state laws may not preempt this preservation of the fcra runs counter to glbas gene ral preemption provision under which glba preempts state laws only to the extent that they provide less protection than glba17 whether or not state law provides more pr otection than glba and is not preempted however must be determined by the federal trade commission ftc18 generally state laws that pr ovide more protection than glba eg that require specific form of notice respecting an institutions privacy policy for example would not automatically be enforceable without an ftc determination as required under glba19 state laws since enactment of glba there has been considerable activity in state legislatures on financial privacy issues particularly in terms of making reference to the changes wrought by glba some states have laws that are more protective of consumer privacy the california fina ncial information privacy act of 200320 is one of these it is the subject of litigation21 at least six other states alaska22 connecticut23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21427crs5 21 continued transactions fact act by m maureen murphy 22 alaska stat 601028 generally requires cust omer consent for financial institution to disclose customer information with blanket ex ception or authorization for sharing information among affiliated companies although there is pe rmission for sharing with marketing partners 23 connecticut gen stat anno 36a41 to 36a44 require consent for

appear to permit interaffiliate sharing of customer information 28 see eg florida stat 6550592b amende d to that effect in 2001 this states that nothingin the financial privacy statute sh all prohibit financial institution from disclosing financial information as permitted by glbaillinois24 maryland25 north dakota26 and vermont27 have current laws that would require an optin or in some way hamper the sharing of customer information among affiliates none of these would of course operate to override the fcra authorization of interaffiliate information sharing in other states since glba there have been provisions enacted modifying stringent financial privacy laws to accommodate glba28 legislative issues although pl 108159 has reso lved various issues related to the consumer credit industry and to the probl em of identity theft there are other topics that may be confronted in future sessi ons of congress privacy advocates favor modifying glba to provide more protection for sensitive information i ndustry representatives are likely to be in favor of federal preemption under glba similar to that enacted for fcra so that there is prospect of having to comply with an array of state laws when information is shared with nonaffiliate d third parties in the 109th congress s 116 feinstein gene rally requires businesses to provide notice and an optout to consumer before selling or marketing personally identifiable information to affiliates affi rmative consent is in the case of nonaffiliated third parties it also includes prohibition and civil and criminal sanctions for the display sale or purchase of social security num bers without consent it so contains provisions aimed at curtailing the sale of individually identifiable health information and section on drivers
