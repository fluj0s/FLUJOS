the implementing partner caritas reasonable as surance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements however caritas could further enhance reporting on progress against indicators unhcr funds totalling us 11 million from repaid h ousing loans were still with the austrian integration fund aif extra efforts are needed to

loans to cofinance the construction of homes for refugees in austria these loans were administe red by the austrian integration fund aif managed by the ministry of interior moi of austri at present aif is legally longer part of the ministry of the interior although sen ior moi official chairs the interministerial managing board in which unhcr is also member the fund cannot use any of the repaid funds without prior unhcr consent as of 31 decembe r 2003 the amount accumulated at this savings account was euro 897000 us 11 mill ion proposal on the possible transfer 3 and use of the funds for refugee related projects utside austria was submitted by the representation to the bureau for europe in july 200 4 at the time of the audit action has been taken on this proposal 11 oios recommended that the unhcr represent ation in austria should make further efforts to allow using the accumulated amount for u nhcr activities outside austria and reach an agreement on the modalities of transfer of the accumulated amount to unhcr account outside of the fund for the eventual use by unhcr the unhcr representation stated that it was arranging for the remittance of the accumulated funds and subsequent annual repayments to hq subsequent to the audit the representative informed the bureau for europe of his intention to instruct the aif in writing to transfer the amount of euro 860000 to the global unhcr eur account the u nhcr treasury had been informed about this accordingly 12 during the followup of the issue with the bureau for europe in april 2005 oios learned that the amount had not yet been transferre d and certain questions were raised by treasury concerning the status of the agreement wit h the government therefore further consultations within unhcr are needed since the fu nds coming from outside of the unhcr accounting system would be treated as income decision should be taken by the financial resources service on how to record this t ransfer recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for europe together with the financial resources service and the division of ext ernal relations should determine the conditions and modal ities for the transfer of the fund balance of the austria n integration fund totalling some us 11 million and use of funds for the projects outside austria and commu nicate this position to the executive manager of the austr ian integration fund the unhcr treasury should decide on how to record this transfer rec 01 in its reply to the draft report the representatio n stated that implementation of recommendation 1 was ongoing and proceeding in coop eration between unhcr bureau for europe and unhcr treasury letter to the executiv manager of the aif regarding the remittance of the accumulated unhcr funds would be drafted in june 2005 pending the outcome of this matter oios keeps this recommendat ion open in its database amounts of outstanding loans on unhcr financial sta tements 13 information from the aif in austria showed that the loan balances as per the end of 2003 amounted to some us 08 million however 11 to the 2003 unhcr financial statements mentioned an amount of some us 41 mill ion as loans transferred to the refugee committee established with the austrian min istry of the interior clearly this reference was misleading as the related amount refl ected the situation as of 1988 when transaction was made for credit entry to zeroout the then loan balance in austria us 4105721 from the unhcr accounts 14 oios referred to the 2003 and 2004 board of auditors management letters which 4 confirmed this situation and their recommendation t hat the note should only list the outstanding loans still repayable to unhcr delete terminated loans from the accounts oios recommended that the financial resources servi ce clean the accounts accordingly and revise the relevant note to the financial statement s to list only loans still collectable by unhcr at present these are only the loans from ge rmany with an unpaid balance amounting to some us 780000 in 2003 the financial resources service agreed with the recommendation and confirmed that the note to the ccounts on the status of the refugee loans as at 31122004 had been revised accordingly fundraising activities 15 over the past years unhcr has witnessed chronic lack of funds due to the fact that it depends almost entirely on voluntary contributio ns austria while being the fourth richest country in the eu in terms of gdp per capita is n ot making comparable contribution to unhcr during the period of 1999 to 2003 it occupi ed 14 th place among eu countries ranking between greece and portugal its contribu tion in 2002 reached the lowest level in four preceding years and amounted to us 240000 i n 2003 it went up and reached us 720000 on the other hand unhcr expenditures in ustria including staff costs were us 16 for the same year 16 on 22 december 2003 the general assembly recommended in its resolutions a58503 and a58410 the implementation of the 30 per cent base level model based on hypothetical annual budget of us 1 billion 30 per cent of that budget was considered to be the minimum requirement for unhcr to maintain ske leton structure calculations for particular countries are based on the regular sc ale of assessment if the idea materialized the annual contribution for austria w ould amount to some us 28 million the representation in austria informed its counterparts in the foreign ministry of austria about these developments 17 at the same time we noted that in order t achieve the successful implementation of the model joint action plan had to be developed between the representation and drrms during the time of the audit such plan had not et been completed the former and present representatives in austria also planned to develop comprehensive fundraising strategy for austria we learned that such strategy has not ye t been developed 18 the representation commented that plans to work ou t more comprehensive strategy and actual plan in cooperation with drrms and be we re delayed though in 2004 since the austrian government counterparts went through pro cess of organizational restructuring not leading to the required consolidation before the d of the year the meeting between the europe bureau and drrms of 14 january 2005 laid the internal basis at hq for the preparations and the necessary information flow wh ich common and comprehensive fundraising strategy requires for its implementatio n and to produce results oios welcomes this preparatory process but is of the opinion that the goals set in order to develop the strategy and the action plan should be met recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in austria together with the bureau for europe and the division of external rela tions should complete the development of fundraising st rategy and joint action plan for the implementation of t he 30 5 per cent base level model for austria rec 02 in its reply to the draft audit report the represe ntation stated that the chief of drrms had visited austria in april 2005 and had hel d meetings with the ministry of foreign affairs the austrian development agency and austri an ngos draft funding strategy is already under discussion between the division of ex ternal relations the bureau for europe and the representation in austria and is expected t be finalized in june 2005 pending its finalization oios keeps this recommendation open i n its database project management 19 unhcr austria did not perform project fina ncial monitoring visits to caritas which
