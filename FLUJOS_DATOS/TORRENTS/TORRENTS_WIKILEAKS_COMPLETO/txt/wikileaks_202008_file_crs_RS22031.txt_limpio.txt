congress and the broader policy community over what is seen as inadequate planning mechanisms for stabilization and reconstruction operations lack of interagency coordination in carrying out such tasks and inappropriate capabilities for many of the nonmilitary tasks required effectively distributing resources among the various executive branch actors maintaining clear lines of authority and jurisdiction and balancing short and longterm objectives are major challenges for designing planning and conducting postconflict operations this report will not be updated the state departments creation in july 2004 of the office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs responded to increasing calls for the improvement of us civilian capabilities to plan and carry out postconflict operations these calls were reflected in several bills introduced in the 108th congress1 scrs is currently comprised of 37 officials from the state department and other us government agencies the coordinator ambassador carlos pascual has been given 1 these bills were the winning the peace act of 2003 hr 2616 introduced by rep sam farr on jun 26 2003 the stabilization and reconstruction civilian management act of 2004 known as the lugarbiden bill s 2127 introduced by senators lugar and biden on feb 25 2004 and its companion measure hr 3996 introduced by rep schiff on mar 18 2004 the international security enhancement act of 2004 hr 4185 introduced by rep dreier on apr 21 2004 and the united states assistance for civilians affected by conflict act of 2004 hr 4058 introduced by rep hyde on mar 30 2004 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 broad mandate to develop proposals for improving us government practices and structures for handling future postconflict operations including new civilian capabilities2 the term postconflict reconstruction and stabilization is broad but is usually understood to encompass tasks and missions to promote security and encourage stable democratic governance and economic growth following major hostilities in the past many of the stabilization activities were loosely labeled peacekeeping these include activities ranging from organizing humanitarian relief efforts monitoring and enforcing ceasefires and other arrangements designed to separate contending parties providing observers to monitor elections and establishing or recreating police or civil defense forces reconstruction involves repairing in some cases creating the infrastructure necessary to support longterm economic growth and development this infrastructure can be physical ie roads and schools or institutional ie legal and tax systems3 background postconflict operations are complex undertakings usually involving the participation of several united nations departments and system agencies the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22031 international financial institutions and plethora of nongovernmental humanitarian and development organizations as well as the military and other departments or ministries of the united states and other nations the united states developed its contributions to the earliest international peacekeeping operations of the 1990s on an ad hoc basis with little interagency planning and coordination and often with the us military in the lead the military was called upon to perform such missions not only for its extensive resources but also because other us government agency could match the militarys superior planning and organizational capabilities in addition because of its manpower the military carried out most of the us humanitarian and nationbuilding contribution even though some believed that civilians might be better suited to carry out such tasks especially those involving cooperation with humanitarian ngos during the 1990s many analysts began to perceive the need to improve and increase civilian contributions to peacekeeping operations especially for those activities related to planning and conducting operations and to establishing secure environment an important clinton administration initiative was the may 1997 presidential decision directive pdd 56 entitled the clinton administrations policy on managing complex contingency operations it sought to address interagency planning and coordination problems through new planning and implementing mechanisms due to what some analysts describe as internal bureaucratic resistance pdd 56s provisions were never formally implemented although some of its practices were informally adopted the administration also attempted to remedy the shortage of one critical nationbuilding tool international civilian police forces through pdd 71 strengthening criminal justice 2 scrs activities are to be prospective dealing with new situations and crises they will not include iraq and afghanistan 3 for additional background on various aspects of postconflict reconstruction and assistance see crs issue

postconflict aid oversight issues for congress by martin weiss archived available from author 75407 crs3 systems in support of peace operations which while never implemented by the clinton administration has been partially put into force by the bush administration4 improvements in the provision of social and economic assistance are also viewed as crucial to successful outcomes postconflict populations need safety net and poverty alleviation programs as well as technical assistance and advice on monetary and fiscal policy and debt management in order to create an environment conducive to democratization and economic growth5 while the popular image of us postconflict assistance is the postworld war ii marshall plan through which the united states provided the foreign assistance needed for europes postconflict reconstruction multilateral institutions became increasingly important during the 1990s when small regional conflicts proliferated following the collapse of the soviet union international organizations such as the world bank and the international monetary fund now play crucial roles working with the us government to provide economic assistance and technical advice on rebuilding postconflict economies nevertheless although the united states has provided some funding for economic reconstruction multilaterally for the recent afghanistan and iraq operations most us funding for postconflict operations is provided bilaterally many analysts now judge that multilateral assistance is more httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22031 effective for the recipient country than bilateral aid for two reasons6 first disbursing funds multilaterally through agencies or international organizations gives greater assurance that it will reach recipients than providing aid bilaterally with direct payments to individual governments or nongovernmental organizations ngos in addition analysts find that bilateral aid is more likely to be apportioned according to the donors foreign policy priorities rather than the economic needs of the recipient country7 for many analysts and policymakers the ongoing iraq operation illustrates us government need for new planning and coordination arrangements that would provide leadership role for civilians in postconflict phases of military operations and new civilian capabilities to augment and relieve the military as soon as possible and greater international coordination the perception of continuing need for such operations and the perceived inefficiencies of the still largely ad hoc us responses have reinvigorated calls for planning and coordination reform the bush administrations reluctance to use military forces for nationbuilding tasks and the extreme stresses placed on the military by combat roles in iraq and afghanistan have pushed those calls in new direction to the development of adequate civilian capabilities to perform those tasks 4 see crs report rl32321 policing in peacekeeping and related

international terrorism can exploit weak unstable states has convinced many policymakers of the need to strengthen us and international capabilities to foster security good governance and economic development especially in postconflict situations most recently the 911 commission and the commission on weak states and us national security8 have judged weak states as well as unsuccessful postconflict transitions to pose threat to us security such states often experience economic strife and political instability that make them vulnerable to drug trafficking human trafficking and other criminal enterprises and to linkage with nonstate terrorist groups such as the links between the previous taliban government in afghanistan and the qaeda terrorist network weak states also are unprepared to handle major public health issues such as hivaids that can generate political and economic instability9 these commissions argued for assistance to the governments of weak states and of postconflict transitions regimes to help them control their territories meet their citizens basic needs and create legitimate governments based on effective transparent institutions these and other studies recognize need to enhance us government structures and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22031 capabilities for conducting postconflict operations10 although differing in several respects the studies largely agree on five points 1 the current ad hoc system needs to be replaced with permanent mechanism for developing contingency plans and procedures for joint civilmilitary operations led by civilians 2 mechanisms to rapidly deploy us civilian government and governmentcontracted personnel need to be put in place 3 preventive action needs to be considered 4 the us government needs to enhance multinational capabilities to carry out postconflict security tasks and to better coordinate international aid and 5 flexible funding arrangements are needed to deal with such situations major differences concern the placement of permanent planning and coordinating structure the emphasis given to rule of law ie police judicial and penal personnel vs economicreconstruction aid and the attention paid to preventive measures scrs current mission and activities congress endorsed the creation of scrs in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 hr 4818 pl 108447 section 408

the first need for readilydeployable crisis response mechanism stated above these are 1 to catalogue and monitor the nonmilitary resources and capabilities of executive branch agencies state and local governments and private and nonprofit organizations that are available to address crises in countries or regions that are in or are in transition from conflict or civil strife 2 to determine the appropriate nonmilitary us response to those crises including but not limited to demobilization policy human rights monitoring and public information efforts 3 to plan that response 4 to coordinate the development of interagency contingency plans for that response and 5 to coordinate the training of civilian personnel to perform stabilization and reconstruction activities in response to crises in such countries or regions the sixth is to monitor political and economic instability worldwide to anticipate the need for us and international assistance the office is developing proposals on how to enable the us government to more effectively respond to crises and carry out all these activities two of the proposals concern the development of more integrated and coherent groups of personnel to respond to crises the first would create response readiness corps of existing and additional us government personnel which would facilitate the transition from military to civilian httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22031 leadership on the ground and to manage more effectively civilian resources in the post conflict environment it would be comprised of three units 1 diplomatic response group to establish diplomatic operations in crisis response efforts to participate in peace negotiations and to develop relationships with transitional governments and liaise with international organizations 2 technical group to design and manage transitional security and governance programs and 3 an advance civilian team of staff from scrs and from diplomatic and technical groups to deploy with military forces at the beginning of an intervention in order to assume stabilization responsibilities freeing up military personnel for other tasks scrs has also begun to work with the joint forces command on feasibility study for civilian response corps to assess possible options for the development of reserve of retired government personnel and personnel from state and local governments private forprofit companies and nonprofit ngoss to carry out rule of law and reconstruction activities scrs has already begun instituting mechanisms to carry out some of its responsibilities to monitor potential crises scrs has asked the national intelligence council nic to provide it twice year with list of weak states most susceptible to crisis and is to choose one or more of them as test cases to prepare contingency plans for possible interventions it is also working with the usaid office of conflict management and mitigation which is developing techniques for assessing conflicts that will provide high level of detail about conflict or impending conflict to better plan and carry out response efforts scrs is developing system to collect analyze and transmit lessons learned to address the need for greater interagency particularly civilmilitary planning and coordination scrs is working with the military to develop among other things civilianmilitary training exercises for stabilization and reconstruction operations and common template for civilmilitary stabilization and reconstruction planning in two related areas necessary to carrying out congress mandates scrs has also taken role first it has begun to develop ties with other international participants to coordinate and enhance civilian capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction activities scrs also is seeking to help state department regional bureaus which have the lead on preventive activities to develop concepts and proposals for preventive action crs6 major issues for congress funding for stabilization and reconstruction operations would us foreign policy interests benefit from flexible funding mechanism for crisis responses and what are the oversight consequences the bush administration is likely to again ask congress to provide new flexible funding mechanism to respond rapidly to developing crises the 108th congress turned down repeated requests for 100 million for an emergency fund for complex foreign crisesin foreign operations appropriations in conference on the fy2005 omnibus appropriations bill hr 4818 congress deleted senate foreign operations appropriations provision that would have created state department crisis response fund with 20 million of noyear money11 interagency planning and coordinating structures would the creation of new government arrangements or entities enhance the united states ability to plan and coordinate such activities congress would have to approve any major restructuring of us government agencies as well as any possible authorities necessary to carry out new or reorganized functions proposals differ as to which functions belong in the national security council and which would be better served by placement in the department of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22031 state in the 108th congress representative dreier bill hr 4185 would have created an undersecretary of state for overseas contingencies and stabilization position competing priorities and resource allocations since postconflict assistance encompasses both shortterm stabilization and longterm reconstruction there is great potential for disputes over resource allocation priorities among the questions are would investment in preventative activities be successful in averting civil conflicts that might later require costly interventions what is the optimal distribution of responsibility between civilian and military actors for establishing immediate security and conditions for growth in postconflict environment and what resources are required how can policymakers be assured that resources are distributed effectively what are the appropriate us civilian capabilities needed to undertake the security and economic challenges and how can funding be best allocated to optimize training and responsiveness to what extent can international capabilities replace or augment us resources 11 the lugarbiden legislation s 2127 and hr 3996 proposed rotating account for stabilization and reconstruction activities funded at 100 million with an authorization for replenishment as needed this mechanism appears similar in concept to the emergency refugee and migration assistance or erma emergency relief account this proposal also would have provided the president with authority to transfer money among foreign operations accounts without regard to funding limits the dreier legislation hr 4185 proposed the creation of such an account with noyear money but with automatic replenishment or transfer authority
