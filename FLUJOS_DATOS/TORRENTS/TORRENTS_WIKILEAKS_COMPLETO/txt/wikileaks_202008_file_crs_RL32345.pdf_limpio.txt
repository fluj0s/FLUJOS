implemented designation be gins process in which the areas must adopt emission control programs sufficient to bring air quality into compliance deadlines will vary depending on the severity of the measured pollution areas failing to adopt adequate plans or failing to demonstrate that their highway and transit construction programs conform to approve d emission budgets are subject to sanctions including possible lapse in the provisi on of federal highway funds while much attention has been placed on the challenges that new nonattainment areas will face in implementing the new ozone standard less atte ntion has been paid to the impact of the new standard on areas not yet in attainment of the old 1hour ozone standard many of these areas esp ecially the most severely polluted appear likely to be given as many as 16 additi onal years to reach attainment under epas implementation plan in the many explan ations of epas new tougher standards this apparent relaxation of the acts requirements for the most severely polluted areas has gone largely unnoticed this report which will be updated as developments warrant provides information on the designation process for nonattainment areas describes epas implementation plan and discusses issues that have been raised as epa the states and potential nonattainment ar eas develop implementation strategies these issues include how the boundaries of nonattainment areas should be set how areas can improve air quality sufficiently to attain the standard what the timelines will be for attainment whether areas affected by upwind pollution can be granted extra time to comply what grants might be available to assist areas in reaching attainment and whether designation will have negative impact on economic activity in the affected areas in response to some of these concer ns congress is considering legislation that might alter the implementation process the courts may also be asked to review whether the agencys

ozone air quality standard1 this standard and separate sta ndard for fine particulates was promulgated by epa in 1997 but because of court challenges and other delays is just now being implemented designation be gins process in which the nonattainment areas must adopt emission control programs sufficient to bring air quality into attainment by an epa deadline some of the areas being designated have not previously been considered nonattainment for ozone or for any other ep air quality standard this has raised numerous questions about the process in these areas including when and why the standard was established what criteri are used to determine nonattainment how boundaries of the nonattainment area are blished whether sp ecial provisions can be made for areas affected by pollution from upwind what the deadline will be for reaching attainment what grants might be available to assist areas in reaching attainment and how designation might affect economic development and transportation investments in an area how areas already designated nonattainment for epas existing 1hour ozone standard w ill be affected by imp lementation of the new standard presents additional questions this report attempts to answer these stions and provides links to sources of additional information it also discusses legislation introduced in this congress that would alter the implementation process national ambient air quality standards under the clean air act epa has set national ambient air quality standards naaqs for six pollutants ozone partic ulate matter pm carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrogen dioxide and lead th standards for these pollutants are health based the statute requires that epa set them at levels necessary to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety based on review of the scientific literature httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32345crs2 2 american lung association v epa 102cv02239 ddc entered november 13 2002 3 us epa office of

less frequently in practice the agency reviews the latest scientific studies and either reaffirms or modifies the standards the most recent changes strengthening of the ozone and pm standards were promul gated in 1997 due to legal ch allenges and other delays the new standards have not yet been imp lemented but in november 2002 consent decree epa committed to designating oz one nonattainment areas by april 15 20042 the new ozone standard why theres standard ozone is lung irritant prolonged exposure to it can make people more susceptible to respiratory infection result in lung inflammation and aggravate preexisting respiratory diseases such as asthma3 according to epa chest pain cough pr emature aging of the lungs and chronic respiratory illnesses are othe r potential effects studies conducted in the northeastern united states and canada indicate that oz one air pollution is associated with 1020 percent of all summertime respiratoryrelated hospital admissions4 the latest revision epa established standa rd for shortterm 1hour concentrations of ozone in the early 1970s nd relaxed the standard but retained the 1hour format in 1979 in recent years however research has indicated that readings below ie in compliance with the 1979 standard produced symptoms in moderately exercising adults especially over longer periods of exposure thus in 1997 after reviewing 190 scientif ic studies the agency re vised the standard again the new standard is more stringent 008 parts per million vs the previous 012 but for reasons explained below it averages the ozone concentrations measured over 8 hours rather than 1 hour determining compliance the method of determining compliance or attainment was also modified in the late st revision under the 1hour standard areas were allowed three exceedances of the st andard in 3year period the fourth highest measurement in the 3year period termed the design value by epa determined whether an area was in attainment this method of determining attainment struck some as arbitrary and potentially unrepresentative of prevailing vels of pollution particularly in areas that were close to attaining the standard ozone forms in the atmosphere when volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides react in the presence of heat and sunlight thus the concentrations of pollution are affected not only by emissions but also by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32345crs3 5 the agency also identified 11 factors that stat or tribes could use to justify larger or smaller nonattainment area boundaries see boundary guidance on air

threeexceedance method single heat wave in threeyear period could produce design values exceeding the standard under the new 8hour standard an area av erages the fourth highest reading for each of the three years to determine whether the area is in attainment the longer averaging time and the averaging of three ears data reduce the influence of unusual meteorological conditions in any give n year making the design value more accurately reflect recurring pollution levels determining the boundaries of nonattainment areas the clean air act establishes process for designating nonattainment areas and setting their boundaries but it allows the epa administrator some discretion in determining what the final boundaries of th areas will be in section 107d1a 42 usc 7407 the statute states that g overnors shall submit list to epa of all areas in the state designating as nona ttainment any area that does not meet or that contributes to ambient air quality in nearby area that does not meet an air quality standard emphasis added following governors submission th epa administrator has discretion to make modifications including to the area boundaries the agency has generally used this discretion to expand the size of nonattainment areas or to combine areas that state listed as separate areas into single larger unit in several cases for example epa has combined nonattainment counties across state lines into the same nonattainment area if the coun ties are part of the same metropolitan area the states are to be notified of any proposed m odifications and given an opportunity to demonstrate why proposed modificati on is inappropriate but the final determination rests with epa the act is not specific in requiring th at neighboring counties be combined in the same nonattainment area but it does require the use of metropolitan statistical area boundaries in the more severely polluted areas section 107d4aiv echoing this requirement epa recommended that metropolitan statistical areas or consolidated metropolitan statistical areas serve as the presumptive boundary for ozone nonattainment areas under the 8hour standard5 as result metropolitan areas are generally treated as units even where part of the area lies in separate state or where part of the area does not have readings exceeding the standard in the latter case even though specifi c county may not exceed the standard the pollution generated there is likely to influence ozone readings elsewhere in the metropolitanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32345crs4 6 the subpart 1 provisions are f ound in

in the nonattaining c ounties the agency included 474 counties in all in the 124 nonattainment areas more information on the specific areas including lists of the counties is at httpwwwepagovozonedesignations timelines for reaching attainment as indicated in table 1 the ultimate d eadline for attaining the 8hour standard can vary widely from 2007 to 2021 depending on the severity of pollution in the nonattainment area and its status under the old 1hour standard roughly twothirds of the areas 82 of 124 were considered attainment under the ol d standard and are governed by sections of the clean air act referred to as subpart 16 these areas are labeled basic in epa s nonattainment area charts most of these areas face deadline of 5 years after designation j une 2009 with possible extension to 2014 if the area would have difficulty atta ining the standard in five years some of the areas volunteered for epa s early action compact program which is described below on page 10 these areas signed enforceable agreements to meet the standard by december 2007 in return fo r flexibility regarding specific regulatory requirements if they fail to meet the standard by that

final rule to implement the 8hour ozone national ambient air quality standard phase 1 p 118 available at h ttp wwwepagovozonedesign ationsfinalrulepdf the rule had continuedthe other 42 areas not designated as bas ic are mostly areas that are currently nonattainment under the 1hour st andard in addition to the new 8hour standard the agency expects to revoke the 1hour standa rd one year after implementing the new standard but as result of 2001 supreme court decision8 it is required to adapt the detailed statutory requireme nts of subpart 2 of the act to these areas9 in subpart 2 congress established sepa rate deadlines and specific control requirements for five categories of 1hour ozone nonattainment areas depending on the degree to which they exceeded the standard ie their design value the five groups were referred to as marginal mode rate serious severe and extreme and they were given attainment deadlines that ranged from 3 years to 20 years after the date of enactment10 epa will use these terms to cat egorize the 8hour areas that are also currently in nonattainment of the 1hour standard with deadlines stretching from 3 years to 17 years after designation thes areas initially have been given deadlines of 2007 2010 2013 or 2021 depending on their desi gn value over the years those that fail to attain the standard by their deadline will be bumped up to the next category with an extension of their deadline thus ultimately all these areas can be given until 2021 to reach attainment the net effect of this will be that areas that currently have deadlines ranging from 20052010 under the 1hour standard may eventually be allowed until 2021 to attain the new standard for exampl washington dc was recently designated as severe ozone nonattainme nt area under the 1hour sta ndard with an attainment deadline of 2005 under the 8hour standar d it has been redesignated as moderate with 2010 attainment deadline if the area does not attain the sta ndard by that date it would presumably be bumped up into th serious category with 2013 deadline or eventually into the severe category with 2019 or 2021 deadlines few additional requirements would be mandated by the statute in connection with these deadline extensions as the area is already subject to most of the requirements for severe areas now and would remain so unde r epas implementation plan11

attainment unde r the new standard in the many explanations of epas new t ougher standard this apparent relaxation of the acts requirements for the most severely polluted areas has gone largely unnoticed demonstrating attainment th state implementation plan the main requirement that follows desi gnation of an area as nonattainment is for the area to develop state implementation plan sip that demonstrates how it will reach attainment the sip sets fort h pollution control measures that will be implemented by federal state and local governments it re lies on models of the impact on air quality of projected emission reductions to demonstrate attainment to be approved sip must demonstrate that the area will reach attainment of the standard by its deadline epa has concluded that in the majority of cases atta inment will be reached as the result of new federal sta ndards on cars light trucks and heavy duty diesel engines that are scheduled to be implemented between 2004 and 2010 and by controls on coalfired electri c power plants the nox sip call and the proposed interstate air quality rule to be imp lemented between 2004 and 2015 without any additional local controls13 of 297 monitored counties that exceeded the 8hour standard in 2002 only 35 would remain in nonattainment after implementation of these federal regulations according to epa14 in reality however all areas will require some local controls because of the requirements of the statute in addition to submitting sip each of the areas will be required to conduct an emi ssions inventory and must meet three regulatory requirements 1 impose reasonably av ailable control technology ract on major stationary sources of pollution 2 require new stationary sources to offset their emissions by arranging for the reducti on of equivalent or greater emissions at existing sources and 3 demonstrate that any new highway or transit projects conform to the emissions budget used in their state implementation plan15 these measures are described in more detail below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32345crs7 the number of areas requiring local cont rols may also be higher than epas projections would suggest because of mismatch between the nonattainment area deadlines and the timetable for implementation of the interstate air quality rule iaqr the iaqr as proposed by ep in january 2004 would be implemented in two phases with deadlines of 2010 nd 2015 the subpart 1 nonattainment areas however must demonstrate attainment by 2009 or 2014 the upshot is that reductions achieved under iaqr may not be useable in demons trating attainment this has led some to argue that epa shoul d modify the iaqr d eadlines to ease local areas task of demonstrating attainment nonattainment areas unable to demonstrat attainment through federal measures and the three basic requirements alone can adopt wide range of local measures to reduce emissions the most common affect motor vehicles fuels stationary sources of pollution and consumer products regarding motor vehicles for example most current nonattainment areas have adopted what are called inspection and maintenance programs these programs require owners to bring their vehicles to testing facilities or local garages for emissions tests and to repair the emission control system or engine if the vehicle fails many areas also require that gasoline sold in the area be cleaner burning reformulated gasoline and that gas stations install equipment to capture evaporative emissions from refueling stationary sources industrial and comme rcial facilities will be subject as noted earlier to reasonably available c ontrol technology in nonattainment areas depending on the severity of an ozone nonattainment area s pollution ract is required at sources that emit more than 10 25 50 or 100 tons of pollution per year new stationary sources are also required to offset their emissions by arranging for the reduction of equivalent or greater emissions at existing sources again depending on the severity of an areas pollution the required offset may be as low as 1 ton for each new ton of pollution emitted or as high as 13 tons for each new ton of pollution in extreme cases consumer products such as lawn and garden equipment paint gasoline storage cans air fresheners nd personal care products may be subject to regulation in nonattainment ar eas many of these products are sources of volatile organic compounds which combine with nitrogen oxides to form ozone in the atmosphere areas affected by upwind pollution one of the more frequent issues raised in nonattainment areas is whether any special consideration can be given to areas whose air quality is adversely affected by pollution from upwind areas in recent years epa has attempted to extend the deadlines for attainment in at least seve n such areas all of them regulated under subpart 2 but its attempts to do so have been overturned by court decisions in three separate circuits the cases involved st louis washington dc and beaumont port arthur texas as result the agen cy is unable to provide deadline extensionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32345crs8 16 number of such petitions have been filed with the agency the most wellknown are those that were filed in august 1997 by 8 nor theastern states 4 of which were granted by the agency in january 2000 for additional information on these see crs report 98236 air quality epas ozone transport rule otag and section 126 petitions hazy situation 17 the nox sip call requires electric utilities in 22 eastern states and the district of

crs report rl32106 transportation conformity under the clean ai r act in need of reformunder subpart 2 except when it bumps an area into more severe category and imposes additional polluti on control requirements subpart 1 of the act is more flexible however under its provisions epa may classify the area for the purpose of applying an attainment date and may consider such factors as the availability and f easibility of pollution control measures in doing so this language might give the administrator sufficient authority to allow an extra 5 years to reach attainment unde r subpart 1 in areas affected by upwind pollution areas classified under either subpart ma also petition the agency under section 126 of the act to impose controls on upwind sources that significantly contribute to their nonattainment of the standard16 the agency has also recently imposed additional controls on sources of nitrog oxides which contribute to ozone formation downwind through its nox sip call17 and has proposed additional nox controls in its interstate air quality rule and regional haze rule18 economic impacts of nonattainment designation another concern over nonattain ment designation is that it will have negative impact on an areas economic development potential economic impacts are among the most frequently voiced concerns raised by local business and political leaders nonattainment design ation does add require ments that make investment in an area more complicated as noted earlier it requires major sources of pollution generally those that emit more than 100 t ons per year of volatile organic compounds to offset their pollution by equivalent or greater emission reductions from existing sources when obtaining permits to operate new or modified facilities and it requires highway and transit planners to demonstr ate that new projects conform to the areas state implementation plan19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32345crs9 20 this phrase was used by the epa administrator mike leavitt in january 9 2004 speech to the edison electric institute but the administrator subsequently reversed his position in speech april 14 he said did nonattainment designation mean that we couldnt grow our economy or build highways n did it mean we had to have plan and take action to clean our air yes for the full speech see httpyosemiteepagovadminis tratorspeeches nsfb1ab9f485b098972852562e70

standstill order on growth however as has frequently been charged20 recent epa analysis found th at 65 million jobs were created in ozone nonattainment areas from 1990 to 1998 and that over 55 percent of ozone nonattainment areas had average annual empl oyment growth rates greater than that of their region of the country pers onal income growth in nonattainment areas essentially matche d the national average between 1990 and 1998 according to the agency 385 vs 38921 grants for nonattainment areas epa does not have grant program desi gned to assist nonattainment areas although it does provide grants to state ai r pollution agencies in support of their programs but many nonattainment ar eas have benefitte d from program administered by the department of transportation the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq cmaqs purpose is to reduce emissions from highway travel as means of assisting states in complying with the national ambient air quality standards fo r ozone carbon monoxide and particulate matter cmaq is funded by the highway trus t fund out of which congress has authorized 81 billion to the states over the last 6 years fy1998 fy2003 projects eligible for funding include 1 mass transit 2 traffi c flow improvements 3 rideshare programs 4 traffic dema nd management programs 5 bicycle and pedestrian projects 6 public education 7 vehicle inspec tion and maintenance programs and 8 conversion of vehicles to burn alternative fuels according to the federal highway administration 44 of total cmaq funds ve been obligated for mass transit projects since the programs inception in fy1992 cmaq funds are distributed based on formula that takes into account population and severity of pollution in addition each state is guaranteed 05 of the total even if it has nonattainment ar eas the formula cu rrently in use which was established by statute determines the severity of ozone pollution by using the areas categorization under th 1hour ozone standard because basic areas are not part of the old categorization scheme there is currently not factor in the funding fo rmula to provide cmaq funds for the new ozone nona ttainment areas providing funds to these areas would require amendments to the authorizing legislati on the surface transportation bill passed byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32345crs10 the senate s 1072 would amend the f unding formula to include 8hour ozone nonattainment areas as well as areas to be designated nonattainment for new fine particulate standard the bill passed by the house hr 3550 would not do so the senate bill would also provide s ubstantial increase in cmaq funding to 134 billion over the 6 years fy2004fy2009 53 billion 65 increase above the previous authorization the house bill would provide smaller increase to 94 billion 16 both bills would expand the types of projects eligible for assistance although in different ways other legislative and regulatory actions concern over the potential impacts of the new ozone and par ticulate standards has led to several attempts to modify the implementation requirements legislative attempts have generally been attached to larger pieces of legislation and with the exception of an amendment clarifying the schedule for implementation in the late 1990s have not been enacted section 1443 of the energy bill hr 6 for example would extend attainment deadlines in areas affected by upwind pollution to the date on which the last reductions in pollution necessary for atta inment in the downwind area are required to be achieved in the upwind area section 970 of the bill would require demonstration project to address the effect of transported ozone and ozone precursors on air quality in southwestern michigan and would prohibit epa from imposing any requirements or sanctions during the two years pending the projects completion the conference report on hr 6 passed the house november 18 2003 the senate began debate on it november 19 but cloture vote on november 21 failed to achieve the 60 votes necessary to end debate on the bill leaving its future uncertain the administration has proposed an add itional modification of the requirements for areas not meeting the new ozone and fine particle standards in its clear skies bill hr 999 s 485 in section 3 clear skie s would allow epa to avoid designating 8hour ozone and pm25 areas as nonattainment til 2016 provided that the area demonstrates that it will attain the st andards by december 31 2015 areas fitting into this new transitional category could avoi d additional regulatory controls including the requirement to demonstrate conformity if they could demonstrate that attainment would be achieved through the imposition of federal controls on utilities diesel engines automobiles and other sources action has been taken on this bill epa has also modified the implementa tion requirements for number of areas in response to an initiative from the st ate of texas in 2002 epa approved protocol suggested by the state unde r which areas can avoid most ozone nonattainment area requirements incl uding transportation conformity until december 31 2007 if they voluntarily commit to enforceable early action compacts with their state and epa the protocol sets out number of milestones that areas must meet to qualify thirty areas mostly in the southeastern

identified as eligible for the program on april 15 200422 conclusion the 8hour ozone standard will affect numerous areas that have not previously been designated nonattainment for nati onal ambient air quality standard this has raised concern in these areas regarding the potential impacts and triggered numerous questions regarding the speci fics of the implementation process in many perhaps majority of cas it appears that new nonattainment areas will have little difficulty demonstrating attainment epa projects that federal measures such as new auto and truck emission standards and controls on power plants will be sufficient to demonstrate attainment in 88 of monitored nonattainment counties by 2015 in areas currently designated nonattain ment under the 1hour ozone standard the principal effect of the new standard is likely to be more time to reach attainment as many as 16 years more in some cases for officials facing deadlines under the old standard as early as 2005 this may be welcome news in any event the implementation plan like most epa rules may be challenged in the courts the agencys first attempt at an implementation plan was among the issues remanded by the supreme court in 2001 decision that addressed number of issues related to the tting of the 8hour standard23 it would not be surprising if interested parties returned to the courts in the months ahead as the agency attempts to implement new version of its implementation plan thus we may not know the final form of implementation or its effects for some time
