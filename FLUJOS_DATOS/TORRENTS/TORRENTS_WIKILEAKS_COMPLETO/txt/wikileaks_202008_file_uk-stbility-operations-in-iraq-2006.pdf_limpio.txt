on telic has posed complex challenges to the armies of the coalition in iraq the comple xity comes from the need to deter and if necessary fight armed groups opposed to our presence as well as to help enable and sometimes lead the humanitarian re construction and nationbuilding activities in support of distinctly frag ile or nonexistent gov ernance structures there is every sign that the british army will bec ome engaged in similar complex operations in other theatres and some broad similarities are already apparent in operations in sout hern afghanistan the style of asymmetric conflict in failing or fr agile states is also now available for global troublemakers to copy it cannot be disinvented and is likely to be with us for some time moreover our enemies are analysi ng our strengths and weaknesses as an army in order to achieve their ends the analysis of operation teli c in the period may 2003 to 31 january 2005 when the first iraqi elections were held offers number of insights for study and action there are positive comments notably about service people work is needed however on cross government campaign planning the compr ehensive approach and its execution including funding and ssr on optimising the armys counter insurgency response including its intelligence and gistic capability and on developi ng our training to ensure that we are fit for all three bl ocks of the threeblock war this analysis is not intended as campaign hist ory but it pays tribute to the contributions of the very many british serv icemen and women who served in iraq during this period and to those who gave their lives or who were injured in the cour of this demanding operation we must learn from the insights in this analysi s always remembering that as with doctrine judgement is needed in t he application of lessons from one campaign to what may be very different situation in another place at another time restricted iii restricted preface introduction 1 the army doctrine committee commissioned an internal army analysis of the period following the major combat operations phase of op telic known variously as phase iv or from the british troop roulement op telic 25 which ran from may 2003 to 31 january 2005 the date of the first iraqi elections th is analysis is int ended to complement publication of operations in iraq an analysis from land perspective which covered the warfighting operations1 aim 2 the aim of the op telic 25 analysis is to provide the chief of the general staff with an evidencebased thematic analysis of land operations in iraq from may 2003 to january 2005 reading guide 3 this analysis comprises the main report known as theme zero during the production of the report this includes 38 insights which will be of relevance to senior commanders and head office planners b the supporting themes one to ten these summarise the detailed data submitted to the analysis team themes ne to ten includes further 42 insights which will be of relevance to staffs working on specific issues 4 insights fall into three broad categories and relate to what the army is able to influence the first category of insight compri ses observations which officers may wish to pass on in the planni ng and execution phases of an expeditionary operation related to complex crisis like that in iraq b secondly there are some specific lessons for t he army for example the need for commanders and their soldiers to underst and the complexities of the law in stability operations in gr eater detail than before c the third category comprises questions or issues which may lead to work on future concepts combat development and experimentation doctrine work and in turn structure equipment and training these run in parallel to the 2005 future army study period insights

5 the complexity of the situation in ir aq suggested that them atic approach would be the best basis for the analysis small director general doct rine and development analysis team chose ten them relating to predominantly army issues which they felt should be examined with view to developing litary effectiveness the analysis does touch on some joint issues and the roles of other government departments some joint aspects eg effects based operations medi and air support have been commented on elsewhere and have not been covered in this report it was decided that observations from the iraq survey group report should be included since ad hoc international teams which include british military elements may we ll be formed at short notice in the future 6 the team recognised that valuable oper ational lessons work had already been done by doc in the joint arena and by the land warfare centre lwc the arms and service directors and others2 the army however published army doctrine publication adp land operations3 in spring 2005 and discussed variou s scenarios during the future army study period in september 2005 the themat ic approach draws on both these sources and should inform future concepts co mbat development and doctrine 7 army policy branches were invited to produce submissions on their areas of expertise where necessary suitabl lead branches had to be found4 in parallel evidence was also drawn from formation postoperati onal reports and from over 40 posttour interviews with key officers from formation vel to subunit commanders and some staff officers parliamentary reports journal arti cles and views from commentators outside the army have also been considered the themes were subject to internal and external review before consideration by just m reference group in january 20065 the analysis was discussed by the army doctri ne committee on 28 february 2006 8 most of the analysis in the report is based on current military assumptions and long standing principles for the us of force in t he land environment so distinguished commentators and academics including some re tired senior officers are now widening the public debate about t he use of force in the contem porary operating environment and their arguments have implications for the armys approach its equipment and training this analysis is designed to inform debate regardi ng size shape and balance of investment decisions for intervention forces in the longer term timeframe as well as to suggest areas for change which will enhance effectiveness in ca mpaigns now and in the immediate future 9 the op telic 25 analysis team would li ke to thank the subj ect matter experts and branches who produced submissi ons on top of their normal busy schedules we are also most grateful

may 2003 january 2005 from land perspective the main report theme zero introduction 1 the british formations battlegroups and supporting elements operating with the coalition in iraq have achieved consider able amount of tactical success despite demanding climatic conditions and complex and dangerous threat environment senior officers and staff officers in coaliti on headquarters in baghdad and detachments elsewhere have also influenced the campaign pos itively during op telic 25 the uk contribution to the coalition was however relatively sma ll only around 5 of the troops and much smaller proportion of the reconstr uction finance were fr om great britain 2 the vast majority of the c80000 brit ish servicemen and women deployed to iraq since february 2003 have acted with adaptability and professionalism and often with great gallantry the british militar deployment in the four s outhern provinces has made significant contribution to the coalition efforts to create an iraqi state with representative system of government1 the period of this analysis nded with an election which was not significantly disrupted by violence and deemed free and fair by international observers strategic success the violence during the st ability operations was however greater than that encountered by the army for many years the 1st bn princess of wales royal regiment battlegroup stopped counting contacts of all types when they reached 900 3 some of the analysis of the uk contribut ion set out in this internal army report may look critical when set against the achi evements professionally however the army has duty enshrined in doctrine to learn from experience so that it can maintain and build on its success the armys doctrine and developm ent staff should identify pointers to the future something our opponents and others are also doing th ere are concerns over the planning of phase iv the postcombat operati ons phase and issues arising in several functional areas of the army and the overall uk effort in iraq which need to be addressed 4 several of those who contributed to this analysis or whose work has been used expressed guarded optimism for t he future in iraq despite the insurgencies and political difficulties it is too early to predict how the situation might turn out but the positive gains will be based on the achievements of determi ned and capable coalit ion servicemen and women in iraq their civilian counterparts and the local people who have benefited from coalition achievements 1 the four southern prov inces comprising the british area of responsibilit were basrah maysan which includes amarah dh i qar and muthanna the mndse aor if overlaid on map of the uk would extend from so uthampton blandford cardiff chester darlington skegness margate southampton vastly larger area than an army corps aor in warfighting restricted 2 restricted national and coalition strategic planning 5 many observers identified failure to plan the military and nonmilitary phase iv tasks for iraq in timely fashion and in sufficient breadth and depth to put this in context during the winter of 200203 there were fear s in london that several factions might compete for power if the sadda m regime fell and that violence or moves towards civil war in iraq were possible howeve r the uk governments overri ding concern was to achieve further united nations security council reso lution scr with robust language relating to weapons of mass destruction as the junior partner in pr ovisional coalition the uk had to work to timetable and strong ideological views set in the united states as one senior officer put it the train was in grand central st ation and was leaving at time which we did not control the military planning main effo rt in both the us and uk before the combat phase of op iraqi freedom telic st arted was reasonably enough for the expeditionary force deployment preparation and warfighting phases iiii in whitehall the internal opsec operational security regime in which only very small numbers of officers and officials were allowed to become involved in telic business constrained broader planning for combat operations and subsequent phases effectively until 23 december 2002 6 at that time little was known in deta il or understood in bot h the us and uk about the state of the infrastructu re and public services in ir aq these proved worse than anticipated the scale of iraq country the size of france was factor identified in mod but not appreciated in detail in the us much planning was done by the office of reconstruction and humanitarian affairs orha under general garner mainly on displaced persons and life pport this was taken on by the coalition provisional authority cpa under ambassador bremer the planning suffered from being militarily directed and orientated and from lack of coherence and resources2 orha planning also focused on us priorities coalition iss ues are covered from 18 onwards figure 1 the river tigris at amarah cc 2 the cpa ran from may 2003 jun 2004 when sove reignty passed to the iraqi interim government restricted 3 restricted 7 in uk the political and planning realities coupled with the restrictive opsec regime meant that few people in mod and very fe w in other government departments ogd were planning the overall operations includin g phase iv departments had very different views of the crisis the fo reign and commonwealth office fco and treasury were involved in phase iv planning as were t he departments for international development dfid trade and industry and constitutional affairs exlord chancellors department to very limited extent the cabinet office pl ayed coordinating role ogd and some officials in mod took some persuading that they would have obligations under the geneva conventions 1949 if or when the uk became an occupying po wer the implied tasks or responsibilities were very significant in size range and complexity 8 the requirements to plan find resources for and undertake interim government and reconstruction in iraq the nonmilitary tasks were discussed in outline across whitehall but approaches to potential co ntractors were not made until combat operations were coming to an end planning was not done in sufficient depth and at the outset of phase iv little finance was requested and approved for reconstruction purposes figure 2 delivering medical supplies in accordance wi th the geneva convention cc 9 there was hope among some senior offi cials in mod and ogd that the or other countries might take on interim gover nment and reconstruction tasks the lack of planning ran counter to potential geneva conv ention obligations and to the principle of restricted 4 restricted contingency planning it also failed to take in to account the evident reluctance of other countries to support the coalition int ent and further robust language scr3 10 in the event the rapid fall of the saddam regime led to an unexpected and precipitate breakdown of law and order lack of planning and resources resulted in delays before reconstruction of essential services could start and before t he new government and security structures in iraq could be established 1st uk armoured divisions declarations that essential services could be quickly rest ored proved hopelessly opt imistic in the four provinces particularly basrah in maysan locals were proud t hat they not the coalition had liberated their province they sought mate rial help not occupying forces overall during the initial months reality on the ground and iraqi expectations were far apart and local support for and confidence in the coalition ebbed in late2003 violent incidents increased4 local activists were able to capitalise on these and to develop an insurgency against the forces of occupation5 11 the strands of the coalit ion campaign were not linked effectively senior british officer observed that the uk government which spent millions of pounds on resourcing the security line of operat ions spent virtually none on the economic one on which security depended in several theatres affect ed by insurgencies the state of the local economy has proved an important fa ctor affecting popular support for the insurgent cause in counter insurgency campaigns and in complex crises money tends to be potent soft power or nonkinetic weapon but in iraq apart from the relatively small but useful sums allocated to quick impact projects qip uk troops lacked the resources to assist economic development or other projec ts which might achieve influence insight the anticipated and planned for postconflict humanitarian crisis did not happen an implosion in iraqi so ciety with serious breakdown in law and order and developing insurgency both of which did occur were not expected in the uk some us assumptions on stability and reconstruction in iraq in the postcombat operation s period were accepted uncritically insight the failure to plan early and in enough detail affected most areas of the coalition response and influenced the operational situation it has had implications for almost all the th emes analysed in this study insight strategic crossgovernment estimate and plan is essential if the likelihood exists that the uk may be invol ved in an intervention operation the estimate should be revised as the situ ation evolves troops can assist in restoring law and order but military forces cannot by themselves take on interim government and reconstruction tasks in the postcombat phase for more than short period troops also lack the resources and expertise to play more than limited role in ot her campaign strands political economic 3 while there was small iraq secretariat team working in mod the iraq

streets first priority rapid and visible progress in reconstructing iraqs wornout and damaged infrastructure new postsaddam regime systems of government and an effective way to spread good news and scotch rumours prior planni ng and preparation the coalitions civilian organisational structures availabl staff and levels of expertise all proved inadequate statebuilding in southern iraq sir hilary synott survival iiss quar terly vol 47 no2 summer 2005 p356 5 see annex for laymans guide to the extremist factions in iraq restricted 5 restricted social legal and cultural in state in which there has been conflict linkages and coordination between campaign st rands must also be effective insight military intervention operation mounted into failing or fragile state is likely to cause the existing government or regime to collapse contingency plans for interim government suppor t to an existing administration humanitarian aid and justice system as well as reconstruction and nation building if required should be made alongside those for combat operations insight if military intervention is related to an insurgency with global implications then the operational level goals for the campaign should be related to the strategic campaign goals including information operations for other theatres where british or allied troops are deployed 12 two insights relating to logistics and stabili ty operations are also relevant here insight british deployment plans w ill be constrained by contract arrangements within the defence logisti cs organisation and outside relating to commercial air and sea lift support for other government departments and postconflict service providers some contracted goods and services can be hastened at cost premium but many suppliers may be unable to deliver at more rapid rates these constraints have significant implicat ions for decision making when the uk is not tting deployment timetables insight postconflict priorities the split of responsibilities outline system of government and security and reconstruction plans should be agreed by coalition partners before intervention forces are deployed if the nonmilitary tasks are not coordinated with expediti onary military force efforts and comprehensive approach is not followed the reconstitution of failing state will take longer with layed exit strategies and military drawdown 13 the uk assumed military responsibility for the four southern iraqi provinces confusion arose however over the nonmilitary responsibilities the legal obligations relating to an occupying power under the geneva conventions fe ll to the uk the civilian authority cpasouth had other responsibilities and many of the reco nstruction plans and resources were provided by t he us cpasouth worked to the cpa in baghdad and was unresponsive to hq multinational division south east mndse requests6 ambassador bremers view was that the coalitions main strategic priority was the stabilisation of the baghdad region7 initially in the southern pr ovinces help came mostly from the troops there rather than the cpa lat er the cpa paid significant sums for iraqi salaries and reconstruction projects it was decided in 2003 that the uk would not take on the administration and reconstr uction of the provinces for which it was the occupying power the post1945 british zo ne of occupation in germany model deserves examination in any future crisis however despite the major resource implications 14 as principle british officers and fficials in theatre military diplomatic intelligence police and aid reconstruction need to be briefed and s upported from uk in 6 scr 1483 adopted 22 may 2003 recognised the us and uk as occupying powers in iraq the transfer of authority to the ir aqi interim government was recognised by scr 1546 in june 2004 7 synott op cit p40 restricted 6 restricted order to maximise british influence locally whitehall structures for directing and co ordinating uk efforts are less well integrated than teamwork in theatre however improved coordination in london could assist britis h endeavours in iraq and other theatres insight the british doctrinal model usu ally applied to counter insurgency of single authority eg di rector of operations coordinating political economic social legal security and cultural strands of campaign is still valid but was not followed in the uk area of responsibility in iraq this created confusion although th appointment of britis h diplomat to head the coalition provisional authority south resulted in better cooperation with british military commanders insight the legal authority obligat ions for government and security and resources in an area of responsibility should belong to the state that is the occupying power until such time as th authority passes to appropriate host state structures and leaders when country is administered by more than one occupying power zones of occupa tion should be considered providing the issues of resources for administration and reconstruction can be resolved insight if the united kingdom as an ccupying power has responsibility for zone of occupation or an area of responsibility it has moral and pragmatic incentive as well as gal obligations to ensure that all lines of operation are properly resourced even if in overall coalition terms the area is not assigned priority as the main effort 15 on the other hand the requirement to plan for the postconflict phase and to co ordinate campaign strands is military observation and many outside mod and the services including some officials in ogd do not plan as systematic ally as those in defence ogd generally lack cris is management expertise or experts and executives able to deploy to operational theatres and different priorities abound in whitehall in addition many commentators and informed mbers of the public believe that the war in iraq was and still is an operation of choice or elective and not one of national survival it would therefore be unnecessary or inappropriate t hey believe to mobilise ogd and national resources to any great extent and certainly not to the level seen between 1939 and 1945 16 military people often with recent operational experience can readily point to the consequences of failing to plan and of not committing both military and nonmilitary resources to complex crises in which uk servicemen and wo men are deployed in unpleasant and dangerous conditions from the rmy perspective there is presentational challenge which needs to be addre ssed in westminster whitehall and further afield those with field experi ence will have to educate and convince people about what is required and what is obligatory for example under the geneva convention in military and in nonmilitary terms if successful endstate is to be achiev ed in pursuit of hmg policy in postconflict situations8 greater emphasis on k eeping nongovernment organisations ngo and 8 during the second world war the planning for the administration of li berated europe and occupied germany was initially coordinated by the chancello r of the duchy of lancaster and his department and was then taken on by several other depa rtments the charities we would now call them ngos were given common purpose and coordinated by the officiallyspo nsored joint war organisation the point was made quite strongly by several of those who gave evidence to the analysis team that given the level of resources being committed to the military and nonmilitary operations and the complexity of the situation single restricted 7 restricted selected contractors informed about events in crisis areas is also highly desirable 17 convincing the public may not be easy s the police are finding over terrorist threats in uk but shaping expe ctations is important for m any reasons mod is investing heavily in intervention capabilitie s so that it can meet hmg policy goals when intervention operations are mounted however civilian teams will be required to help deliver post conflict success unless policy of strategic r aiding is intended to deliver the effect required which seems unlikely insight crossgovernment team efforts are vital to strategic success strategic failure will affect not just the british military but her majestys government itself and british civilians at home and abroad insight senior military fficers should be prepared to advise proactively and engage in dialogue across whitehall duri ng crisis so that strategic tasks can be identified and accepted by ap propriate government departments including the ministry of defence mo d the mod has ca mpaign planning and operational experience and can help iden tify key tasks operational lessons identified by mod show starkly the results of lack of planning insight the army and more widely those in defence need to explain their wellestablished campaign principles to planners outside the ministry of defence to agencies interna tional organisationsnongovernment organisations and to those who m ay undertake reconstruction projects through formal information strategy involving the army presentation team and the crossgovernment postconflict reconstruction unit pcru future campaign partners need to understand th parts that military and nonmilitary bodies play in resolving complex crises 9 the uk as subordinate partner in the coalition 18 the uk has been subordinate partner in the usled coalition of 30 nations in 2004 providing as stated above around 5 of the co alition troops and similar proportion of financial resources during the period the uk and its deployed commanders have where required made their own decisions the perception that the uks influence at the higher levels is necessarily limited both in national capitals and in theatre should be balanced by the tangibl and substantive contributions made by british officers us commanders have accepted advice at the operational level certainly since 2004 and the uk has filled disproportionate number of key staff appointments in the us multinational forces corps iraq headquarters this s prompted some comment from us military officers not in iraq equally t he perception of us reluctance to accept advice from other coalition commanders and the sens itivity of us officers to criticism needs balance suggestions from british officers have been adopted and great effort s have been made to avoid criticising individuals in very difficult operational situat ion senior us officers both government minister or department should be tasked with coordinating british policy and efforts in iraq the secretary of state for defences reid group establis hed in late 2005 for coordinating plans for afghanistan should go some way towards achieving this requirement 9 some positive progress has been made in whitehall with the modled generic strategic campaign plan initiative certainly the crossgovernment approach to the 2006 afghanistan deployment has benefited from the experience gained on op telic restricted 8 restricted at home and in iraq have accepted criticism in published articles and responded in measured way playing subordi nate role in counter insurgency operation may recur and british doctrine and st aff training should take this into account 19 british commanders and forces faced severa l constraints as subordinate partners in iraq there were signifi cant differences in approach particularly relating to counter insurgency british counter insurgency exper ience is respected by some coalition commanders but others had not st udied previous campaigns or did not want to hear about northern ireland or colonial struggles eg in malaya or kenya the unrest and violence following the fall of the saddam regime were re cognised by british offi cers in mid2003 as indicators of insurgent activity but it took longer for us commanders to accept this and to take suitable countermeasures10 some coalition actions eg debaathification alienated many iraqis however and made counter insurgen cy much more difficult to achieve 20 many coalition nations fail to apprecia the impact of the media and good media operations the global media has many facets and agendas it includes domestic media in coalition countries global 24h our networks internet sites regional and islamic media including jazeera in iraq and influential bloggers events in theatre but outside the british area of responsibility may be report ed as usuk coalitio n actions striking image can cast local military succe ss in very different light in strategic or political terms this may directly affect the way uk and britis h troops are regarded in the islamic world insight coalition actions reported in the global media may affect british domestic politics and public opinion it is therefore important that clear political aims and information operations media messages are agreed by coalition partners at the out set and updated when necessary 21 coalition partners take diffe rent stances on other issues too including notably the law this embraces inter national and human rights law proportionality and collateral damage concepts rules of engagement roe forensic approach to incidents and post incident investigation ther is major difference of vi ew between those who have signed the european convention on hu man rights and those who have not political engagement is required to resolve differences of opinion but there is guarantee of success 22 some senior british commanders felt that the coalition did not give enough support to potential friends and the uncommitted people in iraq many who endured the saddam regime stayed alive by sitting on the fence many iraqis of all ages have however come to regard coalition troops as occupying forc and act accordingly the coalition is therefore not reaping the reward s for its humanitarian rec onstruction and nationbuilding efforts often described as multisector issues and is not able to gain the intelligence critical to defeat insurgent groups informati on operations may not have identified the most significant issues influencing opinion in an isla mic country and reconstruction or quality of life efforts have not been co ordinated with these 23 in reality while brit ish officers can do little about differences in approach and perceptions that the pr oblems in the south are remote from those elsewhere in iraq they should continue to try to influence the campai gn plan and its various strands and to apply british principles within our own area of operations 10 comprehensive coalition campaign plan was not developed until august 2004 restricted 9 restricted wider implications 24 having looked at strategic implications insights from the pporting themes will be examined the first two issues fa ll within the conceptual component the approach to operations 25 at an early stage of the analysis the then army doctrine committee and other senior army officers discussed the focu s for the army considering whether the most demanding or the most likely future warfare scenario should be the main effort there are problems of definition her but there is also perception among some officers that with resource constraints operational commitment s and bowman conversion the army is not always training as effectively for high intensit warfighting as it has done in the past at least collectively at formation level the consensus is firmly that the most demanding activity high intensity warfighting should re main main effort main taining high intensity warfighting as main effort should not howev er prevent the continuing development of some low cost capabilities with utility in counter insurgency or complex crises particularly in the intelligence surveillance target acquisition and rec onnaissance istar and force protection areas in turn traini ng and exercises should reflect t he reality of modern conflict in which complex crisis issues are never far aw ay soldiers need the leadership flexibility of mind and skills to be able to respond at least for short periods to nonwarfighting tasks figure 3 flexibility of mind and sk ills to be able to respond cc 26 the operational context and activity in ir aq has been challenging the three block war concept was developed in adp land operations in the form of the continuum of operations in which range of simultaneous high intensity lower intensity or counter restricted 10 restricted insurgency armed policing tasks might be conducted alongside stability operations eg humanitarian or nationbuilding tasks11 op telic 1 brigades were able rapidly to adopt this approach in order to ta ke basrah in april 2003 but the army has not yet begun systematically to train in way that em braces the continuum of operations the challenges of mental adjustmen t to the activities in the continuum of operations are considerable as those who have served in iraq in phase iv can testify adjustment between categories of task is more difficult w hen casualties occur and the local population their leaders and the police are partisan if not hostile developing the right mindset and balancing offensive action with force protection concerns and the use of soft power methods rather than hard power or kinetic effects against armed politicallymotivated factions are essential but have pr oved very difficult to achieve 27 the effects based approach was used for many tasks and was effe ctive in iraq major changes are recommended as one battl egroup commander said you had to use an indirect approach and kinetic ef fects were not always the best or indeed the only methods equally training in how urban ar eas can be policed is highly desirable general chiarellis approach to training for iraq in cluded for example taking 1st us cavalry division officers to study the problems of running the city of austin texas model followed by other us divisional commanders insight the implications of the cont inuum of operations and the training required for simultaneous but differe nt operational challenges require practical development innovative education training and exercises should be identified so that the armys capab ility in stability operations can be enhanced 28 the operational situati on during the period often r equired high intensity peace enforcement approach as the number of contacts in which the princess of wales royal regiment battlegroup was involved suggests12 during op telic 25 an approach broadly consistent to british counter insurgency doctrine based on maintaining consent was ensured at divisional commander level thr ough directives although force postures and responses changed according to threat time and place tactical commanders employed mission command effectively acco rding to the circumstances of the moment while some have raised the question of consistency of appr oach at lower levels the more rigid the consistency demanded the more constraint s that will inevitably be imposed on commanders continuity of commanders did however draw comment and longer command tours at senior level may help to promote trust and good wo rking relationships with coalition officials and local politici ans continuity of approach and command was achieved in northern ireland through standing formation headquarters and some of the means whereby continuity was achieved in the province are worth considering for enduring medium scale peace support operations13 taking steps to achieve continuity will be dependent on the bold assumption t hat the uk is to be committed to relatively long term presence in theatre on op lic this would have run counter to the prevailing political 11 three block war this concept articulated by gener charles krulak us marine corps in oct 1997 envisaged in one moment in time our service memb ers will be feeding and clothing displaced refugees providing humanitarian assistance they will also be holding two warring tribes apart conducting peacekeeping operations and finally they will be fighting highly lethal midintensity battle all on the same day all within three city blocks 12 see 2 13 see comments about deputy commanders in 42 below restricted 11 restricted views in the us in whitehall and westminste r and indeed in iraq it self nonetheless the british army has been engaged in enough campaigns of this na ture to know that rapid exit strategy is seldom achieved 29 the principle of minimum force was inte rpreted according to the situation and on occasions meant considerable amount of force but this wa s employed in measured way proportionate to the circumstances insight continuity of command arrangem ents to ensure both consistent approach to the tactical situation nd good links with coalition officials and local officials deserve serious consider ation in enduring complex crisis and counter insurgency situations british army doctrine 30 as well as the question of consistent approach to the situation the iraq campaign has revealed gaps and outdated aspects of britis h army doctrine in iraq deployed british commanders and officials have relied on doctrine which has its origins in the analysis made by sir robert thompson in defeating communist insurgency 14 joint doctrine on the military support to peace support operations superseded by second edition in dec 2004 has also been useful15 thompsons analysis of campaign strands and the range of responses required political economic soci legal security military police and intelligence and cultural is stil l useful however the crisis in iraq has shown the difficulties of practical application in world very different from south east asia in the 1950s and 60s figure 4 peace support operation an unsuccessful

occupat ion and violent insurgencies in the uk however entrenched views on the original intervention operation dominate media reporting on iraq too often only bad news is broadcast in postconflict counter insurgency operations perceptions are frequently more import ant than facts bad news reinforces negative perceptions of the coa lition and has eroded sup port in the crucial hearts and minds campaign this has affect ed the perceptions of the iraqi people which are key to the situation 69 three areas deserve emphasis in this internal army analysis of most complex campaign the first concerns what adp land operations describes as the balance of military and nonmilitary means required for success in peace support including enforcement and stabilis ation operations35 planning the evidence shows that too littl planning was done for op telic phase iv particularly on the nonmilitary side and that too few resources both human and financial were allocated to the pos tconflict situation in military terms it is axiomatic that leaders should not star t an operation without thinking through the options and implications for their plans and military operations always have non military implications36 mission command and estimates ar thus taught exhaustively to all commanders it is not enough just to identify the desired endstate at the operational level the military effort is only one part of the bigger pangovernment comprehensive approach the view that uk plc is just not joined up and its bureaucratic approach to problem solving is not capable of supporting dynamic operation like telic was echoed by severa l officers and others contributing to this analysis in future military and non military planners and deployed commanders should identify objectives on

employing military c apabilities to restore services and support civilian agencies39 12 the shortcomings in plann ing for phase iv in both the us and uk before the start of operation iraqi freedom

iraqi army and polic and the debaathification programme was rapid much of th is happened spontaneously although the cpa formalised the process in august 2003 for the ir aqi army the melting away of the existing structures however unpopular created security vacuum which the coalition lacked the manpower to fill and meant that disaffected ir aqi officers soldiers and officials were excluded from the security and reconstructi on process disorder which started as the saddam regime collapsed escalated delays in reestablishing order and creating security forces gave credence to the iraqi view that t he coalition would occupy their country for years and gave cause to ant icoalition activists 14 on the uk military side neither the uk theatre headquarters nor hq 1st armoured division had dedicated phase iv planning t eam or time to plan for occupying power obligations in detail single representatives from the fco and dfid joined the division just before it entered iraq following the warfighting success t he delay in developing the vital nonmilitary roles of government and reconstruc tion and the rapid drawdown meant that british forces were initially unable to cont end effectively with the wave of lawlessness including looting suitable roe against such lawlessness were not initially available the lawlessness led to international human rights watch criticism and to opportunities which anticoalition activists sought to exploit the inability to restore security early during the occupation was critical failure human rights abuses involvin g detainees then compounded the problem of lack of respect for the coalition and iraqi interim authority minority view several inputs to the analysi s raised the question of who was responsible for the prematur drawdown of troops when during tense public order situation the visible requi rement was for boots on the ground several officers stated that many difficulties arose owing to the lack of british military capability available in theatre the analysis team f eels that this was decision outside the scope of the analysis however there is an information and morale issue here and lesson for the

to restore law and order quickly led to the emergence of rival factions as well as media condemnation 17 restoration of essential services is important for humanitarian reasons and to meet geneva convention iv eg health care and charter obligations the key lesson re learned in iraq is that an intervention force needs to estab lish itself quickly as credible and efficient administrator factions

british military elements at formation and battlegroup level worked closely with international and nongo vernment organisat ions these bodies invariably have their own priorities and ag endas but there is need to co ordinate efforts particular ly with security plans 111 the tenets of the guidance in the military contribution to peace support operations include the creation sustai nment and

warfightingfocu ssed coalition had to be worked out on the hoof and in many ways it was deeply flawed structure anonymous senior british officer on op telic 2004 21 the op telic 1 report was critical of the size of some headquarters and staff procedures including lengthy overdetail ed orders produced too late to influence operational activity the observations from op telic 25 are more on the role and staffing of the multinational division h eadquarters than size or the meliness of orders the chain of command and liaison was however not clear and coordination with nonmilitary agencies including cpasouth was not always satisfactory 22 for much of the period the coalit ion did not have single military commander exercising overall comm and and control or acting in th british phrase as unitary campaign authority or director of operations the us military chain of command comprised combined joint task force 7 cjtf7 reporting to the us department of defence initially cjtf7 had the multinational force iraq mnfi headquarters and multinational corps iraq mnci in 2004 this was r edesigned so that mnfi acted as the corps headquarters with mndse as one of eight subordinate divisiona llevel headquarters 23 the uk military commander the g eneral officer commanding goc mndse acted under the broad direction of us milit ary commanders in baghdad while coordinating actions on the security and reconstruction si with cpasouth in basrah and in turn acting as the leading member of the occupying power in the four southern provinces until june 200441 the tasks given often exceeded the re sources available to mndse the cpa and to an extent hmg did not appear to appreciate the limits of military capability and resources for reconstruction and nationbu ilding and cpasouth did not provide good structure for nonmilitary tasks in their prov inces contractors were often working in an insecure environment they were sometime s unwilling to work wit h military forces 24 in parallel largely due to different experience under standing of the violence in the central provinces in iraq and the emerging insurgencies differ ed between coalition military commanders in baghdad and basrah british officers identified the warning signs around the time of the basrah ri ots in august 2003 while viol ence had been occurring in the sunni triangle for some months it took longer for s enior coalition commanders to recognise the implications and to plan and execute appropriate countermeasures the insurgencies did not grow at th same rate in all areas much of the insurgent activity modus operandi and many ieds seemed to be develo ped and tested in the sunni triangle before being exported to other provinces includi ng those in the south 25 in june 2004 the interim iraqi governm ent was established and the uks role as an occupying power ceased this relieved the uk from civil responsib ility for the four provinces but the iraqi aut horities had few effective troops and policemen and formally requested uk troops to continue to provide security two insights emerge ssr should have been planned at the outset see theme ten and secondly the shortage of officers 41 see footnote 1 for the four provinces restricted 36 restricted with arabic language skills able to work with local government police and military forces was acute see theme five 26 two other views emerged from the inputs received there was feeling that although the uk military chain of command was effective and counter insurgency direction was positive there was an absence of local uk political direct ion for what overall the uk wished to achieve in its provinces there wa s firm political view as to how political factions and their militias or political affili ations among newly appoint ed iraqi officials and by extension economic development and recons truction should be h andled this led to further violent incidents afte r the period of this analysis secondly there was renewed criticism of some staff procedures without evidence it is difficult to recommend detailed changes however it would appear that while british battlegroups were expected to play their part in the various strands of the ov erall campaign plan the nonmilitary input and resources for projects to win hearts and minds were insufficient this suggests that the role and responsibility of political advisers polad should be reassessed figure 16 hearts and minds cc 27 comment from senior uk ogd official suggested that the army worked with great energy and effectiveness in many roles that were not traditionally military lack of ogd staff meant however that in some cases they could not support the pace of military activity the implication was that sometimes m ilitary forces would deliver quick solution to nonmilitary task that was not necessarily in the best long term interests of local people and their future government this could have been resolved had the uk had an effective overall director of operations or empowered ambassador in t heir provinces and more ogd staff or timely contractor s upport in the absence of these f unctions the army will have to restricted 37 restricted take less well resourced ogd contributions along with their own even if civil direction is inadequate 28 general chiarel li has described his ex periences commanding 1st us cavalry division in iraq his pioneering of integrated

integrated comprehensive approach which embraced soldiers civilian contractors and local people in cleaning up their areas42 in effect he adapted intelligence preparation of the battlefield in form he described as sewage waste electricity and trash swet analysis insight general chiarellis sewage waste electricity an d trash analysis and associated concepts should be valuated by joint and army doctrine staffs and ogd representatives in order that british efforts can be properly focused and coordinated in accordan ce with british government aims this should be major part of the crossgovernment comprehensive approach 29 moving to military c2 topi cs the divisional headquarters evolved into its role once the british divisional headquarte rs left theatre the headquarters was multinationalised it was not however designed or optimised for its purpose properly designed headquarters in the absence of formed british headquarters should be an aspiration for the future and the design should be review ed when the tactical situation changes significantly and additional nonmilitary tasks hav to be coordinated as new staff cells are created their subordination needs careful thought in order that they add value to planning and aid decisionmaking rather than slow it the concept of operations or mission support branch with clear direction and carefully defined levels of authority proved useful it provided the means of coord ination for military support and liaison to non military efforts in accordanc with campaign priorities 210 as in previous campaigns the practice of reachback was used extensively more communication means are ava ilable now however for reachback many issues particularly of nonmilitary nature were referr ed back to uk for policy decisions and this occasionally resulted in misunderstandings and slow decisionmaking with the focus for political decisions remaining in whitehall reachback generally proved useful the preferred military option is that in oper ational terms reachback should be limited to information not decisionmaking however this may not be cceptable to pjhq and mo d crisis managers and ministers on some issues there is however parallel need for uk ogd to consider their representation in theatre when the uk is acting as an occupying power and when the uk is involved in nationbuilding and reconstruc tion appointment of suitably empowered uk ambassador rather than overreliance on reachback may be preferable 211 during op telic 25 t he divisional headquarters evol ved onto trickle posting basis the evidence

least and it should be designed with exp ansion potential so that the functions of an occupying power and the milita ry aspects of reconstruction and nation building can also be coordinated insight formationlevel staff proce dures were again criticised although specific criticisms are hard to isolat work to identify improved staff procedures to support an approach to crises based on manoeuvre and mission command and to consider the links to nonmilitary agencies who work alongside the military in co mplex crises should be considered 213 at battlegroup level intelligence cells were built on similar basis to those used in northern ireland some battlegroups were fo rtunate enough to be able to use trained people experienced in northern ir eland in the same role duri ng their tours in iraq

paras 26 29 of theme zero above 33 during the period of op telic 25 some national cont ingents lacked the capability to carry out their geneva convention obligations in full insight obligations under

operational law branch and read the input in full 35 op telic was conducted in rapidly evolving legal environment in 1998 the uk ratified protocols i and ii additional to the 1977 geneva conventions the human rights act came into force in 2000 the uk became signatory to the statute of the international criminal court rome 1998 there is need to m onitor the impact of evolving international legislation and to adjust guidanc if required when planning any future deployments while in theory different legal considerations appl to the deployment co mbat operations and occupation phases there was inevitably degree of overlap during op telic insight recent developments in intern ational law have affected the legal basis on which united kingdom armed services operate international law continues to evolve in dynamic fashion nd thus the legal basis for the use of force will continue to change restricted 40 restricted 36 the legal basis for the war itself was and still is controversial there is military need at least at the outset of operations to reinforce the legal base for deployment by clear unequivocal and timely dire ction and explanation as adp land operations states the decision to deploy uk forces to engage in armed conflict will always be taken at the highest political and military level and the decis ion will be subject to scrutiny by the law officers and others44 preparation for phase iv 37 the legal staff in the deployed brit ish forces especially in headquarters 1st uk armoured division received higher level directio n on occupation and had insufficient time to prepare detailed guidanc for the postcombat operations phase and for the role as an occupying power the divis ions legal staff issued guide to occupation to commanders in feb 2003 but had little time to tr ain individuals for their roles many of which lay more properly with ogd 38 the most important c onventions relating to occ upation are the four geneva conventions 1949 and the subsequent 1st geneva protocol 1977 these are part of the body of international humani tarian law known as the law of armed conflict the legal cornerstone for the rights and re sponsibilities of an occupying power is article 43 of the 1907 hague convention iv the legal obligati on to restore and ensure as far as possible public order and safety obliged uk and c oalition forces to try to restore and maintain law and order once th ey exercised authority over iraqi territory while many assumed phase iv activities would be simila r to peace support operation occupation is governed by different legal regime with different legal right s and obligations insight mod and 1st uk armoured division lega l staffs did their best to address the legal issues arising from the united kingdom becoming an occupying power and achieved some success but overall there was insufficient time for proactive pla nning and too few resources to ensure implementation arrangements were effect ive when combat operations ended rules of engagement 39 while the major combat operations phase falls outside this analysis the responsibilities of an occupying power start ed as soon as enemy territory was captured as that stage the uk services were operating under op telic 1 combat operations roe which allowed uk forces to attack and destroy positively identified members of the iraqi forces together with members of the former regime and the ba ath party these roe were in force until 14 jul 2003 while appropriate for dealing with an identifiable enemy engaged in hostilities troops are only able to use minimum force when dealing with law and order or criminal issues lethal force is allowed only where human life is in danger the situation was complicated by the difficulties arising fr om both combatants and rmed criminals and later extremists and insurgents dr essed in civilian clothes 310 as well as the guide to occupation the divisional legal staff issued guides on public order and safety and later regarding looting in apr 2003 with roe supplemented by specific guidance uk and coaliti on troops were legitimately able to destroy enemy forces 44 adp land operations 0711 restricted

generally roe and guidanc on opening fire were adequat and the majority of uk troops with experience from other theatres were able to change relatively easily from the combat operations to self defence profile practical difficulties included identification of hostile individuals who were often not in combat uniforms during phase iv carriage of weapons by civilians was comm onplace the range and type of attacks meant that it was not possible to apply the loac or self defence profiles by geographical area captured detained and interned persons 312 the parallel activities of warfighting and

1949 identification of those entitled to pw stat us was not clear cut and all of the c1200 captured in civilian clothes clai med to be civilians ther had therefore to be differentiation between pw and other detainees as soon as th first pws in civilian clothing were captured it was necessary for geneva convention iii article 5 tribunals to restricted 42 restricted be held to determine their status there was however insufficient evidence in every case to make proper recommendations despite the assignment of sevenman royal military police rmp team lack of resources includi ng interpreters and secu rity difficulties as well as inadequate documenta tion from the point of ca pture prevented proper investigation as result an initial assessment process wa s devised and three british officers made an initial determination of status this process received unfavourable comment from the international co mmittee of the red cross icrc insight the practical difficulties of determining the status of captured persons while the uk services are enga ged in fighting irregular warfare operations in postcombat operations phase should not be underestimated 314 during the restoration of law and order while the uk was the occupying power there was requirement to detain those suspected of serious crim including looting murder rape and kidnap while not desirable owing to pot ential confusion with the protected status of pw and the obligations of the capturing state the only viable secure facility during the combat operat ions phase was that at um qasr again the icrc was informed and objection was raised while detainees were afforded the rights and privileges accorded to pw they were deem ed also to be covered by human rights legislation and arguably the european convention on human rig hts it was felt that legal review of their detention was necessary and policy to this effect was introduced 315 the next category was internees t hose people who posed th reat to the uk forces but who did not fall into the category of pw or common criminals in that they posed threat but had not committed serious crim inal offence the geneva convention iv makes specific provision for the review of in ternment by court or administrative board and owing to operational circumstances this was achieved by an initial review by the staff of the division with further review by the goc within 28 days owing to lack of resources the internees were also kept in the pw camp the icrc were generally content with the arrangements made and under stood the constraints on uk and coalition forces 316 finally number of people requested vo luntary internment the occupying power is legally obliged to provide protective custody for those who ask for it however this category too was assigned to another section within the pw camp 317 ukrun divisional tem porary detention facility d tdf was opened in december 2003 manned by an infantry company group wi th specialist advice from the military provost service the dtdf was inspecte d by the icrc and recommendations made by them were implemented the prof ile and interest in the facility rose sharply in the following spring following the abu ghraib abuse allegatio ns but access was tightly controlled in order to prevent internees being exposed to unwarranted attention committee was established to take on the review process for internees insight the obligations regarding facilities for securing and processing prisoners of war detainees criminal detainees internees civilians posing threat to uk forces and voluntary tainees are complex and will almost certainly fall within the responsibility of an occupying power or an intervention force in complex crisis the facilities and processes have to comply with geneva convention requi rements and be established to international committee of the red cross icrc standards restricted 43 restricted restoration of law and order 318 as the occupation continued the legal obli gation to restore public life together with the duty to restore law and order meant that t he criminal justice system in iraq had to be examined and where necessary restored45 the justice system had effectively collapsed along with the regime the impact of inter national law on the ccupying power meant that coalition forces as occupying powers had to deal not only with the iraqi military and pw but also had to embrace the reconstruction of society as whole task for which the intervention forces and their very few ogd co lleagues were not prepared this new set of tasks unanticipated before op telic phase i was constrained by the rapid drawdown 319 nevertheless the servic legal and rmp staffs in t heatre developed strategy for assisting in the restoration of law and or der this comprised clarification of the

investigation in each area much work has been done mostly by the adjutant generals staff although there remains an internal army public relations challenge on the last issue 44 the future army structure fas based on direction given in dpas aims to rebalance the regular army to make it capabl of delivering the most likely concurrency assumptions within harmony and without the need for significant augmentation within fas the primary role of the reserves is to reinforce the regular structure for operations at large scale but the reserves are also expecte d to provide additional capability on volunteer basis when planning assumptions are exceeded at pr esent the army is operating in excess of dpa and fas has yet to be fully implemented therefore medium scale operation like op telic which should be found by regular tr oops without recourse to the reserves has required significant augmentation by volunteer s from the ta and regular reserve this situation has been exacerbated by undermanning in the regular army some 6000 individuals we re mobilised for op telic 2 c2500 in 2004 and 1700 in 2005 management action is being taken to r educe individual ta deployments to c600 pa on six month deployments in order to llow individual recuperat ion however when force levels reduced reservists ta and regular reserves were not necessarily the first to be withdrawn evidence is not conclusive on th is some reservists volunteered to stay for full tour and the specialist tasks undertaken by some mobilised reservists may prevent their early withdrawal however for many indivi duals other than in pinch point trades it would seem reasonable to follow the fas policy that medium scale operations should in the first instance be met by the regular rmy and that nonregulars should be withdrawn when possible46 insight review should be carried out to establish if there is likely to be an enduring requirement for significant reserve mobilisation on volunteer basis in support of enduring operations at medium scale in order to inform the next edition of the defence planning assumptions 45 filling augmentation posts has been demanding and has often resulted in short notice trawls and requirements paper by dgs with the army plans and resources committee in spring 2006 addresses this issue however even with reservists appointed to fill pinch point posts the right people

battlegroup level there has been tendency to regard info ops as soft skill whose influence is difficult to quantify this becomes problem atic when commanders have to set resource priorities between information operations and ot her military methods coalition battlegroups have not always been coordinat ed information operations with ta ctical action in contrast to insurgents who rely on publicity to amplify t heir effects in counter insurgency or stability operations the battle for perceptions is often mo re important than physical action in iraq there were difficulties with in telligence links which sometime s limited theme development and lack of the deep cultural knowledge which is essential for convincing messages 78 the effect of military in formation operations is difficult to measure although opinion polling is used and can give c oarse indications of the impa ct on local people more sophisticated balanced scorecardtype thodology with other indicators of success would be useful 79 during op telic 4 h eadquarters 1st mechanised brigade information operations staff produced leader engagement aides memoires detailing themes pertinent to policy and operations this initiative coupled with verbal briefs to commanders meant that any leader engaged in discussions with iraqis h ad information on current themes and that opportunity to gain influence was wasted 710 planning and coo rdination of information operations with tactical actions improved during the period however par tly through the importance of information operations being stressed during preoperational reconnaissance and collective training battlegroups did not always appoint the most appropriate officers to run their information operations the success of these operations depends on the quality and training of those running them training needs analysis for information perations is currently being undertaken 711 in summary the difficulties encount ered with information operations during the period related to longerte rm planning and development of themes and messages particularly over major events necessitating change of message at theatre level the reluctance to recognise information operations as campaign strand and at tactical level as an essential complementary activity to military presence and tactical tasks on the ground reduced partly as result of pretour training and partly through initiatives such as the leader engagement for the future the army has to improve training courses and ensure that the most appropriate officers at battlegroup level run information operations information operations is an essential acti vity that should be planned and run alongside tactical operations in complex crisis counter insurgency or stability operations

situation at the outset t he requirement was for light forces equipment for stability operations although the lawlessness accompanying the change of regime necessitated the rapid deployment of public order equipment 82 the evolution of an increasingly sophisticated insurgent threat with rate of development very much faster than in other re cent campaigns required the rapid fielding of several specialist capabilitie s for example the early appearance of ieds led to deployment of equipment developed for nort hern ireland postincident assessment technical intelligence and reachback for profe ssional scientific support with operational analysis and other techniques was established in mid2003 this again paid dividends particularly since the extremists were and still are able to draw on ext

evolved from conventio nal doctrinally recognisable land logistic warfighti ng organisation with 1st 2nd and 3rd line troops into an organisation rationalised for stability operations the natio nal support element nse was initially based on logistic brigade headquarte rs but then became joint or ganisation although 90 of its activity and responsibility was for land com ponent logistics the st aff appointed were not well selected and the new organisation did not capitalise on established peacetime procedures relationships and operational lessons61 since op telic 1 d joint commitments and the defence augmentation ce ll have reviewed the consolidated augmentation manning lists c aml and linked anticipated sta ff officer requirements to suitable individuals filling established posts 92 at unit level composite logistic support regim ent was developed around the regimental headquarters of t he royal logistic corps regiment in theatre the drawdown was accompanied by an increase in contract ed support however it was not always clear what support the military elements should give to the individual contractors in terms of force protection communications medical support food fuel access to the naafi etc 93 with the nonlinear battlespace becoming an alarming reality normal logistic tasking was complicated by the need to plan routine supply tasks as deliberate operations and to assign up to 25 of availabl troops for force protection duties eg escorts and quick reaction forces while battlegroups provided s upport for convoys within their areas of responsibility on occasions convoy escort wa s routinely combat service support task in order not to detract from the offensive effo rt against extremists unt il rear operations battlegroup was introduc ed during op telic 5 there was however overall british or mndse direction on the protection of suppl for the early part of the period of the analysis which runs contrary to the last principle of war sustainability formerly administration62 some of the forward bases were poor ly sited in terms of access without the risk of ambush 94 the supply task was complicated by sto ck inloading from two directions thousands of containers and pallets of unused combat and other supplies were left over from op telic 1 and needed to be collected and rationalised there were also m any tons of items arriving from uk which had been demanded by op telic 1 units which had left theatre during 2003 the headquarters and logistic troops were spending as much time on reconciliation of accounts and return of significant quantities of contai ners and stores as they were on sustaining the intheatre forces63 hard work in theatre and supply chain improvements in uk turned round the situation from low point in may 2003 by the end of op telic 3 the contents of over 700 cont ainers had been reconciled with accounts and 61 the composite nature of the headquarters led to t he chief g3 operations officer being royal navy submariner responsible for battlegroup echelons th logistic regiment the equipment support company and other land combat service support units from the original theme submitted 62 tactical plan can succeed without administrative support commensurate with the aim of the operation it follows that commander must hav degree of control over the admin istrative plan proportionate to the degree of his responsibility for the operation principles of war administration 63 the 1st uk armoured division postoperational report mentions over 800 containers of materiel and several acres of other stores that were left for op telic 2 logistic units to sort out restricted 65 restricted returned to uk from then rationalised procedures led to more effective achievement of the logistic task by op telic 5 the procedures were very diffe rent from those on telic 2 95 supply and distribution of materiel continued to be hampered by an incomplete asset tracking and accounting system despite elements of systems being deployed64 secondly although many containers had been returned to uk storage agencies were often not willing to fund the receipt ov erhaul and storage of returned materiel which had already been replaced one option was to leave the sto ck in theatre on op telic 5 some 80m worth of materiel was in theatre much of it stored in unsuitable c onditions redemanding or overdemanding due to lack of confidence in the supply ch ain which could not always meet projected delivery times was major problem transparency is needed in the supply chain this should be part of the asset accounting system by early 2004 intheatre delivery times had been reduced to 24 hours despite constr aints imposed by the security situation 96 following attacks on logistic vehicles in may 2003 force protection emerged as major issue vehicles and equipment were m odified with both intheatre initiatives and uor procurement enhanci ng crew protection65 however as well as protecting logistic vehicle crews two other significant issues emerged combat service support soldiers employed on convoy escorts di d not initially have reasonab level of dismounted close combat skills to be able to react to incidents secondly force protection parties in softskin land rovers lacked vehicle communications optical sights mini machine guns grenade launchers and night vision devices66 equipment enhancements arrived but troops were not fully equipped until op telic 5 the every man nd women soldier issue is covered in theme four 97 in addition to asset tracking and every man soldier the logistic development issues which emerged include the need to design and develop an effective nse and national logistic h eadquarters at the point of theatre entry this is not new lesson similar observations having been made after the kosovo operation in 1999 and exercise saif sareea in late 2001 forward of the nse the observation was made that precise orbats were dictated for the roulements ra ther than logistic missions and tasks being given from which incoming logistic comm anders could build or adjust orbats as the situation evolved this led to many reservis ts being called up by op telic 4 the logistic support regiment was 55 ta with regard to individual reinforcements for headquarters it is evident that better syst em stating competencie s is required as in other areas there is scope for looking at longer to urs in theatre which could be acceptable if conditions of service including time out of theatre coul d be agreed lastly veral comments were made about the training of ba ttlegroup and regimental quarterma sters for their role on operations this is an issue that requires examination insight combat service support elements comprising both regular and reservist individuals provided very good service to battlegroups despite having to sort out op telic 1 stores in large quantities and taking on their 64 the laro report in mar 04 reported that during threemonth period the army placed demands on uk distribution centres depots on 15772 occasions for stores which were already in theatre 65 local innovation by staff serge ants webley and woolley led to the fi elding of their webleyeagle armour system for vehicle cabs 66 combat service support elements were equipped with the lsw and thus had very limited integral firepower compared to battlegroup elements equi pped with the 762mm gpmg and the 556mm minimi machine gun restricted 66 restricted own protection in what rapidly becam high threat nonlinear battlespace old lessons regarding asset tracking and accounting were reinforced overall the logistic system appear ed improvised rather than planned and significant followup is required on some logistic issues medical issues 98 the medical input sugges ts that major health issu emerged that had not been identified before operations began however resources have not been available to allow the analysis of significant amounts of medical data collected insight the medical data collected from iraq should be properly assessed 99 in terms of general health in theatre dv occurred at low background rates with predictable peaks during roulement periods whil incomers developed resistance to local pathogens and the requirement to adhere to fi eld hygiene was reinforced heat illness generally peaked during the first few weeks of each roulement however following visit by the army professor of occupational medicine fall in heat injuries was noticed generally heat injury prevention relies on the training of the individual soldier and junior commanders insight roulement should be manage d so that major troop movements do not occur during the hottest periods for individual augmentees the acclimatisation policy should be strictly enforced 910 in terms of trauma care the golden hour criterion evacuation from the point of wounding to hospital within 60 minutes is longestablished and widely supported by coalition military surgeons experienced in iraq and afghanistan op telic 4 analysis suggests that the army was failing to meet this norm although 85 of casualties were evacuated by helicopter to role 3 hospitals the average time into surgery was over 2½ hours67 the low numbers of british casualties makes statistical co mparison with other british and us campaigns difficult the uk has exploited us data which suggests that operational medical support should as fa r as possible replicate the integrated trauma systems which are common in civilian practice b nonhaemostatic agents such as quickclot and chitosan have resulted in significant reduction in the number of us deaths due to uncontrolled haemorrhage the uk adopted similar policy regarding the use of these agents in apr 2005 c swift evacuation direct to hospita l facility bypassing other field medical posts although these may contain multidi sciplinary medical team is associated with an improved mortality insight the net effect of current practi ce is to draw forward greater weight of hospital medical support with its logistic enable rs and care facilities 67 draft op telic mace clinical audit royal centre for defence medicine restricted 67 restricted insight the average time from wounding to surgery of over 2½ hours appears excessive and urgent steps s hould be taken to identify the causes of delay and to eliminate them 911 in terms of casualty evacuation the uk policy of relying on llocated rather than dedicated aircraft for casualty evacuation proved adequate in iraq calls for helicopter evacuation possibly based on the perception t hat movement by air is best may have resulted in delays and casualties being moved in less than optimal circumstances movement of casualties has to be dictated by clinical need tempered by the tactical situation and the person provid ing the first medical response will generally be able to make appropriate evacuation decisions the medical group deployed in iraq has now received armoured wheeled ambulances following attacks on ambulances one of which was fatal although this may suggest reduced requirement for helicopter evacuation the improved force protection offered by armoured ambulances may be counterbalanced by longer evacuation times and lower quality patient care owing to the ground and vehicle characteristics there may ther efore be an increased requirement for helicopters to make up for lost time 912 heavy reliance was placed on medical reservists several factors need to be assessed here frequent changes in people can undermine continuity of care and affect clinical governance and ssurance measures while long tours can result in clinical skill fade and can create difficulties with nhs trust employers ri sk analysis is important when considering the range of clinical specialists retained in theatre cont racted civilian nurses have been deployed in iraq since mid2004 this initiative has reduced pressure on the defence medical services but the contracts limit employment for medicolegal or operational reasons employing contract nurses in general dut ies or away from hospital facility can be contentious the uk has been in volved in multinational medical support hosting medical personnel from veral countries the uk has benefited from us medical arrangements but there ar limitations in the attachment of medical personnel to and from other nations through language l egal constraints and varying standards in clinical practice 913 the divisional medi cal staff were also involved in the medical reconstruction effort both by involvement in reestablishing local health services which were neglected often as means of coercion under the saddam regime and in initiating health practice reform medical planners needed range of skills to be able to contribute to this programme which follows geneva convention obli gations successive commanders medical were involved in discussions with the mini ster of health in baghdad and with t he cpasouth necessary to ensure that projects to improve health care for the many were supported and not just prestige projects for few raising standards and democratising the health profession in iraq was also important despite much g ood work efforts across iraq have not been uniform due to lack of central direction insight the consensus among senior dical commanders is that health activities as part of nati onbuilding and reconstruction should be coordinated by the j9 branch of the regional headquar ters regular and reservist staff with appropriate skills could be assigned to provide expertise in this area 914 lack of clarity over t he position and entitlem ent

1010 following the drawdown of the coalition forces at the end of combat operations and the deterioration in security in iraq the numbers of private military providers mushroomed companies and indi

least one conference uk policy is however not well developed in the area of private military providers troops often do not know where they stand regarding privat military providers 1011 issues regarding private military providers include curity for some of these groups their relationships with the iraqi authorities includ ing the iraqi and international legal system and potential for clas hes of interest including b lueonblue incidents with coalition and iraqi government fo rces contractor status is not defined in international law the question of roe for privat ely employed military personnel has been raised allegations of killings and human rights abus by private military provi ders have also been reported in addition there are also instances of financ ial malpractice and prof

their lack of regulatio n have also given coalition forces bad name by association political activists or extremists may not be able or bother to distinguish the em ployers of noniraqi armed personnel and thus abuses by unregulated contractors or pr ivate military personnel can eas ily be blamed on coalition forces and detract from hearts and minds efforts improvised explosive devices 1013 between

half of which were cleared by the uk and third by ngos of the 62 designat ed captured enemy ammunition sites recorded only 13 had been cl eared by may 2004 lack of security meant that sites have been available for explosives for ieds in addition t he civilian population has suffered casualties from unexploded battlefield munitions including blind clustermunitions some of which were fired into urban or burban areas while n gos and contractors have cleared thousands of munitions their efforts r educed as the security situation deteriorated 1016 uk policy in the past has been to leave the clearance of uxo fired by british troops allies or the enemy and ab andoned enemy munitions to c ontractors or ngos the evidence from iraq suggests that the failure to clear the large numbers of munitions has allowed an arsenal to become available to insurgents and the civilian population has suffered casualties both from battlefield ux and from ieds made from munitions taken from unguarded

drawn from the uk onest ar confidential uk eyes only post operational report whic h was not widely circulated and focuses on the insights relevant to ad hoc international teams which the uk may wish to support in the future1 2 role investigation of the wm d that the coalition believ ed were present in iraq started during phase iii of op telic military unit expeditionary task force75 xtf75 was tasked to find and neutralise wmd in order to aid force protection on the battlefield the isgs subsequent strategy was to inve stigate sites associated with wmd and delivery systems to interrogate high va lue detainees and to acquire and exploit relevant documents the isg had secondary role in pr ocessing and passing on information in the counter terrorist counter insurgency field and it achieved several successes in this area 3 structure following the efforts of xtf75 in june 2003 the us department of defense established the isg usled coalition unit wit h embedded uk and australian support the isg reached strength of 2300 people at one stage with staff based initially in qatar and then in iraq the c onstituent parts included survey operations centre and survey analysis centre

sites previously declared to the and suspected wmd facilities produced little of substance an investigative ap proach debriefing of iraqi office rs and civilian officials and methodical document and media exploitation was then adopted although investigation on the ground was constrained by the dangerous operating environmen t four members of the isg were killed and many other s wounded during the course of the isgs work emerging information was used to cue other investigati ons on quick reaction and exploitation basis 6 uk contribution the uk contributed team of up to 70 individuals both civilian and from all three services under command of military one star who was deputy commander of the isg various analysts acted as subject matter experts and were embedded completely within the isg functi onal teams and reporting through the isf functional chain the availability of support from scientific estab lishments in uk gave assurance of independent analysis which was critical in such politically highly charged operation some of the capabilities eg cdd were provided wholly by the uk for much of the time there was uk military chief of st aff an army major on 46 month tour with small cell coordinating t he uk efforts in the isg 7 uk issues some specific national concer ns were channelled through the uk deputy commander for him to raise with the isg command group or to refer back to the uk issues included legal inst ructions and detention operations and classification of papers and intelligence the deputy commander made pragmatic judgem ents on other issues eg dress states in order to balance nat ional and coalitio n perspectives 8 uk lessons the main uk contains 25 page section on lessons divided into j1j9 some of the lessons which are not spec ific to the isg role are similar to those raised following the uk team contribution to the kosovo verification mission in 199899 there are procedural and adminis trative limitations on the rapid establishment of an ad hoc mixed civilianmilitary grouping some of whic h could be addressed without major resource implications it is recommended that the isg lessons are read in full before any future deployment of this nature is made isg model the isg model and the uk contri bution to it was successful and can be considered for use in future operatio ns the model would be better suited to defined or bounded mission than as gener intelligence support model restricted c3 restricted b preconflict planning it is thought that many wmd sites or potential leads were spoiled or destroyed by looting and the deliberate destructi on of documents facilities and safe houses in future prec onflict planning should include provision of military elements following behind fr ont line battlegroups tasked to gather immediately documents and materiel of potential use in investigations c reachback the reachback facility to the uk was coordinated through the defence intelligence staff in london which compensated for the absence of some areas of expertise in the isg this worked well d j1j4 issues 1 the need for uk one star in coalition two star organisation was essential the personality was as import ant as the rank but the post usually gave the uk senior access to discussi ons and made the uk point of view hard to ignore the lesson was drawn t hat senior dis manager should also have deployed to act as lead analyst dis focal point in theatre and mentor to the high grade but relatively juni or inexperienced dis staff deployed 2 the british exun arms inspecto rs were invaluable and brought with them experience and corporate memory their expertise wa s also recognised and valued by coalition officers and assi sted in influencing isg strategy 3 the uk national cell includi ng national j1j4 clerical and communications support was essential to the good administration and morale of the british individua ls assigned to the isg 4 the uk provided interrogators to t he isg who with their knowledge of legal processes and experience significantly assisted the sensitive debriefing aspects of the isgs mission 5 there were however significant shortcomings in the recruitment application process and selection of t he dis analysts and the cpacretained subject matter experts including the former arms inspectors one british member of the isg commented that th national manageme nt of british civilians in the isg was disgraceful these individuals were highly skilled and often very experienced their pay and conditions including sick pay death benefit and leave shoul d therefore be examined carefully in order that high value civilian staff are treated properly during any future deployment flexible and attractive temporary civil servant or military reservist pay and conditions package should be worked out ready for use in future deployments2 j2 issues 1 the us noforn issue was the biggest single impediment to uk operations within the isg it embraced us software and databases on the

restricted c4 restricted coalition siprnet tendency for us office rs to use us only systems and in some cases the use of it systems with coalition access in usled coalition the us must be convinced to allow work on systems accessible to coalition individuals within the organisa tion from the outset both so that they can contribute to the work and also maintain situational awareness of developments in the work of the organisation 2 the uk sometimes caused simila r difficulties in the release of intelligence products to the us and aust ralia the uk should consider four eyes default setting for uk intelligence product release to group such as the isg as it tends to do sewhere in the j2 field f j3j5 issues 1 it is often desirable for the uk to become involved in mission like the isg getting involved means producing people on the ground in reasonable numbers and often in short order as t he states doing it from the inside is the only real way to achieve si gnificant influence having joined the uk must give wholehearted support acro ss the various disciplines and ranks the uk can appear tightfisted about manpower and senior us officers become bored with uk specia l pleading regarding limited resources in short care must be taken not to presume in fluence without significant deployed presence 2 the j5 planning task wa s not well handled by the military or the overall strategic function of the isg the uk may have to be robust in any future mission in order to ensure that the val ue and practical applic ation of j5 plans is fully appreciated 3 the predeployment training given to military and civilian members of the isg was inconsistent in quality timeliness and content in any future mission the predeployment training of the civilian elements including any dis analysts should be carefully planned to ensure that it is tailored to the individuals concerned and t he current situation 4 while the general weapons carriage policy for mod civilians was clear some weapon training and carriage of personal weapons would have been beneficial in the very difficult security si tuation pertaining in iraq it is important that mod civilians are not danger to themselves or liability to others in such situations while there are understandable concerns about mod civilians carrying weapons the policy sh ould be related to the threat in theatre 5 the chemical detection dogs capability was successfully developed and trialled and may have wider utility both in uk and in other theatres overseas restricted c5 restricted g j6 issues 1 the british contingent had to bo rrow eight bowman personal role radio sets from the army for interc ommunications during road moves or exploitation missions during any future ad hoc deployments the uk contingent should be

sovereignty to the ir aqi interim government on 28 jun 04 added further potential difficulties regar ding the rules on detention which were relevant to the uk role in debriefing some of the high value detainees strong consideration should be given to the assignment of legal adviser to any uk commander or group in coalition operation when sensitive issues including debriefing and det ention are likely to arise formal review and promulgation of uk interrogation debr iefing and detention guidance to uk staff embedded with coalition units is essential 9 conclusion over 1600 isg mission or exploitation activities were completed over 4000 debriefings were carried out and c40 million pages of documents were scanned and processed by the isg the isg established fact s regarding wmd after 30 years of activity by the secretive and aggressive baathist regi and while relative ly small quantities of wmd materiel were found much better understanding of the longterm wmd programmes and the intent behind them was gained the isg emphasised the power and pot ential of multiagen cy multinational and mixed civilian or ganisation the uk civilians and servicemen and women who served in the isg acquitted themselves we ll and many felt that they had gained much from the experience the isg offers an example of an integrated model which could be effective in intelligence and intelligence support operations in the future b the exclusion of uk personnel fr om information and decisionmaking for reasons of us noforn rules militated against successful working and needed some robust interventions on occasion while this may be factor on future missions it is an issue that needs to be raised at the outset when national contributions are offered c the key uk lessons centre around people issues particularly for the civilian element the provision of legal advice for potentially sensitive activities intelligence sharing with the us and national communicati ons and life support issues most of these insights are not unique to the isg similar observations have appeared in previous operational lessons reports and campaign analyses restricted c6 restricted d the issue of terms and conditions of service including the policy on training in and the carriage of weapons fo r the british civilian individuals attached to the isg or any future ad hoc international team emerges as needing investigation and policy resolution the uk can often contribute very capable and experienced individuals to such missions but it is appar ent from the isg exper ience at least that it needs to

and was himself hit by 762mm bullet which penetr ated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire beharry continued to push through the extended ambush still leading his platoon until he broke clean he then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of amarah to the outside of the cimic house outpost which was receivin g small arms fire from the surrounding area once he had brought his vehicle to halt out side without thought for his own personal safety he climbed onto the turret of the stillburning vehicle and seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret off t he vehicle and to the safety of nearby warrior he then returned once again to his vehicle and agai n mounted the exposed turret to lift out the vehicles gunner and move him to position of safety exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the bur ning vehicle to lead t he disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety remounting his burning vehicle for the third time he drove it through complex chicane and in to the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost thus denying it to the enemy only at this stage did beharry pull the fire extinguisher handles immobilising the engine of the vehicle dismounted and then moved himself into the relative sa fety of the back of another wa rrior once inside beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and m ental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated having returned to duty following medical treatment on the 11th june 2004 beharrys warrior was part of quick reaction force tasked to attempt to cut off mortar team that had attacked coalition force base in amarah as the lead vehicle of the platoon he was moving rapidly through the dark city str eets towards the suspected firing point when his vehicle was ambushed by the enemy from ries of rooftop positions during this initial heavy weight of enemy fire rocket propelled grenade detonated on the vehicles frontal armour just six inches from beharrys head resulting in serious head injury other rockets struck the turret and sides of the vehi cle incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew with the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision b eharry managed to continue to control his vehicle and forcef ully reversed the warrior out of the ambush area the vehicle continued to move until it stru ck the wall of nearby building and came to rest beharry then lost consciousness as result of his wounds by moving the vehicle out of the enemys chosen killing ar ea he enabled other warrior crews to be able to extract his crew from his vehicle with greatly reduced risk from incoming fire despite receiving serious restricted d3 restricted head injury which later saw him being listed as very seriously injured and in coma for some time his levelheaded actions in the face of heavy and accurate enemy fire at short range again almost certainly saved the lives of his crew and provided the conditions for their safe evacuation to medical treatment beharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour despite intense direct attacks personal injury and damage to hi s vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action
