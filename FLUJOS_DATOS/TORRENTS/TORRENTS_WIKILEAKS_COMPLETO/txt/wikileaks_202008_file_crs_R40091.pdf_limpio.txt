provides an overview of selected campaign finance policy issues that have received recent legislative attention or have otherwise been prominent and which could receive attention during the 111th congress specifically the report discusses seven issues 1 bundling 2 electronic filing of senate campaign finance reports 3 the federal election commission fec 4 hybrid political advertising 5 joint fundraising committees 6 public financing of presidential campaigns and 7 527 organizations the report includes brief overview of each issue followed by discussion of recent legislation if any and policy considerations recent legislative or regulatory activity developments during the 2008 election cycle or combination of all those factors suggest that each issue will remain topic of debate during the 111 th congress this report is not intended to provide an exhaustive discussion of each topic in some cases noted throughout the report other crs products provide additional detail the topics addressed in this report are typically considered separately suggesting targeted legislation if congress chooses to revisit the issues however the 111 th congress could also consider broad legislation addressing one or more campaign finance issues however congress decides to proceed the debate will likely be shaped by questions of 1 amounts and sources of money 2 transparency and 3 scope of regulation as the final section of this report discusses these factors unify the seemingly disparate policy issues discussed in the report and are common themes in the debate over campaign finance policy

during the 110th congress approximately 50 legislative measures affecting federal campaign finance policy were introduced two became law1 most significantly the honest leadership and open government act hloga pl 11081 restricted campaign travel aboard private aircraft and required political committees to report additional information to the fec about certain contributions bundled by lobbyists in addition late in the second session of the 110 th congress the fecs administrative fine program which had been scheduled to expire was extended until 2013 pl 110433 other issues received hearings or floor votes but did not become law these included house passage of legislation affecting campaign payments to candidate families hr 2630 schiff disbursement of campaign funds by nontreasurers hr 3032

congress may be addressed again during the 111th congress others became prominent during recent election cycles especially 2008 the following discussion provides additional detail about selected issues that may continue to be on the legislative or oversight agenda g4g158g151g141g149g146g151g144g561 bundling is fundraising practice in which an intermediary either receives contributions and passes them on to campaign or is credited with soliciting contributions that go directly to campaign lobbyists often serve as bundlers bundling has been prominent in recent years both because of the additional disclosure required in hloga and because of the role bundling played in the 2008 presidential elections 3 bundling opponents contend the practice allows individuals to circumvent the federal election campaign act feca4 by delivering larger contributions than they could on their own even though those contributions are funded by multiple sources5 critics also point to anecdotal evidence suggesting that some contributions routed through bundlers might have been coerced or come from impermissible sources6 nonetheless bundling is not prohibited by feca or fec regulations it is also common fundraising practice at least two bundling issues could face the 111th congress first congress may wish to monitor ongoing implementation of the hloga bundling provisions second existing requirements are either easily circumvented or do not cover some common bundling activities which raises the question of whether additional regulation is needed7 3 see for example brody mullins and

the agency website at httpwwwfecgovagenda2008mtgdoc0848pdf those rules cannot be finalized until the commission approves an accompanying explanation and justification document at the december 18 fec meeting at which the rules were approved chairman donald mcgahn stated that the explanation and justification document could be considered in january 2009 audio from that pro ceeding is available at httpwwwfecgovaudio2008 20081218_06mp3 implementation also requires publication of the rules and the ej in the federal register httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40091g5g138g150g153g138g146g144g151g561g8g146

reporting information about bundling the second emphasizes further regulating bundling practices from the reporting disclosure perspective key question is whether campaigns should continue to be permitted to provide information only about bundling by registered lobbyists or organizations employing lobbyists if so existing requirements could be sufficient provided that congress is satisfied with the reporting criteria tablished in hloga ie disclosure of two or more bundled contributions during sixmonth period totaling at least 15000 8 on the other hand congress may wish to increase transparency about bundling overall including by non lobbyists relatively straightforward way to do so could be to extend the existing disclosure requirements to cover bundling by anyone regardless of profession9 during the 110th congress s 2030 obama essentially proposed such an approach the bill did not advance beyond committee referral10 even with additional reporting requirements how ever bundling is likely to continue if congress adopted the view that bundling should be discouraged or reduced additional regulation could be necessary for example limits could be applied to the amount or number of contributions arranged by single bundler bundling could also be banned altogether depending on specifics however ban could prohibit even basic fundraising involving multiple contributors for those who believe that bundling circumvents feca additional restrictions or disclosure requirements could enhance transparency limit the prevalence of bundling or both on the other hand those restrictions could increase compliance burdens for the regulated community finally those who view bundling as an efficient and effective fundraising practice may object to further regulation

unlike all other federal political committees except those raising or spending less than 50000 annually senate campaign committees party committees and political action committees pacs are not required to file campaign finance reports electronically 11 senate reports are also unique because they are filed with the secretary of the senate rather than directly with the fec in the 110th congress the senate committee on rules and administration reported s 223 feingold which would have extended electronic filing to senate reports the bill was never considered on the senate floor despite attempts to bring it up under unanimous consent despite the lack of success in the 110th congress electronic filing remains widely popular policy proposal 8 2 usc 434i 9 an alternative approach could be to strengthen existing restrictions on conduits and earmarked contributions see 2 usc 441aa8 although those requirements appear to require that bundled contributions count against the bundlers personal contribution limit they can be easily avoided by designating bundlers as campaign fundraisers 10 four other bills introduced in the 110th congresshr 776 meehan s 436 feingold hr 4294 price nc and s 2412 feingoldalso contained bundling provisions many of these provisions were eventually enacted in hloga after some of the four bills cited above had been drafted and introduced

campaign finance reports be filed electronically second if so where should those reports be filed the primary arguments in favor of electronic filing concern efficiency and expense currently contractor converts the paper reports filed with the secretary into electronic format the fec then makes the reports publicly available on the internet the conversion process can take weeks or months at reported cost of 250000 annually 12 as result house campaign finance data filed electronically and directly with the fec are routinely available well before senate data various members of congress campaign fina nce groups and media organizations have supported electronic filing both the fec and the secretary of the senate have stated publicly that their offices are or can be prepared to administer electronic filing13 electronic filing could eliminate the conversion process and make public disclosure of the data much faster electronic filing could therefore improve transparency and reduce costs requiring electronic filing of senate reports would also place the same filing responsibilities on senate committees that currently exist for house candidate committees party committees and pacs as result uniform filing standards would apply to all political committees there is little if any notable opposition to electronic filing itself however some members have called for addressing other campaign finance disclosure issues alongside electronic filing for example attempts in the 110th congress to bring up s 223 were unsuccessful amid dispute over whether the bill would be amended to require groups filing ethics complaints to disclose their donors14 similarly at march 2007 senate rules and administration committee hearing on s 223 senator stevens emphasized the need to also consider disclosure requirements for 527 organizations filing location has been secondary issue of debate senate reports are currently filed with the secretary of the senate rather than with the fec bypassing filing with the secretary of the senate could make reports more readily accessible to the public and could reduce delay or costs associated with transmitting the reports to the fec if campaign finance reports are considered senate documents however some may object to their being filed with the fec during the 110th congress senator feinstein reported at markup of s 223 that senator byrd raised concerns about the possibility of filing directly with the fe c because he viewed filing with the secretary as matter of senate prerogative15 12 statement of sen dianne feinstein

enforces civil compliance with campaign finance law16 the commission also facilitates disclosure of federal campaign finance data and administers the presidential public financing program17 six presidentially appointed commissioners lead the agency the senate may confirm or reject nominations to the fec18 the 110th congress enacted one bill affecting the agencys functioning pl 110433 which president george w bush signed in october 2008 extended authority for the fecs administrative fine program afp until 2013 the program had been set to expire at the end of 2008 the afp sets standard penalties for routine financialreporting violations and requires fewer resources than the commissions full enforcement process

continuing resolution which has the effect of freezing agency funding at the 592 million appropriated for fy200819 steven t walther the agencys incoming 2009 chairman has expressed concern that maintaining existing funding levels inhibit the commissions ability to pay approximately 19 million in staff salary increases 900000 rent increase walther recently noted that as consequence the commission cannot expand its services and will constrict some others20 an appropriation of 636 million which would presumably address the fecs current financial constraints was recommended in the presidents budget for fy2009 the house and senate appropriations committees also recommended that amount beyond appropriations congress could choose to undertake legislative or oversight action related to the agency the senate may also be asked to consider fec nominations during the 111th congress perhaps the most fundamental policy question surrounding the fec is the status of the agency itself questions about the commissions structure and effectiveness particularly regarding enforcement have long been topic of debate21 in the 110th congress for example two similar bills hr 421 meehan and s 478 m ccain would have replaced the fec with proposed federal election administration fea22 major provisions of those bills would have established threemember governing body with enhanced enforcement powers neither bill 16 for the 1974 amendments see pl 93443 88 stat 1263 17 the treasury department and irs also have administrative responsibilities for presidential public financing 18

during the 111th congress nonetheless fec reform has not been the subject of sustained legislative activity during recent congresses other fec issues would not necessarily warrant legislative action but could be relevant for oversight or appropriations matters in particular congress may wish to monitor the agency as the fec continues to recover from sixmonth loss of its policymaking quorum between january and june 2008 only two commissioners remained in office due to nominations dispute 23 as result the commission was unable to approve among other things agency rules and enforcement actions additional nominees were confirmed in june 2008 bringing the agency back to full policymaking strength the commi ssion continues to work through backlog of enforcement cases24 the fec has announced that it will hold january 2009 hearing on various issues related to its operations including enforcement25 several rulemakings also remain pending in particular the commission has yet to finalize the hloga bundling and travel regulations finally nominations to the fec subject to senate advice and consent are possible during the 111th congress in april 2009 the terms of two comm issioners will expire the term of third commissioner has already expired however as discussed below this does not necessarily mean that additional nominations will occur as table 1 shows the term26 of commissioner ellen weintraub expired in 200727 she remains at the agency in holdover status the terms of commissioners donald mcgahn and steven walther will expire on april 30 2009 the president may make additional nominations to fill these seats or the incumbents may remain in office in holdover status commissioner may remain in office after the expiration of his or term unless or until 1 the

candidates of political party eg john doe and our democratic team29 hybrid ads are of potential legislative concern because of costsharing practice associated with the ads with traditional advertising the sponsoring entity typica lly covers all costs with hybrid advertising the party and the candidates campaign committee share costs an fec rulemaking on the issue has been open since may 200730 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the controversy over hybrid advertising concerns whether the method of paying for those advertisements undermines feca those calling for additional regulation of hybrid ads have suggested that costsharing represents loophole that permits parties to improperly subsidize campaign spending31 this is particularly noteworthy for publicly financed presidential campaigns which must agree to limit their spending as condition of receiving public funds costsharing might also be viewed as way of circumventing limits on coordinated party expenditures32 those who object to current costsharing practices allege that shared costs primarily benefit only the named candidate yet allow that candidates campaign committee to pay for only portion eg 50 of the advertising some groups have urged the fec to adopt regulations attributing 100 of the cost to the named candidate33 if congress determines that additional regulation of hybrid advertising is necessary it could wait for the fecs ongoing rulemaking to proceed however it is unclear if or when the agency will issue new rules alternatively congress could legislate particular costsharing requirements doing so could close the arguable loophole surrounding hybrid ads but would also involve legislating in technical area more typically left to the fec34 29

ads do not circumvent feca or that additional regulation is unnecessary those opposed to additional restrictions suggest that existing fec regulations provide sufficient guidance on various costsharing arrangements including hybrid advertising additional restrictions including legislation could also minimize parties flexibility to allocate costs according to individual circumstances that flexibility was central concern for various party representatives who testified at july 2007 fec hearing 35 finally costsharing associated with hybrid ads could also be viewed as the continuation of long tradition of various contacts between parties and campaigns during campaigns36 therefore some may fear that additional restrictions on hybrid advertising could threaten the relationship between parties and candidates g12g152g146g151g157g561g8g158g151g141g155g138g146g156g146g151g144g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g156g561 joint fundraising committees were particularly active in the 2008 presidential race but also supported house and senate contests37 joint committees are of potential legislative concern because some observers contend that they facilitate large contributions that would otherwise be impermissible under feca feca limits contributions from individuals as shown in table 2 in 20072008 individuals could contribute more than 4600 to candidate campaign 2300 for the primary campaign and another 2300 for the generalelection campaign 38 as shows individuals could also donate up to 28500 annually to national party committees and up to 10000 annually to state or

or restricted those who wanted to support more than one political committee would have to contribute directly to those committees within the limits established in feca applying the coordination restrictions to joint committees could limit the amount of permissible transfers among committees any of these options could make it more difficult for individuals to make contributions to single source in the hopes of benefitting multiple recipients conversely congress could choose to maintain the status quo if it determines that joint committees do not violate the spirit of feca in turn this conclusion depends on whether one believes that joint committees are backdoor method of supporting individual candidates or whether joint committees support variety of partybuilding activities as existing feca provisions and fec regulations appear to assume some also contend that joint committees represent an efficient way to funnel large aggr egate contributions in permissible amounts to targeted states and political committees legislative action is necessary to maintain the status quo

prominent campaign finance issue during the 2008 election cycle was the status of the presidential 44 public financing system even before the 2008 campaigns began in earnest the cycle was widely perceived as the last in which the current public financing system could survive without major reform the program suffer s from low taxpayer participation resulting in funding shortfalls during recent elections45 as the programs financial resources and public participation generally declined in recent elections so did participation by major candidates in 2008 eight candidates received pecf matching funds during the primaries senator mccain the republican nominee received public funds during the generalelection campaign senator obama the democratic nominee became the first majorparty nominee since the programs inception to completely decline public funds some observers have suggested that senator obamas decision to opt out of public financing combined with the other challenges discussed above marks the death knell of the program others contend that the public financing program can work well again if reformed continued regulations concerning coordinated expenditures coordinated party

campaigns particularly for the general election nonetheless as noted above public financing has become less appealing to candidates in recent elections other developments such as joint fundraising committees allegedly threaten the programs intended emphasis on limiting private fundraising in exchange for public funds maintaining the status quo would leave the public financing program unchanged if that approach is taken however there is widespread agreement that the most competitive candidates will continue to forego public funds as result the program could be in danger of providing funding only for those candidates with limited chance of success as the preceding discussion suggests funda mental policy question is what roleif any congress wants public financing to play in presidential campaigns if that role is to be prominent one there is broad agreement that the program needs to be at least partially revamped making the program more attractive to competitive candidates particularly through increased spending limits is major focus of several reform proposals such efforts will not come without costs an infusion of funds through an increased checkoff designation 46 other revenue sources increased taxpayer participation or combination of all three would likely be necessary public financing can also be controversial along ideological lines which suggests that strong political will and coalitionbuilding will be necessary if changes to the program are to be enacted in the aftermath of the 2008 election cycle the related issue of small contributions has also been prominent topic of debate although publicly financed generalelection candidates must agree to forgo private fundraising for their campaigns public financing is designed to supplement small private contributions during the primary campaign currently the presidential election campaign fund pecf provides 100 match of individua l primary contributions up to 250 providing additional matching funds have been major component of recent reform proposals during the 110 th congress four bills hr 776 meehan hr 4294 price nc s 436 feingold and s 2412 feingold that proposed to restructure the pecf would have matched small contributions at 400 or 500 rather than the current 100 in addition the maximum matching contribution would have been lowered to 200 from the current 250 increasing the match rate from the current 100 to 400 or 500 could increase the effect of small contributions it could also provide substantially greater resources to publicly financed candidates however this approach assumes that sufficient funds would be available in the pecf to cover the additional match in fact sufficient funds have been unavailable during portions of recent election cycles47 nonetheless proposals to reform the public financing program typically include revisions to funding mechanisms congress could also renew the focus on small contributions by permitting publicly financed campaigns to spend larger or unlimited amounts of funds raised through small contributions this approach might or might not include matching funds the effect could be to encourage candidates to focus their efforts on small contributions while still providing government assistance for some campaign needs 46 currently individual taxpayers may designate 3 to the fund married couples filing jointly may designate 6 47 see crs report rl34534 public financing of presidential campaigns overview and analysis by r sam garrett httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40091g5g138g150g153g138g146g144g151g561g8g146

contain campaign costs another program goal particularly for those candidates who were able to raise and spend virtually unlimited amounts in fact if spending limits were eliminated public financing could become an additional but potentially unnecessary funding source for those already able to raise substantial private funds finally public financing could be repealed this approach would largely or entirely depending on specifics eliminate taxpayer funds in presidential campaigns in the 110th congress two bills hr 72 bartlett hr 484 dool ittle would have repealed parts of the program or the

candidate committees party committees and pacs 48 in recent years socalled 527 organizations have shaped some elections even though they are not typically considered to be political committees49 america coming together and swift boat veterans for truth for example were prominent and controversial in 2004 much of the concern surrounding 527s has involved the argument that millions of dollars from these organizations affect federal elections without necessarily being regulated by feca50 the precise nature of 527s financial impact is open to debate as various research organizations and interest groups classify individual groups activities differently and rely on different data51 nonetheless and despite differing data and interpretations of those data research has consistently shown decreased activity among 527s during the 2008 cycle compared with the 2004 cycle table 3 displays financial summaries from two prom inent sources cq moneyline commercial tracking service and the center for responsive politics crp52 both sources show that 527s receipts and expenditures during the 2008 cycle were far below those of the 2004 cycle53 48 on the definition of political committees see 2 usc 4314 see also 26 usc 90029 and 26 usc 90328 49 if congress chooses to revisit 527s it may also encounter questions related to organizations regulated under section 501c of the irc there is some evidence that 501c4 organizations are also becoming active in federal campaigns see for example campaign finance institute outside soft money groups approaching 400 million in targeted spending

however may offer different data or interpretation 53 in interpreting the data it is important to note that overall fundraising and spending are not n ecessarily proxy for involvement or influence in federal elections the variance in the data shown in table 3 also underscore that the precise nature of 527s activities is sometimes unclear

regulatory perspectives54 financially 527s remain significant force surrounding some targeted races55 527s also continue to command substantial financial resources overall nonetheless 527s decreased financial activity suggests that the issue might not receive as much policy attention as 527s have in recent years even with decreased financial activity however th matter of regulating 527s continues to be controversial indeed the major policy question surrounding 527s is whether all such organizations should be regulated as political committees under feca 56 thus far the fec has made casebycase determinations of whether 527s activities required them to register as political committees particularly after the 2004 elections the fec assessed major fines against some 527s for failing to register as political committees however because fines were not assessed until well after the election and represented small portion of the organizations operating budgets some 54 litigation has also occurred on the 527 issue that topic is beyond the scope of this report 55 see for example campaign finance institute outside soft money groups approaching 400 million in targeted spending in 2008 election 56

committees in the 110th congress hr 420 meehan and s 463 mccain would have amended feca to treat 527s as political committees with some exceptions requiring 527s to register as political committees would make those organizations subject to contribution limits and other requirements in feca just as all political committees are today those advocating additional regulation of 527s generally suggest that these groups activities clearly influence federal elections and therefore should be captured by feca others however contend that placing additional regulations on 527s is unnecessary and could stifle the groups political speech 59

recordbreaking 5 billion is believed to have been spent during the 2008 federal elections60 the pace and amount of fundraising in the presidential campaign has been of particular concern to some interest groups and members of the media61 the campaigns of just two presidential candidates john mccain and barack obama spent combined 8603 million during the 2008 election cycle62 for some the 2008 figures suggest that the campaign finance system is in need of significant reform others contend that the primary focus should not be on the amount of money in politics but on the way in which that money is regulated for many existing regulation is already too cumbersome the 2008 election cycle will undoubtedly inform deliberations about how if at all to examine campaign finance policy during

elections others have been prominent for several election cycles and have received congressional attention in the past all the issues discussed in this report are essentially technical questions about how to regulate particular facet of campaigns reaching consensus on these points can be difficult there are however common themes that tend to organize the debate over campaign finance policy even when members of congress disagree about part icular approaches these themes can serve as useful starting points for considering policy options and debate

some the billions of dollars involved in federal campaigns signal potential corruption the money chase of campaigns also allegedly prevents candidates and officeholders from concentrating on serving their constituents 63 others counter that fundraising is an important test of candidates political viability and that the amount of money spent on american elections is far less than the amount spent on consumer goods64 it is unlikely that this ideologically charged debate will be resolved in the foreseeable future even if the debate over amounts money is not resolved sources of funds could be ripe for legislation or oversight the debate over 527s demonstrates that some entities financial activities remain contentious similarly the debate over public financing can be viewed as an attempt to steer candidates toward lower campaign spending with incentives or requirements to limit private fundraising bundling hybrid advertising and joint fundraising also raise policy questions about whether these funding sources should be further regulated 65 g22g155g138g151g156g153g138g155g142g151g140g162g561 transparency is typically accomplished through disclosure most of that information is then made publicly available the details of which activities should be disclosed and in which amounts are sometimes controversial but disclosure is generally accepted as hallmark of campaign finance policy the debate over electronic filing of senate campaign finance reports has the most obvious connections to transparency for some the current form of paper filing is wasteful and causes unnecessary delay in providing information to the public for others broader disclosure concerns should also be addressed if senate electronic filing is reconsidered senate prerogative may also be concern 63 the money chase analogy appears in david b magleby and candice j nelson the money chase congressional campaign finance reform washington brookings institution press 1990 64 on the latter point see for example

perspective in particular new disclosure requirements related to bundlingenacted in the 110th congress and potentially subject to expansion or revision during the 111th congressrepresent an effort to provide more information about how some large contributions are raised on the other hand those efforts may cause an additional compliance burden or inhibit some donors from participating at least as they otherwise would g21g140g152g153g142g561g152g143g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 perhaps the most fundamental questions in campaign finance policy is which behaviors should be subject to feca or fec regulations and to what extent as congress decides how or whether to address campaign finance issues in the 111th congress these questions are again likely to be at the forefront of debate all the policy issues addressed in this report could involve placing new requirements on members of the regulated community among the issues discussed in this report debate has essentially focused on whether bundling electronic filing hybrid advertising joint fundraising recent developments in presidential public financing and 527s undermine various requirements in feca more generally the fec itself may be reevaluated if congress determines that its structure or effectiveness is insufficient for current needs if congress decides to address these or other campaign finance issues key question will be whether they are to be considered alone or jointly all the issues discussed in this report could be selfcontained some of the issues are also interactive this is particularly true for presidential campaign financing which has clear connections to public financing bundling hybrid advertising and joint fundraising
