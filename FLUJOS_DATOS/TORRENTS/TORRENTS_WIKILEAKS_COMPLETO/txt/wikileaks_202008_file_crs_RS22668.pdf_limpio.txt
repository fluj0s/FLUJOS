color religion sex handicap familial status or national origin it does not prohibit discrimination on these bases in the sale or rental itself in some cases that can include roommate situations specifically the fha does not apply to sales or rentals in some cases in which single family home is sold or rented without th services of real estate agent and it does not apply to the sale or rental of rooms or units in dwellings occupied by more than four families if the owner occupies one of the rooms or its 42 usc 3603b the fhas prohibition of advertising for legal conduct arguably violates the first amendment but the threejudge panel did not consider the question and for that reason th banc court also did not consider it see footnote 40 of the banc opinioncomputer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider3 the defendant in this case roommate is website th at helps individuals find roommates based on thei r descriptions of themselves and their roommate preferences it furnishes such members with online questionnaires through which the members disclose information about themselves and their roommate preferences based on such characteristics as age sex and whether child ren will live in the household they can then provide additional comments thr ough an openende d essay prompt4 the plaintiff in this case charged that roommate had violated the fair housing act which prohibits among other things publishing or causing to be published any statement such as an advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of dwelling that indicates any preference based on race color religion sex handicap familial status or national origin 42 usc 3604c5 the plaintiff alleged that roommate had violated this provision in three ways 1 by posting its questionnaires 2 by posting and distributing by email profiles ba sed on the questionnaires and 3 by posting the additional comments that members provide roommate claimed that it was immune from liability under 47 usc 230c and threejudge pa nel of the ninth circuit ruled as follows with respect to the three charges against roommate judge kozinski roommate was immune only with respect to charge 3 judge reinhardt roommate was immune with respect to none of the charges judge ikuta roommate was immune only with respect to charges 2 and 3 thus there were votes for immunity with respect to charge 1 one vote for immunity with respect to charge 2 and two votes for immunity with respect to charge 3 roommate thus received majority in its favor only with respect to charge 3 this coincided with judge kozinskis vote so judge kozinskis opinion became the opinion of the court judge kozinskis opinion concludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22668crs3 6 489 f3d at 929930 7 489 f3d at 925 8 id at 926 9 id at 929 10 id 11 the banc decision discussed below stated that in carafano we correctly held that the website was immune but incorrectly suggested th at it could never be liable because dating continuedhaving determined that the cda does not i mmunize roommate for all of the content on its website we remand for determination of whether its nonimmune publication and distribution of informati on violates the fha 42 usc 3404c6 kozinski opinion in his opinion for the court judge alex kozinski acknowledged that roommate is immune so long as it merely publishes info rmation provided by its members however roommate is not immune for providing materials as to which it is an information content provider content provider is any person or entity that is responsible in whole or in part for the creation or developm ent of information provided through the internet 47 usc 230f3 emphasis added by judge kozinski7 with respect to the three alleged violations of the fha with which roommate was charged judge kozinski found that 1 roommate is responsible for these questionnaires because it create d or developed the forms and answer choices as result roommate is conten t provider of these questionna ires and does not qualify for cda immunity for their publication8 2 roommate does not merely passively pass on information it has received from members wh it publishes and distributes members profiles but by categorizing channe ling and limiting the distribution of users profiles roommate provi des an additional layer of inform ation that it is responsible at least in part for creating or developing9 and 3 roommate is not responsible in whole or in part for the creation or developm ent of its users an swers to the openended additional comments form and is imm une from liability for publishing these responses10 roommate however is not immune fo r 1 posting its questionnaires or 2 posting and distributing members profiles this does not necessarily mean that roommate violated the fha but only that if it did it is not immune under 47 usc 230c in reaching his conclusion with respect to the second charge against roommate posting and distributing profiles based on the questionnaires judge kozinski distinguished the ninth circuit case of carafano v metrosplashcom inc 339 f3d 1119 9th cir 2003 in carafano as kozinski wrote in roommatescom an unidentified prankster placed fraudulent personal ad on da matching website we held that the cda exempted the service from liability for two reasons first the dating service was not an information content provider for the profiles on its website although the website required users to complete tailed questionnaires pr ofile had any content until user actively created it11 second even if the da ting service could be consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22668crs4 11 continued profile has any content until user actively creates it as we explain above even if the data are supplied by third parties website operator ma still contribute to the contents illegality and thus be liable as developer slip op at 3468 citations omitted 12 489 f3d at 927928 the distinction between these two reasons for exempting the dating service is subtle as carafano itself put it even assuming matchmaker could be considered an information content provider the statute precl udes treatment as publisher or speaker for any information provided by another information content provider 47 usc 230c1 emphasis added by the court 339 f3d at 1125 in other wo rds even if the fact that some of the content was formulated in response to matchmakers questionnaire id at 1124 is considered sufficient to make matchmaker an information c ontent provider the information that it provided was furnished by others 13 489 f3d at 928 14 id at 933a content provider for publishing its customers profiles it was exempt from liability because it did not create or develop the particular information at issue12 after providing this summary of carafano judge kozinski explained carafano differs from our case in at least one significant respect the prankster in carafano provided information that was not so licited by the operator of the website the website sought information about the individual posting the information not about unwitting third parties while carafano is written in broad terms it must be read in light of its facts carafano provided cda immunity for information posted by third party that was not in any nse created or developed by the website operator indeed that was provided despite the websites rules and policies13 reinhardt opinion in the second opinion in roommatescom judge stephen reinhardt joined judge kozinskis opinion for the court but dissented with respect to kozinskis finding that roommate was immune from liability for the third charge against it posting members additional comments judge reinhardt s difference of opinion stemmed from his differing interpretation of the facts of th case as he found objective and subjective evidence that roommate solicits users to set forth discriminatory requirements in the additional comments14 ikuta opinion in the third opinion in roommatescom judge sandra s ikuta concurred with judge kozinskis opinion for the court that roommate was not immune from liability for the first charge against it and was immune from liability for the third charge against it but unlike judges kozinski and reinhardt j udge ikuta believed that roommate was also immune from liability for the second charge against it which again was posting and distributing members profiles she reached this conclusion because she disagreed with judge kozinski that carafano was distinguishable from roommatescom carafano controlled this case she wrote because it held that website operator does not become an information content provider by soliciting particular type of information or byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22668crs5 15 id 16 slip op at 3457 17 id at 3472 18 id at 3475selecting editing or republishing that information15 as carafano held that 47 usc 230c protects information that is solicite d it was immaterial that as judge kozinski noted the customer in carafano but not in roommatescom had provided information that the website had not solicited the banc decision the banc ninth circuit opinion was written by judge kozinski and ruled in the same way that the panel decision had with respect to roommates three alleged violations of the fha finding that it was immune only with respect to the third the banc decision was 8 to 3 with the three dissenter s joining in an opinion by judge mckeown with respect to roommates first and second alleged violations of the fha as listed on page 2 in the pdf and print versions of this report judge kozinski wrote for the majority the cda does not grant immunity for inducing third parties to express illegal preferences roommates own acts posting the questionnaire and requiring answers to it are entirely its doing and thus section 230 of th cda does not apply to them roommate is entitled to immunity16 with respect to roommates third allege d violation of the fha judge kozinski wrote roommate publishes these comments as written it does not provide any specific guidance as to what the essay should cont ain nor does it urge subscribers to input discriminatory preferences roommate is not responsible in whole or in part for the development of this content which comes entirely from subscribers and is passively displayed by roommate without reviewin g every essay roommate would have way to distinguish unlawful discriminatory preferences from perfectly legitimate statements this is precisely the kind of situation for which section 230 was designed to provide immunity17 as he had done in his decision for the th reejudge panel judge kozinski remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the alleged actions for which roommate is not immune violate the fa ir housing act 42 usc 3604c18 effect of the decision debate has arisen over how farreaching the decision in roommatescom will be specifically whether it will preclude 230 c immunity to search engines such as google the dissent in the banc decision wrote the consequences of the majoritys interpretation are farreaching its position will chill speech on the internet and impede the continued development of the

computer services and other interactive media 230b1 to the extent the majority strips immunity because of sorting channeling and categorizing functions it guts the heart of 230c1 immunity19 the majority opinion in the banc decision stated roommates search function is designed to steer users based on discriminatory criteria roommates search engine thus differs materially from generic search engines such as google yahoo and msn live search ordinary search engines do not use unlawful criteria to limit the scope of searches conducted on them 20 the dissent however warned that google might be in danger because it ranks search results provides prompts beyond what the user enters and answers questions21 one commentator wrote the opinion suggests that neutral tools wont be liable but all search engines tweak their results to some extent there is such thing as neutral search engine22 she added roommate needs to be limited to its facts another commentator who was c oncerned by the decision wrote if the supreme court lets the decision stand i predict that it will significantly increase litigation and chill internet activity eg sites like roommates will be much less efficient as prompts become bulletin boards the reason im skeptical is that litigation if often done in bad faith as any real litigator will tell you the point of litigation isnt necessarily to vindicate right but to harass an opponent with discovery document productions and other xpensive tactics so long as claim is plausible you can inflict real damage and maybe get favorable settlement even if you think you will ultimately lose the beauty of broad brightline immunity under section 230 is that it allows parties to end this type of litigation quickly if google or craigslist gets sued for content its users create then the companies can immediately file summary judgment motion or motion to dismiss and end the case before discovery begins if that line becomes less bright then its harder to shut down frivolous or at least losing litigation early23 finally another commentat or was less concerned if other sites simply ask people to post their ads and let others search the ads in full text but without expressly asking fo r sexfamilial statusetc preferences and specifically providing searches for such preferences the nth circuit opinion suggests they will be immune this is not substantial retrenchment of the preexisting law under 47 usc 230 which offe rs great deal of immunity for those internet outlets that merely pass along others speech24
