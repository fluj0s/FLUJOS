and trade division congressional research service the library of congress the proposed authorities of director of national intelligence issues for congress and sidebyside comparison of s 2845 hr 10 and current law summary the 911 commission in its recent report on the attacks of september 11 2001 criticized the us intelligence communitys ic fragmented management structure and questioned whether the us government and the ic in particular is organized adequately to direct resources and build the intelligence capabilities that the united states will need to counter terrorism and to address the broader range of national security challenges in the decades ahead the commission made number of recommendations one of which was to replace the current position of director of central intelligence dci with national intelligence director nid who would oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest including national counterterrorism center nctc across the us government manage the national intelligence program oversee the agencies that contribute to it and have hiring firing and budgetary authority over the ics 15 agencies although the commission recommended that the director be located in the executive office of the president the commission vice chairman in testimony before congress on september 7 2004 withdrew that portion of the recommendation in light of concerns that the nid would be subject to undue influence the commission further recommended that deputy nid be established to oversee the daytoday operations of the central intelligence agency cia the commissions recommendation to strengthen management authority over the ic is the latest contribution to an ic structural reform debate that dates at least to 1955 when arguments for stronger ic authority began to surface omb deputy director james schlesinger in 1971 first broached the nid concept congress currently is considering two principal bills s 2845 introduced by senators collins and lieberman and hr 10 introduced by representative hastert that would establish the nid position for comprehensive comparison of all recent nid legislative proposals see crs report rl32600 and crs report rl32601 reactions to the concept of an nid have been mixed since its inception supporters argue that the dci cannot manage the ic the cia and serve as the presidents chief intelligence advisor and do justice to any of the jobs other than at the cia the dci also lacks hiring firing and budget authority they argue that the absence of strong centralized leadership has resulted in divided management of intelligence capabilities lack of common standards and practices across the foreign domestic intelligence divide structural barriers that undermine the performance of joint intelligence work and weak capacity to set priorities and move resources opponents counter that an nid would lose daytoday control over the cia natural power base and as result influence they also contend that an nid will shift the balance of control away from dod risking intelligence support to the warfighter the congressional role includes deciding whether to establish the position of the nid and its authority this report will be updated as events warrant contents congressional proposals concerning nid position 2 dci budgetrelated responsibilities and authorities under the national security act of

proposals to reorganize the united states intelligence community began to surface almost as soon as the management structure for the intelligence community ic was statutorily established by the passage of the national security act of 1947 since then at least 19 commissions committees and panels created by either the executive or legislative branches have made numerous recommendations for structural reorganization several of the proposals urged stronger centralized ic authority and in some cases the establishment of the position of national intelligence director nid the socalled second hoover commission established by law to examine the organization of the executive branch in 1953 became the first independent panel to push for stronger centralized ic authority see page 7 for historical review of efforts to centralize and strengthen ic leadership in examining ways to strengthen the ic the commission recommended that an executive officer be named to manage the cia so that the dci could focus attention on the ic eighteen years and several commissions committees and panels after former president herbert hoover made his recommendations the office of management and budgets omb deputy director james r schlesinger later dci after studying the ics management at the behest of former president richard nixon blamed the absence of strong central ic leadership for unproductively duplicative intelligence collection systems and the failure to coordinate the allocation of resources schlesinger considered the establishment of an nid but backed away recommending instead strong dci who could bring intelligence to an adequate level of quality and responsiveness1 1 see richard best jr and h andrew boerstling proposals for intelligence reorganization 19491996 in

intelligence reorganization 19492004 by richard best crs2 in one of the most recent iterations of the nid debate the 911 commission2 on july 22 2004 recommended that the position of the dci should be replaced by national intelligence director who would oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest across the us government and would manage the us national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to it the commission recommended the establishment of the position of deputy nid for foreign intelligence to direct the cias daytoday operations the commission also recommended the creation of national counterterrorism center nctc which would be placed in the executive office of the president and be under the control of the nid the nctc would be center for joint operational planning and joint intelligence3 congressional proposals concerning nid position there have been variety of proposals concerning the nid4 position following the creation of the intelligence oversight committees in the senate 1976 and in the house 1977 congress considered charter legislation that included among other proposals one that would have created the position of an nid to manage the ic presidentially selected deputy would have managed the cia confronted by strong opposition to the overall legislation which also included language governing covert actions the committees did not report the respective bills in 1992 senator david boren and representative david mccurdy respective chairmen of the senate select committee on intelligence ssci and house permanent select committee on intelligence hpsci introduced legislation creating the nid position and giving the position the authority to program and reprogram funds their legislation also would have created separate director of cia boren and mccurdy failed to win adoption of their legislation in the face of opposition by the department of defense dod and the congressional armed services committees 2 the 911 commission formally known as the national commission on the terrorist attacks upon the united states was created by congressional legislation and the signature of president george w bush in late 2002 pl 107306 nov 27 2003 it was chartered to prepare full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks the commission was also mandated to provide recommendations designed to guard against future attacks 3 see the 911 commission report national commission on the terrorist attacks upon the united states july 22 2004 p 403 4 the 911 commission recommendations refer to national intelligence director or nid so too do the two principal legislative bills s 2845 and hr 10 being considered by congress historically however various proposals generally have named the position director of national intelligence or nid this paper will use the nid nomenclature crs3 in december 2002 the congressional joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 20015 recommended that new cabinet level senateconfirmed nid position be established and that separate director be named to manage the cia the joint inquiry also recommended that the nid be granted the full range of management budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed to make the entire ic operate as coherent whole6 dci budgetrelated responsibilities and authorities under the national security act of 1947 are seen by some as limited proponents of establishing the nid position contend the current ic management structure is characterized by an incoherence they attribute to two flaws first because the dci is dualhatted heading both the ic and the cia they maintain he is too busy to do either job well second they argue that the dcis hiring firing and budget authorities are limited from their perspective the result is an ic management structure that lacks direction and focus any discussion of the nid concept invariably leads to debate over whether the two jobs should be split and whether current dci budget authorities are strong enough to permit effective management of the ic with regard to budget authority the national security act of 1947 authorizes the dci to facilitate the development of an annual intelligence budget 1947 national security act see sec103c1a 50 usc 4033c1a the act also stipulates that the dci prepare and approve all budgets for each of the ic agencies comprising the national foreign intelligence program nfip7 1947 national security act see sec10450 usc 4034 b more than 85 of the intelligence budget however is executed by agencies not under the dcis control8 although the dci has the authority to approve all budgets for each of the ic agencies comprising the nfip he or she cannot transfer funds and personnel during the year of budget execution without the agreement of the agency head of the ic element that would be affected by such transfer moreover the appropriation for the nfip agencies including the cia is given directly to the 5 the senate and house congressional

national security agency nsa the national reconnaissance office nro and the national geospatialintelligence agency nga9 each of those agencies among other tasks supports department of defense dod combat operations and each answers to the secretary of defense the dci is left with exclusive budget execution authority only over the cia10 some have asserted that in part because of the dcis relatively weak position with respect to the ic dcis historically have devoted the bulk of their time to managing the cia and serving as the presidents intelligence advisor rather than overseeing the ic11 collinslieberman s 2845 and hastert hr 10 would establish an nid senators susan collins and joe lieberman and speaker of the house of representatives dennis hastert have separately introduced legislation that would establish the nid position both bills would establish presidentiallynominated senateconfirmed position of nid who would serve as the head of the ics 15 separate intelligence agencies including the cia both bills also would establish separate senateconfirmed director of central intelligence who would manage the cia and would be prohibited from serving simultaneously as the nid see appendix 1 for sidebyside comparison of nid authorities in both bills arguments offered in favor of establishing an nid supporters of the nid concept argue that the dci who manages the ic and the cia and serves as the principal intelligence advisor to the president has too many jobs and that an nid unburdened by the need to manage the cia must be established if the ic is to be effectively managed12 they also argue that an nid must be empowered with two authorities the dci now lacks the authority to hire and remove ic agency heads in consultation with the defense secretary currently the secretary of defense selects principal ic agency heads for the three combat support agencies nsa nro and nga with the concurrence of the dci and the authority to move funding and personnel within or across ic agencies at any time during the year of execution with congressional 9 the national security agency is responsible for electronic intercepts the national reconnaissance office designs builds

infrastructure and personnel14 from the prospective of proponents failure to establish an empowered nid with hiring firing and budget authority will leave the ic with divided management of intelligence capabilities lack of common standards and practices across the foreign domestic intelligence divide structural barriers that undermine the performance of joint intelligence work and weak capacity to set priorities and move resources they cite dci george tenets 1998 declaration of war15 on osama bin laden and the corresponding lack of an integrated ic response as clear indication of the need for an nid16 senator bob graham cochairman of the 911 congressional joint inquiry stated the intelligence community needs leader with the clout to set common goals establish priorities knock heads and ensure that the american people are protected17 to accomplish that goal nid supporters argue requires an empowered nid with clear statutory endtoend ic budget and personnel authorities including authority over those large portions of the nfip budget now controlled by the secretary of defense arguments offered in opposition to establishing an nid some opponents counter that although perhaps good idea establishing the position of nid will have only marginal impact and assert that had this change 13 see studies in intelligence the need to reorganize the intelligence community by larry c kindsvater vol 47 1 2003 ibid p 36 with regard to the selection of agency heads sec 106 of the national security act 50 usc 4036 stipulates that if the dci does not concur in the personnel recommendation by the secretary of defense the defense secretary still may present his recommendation to the president without the dcis concurrence but include in the recommendation that the dci does not agree with the recommendation 14 see the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911commission report july 2004 p 410 15 in december 1998 following the august bombings

certainly would not have prevented the 911 attacks they suggest that more important step would be to hire more capable people throughout the ic18 other opponents contend that rather than strengthening control over the ic the establishment of an ndi would actually weaken ic management they assert an nid would lose daytoday control over the cia natural power base without it the nid will lose influence according to opponents admiral bobby inman former deputy dci and nsa director said that dcis rely on the cia for their effectiveness and that an nid would be like the drug czar19 position that critics have argued has little management control over us government agencies engaged in counternarcotics other skeptics assert that establishing the position of nid will only add another layer of bureaucracy and risks disruption at time when terrorists continue to threaten to attack the united states critics are likely to also assert that centralized management control will be further weakened if the nid is not granted meaningful hiring firing and budget authority they may argue that the dcis relatively robust authorities to approve ic budgets and control budget reprogramming historically have gone largely unused in the face of dod opposition in other words critics say the dcis have had the authority but simply have chosen not to exercise it some critics have voiced concern about the 911 commissions recommendations to locate the office of the nid in the executive office of the president they contend that doing so risks the politicization of intelligence would give the white house more direct control over covert operations and would blur the line between foreign and domestic covert operations20 they also express concern that congress will experience greater difficulty in conducting oversight of the ic because the proximity of the nid to the white house will more frequently raise the issue of executive privilege some critics contend that the 911 commissions concept of the ndi would shift too much influence over the ic to the defense department because dod would retain most of its roles under the commissions proposal and they say stand to gain influence in contrast other critics of the nid concept oppose it because they believe 18 see richard clarke now for the punches the 911 commission pulled houston chronicle july 28 2004 19 see staff

nid were to favor providing more intelligence to policy makers rather than the warfighter they argue the ics three largest agencies nsa nro and nga are combat support agencies that collect and disseminate intelligence affecting tactical military operations it therefore is entirely appropriate they argue that the secretary of defense rather than the dci control these agencies and the dollars that fund them given that the needs of military commanders often differ from those of policymakers who generally are more interested in strategic intelligence21 history of recommendations to centralize and strengthen ic leadership the issue of centralized ic leadership was first addressed by the second hoover commission in 1955 the following lists those commissions reports individuals executive orders and legislation that have addressed the issue of centralizing and strengthening ic leadership22 second hoover commission 1955 the commission on organization of the executive branch of the government also known as the second hoover commission and chaired by former president herbert hoover recommended that management of the cia be turned over to an executive officer so that the dci could focus attention on the ic the schlesinger report 1971 president nixon tasked the office of budget and management to recommend changes in the ics organization deputy omb director james r schlesinger future dci headed the effort and in his report considered the creation of an nid but in the end recommended that strong dci who could bring intelligence costs under control and intelligence production to an adequate level of quality and responsiveness schlesinger criticized the ics failure to coordinate resources blaming the deficiency on the lack of strong central ic leadership that could consider the relationship between cost and substantive output from national perspective 21 see pincus walter intelligence shakeup would boost cia panel urges transfer of nsa

for the conduct of foreign policy chaired by former deputy secretary of state robert d murphy noted that the dci exercised direct control over the cia but had only limited influence over the ic as whole but rather than recommending structural change the commission said it was neither possible nor desirable to extend the dcis control to the large part of the intelligence community that lies outside the cia church committee 1976 the senate select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities known as the church committee and headed by senator frank church did not recommend establishing an nid but urged that dci authorities be strengthened by appropriating intelligence dollars directly to the dci and by defining in statute dci reprogramming authorities the committee also recommended that consideration be given to enhancing the dcis management of the ic by relieving him of daytoday management of the cia pike committee 1976 the house select committee on intelligence chaired by congressman otis g pike recommended that the dci should manage the ic as whole and not exclusively the cia the commission said the dci should receive budget proposals from intelligence agencies comprising the community but did not indicate whether the dci should have budget authority cliffordcline proposals 1976 clark clifford former secretary of defense under president lyndon b johnson who had earlier participated in drafting legislation establishing the cia recommended that new position of director of general intelligence be established and that separate cia director be responsible for managing the cia ray cline former deputy director of the cia recommended that the dci be given cabinet rank and broad supervisory authorities over the ic charter legislation 1978 following the establishment of the intelligence oversight committees in the senate 1976 and in the house 1977 congress considered charter legislation that among other things would have created an nid to manage the ic presidentially selected deputy would manage cia in the face of strong opposition to the overall legislation which also included language governing covert actions the committees did not report the respective bills crs9 executive branch orders 19761981 in an effort to head off further congressional action president gerald ford in 1976 issued executive

executive order 12333 which remains in effect today granted the dci more explicit authority over the development implementation and evaluation of the nfip turner proposal 1985 admiral stansfield

david boren and congressman david mccurdy respective chairmen of the senate select committee on intelligence ssci and house permanent select on intelligence hpsci introduced legislation creating the position of an nid with authority to program and reprogram funds and creating separate director of cia boren and mccurdy failed to win adoption of their legislation in the face of opposition from dod and the congressional armed services committees aspinbrown commission 1996 the commission on the roles and capabilities of the united states intelligence community known as the aspinbrown commission after its respective chairmen aspin and harold brown concluded that the relationship between the dci and secretary of defense should not be altered but that the dci should be given more time to manage the ic the commission recommended the creation of two deputies one to help manage the ic and the other to manage the cia23 23 see report of the commission on the roles and capabilities of the united

arlen specter and congressman larry combest respective chairmen of the ssci and the hpsci sought to increase the clout of the dci by giving him more control over the appointments of chiefs of defenserelated agencies and the budgets of those agencies but faced with intense opposition from the pentagon and its congressional allies they settled for more modest reform agreeing to establish new position of deputy dci for community management and three assistant directors to oversee collection analysis and administration24 although each were to be senate confirmed only the deputy intelligence director for community management and the assistant director for administration have been confirmed neither the clinton nor george w bush administration has chosen to submit to the senate for
