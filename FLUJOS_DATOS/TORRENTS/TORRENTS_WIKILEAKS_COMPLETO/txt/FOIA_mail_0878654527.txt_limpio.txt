from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu subject re date tue nov 4 094207 1997 tom please do actually i would be interested to know whether malcolm mentioned these results to dave as he was in krasnoyarsk few months ago when i showed this stuff i will be over in new york in few weeks to discuss with ed the possibility of putting in an nsfnerc proposal to look at the tree biomass change question alsothe initial impetus to redo this stuff was as part of nerc project we have running in colllaboration with ian woodward i which we are inputting high resolution climate data to dolly to assess the roll of such variability on carbon uptake cheers keith at 0254 pm 11397 0700 you wrote keith malcolm hughes was here on friday to see dave schimel about precisely the issue you raise dave wants to see if he can validate his ecosystem model using tree ring data sounds as if you already have the data to do this can i show your email to dave tom on mon 3 nov 1997 keith briffa wrote tom thanks for the info actually this is chance for to to mention that we have for the last few months at least been reworking the idea of looking in the schweingruber network data for evidence of increasing tree growth and hence potentially at least evidence of changing treeread biomass uptake of carbon the results are dramatic not to say earth shattering because they demonstrate major timedependent changes but changes that are consistent in different areas of the network we have regionalised over 350 site collections each with ring width and density data agebanded the data so that we look only at relative growth in similar ages of trees through time and recombined the standardisd curves to produce growth changes in each region basically growth is roughly constant except for relatively small climate variablity forcing from 1700 to about 1850 it then increases linearly by about up until about 1950 after which time young up to 50 year old basal area explodes but older trees remain constant the implication is major increase in carbon uptake before the mid 20th century temperatue doubt partly to blame but much more likely to be nitrateco2 equally important though is the levelling off of carbon uptake in the later 20th century this levelling is coincident with the start of density decline we have paper coming out in nature documenting the decline in relative terms ie by comparison with increasing summer temperatures the decline is represented in the ring width and basal area data as levelling off in the longtimescale inrease which you only see when you process the data as we have the density data do not show the increase over and above what you expect from temperature forcing i have been agonising for months that these results are not some statistical artifact of the analysis method but we cant see how for just two species spruce in the western us great basin area and larch in eastern siberia we can push the method far enough to get an indication of much longer term growth changes from about 1400 and the results confirm late 20th century apparent fertilization the method requires standardizing localized mean subtraction and standard deviation division by speciesage band so we reconstruct relative eg per cent change only we have experimented with integrating the different signals in basal area and densityafter extracting intra ring ring width and density data where available within flat mass measure which shows general late 20th century increase but whether this incorporates defensible relative waiting on the different components and what the relative carbon components are is debatable we now need to make some horrible simplistic assumptions about absolute carbon in these relatively small components of the total biomass carbon pool and imlpications for terrestrial and total carbon fluxes over the last few hundred years and beyond without these implications we will have difficulty convincing nature that this work is mega important there are problems with explaining and interpreting these data but they are by far the best produced for assessing large scale carboncyclerelevant vegetation changes at least as regards welldated continous trends i will send you couple of figures tiny sample of the literally hundreds we have which illustrate some of this i would appreciate your reaction obviously this stuff is very hush hush till i get couple of papers written up on this we are looking at moisture sensive network of data at the moment to see if any similar results are produced when nontemperaturesensitive data are used you would expect perhaps greater effect in such data if co2 acts on the water use efficiency at 0930 am 11397 0700 you wrote dear keith look at tremblay et grl 24 202730 1997 and dyke et arctic 50 116 1997 these papers deal with driftwood in the arctic over the past 9000 years they note that genera can be distinguished but not species hence they cant say where the wood comes from north america versus europe surely crossdating could do this may be worth getting in touch with dyke et tom dr keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj united kingdom phone
