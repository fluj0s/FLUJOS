aggregates their use in the conduct of monetary policy summary economic theory and history make compelling case that monetary policy is powerful in affecting the pace of economic activity and employment in the short run and the rate of inflation in the longer run thus unambiguous indicators should exist for those formulating executing and overs eeing monetary policy to this end definitions of money are sought as are coll ections of assets c onsistent with those definitions for these measures of mone known as monetary aggregates to be useful in policy context they must at minimum be stable and predictably related to spending meaning that when they are changed the subsequent change in spending can be closely predicted if they meet that test they can provide information about the current posture of monetary policy should they be under the control of the federal reserve fed they may be useful as intermediate target variables in the execution of monetary policy the monetary aggregates constructed by the fed are longer stable and predictably related to spe nding although they once may have been vast number of studies have sought to explain the reason for this sudden instability their findings highlighted efforts by financial in stitutions to get around federal regulations structural changes related to economic development the us of us currency abroad and number of onetime ev ents such as the thrift crisis of the mid1980s accounting for these developments led to refinements of the existing aggregates development of new aggregates and new m easures of opportunity costs at most this research suggests that the refined old and new aggregates can provide useful information about future income growth em ployment and inflati on several of the aggregates however do not seem to be under the control of the fed were monetary aggregates to exist that were stable and predictably related to spending and under the control of the fed th eir use in the conduct of monetary policy would likely be controversial some economists who see monetary instability as the major cause of business cycles favor rulebased policy of increasing the aggregates at fixed percentage per year others with different notions of the causes of cyclical instability tend to favor discretionary approach to policy and monetary fine tuning if ideal monetary aggregates do not exis t or are not under the control of the fed if they do exist monetary policy can be formulated and executed in terms of interest rates however the rele vant interest rates for hous ehold and business spending decisions are the real or inflationadjusted rates these rates can be affected by actions of others in the economy in additi on to the fed and by developments abroad thus their movements may provide little information about monetary policy the oversight of monetary policy is handi capped by lack of reliable objective and unambiguous monetary indicators this leads to the unhealthy situation in which those responsible for overseeing monetary policy must rely heavily on the fed to provide them with an assessment of policy which falls short of an arms length assessment this re

monetary policy the federal reserve conduc ts monetary policy by buying and selling us treasury securities this action alters the reserves of financial institutions primarily commercial banks which in turn alters the availability of money and credit in the us the ultimate goal of fed activity is to influence aggregate spending in such way that full employment and low and stable inflation rate prevail over time1 in conducting monetary policy the fede ral reserve has choice of target since money spending involves money it c ould buy and sell us treasury securities with the objective of targeting the growth of the money supply alternatively since changes in money and credit affect spending largely through changes in interest rates it could target one or more of those rate s directly simply by supplying whatever money is needed to meet its target it ca nnot target money growth and interest rates simultaneously however the discussion in this report concentrates primarily on targeting the money supply to achieve such changes in money sp ending that the goals of full employment and stable prices are met in recent years the fed has targeted interest rates instead of the money supply an important reason fo r this choice as discussed below is the unstable link between the money supply nd money spending nevertheless some economists for several reasons continue to prefer targ eting money growth and seek stable measure of money as means of furthering that goal the link between the monetary aggregates and the economy there are few topics in economics as contentious as the role of money in business cycles there is doubt that money and economic activity are highly correlated table 1 sets out the nature of this relationship the average rate of growth of nominal gross domestic produc t gdp over the past four decades is shown relative to the average growth of popular measure of money known as m2 which is defined in the glossary one cannot help but be struck by th close relationship between the two variables over most of the period moreover when the growth rate of real gdp is subtracted from that of nominal gdp the gr owth rate of m2 provides good deal of information about the rate of inflati on for example over the period 19602000 m2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs2 21960 is generally chosen as base date for making comparisons because the money supply data for earlier years are not quite compatible with the post1959 datagrew at an average compound annual rate of 71 while real gdp grew at an average compound annual rate of 35 the di fference 36 closely approximates the average compound annual rate of growth of the implicit price deflator for gdp 402 thus the excess of m2 growth over real gdp growth seems to be highly correlated with the inflation rate over this 40year period table 1 growth rates of gross domestic product and m2 time period average growth rate of nominal gdpaverage growth rate of m2 19601969 72 7119701979 106 9819801989 78 8019901999 53 38 memorandum 19952000 59 61 source board of governors of the federal reserve bureau of economic analysis it is well known that correlation measur only the degree to which variations in the two data series coincide it doe s not necessarily imply anything about cause and effect indeed in terms of table 1 the contention among economists is whether the changes in m2 cause the changes in nominal gdp or vice versa the jury is still out on this question and proba bly will never be able to render verdict acceptable to all parties nevertheless the relationship of money to economic activity suggests two possible roles that money might play in the formulation and execution of monetary policy the first role is that of an intermediate target variable in this role the federal reserve would manipulate the m oney supply or its growth ra to achieve such goals as high employment high r eal gdp growth or low infla tion as far as inflation is concerned the information above suggests th at growth rate of m2 of about 35 per year would yield fairly stable pr ice level or low rate of inflation for m2 or any other measure of money to be used as an intermediate target it must be either directly or indirectly under the control of the federal reserve for much of the federal reserve era aft er 1913 the money supply could not be controlled this was because the united stat adhered to an international monetary system that used fixed exchange rates central feature of fixed exchange rate regimes is that monetary policy must be directed to maintaining the exchange rate as such it cannot focus on manipulatin g the money supply in way that is inconsistent with that objectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs3 3control over reserves is supplemented by control over the legal reserve obligations imposed on these institutions the obligations were differentiated by the type of deposits supplied by these institutions and by control over the disc ount rate which sets the cost to depository institution when it must borrow reserves from the central bank to make up any reserve deficiencies 4during the period october 1979 to october 1982 the federal reserve appeared to use the growth of m1 as an intermediate target this episode is examined belowsince the early 1970s however the unite d states has participated in the international monetary system on the basis of flexible exchange rates under this system central banks theoretically have great freedom in manipulating their respective national mone supplies however they do not have direct control over that supply rather they control the reserves that are available to depository institutions on the basis of which deposit money can be created3 how much money is created in any given period also depends on other factors important among these are the preferences of the public for how it wishes to hold its money assets in the case of m2 this means currency demand posits and various types of saving and time deposits and the actions of depository institutions that influence those preferences also of some importance are the reserves that depository institutions choose to hold relative to the various ty pes of deposit liabilitie s outstanding some of these are legally imposed while othe rs are voluntary more extensive discussion on the ability of the fed to c ontrol the money supply is given below thus the federal reserve does not have daytoday control over the money supply its control is only indirect and depends on the closeness of the relationship of reserves to the various measures of money even though case can be made that the federal reserve has been able to use the money supply as an intermediate target variable for the past 30 years or more it has apparently chosen not to do so4 in recent years this reluctance has been associated with what has been called the i nstability in the velo city or turnover rate of money while this topic is discusse d below what is involved can be gleaned from table 1 the close relationship betw een money and nominal gdp so evident in the 19601989 period is weaker in the 19901999 period clearly something altered the relationship betw een m2 money growth and the growth in nominal gdp nevertheless for considerable period of time the federal reserve reported to congress growth rate target ranges for va rious measures of money this practice may seem curious since manipulating these measures of money is not the objective of monetary policy one might even have questioned the usefulness of this exercise however the data above do show that fo r much of the past 40 years money growth has been closely related to both nominal gdp growth and the rate of inflation even if causation runs from income growth to money growth or if the federal reserve cannot control the m oney supply or it chooses not to control the money supply movements in the growth rate of the money supply might nevertheless provide good deal of useful inform ation about some important performance parameters of the economy for example th data above suggest that the growth ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs4 of m2 has been good predictor of r source of information about the future growth of nominal gdp nd the rate of inflation however for money to be the preeminent informational variable the close relationship between it and various m easures of economic performance must continue although the conditions under wh ich measure of money serves as an informational variable are less demanding than in its role as an intermediate target variable eg it does not ve to be under the control of the federal reserve its usefulness in providing information diminishes in the absence of close relationship between it and for example aggregate spe nding thus the emergence of velocity instability which reduced the usefulness of money as an intermediate target variable has also reduced its usefulness as sour ce of information about the current and expected performan ce of the economy the velocity of money while the amount of money in existence is an important determinant of the amount of money spending that can or will take place it is not the only factor also of importance is the number of times each unit of money is spent during given time period this spending or turnover rate of the existing amount of money is commonly known as the velocity of money or the velocity of moneys circulation these notions can be formalized in rms of simple equation let the amount of money in existence be symbolized by m its velocity of circulation by v and total money spending by py where p is price index and measure of the quantity of real goods and services then mv py in order to calculate v which is equal to pym we need to be able to measure both m and py in theory py symbolizes total money spending on all goods services and financial and real assets that takes place in an econom over given time period since measures of total spending do not exist py is often proxied by the nominal value of gdp or some subdivision thereo f such as net nati onal product national income personal income etc given any measure of py the calculated value of v will be different for different definitions of m and for each definition of m v will also differ for differe nt measure of py the definition of money providing generally accepted definition of money has proven to be elusive economists have taken veral approaches to this task the first has been what might be called the traditional or f unctional approach it starts by saying that money is what money does and money is any asse t that simultaneously performs all four ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs5 5the dollar was originally defined as given quantity of gold over time it has evolved into an abstract measure the unit of account role is common to all definitions of money since we measure money using the dollarthe basic functions of money serving as unit of account medium of exchange store of value and standa rd of deferred payment second definition holds that money is temporary abode of purchasing power this definition seems to focus on the store of value role stressed by th traditional definition the role of each definition in selecting gr oup of assets to call money is worth exploring for it rationalizes the composition of ssets included in m1 and m2 the unit of account role is basic to m oney as it is the common denominator in terms of which all goods services and ssets can be expressed and their relative values compared in the case of the unite d states the unit of account is the dollar5 the medium of exchange role says that whatever is money must be the dominant means used to make payments or effect exchange the store of value role emphasizes that money is generalized m eans for holding wealth the standard of deferred payments means that money is used for writing contracts that require future payments the functional definition of money m1 the functional definition suggests that m oney consists primar ily of those assets that can be used to make transactions mainly paper currency including coins and deposits against which checks can be draw n this collection of assets corresponds closely to what the federal rese rve has defined since 1980 as m1 the m1 velocity of money is shown in figure 1 it is calculated by letting the nominal value of gross domestic product gdp serve as proxy for total money spending or py it is obvious from figure 1 that the m1 velocity of money has not been constant throughout much of the post1959 period it rose between 1959 and 1981 m1 velocity grew at compound av erage rate of about 32 it declined from 1981 to 1994 and then began to rise by 1997 it had surpassed its 1981 peak and by 2001 it reached its highest value in the 19592001 period between 1997 and 2001 m1 velocity grew at an average co mpound rate of 36 somewhat higher than its average growth rate from 19591981httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs6 345678 m1 velocity 19591963196719711975197919831987199119951999 year v1figure 1 velocity of m1 source federal reserve for m1 to be used as an intermediate target variable as noted above it must be under the control of the federal reserve federal reserve control in this case is indirect because the composition of m1 is determined by the preferences of the public fed control reside s primarily in control over the reserves available to depository institutions and the evidence suggests that reserve growth is the major determinant of the growth of m1 control however is not in itself sufficient for using m1 as an intermediate target variable its velocity must be stable and predictable this means that the behavior of m1s velocity must depend on and be ex plained by ideally few variables knowledge about the value of these variables will allow monetary authorities to predict the value of v if the behavior of v depends on large number of variables it would be regarded as less predictable even if it were stable if velocity is not stable and predictable then control of m1 will not ensure control of money spending moreover its ability to function as an informational variable or its usefulness as an indicator of the futu re performance of the economy will also be compromised as the growth rate of m1 or any m may provide little information about the subsequent growth of sp ending and the rate of inflation does the behavior of m1 velocity show n on figure 1 suggest that it is unstable after all it rose continuously for more th an 20 years and then for the next 13 years it followed pattern that moved downward in an erratic sort of way to be followed by 7 years of upward growth at an aver age rate not too different from the 19591981 periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs7 6william j baumol the transactions demand for cash an inventory theoretic approach quarterly journal of economics vol 66 november 1952 pp 545556 and james tobin the interestelasticity of transactions demand for cash review of economics and statistics vol 38 august 1956 pp 241247 note that the baumoltobin model explains money holding or money demand rather than velocity this is distinction without difference if households and businesses are holding money balances equal to 15th of income or total spending then the velocity of money must be 5 and any factor which reduces desired money holdings must raise the velocity of money and vice versa 7the seminal discussion of the determinants of velocity is irving fisher the purchasing power of money new york macmillan 1911 in addition to foregone income fisher also listed as determinants such factors as the freque ncy of payments size of payments certainty of payments the coordination of income nd payments the distribution of income among classes the state of confidence the availability of credit uncertainty about the future etc these other factors are thought to have longer run influence on the behavior of velocity for recent discussion of the development of velocity in the history of economic thought see thomas m humphrey the origins of velocity functions federal reserve bank of richmond economic quarterly vol 79 fall 1993 pp 117this behavior need not indicate instability to see why the factor or factors thought to determine how rapidly the public spends or turns over its money must be explained economists have voted considerable efforts to this task widely used behavioral model was developed by professo rs baumol and tobin6 in their model money is held only to make transactions how much is held comes to depend not only on planned transactions but on two ot her factors the income lost by holding money rather than some interest earning asset the socalle d opportunity cost of money and the brokerage fee or cost both financial and physical eg time and inconvenience incurred when the income ear ning assets are converted into money7 in this model as interest rates rise individuals will hold less money relative to transactions velocity will rise similarly any innovation that lowers the transactions cost of conver ting incomeyielding assets in to money will also decrease money holdings relative to transactions velocity will rise as this model was origin ally estimated economists be lieved that the income yielding asset most likely to be held in lieu of money was one that was short term and highly liquid such as 3month treasury bill if this is correct choice can the yield on 3month us treasury bills explain the behavior of m1s velocity the annual yield on these bills during the period 19582001 is recorded on figure 2 the most noticeable feature of these data is that they trend upward reaching peak in 1981 and then record general dec line over the subsequent 13 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs8 8this is not to suggest that the relationship was unstable over the entire period note for example that the rise in interest rates between 198183 and 198588 was followed by rise in velocity similarly for the fall over 1983852468101214yield on 3 month tbill 19601964196819721976198019841988199219962000 yearfigure 2 the yield on 3month us treasury bills source federal reserve at first glance it would appear that compelling case could be made that the behavior of m1s velo city is stable and is explained by the movement of the yield on 3month treasury bills unfortuna tely looks can be deceiving the velocity pattern in figure 1 demonstrates instability over the past 15 years to see why in simple way if the yield on 3month tbills explains m1s velocity the value of velocity in 1993 ought to be about the same as in 1963 because in each year the tbill yield was about the same velocity however wa s quite different in the 2 years about 336 in 1960 versus about 542 in 19938 it is obvious that other factors are at work influenc ing the turnover rate of m1 velocity instability nd the missing money much of the discussion about the instability or lack of predictability of m1s velocity to be reviewed below has been carried out in terms of the missing money rather than address instability directly this occurs because rather than talk about the veloc ity of m1 directly various authors have phrased their investiga tions in terms such as given the level of gdp and the opportunity cost of m1 in 1980 for example how much money should the public have been holding in that year this predicted level was then compared with the level the public was actually holdi ng and the latter was found to be less than predicted giving rise to the notion that money was missing this is however just another way of saying that m1s veloc ity was higher than predicted simple example will explain why if the public was making given level of expenditures in 1980 with less m1 than was predicted the velocity of m1 must have been higher than predicted that is the only way this could happen from our discussion abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs9 9this conviction that inflation was caused by an excessive growth of money was influenced by similar conviction among an increasingly vocal number of economists known as monetarists they came to occupy an impor tant place in th economics profession in the 1960s and 1970s and their central thesis that excessive money growth causes inflation became generally accepted viewm1s velocity in 1993 was about 54 whereas based on the level of the tbill rate it was predicted to be about 34 thus missing money implie s higher than predicted velocity the role of m1 in the conduct of monetary policy the growing conviction by influen tial members of congress that the acceleration in the inflation rate during th 1970s was caused by too much money by excessive money growth relative to the growth in real output led in 1975 to resolution requiring the federal reserve to report its objectives for money growth later in 1978 this requirement was enacted into law in the full employment and balanced growth act popularly know n as the humphreyhawkins act9 as inflation during the 1970s accelerated into double digits the federal reserve under the leadership of paul volcker announced in october 1979 new operating procedures emphasizing the grow th of nonborrowed reserves as means for controlling the growth of m1 thus m1 appeared to be elevated from an informational variable to an intermediate target variable not only did m1 have the desirable characteristic that its components were almost exclusively held to make transactions but its velocity also had ve ry small variation bout its trend rate of growth remember that in 1979 only the ri sing portion of m1s velocity shown in figure 1 was known whether m1 was in fact elevated to this role is unclear at about this same time evidence began to accumulate that its veloc ity was unstable in october 1982 as the deepest economic downturn since the gr eat depression of 192933 was nearing its end the federal reserve began to deempha size m1 in its deliberations by july 1987 the instability in m1s velocity was so apparent that the federal reserve announced at the humphreyhawkins hearin gs that it would discontinue setting target range for m1 growth thus m1 may have been used briefly as an intermediate target by the federal reserve the instability in its velocity however diminished its usefulness as target variable and ultimately robbed it of much of role as an informational variable efforts to explain its instability will be re viewed below in addition during the period october 1979october 1982 when m1 may have been used as an intermediate target variable its growth rate on quarterly basis was highly erratic and market interest rates were much more variable than during the period when they were the focus of federal reserve policy as might be expected why the erratic behavior of m1 growth occurred is unclear nevertheless because of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs10 10there is substantial doubt that m1 was ever elev ated to the status of an intermediate target variable one reason for this doubt is that the federal reserve allowed base drift to occur base drift occurs when the ending value of m1 during given period is used as the base for setting the growth rate target range for subsequent period regardless of whether that ending value for m1 is other than the midpoint of the prevailing growth rate range over time if base drift is not corrected m1 growth or th growth of any monetary aggregate can be higher or lower than would have occurred if each new growth rate range was positioned at the midpoint of existing growth rate rangedevelopments money market participants were among those voicing disapproval of fed policy10 the humphreyhawkins act also manda ted the fed to present semiannual reports to congress central feature of these reports were growth rate ranges for various measures of money and credit between the late 1980s and july 2000 the federal reserve decided against setting monitoring ranges for the monetary aggregates beginning in the early 1980s the fed decided to discontinue setting monitoring range for m1 in july 2000 similar decision was made for the remaining aggregates the instability in m1s velocity need not imply that monetary aggregates have role to play in the conduct of monetary policy there are two other measures of money m2 and m3 the theoretical basis made for using either as an intermediate target or informational variable comes from an alternative approach to defining money the empirical definition of money m2 as noted above the economic s profession is not of one mind when it comes to the role of money in business cycles beginning in the 1950s two economists later to achieve great prominence in the prof ession milton friedman and anna schwartz among others began to publish resear ch findings designed to convince then skeptical economics profession that money mattered and that variations in the growth rate of the money supply played major ro in causing business cycles crucial to this research was definition of money or some empirical counterpart to the notion of money friedman and schwartz in justifying their definition state we see compelling reason to regard the literal mediumofexchange function as the essential function of the items we wish to call money after all except for the moment in which money actually changes hands in transaction or is used as medium of exchange it remains inactive or in their words is temporary abode of purchasing power what such coll ection of assets would be was not to be determined by logic rather they sought collection of assets changes in the supply of or the demand for which would allow them to readily and accurately predict the consequences for important economic variables such as nominal gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs11 11as m2 was defined prior to 1980 it contai ned currency noninterest paying demand deposits and saving and time deposits time certificates of deposit or cds were not in existence during the period covered by the work of friedman and schwartz 12the friedmanschwartz approach to money demand or velocity yields model which is somewhat different from baumol tobin since money holding is viewed as an alternative to both real and financial assets its opportunity cost can be measured by such diverse factors as interest rates the yields on stocks and the expected rate of inflation which measures the yield on goods velocity however rises as th opportunity cost of money rises as in the baumoltobin model the friedmanschwa rtz model suggests that money holding is linked to wealth or its proxy expe cted income rather than to gdp 13the velocity of the m2 used by friedman nd schwartz has been computed by them for the period 1869 to 1960 it slowly declined from about 46 in 1869 to range of about 15 to 17 during the decade of the 1950s see milton friedman and anna j schwartz monetary history of the united states 18671960 princeton nj princeton university press 1963 table a5 pp 774775 factor in friedman nd schwartzs selection of m2 as their preferred measure of money is th at they wanted longtime series on money so that they could examine its behavior over many business cycles prior to 1915 it is impossible to separate demand from other deposits on the books of us banks thus to examine the behavior of money over many cycles m2 must be used141516171819m2 velocity 19591963196719711975197919831987199119951999 year v2figure 3 the velocity of m2after much consideration friedman and schwartz settle d on what was then called m211 m2 it should be noted contains ssets that cannot themselves be used directly as medium of exchange nevertheless in their studies m2 was stable and predictably related to nominal gdp12 in addition as shown in figure 3 over most of the 19591991 period the velocity of m2 displays trend varying between 14 and 16 it has the advantage of being virt ual constant with ve ry small deviations from its average value13 source federal reserve the near constancy of m2s velocity attracted the attention of the board of governors and it came to replace m1 as the preeminent informational variable in the conduct of monetary policy during th 1980s and early 1990s the deliberations ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs12 14since m1 is component of m2 one might be tempted to ask why the instability in m1s velocity did not immediately lead to instability in m2s velocity popular answer was the missing m1 was shifted into cds since cd s are in m2 but not m1 this shift would have effect on m2s velocitythe federal reserve and the semiannual humphreyhawkins monetary policy reports consistently used m2 as the basic money s upply variable moreover m2 is the basic measure of money used in the larges cale econometric model of the united states maintained by the board of governors of the federal reserve m2 however has not been used as an intermediate target variable unfortunately beginning late in the 1980s and early 1990s the behavior of m2s velocity like that of m1 decade or so before began to go off track the relationship of m2 to its opportunity co st established in the postworld war ii period could not explain the behavior of m2 s velocity while m2s velocity was expected to fall as interest rates declin ed in the 1990s it actually began sharp rise and reached its highest levels in the 40year period the m2 velocity values expected or predicted to occur based on historical experience were less that the actual m2 velocity that occurred in terms of the alternative way of expressing this development used above this was another case of missing money that is based on gdp and the opportunity cost of m2 the public wa s holding less money than predicted the same problem that d bedeviled m1 came to bedevil m214 quite clearly this development cause d consternation among the board of governors in its semiannua l monetary policy report to the congress dated july 20 1993 the board for the first time expresse d considerable uncer tainty about the usefulness of m2 and m3 as informational variables while the board continued to set growth rate ranges for each aggregate it concluded in that report with considerable uncertainty persistin g about the relationship of the monetary aggregates to spending the behavior of the aggregates relative to their annual ranges will be of limited use in guiding policy and the federal reserve will continue to

this relationship could be exploited for forecasting purposes knowledge of money growth could be used for example to forecast the growth of nominal and real gdp and the rate of inflation good deal of analytical effort has b een expended on this subject increasingly these efforts have been focused on what is called time series analysis central feature of this analytical tool is the so called granger test named after prof clive granger pioneer in time series analysis the essence of the granger test is to see whether additional variables can add any extra information or predictive power to forecasting focus variable that is not already contained in the history of the focus variable itself if it can as determined by statistical test of significance the added variable is said to granger cause the fo cus variable or the variable whose value is being forecasted seminal use of this methodology in the study of moneys influence on economic activity was ma by prof christopher sims in 1972 in this study using quarterly data from 1947 through 1969 m1 was found to gran ger cause nominal gross national product15 that is although the hist ory of gnp provided good deal of information about the current and future values of gnp this information was enhanced or an improved prediction was possi ble by also using the history of the growth of m1 later in 1980 sims publis hed the results of more elaborate study using monthly data involving possible gr anger causality role for both m1 and the commercial paper rate16 when both were used simultaneously with the focus variable being the industria l production index m1 longer played granger causal role in explaining this measure of economic activity ie its contribution to explaining the behavior of industria l production was longer statistically significant major role was however played by the commercial paper rate the sample period covered by this study ran from 1947 to 1978 what sims may have picked up in this study was the breakdown in the stability of m1s velocity the extent of which was not too well documented in 1980 several subsequent studies using data from the 1980s and 1990s have come to inconclusive results on the granger causal ro of money for example study by friedman and kuttner incorporating quarter ly data for the entire decade of the 1980s their sample runs from 19703 to 19904 appeared to sound the

of money efforts to explain the instability of m1s velocity the instabilities in the velocities of m1 and m2 have not gone unnoticed chronologically the instability of m1s ve locity occurred first ironically by 1973 the economics profession had accepted as fact that stable velocity for m1 existed highly regarded study by princeton ec onomist stephen goldfeld established this fact23 goldfeld estimated an equation in which m1s velocity depended on interest rates and income this equation passed all the statistical tests of stability beginning in 1974 however the goldfeld equation began to seriously underpredict m1s velocity and thus overpredi ct the publics money holdings this degree of error continued to grow over the decade in 1976 goldfeld published study on the missing money24 for the next several years the journals were filled with articles purporting to explain what had happened some sense of the magnitude of this effort can be gleaned from the fact that in 1982 two ec onomists judd and scadding surveyed this outpouring for the journal of economic literature their survey article contains 86 citations25 the search for the cause of the instability had to confront considerable number of innovations that had and were occurring in financial markets during the 1960s andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs16 26it should be noted that as m1 was then defined it consisted only of currency and noninterest bearing demand deposits m2 consisted of m1 and savings and time deposits the now popular time certificates of deposits or cds were unimportant at this time 27an important modification of the baumoltobin model made by miller and orr is to make income and expenditures probabilistic rather than certain as result any innovations that reduce the possible dispersion of either can be expected to reduce the demand for money or raise velocity see merton miller and daniel orr model of the demand for money by firms quarterly journal of economics vol 80 august 1966 pp 4134351970s that could reasonably have been exp ected to affect the velocity of m126 these innovations were due in large part to ba nks and resulted from clash between rising market interest rates documented in figure 2 and banking regulations that forbade the payment of explicit interest on demand deposits and regulated those paid on saving and time deposits if banks wished to remain major players as financial intermediaries they had to come up with ways to pay interest to depositors or else risk the loss of funds and their ro in the intermediation process the research efforts by economists tende d to take one of two approaches both of which were suggested by the baumol tobin model as modified by miller and orr27 the first approach continued to accep t and use the then prevailing definition of m1 however it was thought that th variables used to measure expenditures broker fees and opportunity cost s were longer adequate in light of the financial innovations and other changes in the ec onomy thus efforts were made to reformulate or adopt new meas ures for some of these cr ucial explanatory variables maintaining the definition of m1 since major role for the breakdown of m1s velocity was belie ved to have its origin in the demand deposit holdings of businesses business practices with re gard to these holdings came under close scrutiny important in this effort was belief that banks were assisting businesses to better manage their money holdings incl uding standing ready to convert money holdings into interest earning securities on an overnight basis while finding suitable empirical meas ure for these improved services proved difficult those selected did seem promising at the time to capture this structural change in velocity these improved cash management technique s were also thought to reduce the variability in the income and expenditure flows of businesses thereby reducing their need for precautionary money holdings as suggested by the millerorr model in similar vein it was questioned wh ether gross national product gnp or some subdivision thereof was really an adequate proxy for those expenditures requiring money gnp and gdp after ll includes capital consumption allowances and number of imputations ne ither of which require the us of money in addition gnp and its subdivisions exclude spending on financial and ex isting real assets nevertheless so long as gnp or gdp moves in concert with total spending it will not produce an unstable velocity when this is not the case it can affect the perceived stability of velocity for exam ple if turnover in financial markets increases money demand may increase all else equal since this increase in money holding does not affect income measured velocity pym woul d fall for

practice would not affect the velocity of m2 however because the money market accounts are included in m2reason and would appear unstable ther was feeling that perhaps this was happening in the 1970s after long pe riod in which income and transactions velocity were moving in concert the growth in financial and asset transactions during the 1970s relative to income growth might ve caused m1s velocity to appear to be unstable when in fact it was not efforts to find better measures of total spending while promising did not provide the answer to the instability28 changing the defi nition of m1 the second line of inquiry suggested that since some of the innovations in financial markets consisted of new assets which were highly substitutable for the assets then included in m1 the definition of m1 should be changed during the late 1970s and into the 1980s the regulations placed on the interest rates depository institutions could offer on various types of deposits were relaxed this deregu lation undoubtedly altered the ra nge of assets that could be regarded as substitutes for the assets in both m1 and m2 obvious choices were the interestp aying accounts then offered by state chartered mutual savings banks to house holds on which checks could be drawn these were the now accounts and super now accounts and later share drafts offered by credit unions by the mid1970s nows were authorized for most types of depository institutions in the northeastern part of the united states however since only households were able to hold now s at that time they could explain only small part of the shift in m1s velocity since large part of the problem was thought to be due to the sudden decline in th demand deposit holding s of businesses perhaps one of the most innovative expl anations for the instability involved new arrangement banks had deve loped for paying interest to business customers the socalled repurchase agreement or repo this involves bank selling an asset for fixed period with the promise to repurchase it at fixed price the repos could be for very short time indeed overnight in fact garcia and pak made an interesting argument that banks allowed their business customers to use their demand deposits during the day and just before closing would sell them repos on an overnight basis29 thus business demand deposits would be understated at the end of the day by the amount of repos when the repos were added to m1 they accounted for much of the socalled ssing money subsequent research however cast doubt on the role repos were t hought to have played in the decline in m1s velocity30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs18 31it should not be forgotten that these change s to the definition of m1 also required redefinition of the opportunity cost of money redefinition of opportunity cost was also an important part of the research effort highlight ed above in which the old measure of m1 was maintained 32john v duca us business credit sour ces demand

circulation rising by gail makinen crs report 30904one aspect of the search for the missi ng money was to re open the debate about the appropriate definition of money the fact that the velocity of m2 had all the statistical properties of st ability did not go unnoticed moreover the equation used to predict m2s velocity for forecasting purposes neither over nor underpredicted it it thus appeared that the velocity of m2 was immune to the changes in financial structure financial innovations and the regulation of banking that had taken place during the 19601980 period m2 then became the primary informational variable for monetary policy nevertheless research continued into the causes of the instability of m1s velocity including the velocity of th augmented m1 for all now accounts share drafts and the like were included in the new definition of this aggregate announced by the federal reserve in 198031 perhaps the final act in this research drama was played in 1992 when duca presented eviden ce that the major reason for the weakness in business demand deposit holdi ngs had to do with interest rates and compensating balances32 when businesses borrow from banks they are generally required to hold certain deposit balances at those banks socalle d compensating balances these balances can be an important fracti on of total business demand posits federal reserve survey of 60 large banks in 1987 for exampl suggested that roughly half of all business demand deposits were in fact compensating balances as interest rates rose during the 1960s and 1970s compensating balances became more costly for businesses even though banks tried to pa interest on them implicitly duca argues that as result an increasing number of businesses incurred the setup costs for borrowing directly in the commercial paper market rather than borrowing indirectly using banks as intermediaries this shift to direct borrowing brought about marked decline in compensating balances and thus in business holdings of demand deposits this decline ducas evidence suggests explains much of the missing money an equally serious problem arose from the increasing popularity of the us dollar as an international currency dollars are held by foreigners as hedge against an uncertain political and economic future to finance illegal activ ities the narcotics trade and as currency for conductin g legitimate business as in ecuador estimates using only 100 denomination bills suggest that this sum has risen from about 10 of the total in the early 1970s to about 50 in 200133 this overstatement is not small in 2001 currency was more than 50 of recorded m1 thus the recorded data on m1 progre ssively overstates the amount of m1 that is used for spending in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs19 34for an account of the interaction of economic growth and financial intermediation see john gurley and edward shaw money in theory of finance washington dc brookings institute 1960summary the stability displayed by the velocity of m1 through the early 1970s gave rise to view among some ec onomists that m1 could be used as an intermediate variable for th conduct of monetary policy as well as providing good deal of information about the likely cour to be taken by the economy this optimism was shaken by the apparent instability of m1s velocity that appeared in the early 1970s and continued for some years ther eafter research s identified several factors as responsible for this instability first structural changes have occurred in the financial environment that determines velocity these changes are due in part to the growing sophistication of the economy nd the financial intermediaries that it creates and to changes in the legal environment that governs intermediaries34 second changes in the nature and availability of substitute assets for money can both alter the opportunity cost and create meas urement problems for m1 third the use of american currency abro ad creates problems for m easuring the effective amount of m1 that circulates in the us finally there can be series of one time and largely transient events that can alter the velocity of money prominent one analyzed below was the thrift and ba nking crisis of the mid1980s efforts to explain the instability of m2s velocity the velocity of m2 proved to be qu ite stable during the 1980s and without doubt it became the preeminent informational variable for the board of governors the semiannual monetary policy reports make ample referen ce to the behavior of m2 and its velocity compared with ot her measures of money and credit this happy state of affairs did not last the velocity of m2 began to rise in 1990 when the standard estimating equation predicted it would fall as in the case of m1 the problem with m2s velocity has also b een phrased in terms of the missing money moreover the economic expansion that got underway in march 1991 seems to have been set in motion and sustained with he lp from m2 in fact given the behavior of m2 it is doubtful that any expansion should have occurred much less been sustained it is now widely acknowledged that th weakness in m2 growth or the missing money is tied to three of its components currency much of whic h circulates abroad money market mutual fund balances and time certificates of deposit cds especially the latter as with m1 an extensive and ongoing research effort has been undertaken to find the missing money or explain the perv erse movement in m2s velocity while some of it has been found the results of th is effort are inconclusive ie only some of the instability in m2s velocity has been reduced it is still too unstable or the research too tentative for m2 to be consider ed as an intermediate

journal of money credit and banking vol 32 november 2000 pp 820839value of m2 in general five explanati ons have been put forth to account for the missing m2 adding assets to m2 some economists tried to account for the effect of financial innovation on m2 it was noticed that the missing money coincided with the rapid growth of bond and equity mutual funds an argument was made that these funds were very good substitutes for the savings accounts and cd s supplied by banks and therefore should be included in an augmented m2 some studies have used such an augmented m2 and found that its velocity is more stable than for conventional m2 among the studies optin g for the expanded monetary aggregate duca reports that he is able to acc ount for over 40 of the missing m235 however problem with augmented m2 is that unlike the assets in conventional m2 bond and equity funds are subject to capital gain s and losses these gains and losses will change the value of m2 independent of changes in its opportunity cost making velocity appear to be unstable reduced transactions costs transactions costs or the cost to buy and sell assets play role in the baumoltobi n model of money demand if those costs decline the model predicts that individuals will hold less money or that velocity will rise the introduction of bond and equity mutual funds was thought to have made this possible in some cases bond mutual funds became part of family of mutual funds offered by banks whic h allowed depositors at low transactions costs to transfer funds from bond funds to money market mutual funds on which checks can be written failure to account for this fa ll in transactions costs was one element thought to account for missing money36 additional opportunity costs the third explanation is to some degree complementary with the first it has to do with interest rates the spread in interest rates and deregulation as the intere st rates banks could pay on their various deposits were deregu lated it is argued these depos its became better substitutes for variety of other earning ssets such as stocks and bonds failure to account for this change was believed to be responsible for some of the missing money the economists taking this line advocated alteri ng the opportunity cost variable in the standard velocity estimating equation in particular they urged that the yields on both short and long term assets be included in the equation less the interest that was paid on the assets in m2 the spread between long and short term interest rates supposedly captured the ability of the bond nd stock funds to attract dollars from or divert those that were intended to go to depository institutions this is due to the fact that bond funds can hold longer term ssets and as the spread widens offer higher rates than can depository institutions on their cdshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs21 37joshua feinman and richard d porter the continuing weakness in m2 finance and economic discussion

interest rates or spread variable they use the spread between the 30year treasury bond yield and the 3month treasury bill rate they report they have found more than twoth irds of the missing m2 the thrift and ba nking crisis fourth explanation for the missing money is related to the thrift and banking crisis of the mid1980s and weakness in the sector in the early 1990s adjusting m2 velocity for this onetime even t has taken several routes the first builds upon the activitie s of the resolution trust corporation rtc its activities it is argued made the yields on cds more uncertain it did this because in dealing with failed thrifts the rtc would either pay off the cd holder or transfer the cd to the merging or pur chasing institution which had the option of repricing the cd since many cds in failed institutions were higher yielding than at acquiring institutions this increased the uncertainty of cd yields an attempt was made to incorporate this increased uncertainty into the standard equation explaining velocity it should be noted that the activ ities of the rtc were not expected to have lasting effect on m2s velocity this is in essence onetime effect once the rtc had completed its activities m2s velocity was expected to be governed by only its systematic determinants eg opportunity cost br okerage fees and income using conventional m2 duca after incor porating measure of this uncertainty in standard estimating equation for velocity was able to explain what happened to 83 of the missing money when m2 is augmented by adding bond and equity mutual funds the addition of the rtc certainty variable enables him to account for 95 of the missing money38 carlson and parrott so using conventional m2 report that they are able to account for much of the missing money when their variable accounting for rtc activities is added to standard m2 velocity equation39 their study unfortunately does not in clude data from most of the 1990s orphanides and porters appr oach is

consists of the m2 that would have occurred if it had been supplied only by well capitalized banks and thrifts they find the velocity derived from this new ries to be stable and argue that their modified m2 may contain useful information about economic growth41 structural changes fifth approach has been to argue that there was an acceleration in the long term structural changes affecting the intermediation process in the united states during 199094 that fu rther diminished the role of commercial banks as intermediaries as result the same or greater amount of spending took place in the economy with less money this would appear as rise in m2s velocity unrelated to change in income or its opportunity cost major reason for the diminished role of banks as intermediaries it was argued was the removal of the subsidy given them by the federal government the nature of the subsidy was in the pr ovision of deposit insurance at rates that bore little relation to the riskiness of the assets that banks acquired moreover deposit insurance made it possible for these institutions to get by with capital accounts that in many cases were also unr elated to the riskiness of the assets changes in deposit insurance premiums and the imposition of risk based capital standards have made it more costly for banks to lend as result borrowers have sought funds by borrowing directly from nders or from other intermediaries eg insurance companies pension funds etc ra ther that indirectly through banks the decline in the banking sectors share of nding is matched it is argued by the run off of cds the principal managed liability of banks summary the research agenda to find the missing m1 was simply extended to find the missing m2 when its velocity became unstable in the early 1990s it has involved redefining m2 redefining th opportunity cost of m2 accounting for changes in the institutional setting determin ing m2 velocity and factoring in any number of changes essentially of one time nature to account for the resolution of the thrift and banking crisis of the mid1980s while much of this research has been fruitful in fostering our understanding of the role of the financial system in the ec onomic health of the nation it failed to make much of an impression on the published repor ts of the board of governors and did not prevent the board from discontinuing the setting of growth rate ranges for the monetary aggregates in large measure this is due to the variety of results that have been obtained contrast fo r example the findings of duca with those of feinman and

sensitive to movements in its opportunity cost fairly good forecast of the probable course to be taken by money spendi ng could be gleaned from observing the recent growth rate of m2 itself however as noted earlier the stability of m2s velocity has broken down in recent years and carlson and keen were unable to explain m2s velocity by its continuedapproaches in addition the weakness in m2 is of such recent origins that sufficient time may not have elapsed to see whethe r these new equations have good record for prediction42 other efforts to redefine money before concluding this discussion it is worth reporting on two other efforts to construct new monetary aggregates that are theoretically consistent the first is the effort by professor william poole now pres ident of the federal reserve bank of st louis43 poole draws his inspiration from fr iedman and schwartzs definition of money as temporary abode of purchasin g power for poole these should be assets that can be accessed without notice nd at par he calls assets that have these characteristics assets of zero matur ity all assets currently in m2 are zero maturity assets except cds which have fixed and positive term to maturity should they be cashed before maturity thei r holders incur penalty thus their face and conversion values differ however institution only money market funds now included in m3 have the zero maturity ch aracteristic poole proposes to gather all these zero maturity assets into common aggregate called mzm money with zero maturity carlson and keen examined the st ability of mzm in the early 1990s44 they found that over the period 19751995 the veloc ity of mzm could be explained very well by its opportunity cost particularly by movements in interest rates since the opportunity cost of mzm over this peri od varied from about 1 to 12 mzms velocity was highly variable rising from about 25 in 1975 to 34 in 1980 and back to 25 in 1995 thus knowledge of the movements in mzm by itself would be unlikely to provide consistently good fo recasts on the probable course taken by money spending in the absence of good for ecasts of the movement s in interest rates45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs24

expect sharp decline in the pace of economic activity wh ich did not occur unless one had been able to accurately predic t the course of interest rates from 19911994 mzm would not have been useful informational vari able over this period however the pace of mzm growth accelerated noticeably from early 1995 to early 1999 period of very high growth of real gdp second approach to defining money has been through the development of what are called divisia indexes the tion behind these indexes as applied to monetary aggregates is that the conventi onal way of defining m2 or any monetary aggregate is likely to be flawed when collection of assets is put together as monetary aggregate an implicit assumption is made all of the assets in the aggregate are perfect substitutes for each other that is they all yield identical money services to their perspective holder this is unlikely to be true especially for the broader aggregates divisia index results when the various components of an aggregate are weighted by their degree of moniness defining moniness and assigning the weights are complex and technical matters nevertheless it can be done and the results are divisia m1 m2 and m346 for each of these aggregates related velocity can be computed in exactly th same way as with the conventional ms unfortunately these velocities have also proved to be unstable thus aggregates which are constructed to meet rigorous index number tests and are also theoretically consistent in the sense that each component supplies identical monetary services to its holder do not ensure that the resulting velocities will be stable however in forecasting real gdp and prices the divisia aggregates generally outperform their simple nondivisia counterparts47 uses of the alternat ive measures of money in the conduct of monetary policy two roles have been identif ied for the conventional monetary aggregates in the conduct of monetary po licy intermediate ta rget variables and informational variables at least three new monetary aggregates are suggested by the discussion above mzm divisia money nd m2 plus dollars in bond and stock mutual funds m2 could these aggregates play either or both of the above roleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs25 48athanasios orphanides and richard porter making sens of the monetary aggregates preliminary draft federal reserve december 2001if the velocity of all three aggregates were stable and predictable it is possible that mzm could be an intermediate targ et variable the federal reserve could control it with more difficulty than it curre ntly controls m1 or m2 it is doubtful that either m2 or the divisia measures could serve as intermediate target variables since the fed would have much greater difficulty controlling them all three money measures could potentia lly serve as useful informational variables their usefulness in this role w ould be enhanced by st able and predictable velocities on the basis of current evidence m2 seems more suited to this role than the others even though the feds ability to control this aggregate would appear to be more difficult than for mzm for example the conduct of monetary policy and the money supply thus far this report has discussed the link between the money supply and economic activity and chronicles the effo rts to explain the breakdown in the link but ultimately this exercise is useful to policymakers only in so far as it affects the conduct of monetary policy the remainder of the repor t will discuss different ways that the money supply relates to or coul d alter the execution of monetary policy can the federal reserve control the money supply it has been established that for the suppl of money to be useful in the conduct of monetary policy it must be stable rela ted to money spending such that given any change in the money supply policymakers can predict with reasonable certainty the subsequent change in money spending in this discussion it was taken as given that the fed could closely control the growth of the money supply if it so desired this raises the question as to whether the federal reserve can in fact control the money supply over reasonably short period of time say on quarterly basis in other words do open market operations lead to direct and predictable changes in some measure of money say m2 lack of control is not due to an absence of timely data on m2 orphanides and porter report that currently the board of governors receives micro data on over 92 of the com ponents of m2 in dollars with lag of eight days48 an answer to this question must begi n with the observation that the federal reserve does not directly control the vari ous measures of money discussed in this paper what the federal reserve controls are the reserves available to depository institutions mainly commercial banks on the basis of which they can make loans and buy assets and in th process create moneyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs26 49for discussion of the ability of the federal reserve to control m2 see daniel l thornton targeting m2 the issue of monetary control federal reserve bank of st louis review julyaugust 1992 pp 2335however there are two other groups th at can play an important role in determining how much money is created individuals households business firms and other financial intermediaries and the banks themselves individuals decide how they wish to hold their wealth and ssets currency dema nd and saving deposits mmdas cds stocks bonds etc thes decisions determine the composition of any aggregate identified as money eg m1 m2 m2 mzm banks themselves can play an important role in determining their own liabilities whether they take the form of demand or savings deposits cds or mmdas in the process given dollar of reserves supplie d by the federal reserve can result in different amount of m2 for ex ample this arises because the reserves banks hold for their various liabilities are not uniform the law requires reserves of approximately 10 for demand deposits legally require d reserves are specified for the other types of liabilities and banks typically hold lower reserves for them since reserves are typically held in currency or noninte rest earning form banks have an incentive to minimize their liabilities in the form of demand deposits this incentive increases as interest rates rise the crucial point is that the ability of the federal reserve to control money depends on the relationship of bank reserves and money if the relationship is tight over relatively short period of time the fed can be said to control the money supply and control is necessary to use the money supply in the role of an intermediate target it would appear th at for some of the measures of money proposed above control would not be very tight if this is the case sharp and unpredictable swings in bank reserves woul d be required for the fed to control the money supply and this would place consid erable hardship on the banking sector this would not preclude thos measures of money from pe rforming an informational role49 rulebased monetary policy and the money supply suppose that measure of m oney is shown to be stable and predictably related to money spending and that the federal reserve can by manipul ating bank reserves control this measure of money on timely basis how should it conduct monetary policy an early answer to that question wa s provided by friedm an and schwartz looking at the evidence from the early years in table 1 and from figure 3 which was available at the time they wrote they argued that since the velocity of m2 was near constant steady growth of money spending could be maintained by constant rate of growth of m2 they concluded that discretionary monetary policy as practiced by the board of governors should be replaced by rule based policy m2 should grow by whatever fixed rate was required to keep the price level constant the historic evidence they had available suggested that since real output grew on averagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs27 50a growth rate rule could have been derived from the behavior of m1 as well given the trend rate of growth of its velocity over the period 19591970 about 3 price level stability could have been achieved by holding the m1 stock of money approximately constant 51for more information see us library of congress congressional research service formulation of monetary po licy rules vs discretion by marc labonte crs report rl31050about 3 per year price stability could be maintained by keeping m2 growing at the same rate50 implicit in this rule was an assumpti on that is often overlooked that the dominant cause of cyclical instability in the us is due to an erratic rate of growth of the money supply thus if money gr owth could be stabilized friedman and schwartz argued most of the cyclical instability could be eliminated what happens if this monetary theory of business cycles is not true suppose instead that while the federal reserve c ould control the supply of money cyclical instability was due to such factors as business expectations about the future profitability of their capital outlays such belief gave rise to an argument for monetary fine tuning in this framework discretionary monetary policy was seen playing stabilization role the federal reserve would vary the growth rate of the money supply in way to offset changes in money spending that originated in the private sector due to changing expectati ons this view of business cycles seems prevalent with the federal reserves federal open market committee which has always used and supporte d discretionary policy for this to work timely decisions had to be made and the lag between those decisions and subsequent changes in aggreg ate spending had to be predictable in particular for discretionary monetary policy to work as intended the major cause of cyclical instability must be due to changes in private sector spending unrelated to monetary policy the federal reserve had to be able to recognize those changes and act upon them in timely fashion and the lag between federal reserve action and the economys spending response must be pred ictable if that is not the case it strengthens the case for rule based reg ime although not necessa rily rule based regime based on money growth faced w ith mounting evidence of the instability of money velocity some rule proponents have shifted their support towards rules based on interest rates inst ead of money growth51 thus the ability of the federal reserve to control the supply of money in timely fashion does not necessarily lend itsel f to rule based policy using the money supply as an intermediate target can equally well be app lied to discretionary policy just as an interest rate target can equally well be applied to rulebased policy of importance is the cause of cyclical instability an alternative to the ms as an indicator of monetary policy if the instability of the velocity of money makes the currently defined monetary aggregates both undesirable intermedia targets and of limited usefulness ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs28 52see william poole optimal choice of monetary policy instruments in simple stochastic macro model quarterly journal of economics vol 84 may 1970 pp 197216 technically this choice is correct only if inve stment demand is more stable than velocityinformational variables there remains the possibility that interest rates might perform these roles the reason for using interest rates in these roles is that they are an important channel by which changes in the money supply cause changes in spending indeed for some economists interest rates are said to be the price of money essentially with all else constant an acceleration in money growth reduces interest rates and fall in rates raises household and busine ss spending on interest sensitive goods alternatively when money growth is decelerated interest rates rise and interest sensitive spending is curtailed in this framework rising interest rates are taken as sign of tight money while fallin g rates are sign of easy money thus movements in interest rates could be used to control total spending and they could provide useful information bout monetary policy nd the future course of economic activity and indeed the fede ral reserve has used interest rates in these roles there is doubt that excep t possibly during the brief period october 1979 to about october 1982 the federal re serve has used interest rates as intermediate targets in recent years this has meant controlling the federal funds rate and through it range of short term intere st rates moreover the federal reserve has given interest rates an important informational role in communicating the posture of monetary policy to the public such role for interest rates is suggested by widely used macroeconomic model when there is instability in the velocity of money52 however the interest rates suggested by economic theory as releva nt are not the rates used by the federal reserve economic theory suggests that real interest rates or market rates less the expected rate of inflation are the link from money supply changes to changes in spending and economic activity even if the expected inflation rate could be calculated the resultant real interest rates would not necessarily be good info rmational variable bout monetary policy the reason is that other factors can influe nce the real rate independent of federal reserve action important among these ot her forces is the budget position of the federal government it is generally acknowledged that the 1980s was decade of high real interest rates these were not due to policy of tight money but rather to the unprecedented large peacetime federal budg et deficits thus the high real interest rates of the 1980s convey little useful informati on about monetary policy and may be very poor means for forecas ting the future state of the economy real interest rates can also be influenced by at least two other factors first the pace of economic activity can cause the real rates to vary during economic upswings real rates are thought to rise and to fall during slumps second since capital flows between major countries w ith considerable ease developments in foreign countries can affect r eal interest rates in the us and vice versa thus since rising or falling real rates may be due to the budget position of the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs29 government and cyclical and international factors they may ll us little about the posture of monetary policy alternatively using market or nominal interest rates as an informational variable does not get around the problem with real rates since nominal rates can move with real rates additionally thei r behavior is substantially in fluenced by expectations of inflation since it is easy money paradoxically can lead to high market interest rates this can happen if easy money causes the public to fear that the inflation rate will accelerate similarly tight money can lead to low mark et interest rates if as result the public comes to expect the inflation rate to decline for all these reasons the informational content about the posture of monetary policy that comes from either market or real interest rates may be very little movements in interest rates must be read with great care if they are to provide any information about monetary policy consequences of ambiguous indicators for the conduct of monetary policy it is now widely accepted that monetary policy is powerful tool in the short run for affecting the pace of economic activity and employment and over the longer run the rate of inflation moreover in the pr esent international monetary system it is more powerful tool than fiscal policy thus for those exercising oversight responsibilities for monetary policy it is bot h imperative and desirable that they have the most objective and unambiguous po ssible indicator of that policy with monetary aggregates that convey little information about monetary policy and interest rates that can be equally devoid of in formation those exercising oversight are left in the position of havi ng to rely heavily on the nations central banker as the conduit of information about nd judgments on the policy that he or she is responsible for formulating and executing from an oversight perspective this is unlikely to be healthy situation and one conducive to an arms length evaluation of monetary policy moreover without unambiguous indicat ors of monetary policy those formulating policy are more likely to rely on current developments in the economy in making their decisions on what policy s hould be even though the effects of that policy may be felt at some distant time perhaps as long as 2 years in the future dont fire until you see the whites of thei r eyes may have been good advice on the field of battle during the revolutionary wa r but it is not good advice for the conduct of monetary policy by the time you see the whites of their eyes it is long past the time when policy initiatives s hould have been undertaken nevertheless one must contend with the fact that monetary policy seems to have been quite successful over the past 20 year s in bringing the us economy to full employment and keeping it there the us has had only tw short and shallow downturns since the early 1980s on the ba sis of this record case might be made that central banking is an art and its success depends crucially on the abilities of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31416crs30 central banker alternatively it might be argued that the federal reserve has had an incredible run of good luck it has managed to steer ship with two compasses that often fail to yield unambiguous readings conclusions for some three decades the united states has seen rapid changes in its financial system these changes have been spurred in part by clash between rising interest rates and regulations that inhibited banks from being competitive players in financial markets the desire to survive as intermediaries motivated them and other depository institutions to innovate ways to get around these regulations this involved finding ways to pay interest to depositors and potential depositors in some cases this meant bringing into being new types of financial instruments such as now accounts money market accounts money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements gradually governments came to realize that the interest rate regulations were counterproductive if not harmfu l deregulation of intere st rates made bank deposits better substitutes for variety of other financial instruments it should come as surprise that th changes have had an effect on the velocity of various measures of money trying to explain what these effects have been and how to adjust to them has been part of large and ongoing research effort involving the specification of new monetary aggregates new measures of opportunity cost and risk and new measures of total spending in addition host of technical issues related to econometric estimations of velocity equations ve arisen and been dealt with because of the continued instability in the velocities of the conventionally defined aggregates and the tentative and unsettled nature of current research it is not possible to use the existing or newly formulated monetary aggregates as intermediate control variables more their role as preeminent information variables is also limited it is however desirable to continue to monitor the existing aggregates and some of the new ones that have demonstrated promise for forecasting such relevant economic performance variables as nominal gdp in addition interest rates can play potentially useful information role however since their movements are subject to influences other than the federal reserve they must be interpreted with great
