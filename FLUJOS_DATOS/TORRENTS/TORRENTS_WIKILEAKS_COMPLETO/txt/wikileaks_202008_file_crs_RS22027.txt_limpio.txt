indian ocean disaster and is appealing for donor contributions to meet the estimated need2 wfps initial response and appeal wfps initial response to the disaster was to provide immediate food assistance in the affected countries over two to three week period following the disaster using available funds 19 million wfp provided food to an estimated 600000 people where available wfp purchased local food but fortified foods were quickly airlifted to the region food stocks in the various countries destined for wfp development projects were reallocated to emergency relief wfp shipments on the high seas were diverted to countries affected by the disaster the wfp appeal on january 6 2005 in conjunction with an international donors conference in jakarta indonesia wfp announced 256 million appeal to provide emergency food assistance to victims of the indian ocean disaster3 wfp estimates that 169000 metric tons of food valued at 185 million will be needed to feed 2 million people over six months january to june 2005 see table 1 the targeted beneficiaries according to wfp are poor and vulnerable people already living in extreme httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22027 poverty they include displaced people those who lost their houses andor means of livelihood and other productive assets and children who lost parents and families wfp reports confirmed contributions of 164 million or 88

as in table 3 below and wfp reports of confirmed contributions on its website result from lags between the time usaid announces contribution and its being reported as confirmed by wfp crs3 of the total estimated food needs of 169000 metric tons rice at an estimated 125820 metric tons is the largest single component see table 2 however wfp notes that some of sri lankas estimated need for rice

provider of emergency food aid during international humanitarian disasters for example in response to hurricane mitch which wiped out both food supplies and the food distribution system in honduras and in several other central american countries in 1998 the united states provided 67 million of pl 480 title ii emergency food aid from the us agency for international development usaid along with 63 million of commodity donations from the us department of agriculture food aid accounted for 42 of the total us emergency response to hurricane mitch of 3084 million as of february 22 2005 the united states has pledged about 346 million of emergency food aid to two of the affected countries indonesia and sri lanka see table 3 in addition to food aid provided via us food aid programs some office of foreign disaster assistance funds ofda is component of the us agency for international development usaid have been used for transport andor purchase of emergency food supplies usually in conjunction with the provision of range of other crs4 relief supplies including in addition to food water medicine sanitation supplies blankets tents etc5 most of the us food aid for tsunami victims has been provided by way of pl 480 title ii humanitarian donations although substantial amount of food aid has also come from the us department of agriculture usda pl 480 title ii is the main program vehicle for responding to food emergencies although usdas section 416b donations when available from commodity surpluses can also be used for emergency food aid the bill emerson humanitarian trust reserve of commodities and cash can also be tapped in emergencies when pl 480 title ii resources are unavailable6 commodities or cash from the emerson trust have as yet been released for tsunami relief usaid has not reported on the extent to which food aid already allocated to development projects in the affected countries has been diverted to emergency relief it is likely that some portion of the initial response is from such reallocations table 3 us emergency food aid to indian ocean countries country us food aid program amount httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22027 indonesia 3000 mt of pl 480 title ii

usaid frequently updates its fact sheets on the us response to the indian ocean disaster including food aid provided and publishes them at httpwwwusaidgovour_workhumanitarian_ assistancedisaster_assistancecountriesindian_oceanet_indexhtml issues for congress competition for us food aid resources the need for food aid to respond to the earthquake and tsunamis in the indian ocean region comes at time when there are already large demands for us food aid resources to respond to other emergencies even before the indian ocean disaster us private voluntary organizations and others had pointed out that food aid allocations to emergency food aid in sudan ethiopia eritrea and elsewhere had reduced the food available for nonemergency or developmental food 5 see crs report rl32715 for other us agency contributions including eg the us department of defense dod 6 see crs report rs21234 the bill emerson humanitarian trust background and current issues crs5 aid projects7 usaids allocation of food aid to emergency and nonemergency activities for fy2005 which the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 requires be made by december of each fiscal year shows of 1173 billion total for pl 480 title ii in fy2005 668 million allocated to emergencies 462 million to nonemergency or development activities and 33 million as yet unallocated accounting for the availability of us and other donor food aid contributions wfp had estimated prior to the tsunami disaster global shortfall of 13 billion in emergency food needs what should be the us share historically the united states has been the worlds largest provider of food aid both emergency and nonemergency there is established rule as to what proportion of food aid needs should be provided by the united states yet there is presumption that especially in the case of emergencies the united states will make substantial and most likely the largest contribution there are some historical indicators of the relative importance of us food aid contributions8 in the 1990s the united states provided just over 55 of total world food aid the us contribution to all wfp activities both emergency and nonemergency during the 1990s averaged 465 under the food aid convention fac an international agreement now expired that constituted framework for cooperation on food aid among major httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22027 donor countries the united states had pledged to meet 51 of the total pledge of 49 million metric tons the fac pledge did not represent actual food aid shipments but was rather minimum commitment the european union eu is the next largest contributor of food aid globally providing 28 of all food aid during the 1990s 31 of total contributions to the wfp and 27 of commitments under the fac in terms of contributions to the wfp for recent food emergencies during 2003 and 2004 the united states provided 64 of total emergency food aid to ethiopia 28 of total emergency food aid to the democratic republic of korea and thus far has pledged about onequarter of the emergency food aid called for by wfp for western sudan darfur and eastern chad in the indian ocean tsunami disaster the eu has provided 39 of the total wfp appeal while the united states has thus far contributed 13 funding issues congress and the administration are likely to be confronted with the challenge of funding additional food aid along with other relief and development assistance for the indian ocean disaster early in the109th congress9 in the short term the administration can reallocate nonemergency food aid to emergency relief in addition the 2002 farm bill authorization for pl 480 food aid allows for some transfer of food aid from pl 480 title i concessional sales to title ii in order to provide food aid to indian ocean countries as well as to displaced persons and refugees in darfur sudan and elsewhere additional funds will be needed the housepassed hr 1268 the fy2005 supplemental which provides 819 billion for wartime expenditures in iraq and afghanistan includes also 150 million for emergency food needs in sudan darfur 7 see for example food aid cuts jeopardize programs that help break cycle of poverty overseas

meeting food aid emergencies could result in an examination of the role of the emerson trust of commodities and cash which is intended to provide food aid when title ii food aid is unavailable the trust which can hold 4 million metric tons of wheat corn sorghum and rice now holds just 14 million metric tons of wheat and around 89 million in cash in the conference report accompanying fy2005 agriculture appropriations congress admonished the administration not to use nonemergency food aid funds for emergency purposes and indicated that the emerson trust should be relied upon to meet unanticipated emergency needs p 667 hrept 108792 pl 108477 without replenishment of the commodities in the trust andor augmentation of its cash reserves however the trust could not make major contribution to meeting future or even nearterm emergency food needs in letter dated january 14 2005 number of us senators asked the president to include in an fy2005 supplemental appropriations
