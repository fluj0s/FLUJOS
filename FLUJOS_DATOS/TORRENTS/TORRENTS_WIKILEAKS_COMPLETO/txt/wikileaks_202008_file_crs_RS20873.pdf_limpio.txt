agreement on what constitutes abstinence teens are more likely than adults to believe that behaviors that cannot result in pregnancy constitute abstinence because pregnancy prevention together with avoidance of stds are dual goals of the abstinence education program some observers contend that it is time for programs to explicitly define what constitutes sexual activity others contend that

shortcomings abstinenceonly policy10 advocates of the abstinence education appr oach argue that teenagers need to hear single unambiguous message th at sex outside of marriage is wrong and harmful to their physical and emotional health they cont end that youth can and should be empowered to say to sex they argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical and undermines the strength of an abstinenceonly message they also cite research that indicates that teens who take virginity pledges to refrain from sex until marriage appear to delay having sex longer than those teens who do not make such commitment the study f ound that teens who publicly promise to postpone sex until marriage refrain from intercourse for about ear and half longer than teens who did not make such pledge11 they argue that abstinence is the most effective means of preventing unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including hivaids advocates of the more comprehensive approach to sex education argue that todays youth need information and decisionmaking skills to make realistic practical decisions about whether to engage in sexual activities they contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases12 they maintain that abstinenceonly messages provide protection against the risks of pregnancy nd disease for those who are sexually active they point out that teens who break their virginity pledges were less likely to use contraception the first time than teens who had never made such promise the april 2007 mathemati ca evaluation of the title v abstinence education program found that program pa rticipants had just as many sexual partners as nonparticipants had sex at the sa median age as nonparticipan ts and were just as likely to use contraception as nonparticipants suppor ters of the abstinenceonly approach say that the evaluation only examined four progra ms and is thereby inconclusive recent compilation of experimentally designed eval uations of comprehens ive sexual education programs found that some comprehensiv programs that included contraception information decisionmaking skills and peer pressure strategies were successful in delaying sexual activity improving contr aceptive use or preventing teen pregnancy13
