background the april 1999 national election in turkey brought to power an ideologically mismatched threeparty coalition government while 77year old prime minister bulent ecevit of the democratic left party dsp was hospitalized in spring 2002 differences worsened between his two coalition partners over reforms needed for european union eu membership the government was paralyzed yet all three partners resisted calls for an early election because they wanted to stay in office long enough for voters to feel the effects of an economic recovery from the worst recession in 50 years on june 30 2002 nationalist action party mhp leader vlet bahceli surprisingly called for an early national election to be he ld november 3 instead of in april 2004 as scheduled the move was aimed at ending political intrigues that he suspected were intended to replace him and ecevit in the government parliament eventually scheduled elections as bahceli had proposed ecevit would later characterize the election as an act of political suicide election results the voters anger over their economic plig ht produced political upheaval their anger was directed at the three governing parties and at the international monetary fund imf which had required the government to undertake painful macroeconomic reformhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21355crs2 1 the two main center right parties are anap led by former prime minister mesut yilmaz and the true path party dyp led by former prime minister tansu ciller the decline in popularity of both parties was sharp anap which first rose to power in 1983 with 452 of the vote and majority in parliament won bare 51 in 2002 its descent failed to make anap govern the ministries it controlled in ways that might expunge its reputation for corruption program in exchange for funds to abate financial crises voters threw the coa lition partners who together had polled 54 of the vote in 1999 out of office and out of parliament none achie ved the 10 of the vote required to enter parliament together they won less than 15 of the vote about 90 of the members of the old parliament will not serve in the new one two opposition parties so were purged lead ers of several losing parties have resigned their leadership posts and more resignations are anticipated some analyses describe the election as the beheading of an entire political class for the first time ce 1950 only two parties will be in parliament for the first time since 1987 single party not coaliti on will form government the justice and development party akp which has islamist roots and is led by recep tayyip erdogan won 3428 of the vote and 363 seats out of 550 and will form the government the republican peoples party chp the party of mustafa kemal ataturk founder of the secular turkish republic won 1939 of the vote and 178 seats in parliament it will form the opposition chp is led by denis ba ykal nine independents will hold seats about 78 of all eligible voters cast ballots an unprecedented 46 of the electorate voted for parties which fa iled to pass the 10 thre shold and many may feel disenfranchised by an election outcome th at excludes the parties they supported from parliament this may tarnish the akps victory somewhat election analysis the november 3 2002 election is being refe rred to as major political realignment because so many established political parties and leaders we re eliminated the disastrous economy was the primary catalyst for the upheaval and corruption in the ruling class was critical contributing factor the coalition pa rties were held respons ible for precipitating the recession exacerbating it and in some in stances creating obstacles to the economic recovery their tenure was marre d by an unending parade of scandals involving officials who allegedly used their government positi ons for personal enrichment with impunity voters lacked trust in politicians seen as interested only in themselves and not in the masses whom they had impoverished the s candals alienated voter s largely from center right parties which had led the country for most of the 1990s and whose leaders were seen as most dishonest1 in 1999 ecevit and bahceli had br ought their respective left and rightwing parties to power on the strength of their personal honesty in order for the tripartite government to survive however they were tied to discredited members of anap and became tainted by the association the political realignment of november 3 is one of parties and leaders not one of public opinion the turkish voters remain predominantly cente rright according to analysts and during the campaign akp move d decisively to claim them akp cannily eschews the label islamist preferring to be called conservative democrat or muslim democratin imitation of european christian democratic parties at least 50 of akps voters are more center right than islamist in inclination they are secularist andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21355crs3 2 us

imposition of isla mic law and political exploitation of religion according to public opinion polls th ey want religion to remain matter of personal faith separate from government policy for example most would likely oppose making veiling of women mandatory as favored by stricter islamists but might favor allowing women to wear head scarves in public buildings which is now forbidden2 forming government akp leader recep tayyip erdogan known wi dely as tayyip was not allowed to run for parliament and cannot be prime minister because of his 1998 conviction for inciting hatred based on religion he had publicly rec ited poem declaring minarets are our bayonets domes are our helmets mo sques are our barracks believers are our soldiers observers suggest that his views have since evolved and moderated if the new parliament amends the constitution to provide for freer expression and rescinds the ban on erdogan he still will not be able to enter parliament and assume leadership of government until another general election or byelection results in his being chosen as member of parliament constitutional provision stipulating that byelection not be held until at least 30 months after general election or 5 of the seats are vacant also would need to be amended assuming that erdogan would not want to wait 2½ years to take office or to have 5 of his deputies resign chp leader baykal has said that erdogan must become prime minister because it is th will of the people baykal supports lifting the ban and byelection if certain conditions are met3 another less likely possibility is amending the constitution to allow the ppointment of nonmemb er of parliament as prime minister which some oppose because it w ould tailor the law to single individual and be major change in the political system amending the constitution requires 23 of the votes in parliament requirement that akp can meet with the support of few independents the constitution requires the president to approve an amendment or refer it to national referendum if he disapproves erdogan has said that he feels voters chos him to lead because his name as party leader was on ballot along with the party go he believes that the nation assigned duty to tayyip erdogan when electing the akp because that duty is being postponed the akp has to look for way to organize ong the lines of the wishes of the nation4 since the election erdogan has acted like and been treated by some foreign governments as national leader akp has authorized him to select candidate for prime minister and to name all members of the government akp intends to streamline and cut the cost of government by reducing the number of ministries from 38 to less than 25 the large number of ministr ies had resulted from

the court did not rule before the electi on akps victory in the electi on may restrain the judiciary for while but the threat of ban shadows the ruling party justice and development partys views akp learned the lessons of its four islamist precursors banned since 1971 in particular it has tried not to repeat the mista kes of the refah or we lfare party which was forced from power in 1997 after barely year in office because the military and secular establishment deemed its conduct incompatible with the secular identity of the state akp leaders have tried to ppear moderate to reassure domestic and foreign audiences akps female candidates for parliament did not wear head scarves indicating that the party wanted to avoid confrontation alt hough it still believes that the prohibition on wearing head scarves in public buildings s hould be eliminated because it is antithetical to democracy on election night erdogan declared we are the guarantors of secularism5 he said that akp did not seek to change the constitutions mandate that the state be secular akp pledged to meet the targets of the imf program noting that agreements signed by one government bind its successor none of the akps stated views differ from turkeys tablished foreign policies the party vowed to comply with all crite ria for european union membership see below on other critical issues such as ir aq and cyprus

implications for the united states the united states has long described turk ey as model of muslim country that is also democracy turkeys secularism may have helped to make it successful model but not one that nonsecular muslim states could imitate before the turkish election administration officials avoided giving the islamist akp us imprimatur the us ambassador in turkey avoided akp leaders and erdogan failed to get an appointment at the state department during january 2002 visit to washington now some argue the akp victory may offer the opportunity for the united states to back muslim democracy whose model might be transferable elsewhere in any event before the election the state departme nt spokesman declared regarding akp we oppose the banning of political parties th at are expressing their view s in peaceful and democratic manner13 the administration has since saluted the election as evidence of turkeys vibrant democracy14 the united states has sought more stab and
