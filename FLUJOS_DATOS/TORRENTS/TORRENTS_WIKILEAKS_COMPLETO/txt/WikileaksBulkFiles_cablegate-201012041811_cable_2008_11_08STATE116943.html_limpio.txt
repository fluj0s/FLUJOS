midoctober 2007 debrief information following the september 29 bombing in male that targeted tourists indicates at least two of the operatives participated in the attack in exchange for travel from

again in tijuana according to midlevel baja california state police official turf war between the arellano felix organization afo and the sinaloa cartel has caused another increase in violence in tijuana the mexican governments counternarcotics efforts in the form of 3300 military and police assets patrolling the area under operation tijuana have severely weakened the afos operations the sinaloa cartel hoping to capitalize on the afos weaknesses is battling for control of tijuanas drug plaza while the afo assassins are skilled sinaloa cartel hit men are poorly trained and have aversion to public shootings however if the sinaloa cartel successfully ousts the afo from tijuana dstiaita notes the levels of violence should decrease while residents and visitors are not being targeted the likelihood of being in the wrong place at the wrong time is of increasing concern cartel targets are being killed during daytime hours in public areas of tijuana including restaurants shopping centers and near school buildings the dos travel alert for mexico was extended for six months on october 14 to reflect the current and widely reported crime and violence occurring throughout

october 31 kidnapping of approximately 10 hostages off the shores of the bakassi peninsula has magnified the role of two groups the bakassi freedom fighters bff and the niger delta defense and security council nddsc in the increasing insecurity in the bakassi the kidnappings an overview of the nddscs and bffs background and an examination of their past operations highlight the groups possible intent to use novel deadly and unprecedented tactics to achieve their goals 22 sbu in the early morning of october 31 group of armed men in three boats attacked french total vessel named bourbon sagita which was located off the cameroonian shore between bakassi and limbe although americans were directly impacted at least seven french citizens one tunisian one senegalese and several cameroonian nationals were kidnapped five remaining oil workers were left on the boat nobody was injured in the attack 23 sbu according to unconfirmed media reports shortly after the raid the bff part of larger and shadowy alliance of the nddsc claimed responsibility for the attacks and threatened to kill the hostages stating the 10 are in our hands if you dont tell the government of cameroon to come here and discuss with us we will kill them all in three days8 on november 1 the nddscbff withdrew the threat but stated it would hold the hostages until the government opened negotiations with them 24 snf the nddscbff is likely referring to discussions over the status of the bakassi peninsula in its statement the region was transferred from nigeria to cameroon on august 14 per an international court of justice ruling according to emails it sent to media outlets the nddscbff merged into an official alliance at the end of july in an attempt to forestall the hand over led by commander ebi dari and general ag dasuo who claim they are fighting for selfdetermination and freedom8 of the bakassi peninsula which contains majority of nigerian citizens they are also demanding that two of their fighters captured in july be released and that nigerians on the bakassi peninsula be compensated 25 snf an intelligence and open media search of the bff provided negligible results meanwhile although little background information is known about the nddsc it claims to have approximately 1050 fighters it has been in existence since at least 2002 and previously conducted lowlevel attacks against cameroonian troops on the bakassi it can also be linked to three deadly operations prior to the hand over of the controversial region in the most macabre raid on june 9 the nddsc allegedly killed and mutilated six members of cameroonian delegation visiting the peninsula including the deputy subregional commander it also claimed responsibility for november 2007 raid on cameroonian military outpost which killed 21 soldiers this claim remains unconfirmed please see the july 26 ds daily for further information on the prehand over security incidents in the bakassi 26 snf although the posthand over period has been defined by series of attacks the nddscbff has released statements denying culpability in some of those operations these include september 28 bank robbery in limbe and september 13 attack against trawler off the bakassi peninsula the nddscbff may be responsible for some posthand over operations while others may have been conducted by different militants in the region including in the niger delta despite similar tactics in all these operations including the use of speedboats carrying heavily armed masked men at this time there are clear indications the nddscbff has defined relationship with the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend or any other prominent niger delta group 27 snf instead the series of raids by the nddscbff may possibly signify new tactics being pursued in the bakassi region in its early raids the nddscbff primarily used deadly and brutal force against the cameroonian military but often spared expatriates and civilians two recent attacks however the june 9 attack and the october 31 hostagetaking operation have demonstrated its desire to expand its targets in the june 6 raid the nddsc targeted political delegation and mutilated deputy subregional commander the equivalent of governor it is unclear if the nddsc was directly targeting the governor but nevertheless the group demonstrated its desire to also kill politicians for its part the october 31 attacks was the first kidnapping of expatriates off the coast of cameroon 28 snf also of concern is the nddscbffs intent to hold hostages indefinitely after initially threatening to kill them whereas mend and other delta groups kidnapped hostages primarily to garner ransom money or to force oil companies to scale back operations they had seldom directly harmed or threatened to kill hostages they also often released hostages shortly after their capture moreover given its intent to hold the hostages for political objective the nddscbff may find it convenient to continue operations against expatriates in the region to pressure the cameroonian government and to ensure that its political demands are met open sources yaound 1071 0754 0706 appendix sources 2128 29 sfginf sca bangladesh rejection of idp to register for december elections as of late october the bangladeshi election commission was set to reject the islamic democratic partys idps attempt to register for the december parliamentary elections the idp is nascent political party formed by senior members of the islamic terrorist group harakatuljihadiislami bangladesh hujib bangladeshs directorate general of forces intelligence dgfi supported the formation of the idp as way to bring hujib into the mainstream and reported it tightly monitored the groups activities although hujib has never renounced the use of violence to implement its vision of transforming bangladesh into muslim theocracy according to us embassy dhaka which strongly opposed the creation of the idp the party and its leadership will likely be angered by the decision and may respond with violence possibly against the commission or the us mission or interests 30 snf arrests and monitoring have undoubtedly hindered hujibs capabilities in recent years and it is entirely plausible the group is pursuing the creation of political wing to improve its ability to support and carry out terrorist activity lateseptember assessment from bangladeshs national security intelligence organization nsi voiced concern that the partys creation would free extremists to pursue extremist activity under the cover of moderate front organization indeed there are indications idp would garner significant number of votes analysis from the dos office of research noted the majority of bangladeshis want awami league and bangladesh national party leaders sheikh hasina and khaleda zia to participate in the december elections interestingly 80 percent stated they would ignore call by either party to boycott the vote onethird further stated they would join street protests in the face of cancellation of elections 31 sfginf although there is little information available regarding hujibs current capabilities its membership likely does retain the ability to manufacture and use explosives and has previously favored targeting highprofile individuals for attack while there is specific reporting at the present time detailing plots against us interests in bangladesh the group has publicly articulated its antiwestern and indian stance including signing usama bin ladins 1998 fatwa against the west in regards to hujibs capabilities dgfis rapid action battalions rabs and nsis assessments vary significantly following the earlymarch us designation of hujib as foreign terrorist organization rab assessed hujib would not respond with violence due to the severe degradation of the groups capability and leadership structure from arrests and active surveillance some member who wanted to independently attack western interests however remained technically capable of carrying out lowlevel attacks using small arms grenades and ieds dgfi likewise reported hujib was an organization on the run8 and that it did not pose threat to us interests in bangladesh nsi conversely assessed hujib would react violently to the designation and would attempt to conduct an attack against the us official presence in dhaka although there was information available detailing such an operation thus far hujib has not carried out an attack against american interests in bangladesh but the group has been linked to assassination attempts on intellectuals journalists and politicians including two thwarted attempts on the life of prime minister sheikh hasina during public addresses and grenade attack that injured

ctad comment on october 21 officials from the kuwaiti central agency for information cait and the national security bureau nsb expressed concerns for foreign and domestic threats to kuwaiti information systems according to these organizations some of the issues plaguing government of kuwait gok networks are suspected attacks from iranian hackers insider corruption and misuse of resources and lack of sufficient interagency coordination and guidance for monitoring users activities and investigating incidents for example the groups inability to adequately examine malicious software malware injections or internal abuse of system access continues to hinder the goks capacity to ensure the protection of sensitive information therefore the cait and nsb are interested in learning more
