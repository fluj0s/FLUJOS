division gail makinen economic policy consultant government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585us military intervention in iraq some economic consequences summary going into the war economists predicted that us military operations in iraq could have had two distinct effects on th economy first the deficit financed increase in military expenditures could increase aggregate demand in the short run supplemental appropriation hr 1559 s been signed into law pl 10811 that includes 626 billion for iraqrelated outlays second the effect of military operations on the price of oil could have cau sed economic growth to fall and inflation to rise in the short run government borrowing from the public through the issuance of us treasury securities to finance larger budget deficit appears likely to be the primary financing method for military operations in iraq th is boosts aggregate demand in the short run some of the boost would be directed to foreigners instead of domestic producers since the operations would occur abroad some of the boost in aggregate demand will be crowded out by higher interest rates which reduce investment spending and other interestsensitive spending and dolla r appreciation which reduces exports and the production of importcompeting goods because economic ac tivity was sluggish during the conflict less of the boost in aggregate demand was crowded out lower government spending may play small role in financing any us operation in iraq reducing the size of the deficit while wars may shift re sources from nonmilitary uses to military uses the shift would not lead to recession since military spending is included in gdp military operations against iraq were accomplished with little damage to the iraqi oil fields as result further oil price spikes may be avoided and the price of oil is already coming down some would argue that the price spike before the war was caused by anticipation of the coming conflict and should therefore be counted as cost of the war economic theory suggests that oil shocks lead to higher inflation contraction in output and hi gher unemployment effective policy responses are difficult b ecause expansionary policy woul d exacerbate the inflationary pressures while contractionary policy w ould exacerbate the contraction in output studies suggest that an increase in the price of oil would have little effect on the economy if it is transient in hindsight we know that the size of military outlays relative to gdp and the wars effect on oil prices were both m odest oil prices rose in the 4 months preceding the war but fell back to previous levels before the conflict had ended the war also had significant effect on consum er or investor confidence thus the effects of the war on the economy were mild most economists do not attribute the 19901991 recession to the gulf war rather they attribute it to contractionary monetary policy the spike in oil prices that accompanied the iraqi invasion of kuwait and problems in the us banking sector the gulf war did not begin until the recessi on was almost over as percentage of gdp military outlays actually fell during the gulf war this report will not be

estimates congressional budget office letter to the honorable pete domenici april 10 2002us military intervention in iraq some economic consequences military operations in iraq raise several macroecono mic questions of congressional interest that th is report will address the economic effects of conflict take two distinct forms the effects of increased military outlays and the potential effects of change in the price of oil and it is crucial to separate those effects this report will analyze the effects of increased military outlays and then analyze the potential effects of change in the price of oil it will conclude with an analysis of the economic experience during the 1991 gulf war but first it will examine the economic size of the conflict the potential size of the conflict 7845 b illion supplemental appropriation has been signed into law pl 108 11 of the 7845 billion 626 billion is dedicated to iraqrelated outlays1 the pentagon estimated that the war has thus fa r cost 20 billion and costs related to the military effort are estimated to run 2 billion per month through the end of the fiscal year2 this appropriation could be followe d by others if the pacification and reconstruction follow different route from that anticipated by the administration by way of comparison the gulf war is estimated to have cost 80 billion in inflationadjusted terms and recent military operations in afghanistan are estimated to have cost 10 billion to date3 one should also take into account the f act that many of the military resources used in the conflict would be used in the absence of conflict for example soldiers must be paid albeit at lower rate nd equipment must be maintained in peace time as well thus when considering the economic effects the relevant figure is the incremental cost of the conflict that is the increase in military expenditures compared to expenditures in the absence of conflict these incremental costs and the fiscal stimulus they generate somewhat lag the conflict since it takes time to replace the armaments and munitions expended httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs2 4 for more information see crs report rl31177 financing issues and economic effects of past american wars by marc labontefor the purpose of estimating macroeconomic effects the most important point to recognize is that even the highest estimates of the military conflict are relatively small given gross domestic product gdp which is now in excess of 10 trillion while the expenditures would be expect ed to have the effects on the economy described in the next section this means that the magnitude of those effects would be small the economics of war financing4 people often assume that wars will l ead to recessions reasoning that the spending on war will lead to less spending in the rest of the economy while this reasoning is correct the conclusion is wrong recessions are characterized by reduction in spending in the entire economy including the military sector while it is true resources must be shifted to the military sector since the military sector is part of gdp the shift does not lower gdp wars may lead to less spending on non military goods and services but there is reas on to assume that it will lead to less spending on total goods and services in fact unde r certain financing methods it is likely to lead to greater spending on total goods and rvices which would increase the growth rate of aggreg ate demand in the short run the increased government outlays associat ed with wars can be financed in four ways through higher taxes reductions in other govern ment spending government borrowing from the public the issuance and sale of us treasury securities to the public or money creation major wars have relied upon all four measures the first two methods are unlikely to have an effect on economic growth aggregate demand in the short run th expansion in aggregate demand caused by greater military outlays is largely offset by the contraction in aggregate demand caused by higher taxes andor lowe r nonmilitary government spending the latter two financing methods incr ease aggregate demand thus by product of wars has typically been shortterm economic boom and increase in employment in excess of the economys sust ainable rate of growth the sectors of the economy that are recipients of the milita ry spending such as the transportation sector and military equipment producers woul d receive the biggest boost just as military buildup in wartime typically boo sts aggregate demand the reduction in defense expenditures after war typically causes brief economic contraction as the economy adjusts to the retu rn to peacetime activities in the conflict with iraq money creati on and higher taxes were not used as financing methods it is possible that some resources could be freed up through lower government spending but given the small projected size of the military outlays in relation to gdp and the temporar nature of the expenditures the bulk of the financing will most likely come from borrowing an increase in the budget deficithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs3 5 for more detailed discussion see crs report rl30583 the economics of the federal budget deficit by brian cashellborrowing from the public if the economys resources are fully employed when the government boosts aggregate mand the increase in government spending must be offset by reduction in spending elsewhere in the economy in the case of borrowing from the public prices and interest rates would be expected to rise the latter causing investment and other interestsensitive spending to be lower than it otherwise would be economists refer to this phenomenon as government purchases crowding out private investment and interestsensitive spending since private investment is crucial to l ongrun growth the longrun eff ect of these policies would be to reduce the private capital stoc k and future size of the economy5 government budget deficits can be fina nced by foreigners as well as domestic citizens if budget deficit is financed by foreigners exports and importcompeting goods rather than private investment would be crowded out by government expenditures through an appreciation of the dollar and larger trade deficit the appreciation occurs because demand for the dollar increases as foreigners purchase us financial instruments in the case of expenditures on military campaign abroad there may be less of an expansion in aggregate demand than from other forms of government spending since some of the expenditures would be us ed for foreign goods and services this suggests that there would be less upward pr essure on the exchange rate and less crowding out of us exports and importcompeting goods around the time of the war most economis ts would agree that the economy was operating below full employment this re duces the extent of crowding out due caused by the deficit because unemployed resources can be brought back into use to match the rise in spending the economy may not be that far from full employment however some economists estimate the full employment rate of unemployment to be 5 since the beginning of 2002 the une mployment rate has fluctuated between 5560 when borrowing is undertaken on very large scale the public will eventually refuse to lend more resources to the g overnment this would then lead to budgetary crisis where the government woul d be forced to turn to other forms of financing andor default on its existing debt policymakers have little reason to be concerned about the governments ability to finance operations on the scale undertaken in iraq the administrati ons current budgetary requests war and domestic would increase the pr ojected budget deficit to only about 4 of gdp the government faced difficulty in persuading the public to finance deficits from 46 of gdp in the mid1980s and early 1990s and the national debt t oday is substantially smaller both absolutely and relative to gdp the fact that the borrowing would be on manageable scale does not imply it coul d not lead to significant crowding out of interestsensitive goods and ex changerate sensitive goods however equity issues all four methods of war fi nancing raise equity questions since each method places the financing bur den on different groups of individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs4 6 for more information see crs report rl30520 the national debt who bears its burden by marc labonte and gail makinenthe burden of financing wars through higher taxes is borne by the individuals who have their taxes raised the burden of fi nancing wars through reduction in other government spending is borne by the individuals to whom the spending was previously directed the burden of fina ncing wars through m oney creation is borne by those whose real wealth and real inco fall when prices rise uniquely the burden of financing wars through borrowing from the public is thought to be borne in part by future generations rather than present generations the result of borrowing from the public is lower private investment and lower private investment leads to smaller future economy and hence lowe r standards of living in the future philosophically the debt financing of wa rs has often been justified on the grounds that the peace or security that wars make possible is enjoyed by present and future generations and therefore the cost should be borne jointly by present and future generations6 the economics of oil shocks before the war there were concerns that military conflict could cause widespread damage to the oilproducing cap acity of iraq and its neighbors which would lead to large spike in oil prices these fears did not come to pass iraqs oil fields were secured quickly by coalition forces and there was damage to its neighbors fields as seen in figure 1 monthly oil prices peaked in february before the war and have fallen since then t hus the war had contemporaneous effect on oil prices and through this channel on the us economy however some would argue that fear of the war is what caused prices to begin rising from about 20barrel at the beginning of 2002 to 30barrel by th end of the year and this price rise should be counted as part of the cost of the war it is difficult to say what path prices would have taken in late 2002 and early 2003 without th buildup to war there were other circumstances at the time that could have also pushed oil prices up such as the unrest in venezuela this report will not attempt to determine whether or not the increase in prices should be attributed to the war but will describe how runup in prices affects the economy in generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs5 7 if rising energy prices affect the economy through this transmission mechanism then falling energy prices should have the opposite effect on the economy they should temporarily reduce inflation and raise output indeed some economists partly attribute the continued0510152025303540crude oil per barrel jan02 apr02 jul02 oct02 jan03 apr03figure 1 monthly oil prices source energy information administration due to the central role energy plays in the functioning of our economy changes in energy prices are not the same as changes in the price of most other goods energy shocks can have macroecono mic consequences in terms of higher inflation higher unemployment and lower output historically energy price shocks have proven particularly troublesome for the us economy sharp spikes in the price of oil have preceded eight of the nine post war recessions including the current one wh oil prices rise suddenly the overall inflation rate is temporarily pushed up because other prices do not instantly adjust and fall at the same time because energy is an important input in the production process the price shock raises the cost of production because other prices do not instantly fall the overall cost of producti on rises and producers must cut back production which causes the contraction in output and employme nt all else equal there may also be adjustment costs to shifting toward less energy intensive methods of production and this could have negative effect on output in the short run typically the effect on output occurs over few quarters the recen t energy price spike followed this pattern with oil prices rising in the second half of 1999 thr ough the first half of 2000 and output growth slowing in the third quarter of 20007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs6 7 continued salutary combination of unusually low inflation and high economic growth of the late 1990s with the fall in energy prices during that time 8 expansionary monetary policy leads to an increase in output only because prices do not adjust instantly to the increase in the money stoc k if prices adjusted instantly there would be increase in output thus given change in the money stock would have smaller effect on output when inflati onary expectations are high 9 the estimate assumes that the price of oil increases by 10 in the first quarter and then stays constant at the higher level for the next three quartersboth the inflation and output effects of energy shocks are temporary once prices adjust the economy returns to full employment and its sustainable growth path this observation yields an important insight it is not the level of energy prices that affects economic growth and infl ation but rather the change in energy prices thus if policymakers priority is to mitigate the eff ect of energy prices on output and inflation they should be concerned with rising ener gy prices and should not be concerned with high energy prices even if the high prices are permanent the only permanent macroeconomic effect of higher energy prices is their negative effect on the terms of trade the terms of trade is measure of standard of living that refers to the labor and capital embodied in us exports that can be exchanged for the labor and capital embodied in foreign imports permanently higher energy prices lead to onetime permanent decline in the terms of trade and the standard of living of us consumers all else equal historically formulating an effective policy response to oil shocks has been difficult expansionary fiscal or mone tary policy increases aggregate demand and inflationary pressures in typical downt urns monetary and fi scal policy can safely become expansionary without triggering si gnificant increase in inflation because the fall in demand reduces inflati onary pressures in oil shocks policymakers must be simultaneously concerned with the fall in economic activity and the rise in prices by tackling one problem they risk exacerbating the other for example if policymakers use expansionary fiscal or m onetary policy to offset the fall in output prices may rise further and inflationary ex pectations could become em bedded this was the problem in the 1970s inflation which was already ri sing before the oil shocks continued to accelerate following the oil shock of 1973 until it reached double digits in 1974 once the public came to expect higher infla tion the subsequent expansionary policy measures had less and less of positive effect on aggregate demand making the purported tradeoff between inflation nd unemployment less and less favorable8 following the second oil shock of 1979 fe deral reserve that was determined to stamp out doubledigit inflation chose instead to tackle the inflationary pressures caused by the oil shock by raising interest rates this decision exacerbated the effect on output contributing to the deepest economic contraction since the great depression with inflation quiescent today the tradeoff has been easier to manage empirical evidence suggests that the cumulative effect of sustained 10 increase in oil prices9 would be to reduce economic growth by 0714 percentagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs7 10 the literature estimating the economic effects of oil shocks is reviewed in crs report rl31608 the effects of oil shocks on the economy review of the empirical evidence by marc labonte 11 hamilton offers evidence that oil price incr eases only have an significant effect on the economy if they persist james hamilton what is an oil shock national bureau of economic research working paper 7755 june 2000points over the next year10 but if the price rise were short lived and quickly reversed there would likely be little effect on the economy11 since the price of oil fell during the war that had positive but mild effect on the economy in the runup to the war prices were above 25barrel from apr il 2002 on and above 30 barrel from january to march 2003 but since prices averaged about 30barrel in 2000 and 25barrel for the first 9 months of 2002 arguably there was new shock to oil prices but merely continuation of the previous one after br ief respite at the beginning of 2002 since it is the change in oil prices rather than the level of prices that affects economic activity oil prices in 2002 probably had little effect on the economy and the increase in prices in the first 3 months of 2003 wa s not longlas ting enough to have serious effect on the economy that assessment is based on current trends since prices have been declining since april 2003 if high pr ices soon returned and were sustained then the effect on the economy could be significant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs8 the role of confidence this report has discussed the effect of the military expenditures and oil price on the economy before the war many of the reports and projections of the wars effects on the economy were highly pess imistic most of the wars negative economic effects in these forecasts came through another channel by reducing consumer and investor confidence accord ing to this story independent of the effects of higher oil prices and military expenditures house holds and businesses would reduce their spending because of psychological malaise and heightened uncertainty brought on by the conflict this they predicted would depress economic activity for example the center for strategic international studies evaluated the macroeconomic effects of four scenario s war benign intermediate worse using the macroeconomic advisers model in the worse case scenario which includes an oil price of 80barrel gdp would contract by 38 in the first quarter following the invasion and 32 in the second quarter of the invasion as disastrous as the results in these simulations are what is even more telling is chart that separates the direct macroeconomic effects of the war oil prices and military expenditures from the confid enceinduced macroeconomic effects decline in confidence rise in bond sprea d fall in stock markets and fall in the exchange value of the dollar if the confidenceinduced effects are removed gdp never shrinks under the worse case scenario and the economys performance is virtually indistinguis hable from the war scenario the likelihood of these effects occurring was highly speculative since it was not clear if there was rational reason for them to occur small conflict as percentage of gdp far from the homela nd should have little longterm effect on the future profitability of us corpor ations and the future earnings of us workers only the rise in oil prices should affect profitability and earnings but the length and severity of the pri ce spike was unknown furthermore the economy has boomed during most wars nd the growth in consumer spending showed decline following the large decline in consumer confidence caused by 911 because psychological effects were so uncertain but so important to the outcome of the projection the projections themselves became highly uncertain as it turned out consumer confiden ce fell slightly in march 2003 4 but rose sharply in april 30 it fell si gnificantly in 2002 42 in the year ending march 2003 but it did not collapse by comparison the index was at similar value in 1993 how much of that fall is attributable to the buildup of the war is highly debatable there were many f actors that could have been reducing consumer confidence in 2002 for exam ple consumer confidence is highly correlated with the unemployment rate signs of investor panic during the war such as widening yield spreads or falling stocks did not materialize presumably these confidence factors were mild ce the military conflict was so successful source joel prakken after an attack on iraq the economic consequences macroeconomic advisers

october 29 1990the us economic experience during the gulf war the gulf war was the only major military operation of the 20th century that did not require any increase in military expenditures as percentage of gdp in fact it took place during the long reduction in military spending as percentage of gdp that accompanied the end of the cold war in this broad sense there is reason to consider the economic effects of fina ncing the buildup in fact an economic contraction occurred during the gulf war unlike the typical wartime economic boom proving that small c onflicts have small economic effects see table 1 for data on the economic environment before during and after the persia n gulf crisis the 1990 1991 recession is not typically attributed to the war except for its possible negative effects on confidence instead it is typica lly attributed to contractionary monetary policy undertaken in 19881989 to quell the ri sing inflation rate problems in the banking sector and the spike in oil pri ces associated with the iraqi invasion of kuwait12 timing supports this argument the monetary tightening took place in 1988 and 1989 the recession began in july 1990 the oil price spike began in august 1990 and military operations began in january 1991 after the conflic t ended the economy began to expand again in march 1991 it did not experience typical postwar contraction unlike previous military conflicts in which the federal reserve had tolerated excessive money creation during the gulf wa r the federal reserve sought to stamp out inflationary pressures that originated before the conflict even at the risk of recession the budget deficit rose during the conflict but it would be difficult to claim that military spending contributed to the rise in the deficit when overall military spending was declining during this time instead the rising budget deficit was characterized by falling tax revenues and rising nonmilitary outlays both of which can be largely accounted for by automatic chan ges in revenues and ou tlays caused by the economic slowdown13 to reduce the widening deficit the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 cut sp ending and increased taxes it was estimated that over the following 5 years 57 of the deficit reduction woul d come from spending cuts and 29 from tax increases 14 would come from lower interest payments changes to excise taxes payroll taxes and individual income taxes accounted for the bulk of the tax increases the revenue raising provisions of the act were estimated to raise tax revenues by 03 of gdp in 1991 most of the spending reductions were to come from reductions in military outlays and medicare spending14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs10 15 department of defense report of the secretary of the defense to the president and the congress washington dc january 1993 table 4 foreign governments also contributed 57 billion of inkind assistanceanother unique aspect of the financin g of the gulf war was the financial contributions that the us received from its allies in effect foreign governments financed large part of the war effort for the united states contributions from foreign governments equaled 48 billi on while the overall cost of the war was 61 billion in current dollars15 in the balance of payments these contributions represented unilateral transfer to the united states which is recorded as reduction in the current account deficit the exchange value of the dollar was unlikely to have been significantly affected however since s ubstantial portion of the

conclusion prior to the conflict it was highly certain how war would affect the us economy it was not clear if the world oil market would be disrupted by the conflict if it was disrupted and the disruption was longlasting the negative economic effects could have been serious additionally d the war gone poorly the effect on us consumer and investor confidence could have also d serious negative effects on the economy it was more certain that th military expenditures would have positive effect on the economy but their size was certain since the scope and duration of the conflict was unknownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31585crs11 in hindsight we now know how all these f actors played out and more definitive analysis of the wars economic effects can be given military expenditures at about 60 billion in 2003 the deficit financed military expenditures have had positive if mild effect on the economy in the short run oil prices oil prices did not rise during the war and have been falling since if the decline tinues this will boost economic growth over the next year some would argue that the increase in oil prices in the runup to the war should be counted as cost of the war while this report makes judgement on the validity of that argument if one were to count that runup as cost of the war it had mildly negative effect on the economy prices rose from roughly 25 to 30 barrel from december 2002 to march 2003 this price increase was too brief to do serious lasting damage to th economy counting the oil price rise to 25 in early 2002 as cost of the war seems more dubious since it happened long before the war be gan and only brought prices back to levels seen in 2000 and 2001 confidence consumer confidence fell slightly during the war and shot up after it had ended the fa ll during the war was too small to have significant economic impact there were signs that the war was causing an increase in risk aversion in financial markets some would argue that the large decline in confidence in the year before the war should be counted as cost of the war but there are many unrelated factors that could have been causing confidence to fall in the last year since none of these three factors were si gnificant at least wh ile the conflict was taking place the economic effects of the war in iraq were probably fairly small
