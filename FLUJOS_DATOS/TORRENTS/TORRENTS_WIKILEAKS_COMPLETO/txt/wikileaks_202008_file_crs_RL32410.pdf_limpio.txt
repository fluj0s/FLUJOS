question of us assistance to russia and the other new republics of th former soviet union it approved series of bills most prominent of which was the freedom for russia and emerging eurasian democracies and open ma rkets support act of 1992 the freedom support act authorized us foreign assistan ce to the new states and established the policy framework that laid out the criteria for assistance as well as the types of programs and projects to be assisted members of congress took the lead on this issue by pressuring the administration to submit legislative proposal the house foreign affairs committee even crafted and on march 24 1992 introduced its own authorization bill for the region on april 1 1992 presid ent bush announced the administrations comprehensive legislation the freedom support act as congress debated the administration bill attention focused on several key issues should the united states assist the former soviet union and if so how much money should the country provi how much freedom should the administration have to carry out an assi stance program for the region what kind of conditions must the new states meet in order to be eligible for assistance what specific programs should the us support with its funding as the bill moved throug h committee and floor debate congress molded and transformed the administra tion bill in critical ways unlike the administration congress established specific levels of funding it pl aced some restrictions on administration flexibility it recommended criteria that countries should follow to be eligible for assistance and establis hed prohibitions on assistance finally congress listed range of programs some of which were recommended others clear priorities for adoption by the administration like most important and controversial legislati on passage of the freedom support act was process affected by dive rse and conflicting interests the house and senate took different approaches to the bill the bipartisan support of congressional leaders was considered cr ucial to the success of the legislation multiple committee jurisdiction was resolved but not without some friction perhaps the most dramatic conflict affecting the legislation was that caused by those who held the bill hostage to the passage of domestic econo mic legislation in the end congress produced policy for the united states to follow in its efforts to influence the former soviet union th freedom support act was approved by the senate on july 2 1992 by 7620 vote the house approved the bill on august 6 1992 by

role of congress introduction when the 102nd congress reconvened fo r its second session in january 1992 it faced very different world than had been the case at the end of the previous session in december 1991 the soviet union had formally ceased to exist replaced by 12 newly independent states whose political and economic systems were in varying states of confusion and instability1 four of the states still housed nuclear weapons many bordered parts of the world that were of strategic interest to the united states one remained the worlds largest nation possessi ng enormous wealth in natural and human resources still potentially powerful political force and valuable trade partner how the united states should respond to these new entities was likely the most important foreign policy question of the year the foreign aid program afforded congress an especially strong role in th initiation and formulation of that response wielding its authorization and especially its appropriation powers in the foreign aid process congress has often used the prog ram to influence the direction of us foreign policy in this case as it sought to exercise its foreign aid muscle it found itself at times in conflict with the executiv branch and even at times in conflict with itself as always the general political environment dominated by the impending presidential and c ongressional election was f actor in the deliberations and posturing this report discusses the key role c ongress played in formulating an aid program for the former soviet union in 1992 focusing on

interest in the new states of the former soviet union and interest in finding ways to ssist their evolution toward democracy and free markets was evident in the wealth of hearings held by numerous committees the considerable time spent on floor speeches and debate and most important in the amount of legislation submitted and approved the legislative record in 1992 congress produced number of

in 1992 and signed by the president into law the freedom support ac t received the most public attention and stimulated the most controversy and debate within congress8 the freedom support act was focus of congressional cern because it was intended by the administration to be the centerpiece legislation regarding us assistance to the new republics of the region the bush administr ation hailed it as comprehensive policy framework for future us relations with the new states and in fact its various parts encapsulated all types of assistance in cluding those debated concurrently in the context of the defense authorization and ppropriations bills president bush called this effort to assist the former soviet union the most important foreign policy opportunity of our time9 congress treated the legislation as matter of great consequence chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on europe lee hamilton called it by far the most important foreign policy vote that most members will cast in their careers in the congress10 house republican whip newt gingrich compared the vote to congressional adoption of th marshall plan in 1948 and said the vote may well be as important vote as any of us will ever cast11 chairman of the senate foreign relations committee claiborne pell called the act the most important piece of foreign policy legislati on dealt with by the committee during the 102nd congress12 the freedom support act represented an important statement by congress on number of levels first it was statem ent of congressional support for an activist foreign policy approach to the region with foreign assistance as the instrument of policy some members rejected the idea of providing assistance until the newlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs4 independent states had c onclusively adopted mark et economy and democratic systems others felt the united states w ould be better off spending money on us domestic programs during time of recession and still ot hers rejected any foreign aid the majority of congress however ag reed that the united states could not sit by and do nothing while the country that d dominated us national security policy for more than four decades was possibly changing in the direction the united states had long sought second the freedom support act was vehicle for congress itself to participate actively and substantively in the formulation of policy visavis the former soviet union the final version of the act approved in oct ober was substantially different from the draft proposed by the pres ident in april at that time president bush requested significant degree of flexibility in determining what programs to fund the amount of funding and the conditi ons of funding although it left the president with much discretionary authority congress did establish the objectives of us aid set specific amounts of aid laid out list of specific types of programs it would like funded and set conditions for th new states to follow in order to be eligible for assistance finally the act signaled change in the character of us aid to the region from period of ad hoc assistance characterized by delivery of agricultural commodity credit guarantees and food and dical aid to long term development effort characterized by provision of technical assistance in variety of sectors and by us private sector investment support as noted above the freedom support act was not the only piece of legislation to emerge from the debate on how to assi st the former soviet union it was however the center of attention and chief focus of the debate the legislation contained elements of all the other legisl ation that was approved on this subject in 1992 the debate on it was more extensive and covered the whole range of related issues that concerned congress two major conflicts characterized the debate on and formulation of the freedom support act in one congress and the ad ministration frequently rubbed against each other as they both sought to formulate policy and programs for the region in the other elements within congress representin g different points of view contended with each other to achieve their objectives how legislative program emerged from these various contending fo rces is discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs5 13 for more comprehensive overview of c ongressional

ged to the baltic states following military crackdown and bloodshed there in january on june 12 1991 in response to soviet request another 15 billion in agriculture credit guarantees was offered 15 roughly 96 of the 42 billion in us assistance offered between december 1990 and november 20 1991 had been in the form of export credits or guarantees this form of assistance was criticized by senator leahy as stopgap measure and not longterm policy senator leahy chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee and the continuedcongress leads time and again in 1992 congress took th initiative in formulating new us policy toward the former soviet union this action occurred largely through development of foreign assistance legisla tion but also through speeches and hearings that might shape public opinion it can be argued that the prominent voice wielded by individual members and then by congress as whole ultimately helped to move what had been largely inert us govern ment toward active measures in support of fsu efforts to build democracy and free market economies events prior to 1992 as 1992 commenced congress had already be gun to establish itself as major player on soviet aid because many belie ved the bush administration was unwilling to take the lead on the issue since 1990 administration responses to events in the soviet union appeared ad hoc in natu re although the bush administration had adopted the goal of supporting reformist president mikhail gorbachev in his perestroika program it did not pronounce any largescale or comprehensive aid program to demonstrate that support13 the first aid initiative came in december 1990 responding to an urgent request from foreign minister shevardn adze for food and medical assistance president bush offered up to 1 billion in commodity credit corporation ccc agricultural credit guarantees us guaran tees of shortterm three year loans at market rates the president also ma available 300 million of eximbank credits for purchase of us goods technical assi stance grants to improve food distribution and implement economic reforms and 5 million in disaster relief medical assistance were also offered thereafter until the attempted coup in august 1991 the administration periodically extended additional medical aid or agricultural credit guarantees14 the bush administration reacted with some caution following gorbachevs recovery of power it resumed release of credits promised be fore the coup attempt but did not offer new assistance til november 20 1991 when it announced further 125 billion in agricultural credit guarantees and 165 million in grant food aid15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs6 15 continued agriculture committee considered ccc credits as deceptive piecemeal foreign aid and disguised foreign aid package because of the high risk that the loans would not be repaid he suggested the administration adopt more honest approach and come to the american people with coherent soviet aid polic this is

administration do what they believed was much too little to encourage democratic forces in th soviet union on august 27 1991 house majority leader gephardt repeated pr oposal that the united states provide 3 billion year in credits and technical assi stance in return for economic reforms on august 28 chairman of the house armed services committee aspin suggested that 1 billion be drawn from the defe nse budget for emergency humanitarian assistance his argument was that with thousands of nuclear weapons still in soviet hands and dispersed among several repub lics with independe nce movements and ethnic conflicts soviet political stability had become critical factor in us national security soon after chairman of the senate armed services committee senator sam nunn united with his house counterpart to draft proposal that would allocate 1 billion of defense money for the soviet ion part of the funds would go toward the humanitarian uses favored by represen tative aspin and part would be used as senator nunn proposed to help the soviet s dismantle nuclear weapons and convert their defense industry to civilian uses the administration wa s consulted throughout the discussions but declined to take position on the initiative despite this agreement by these senior congressional leaders the proposal as originally constructe d was dropped and it briefly appear ed that any assistance would be out of the question declining us economy coupled with white house resistance to extending unemployment benefits helped to create this temporary impasse by stimulating public opposition to foreign aid house members seemed to sense the public mood first althoug h the house approved foreign aid authorization bill by large margin in june and it appeared that congress would enact bill for the first time since 1985 th conference report on the bill was rejected by the house on october 30 1991 in the following week democrat harris wofford defeated the highly favored republican candidate former attorney general richard thornburgh in special election for seat in the us senate theme of woffords campaign had been that it was time to stop taking care of the rest of the worlds problems and attend to the economic recession at home viewed as vote against foreign aid the election elicited number of congressi onal proposals to divert foreign aid funds to domestic purposes and inspired democrats to attack president bush for spending too much time on foreign affairs16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs7 17 hr 3807 the conventional forces in eur ope treaty

that he believed had appeared in both political parties he called for substantial program of assistance for russia from the united states europe and japan and he pointedly noted the parallel between harry truman and the early origins of the marshall plan in 1947 and contemporary events that challenged president bush in 1992 bot h faced opposing political party domination of congress an antiforeign aid mood and an impending election in the days preceding the speech nixon had circulated memo among foreign affairs experts that more directly attacked the bush administration program of assistance as being pathetically inadequate response in light of the oppor tunities and dangers we face in the crisis in the former soviet union24 because of the former presidents republican credentials and recognized expertise in foreign affairs his speech received considerable media attention and stimulated numerous editorials and op ed pi eces however on the same day as the nixon speech key members of congress had also stepped forward again to express their support for more aggressive aid prog ram bipartisan group led by senators nunn and lugar came out with recommendations that would encourage us private investment and fac ilitate defense convers ion democratic mbers of the senate foreign relations committee told ambassador to russia robert strauss that they would

deputies meeting were two key factors in the speed and timing of the announcement however many believe the administration hurried to complete its aid package and announce it on april 1 because

in crease became one of th most disputatious aspects of the debate on passage of the act in the final analysis therefore the legislative proposal was more an effort to establish congressi onal and public support for an assistance program than condition for further action the freedom support act was means fo r rallying congress and public opinion around us support for an important foreig n policy agenda however in the view of many congressional suppor t was equally necessary to the administration for domestic political reasons in order to protect the president from the stigma of being alone in supporting foreign aid nevert heless members of congress repeatedly made it clear that it would take presidential leadership to push the legislation through congress democrats being equally reluctant to take the political risk for approving foreign aid after the president announced the proposal at press conference he mentioned it in number of speeches and sent his foreign policy advisers to testify on capitol hill but during the first months he continued to be reluctant to make it high profile campaign issue by midjune however as the legislation appeared increasingly endangered the president told the cable news network that he would do whatever it takes to persuade congress to cast tough vote on the issue33 in the end it is likely that presidential leadership expressed most effectively through intensive lobbying by secretary of state baker was only one of several factors that made the difference equally important were the visit to congress of russian president boris yeltsin and the belief of many members especially in the house and senate leadership of both par ties that support for the assistance to the region was the right thing to do these factors are discussed below congress responds although the administration originally hoped to see the freedom support act approved by congress before the visit of russian president boris yeltsin in mid june it

greater flexibility in determin ing the creditworthiness of agricultural aid recipients the housepassed bill differed from the admi nistration bill in several ways for example it authorized appropriation of speci fic amounts to carry out the bilateral aid program and allowed use of security assist ance funds for nonproliferation and disarmament activities it authorized an appropriation for democracy corps it placed most of the bilateral activities in the framework of the fo reign assistance act of 1961 the legislation which guides the foreign aid program in the rest of the world it also included detailed language on nonproliferation and disarmament and on space trade and cooperation it contained prohibition on assistance to azerbaijan it eliminat ed the flexible interpretation of creditworthiness provisions regarding ag ricultural credit guarantees perhaps most notably it both authorized and appropr iated funds for the imf quota increase 47 the senatepassed bill differed from the admini stration bill in several ways for example it authorized specific amounts of assistance fo r eastern europe as well as for the fsu it eliminated the flexible interp retation of

continued environment it prohibited assistance to russi after one year if steps were not taken to withdraw troops from the baltics and to azerbaijan if steps were not taken to end the blockade of nagornokarabakh perhaps most notably the senate bill added language recommending and sometimes earmarking funds for large number of new bilateral assistance project activities including veral types of educational exchanges the final conference version of the freedom support act did carry over most of the essential features of the president s bill but the congressional imprint was very strong congress put limitations on executive authority sought by the president it placed political and other conditions to govern the allocation of funds and it recommended multiple programs that were in effect congressional priorities for the use of funds the legislative debate that began in april ran along two intertwined tracks the first was broad discussion of issues ch as whether the united states should provide assistance to the fo rmer soviet union how mu ch money it should provide and where the money should go the sec ond focused on the specifics of the proposed legislation and its proposed amendment by congress the main elements of this debate are discussed below intersectin g these tracks through much of the debate were the issue of linkage to domestic economic needs and the approaching fall election the role of these factors is reviewed in the subsequent section should the united states assist the fsu the broadest of issues whether the united states should play role in assisting the former soviet union was rarely central point of the debate those who were most vocal about the bill were supporters of assistance their concerns were the tails of the legislation and the program of us assistance those who spoke out in opposition to assistance fell into three often overlapping categories one set opposed foreign aid in principle although even many of these would make an exception for humanitarian assistance some of these argued that the soviet union and its predecessors remained untrustworthy and threat to the united states others argued that only the private sector and private investment could help the fsu still others argued that the fsu was capable of paying its own way and that us aid mig ht therefore be provided in the form of loans if collateral in the form of natural resources was offered not all the usual opponents of foreign aid opposed aid to the fsu some of those who usually opposed foreign aid for developing count ries supported assistance to the fsu on national security and trade grounds second set of opponents expressed their displeasure with particular features of the proposed legislation they tried us ually unsuccessfully to eliminate or alter those features and voted ag ainst the final legislation the imf quota contribution was particular target of this group although bilateral aid may have been acceptable others sought more strict economic nd political conditionality prior to providing assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs18 48 joint hearing may 6 1992 p3536 49 joint hearing may 6 1992 p30 50 joint hearing may 6 1992 p39

freedom support act was an authorization bill the president s bill would authorize the appropriation of 12 billion for the imf quota increase followon appropriation bill would be necessary to

oppose aid to the fs u as long as aid was provided for us domestic purposes how much money the biggest point of contention for congress was how much the program would cost both becaus foreign aid was generally viewed as unpopular with the american people and becau of political pressures to spend the money on us domestic programs if the legislation was percei ved as providing very large aid program its chances of passage would be sharply reduced the first problem members identified was to ascertain what the administration was requesting there was dollar am ount in the bill the administrations legislation authorized to be appropriated for fy1992 nd fy1993 such sums as may be necessary to carry out the act senator kasten note d this openended authorization was likely to encourage mistrust between the legislative branch and the administration48 more than month after the proposal was announced the administration was criticized for not yet giving clear answer to this question after administration officials testified at one hearing senator leahy noted that if somebody asked back home in vermont this weekend how much is it going to cost im still not sure i know49 senator conrad added but the bottom line is i have absolutely idea what is the united states doing in terms of number how much aid are we providing50 some members noted that the administrations response to this line of questioning did not encourage their confid ence in the initial news conference introducing the bill both the president nd secretary baker seemed unsure of the details of the program officials

1990 that the imf quota would not count against the budget caps for the year it was approvedis trying to blur the issue of how much his plan will cost the american taxpayers he said53 the congressional response to this obfus cation was to authorize specific sums for humanitarian and technical assistance and other costs associated with the bill the house foreign affairs committee took the first steps in this regard reporting bill authorizing 5847 million including the 150 million that had been the presidents fy1992 request for humanitarian and technical assistance and additional amounts for usia and state department ac tivities by the time the substitute bill was debated on the house floor the figu re was changed to 417 million the fy1992 amount having been eliminated because the appropriation had already been approved initially the sena bill did not include specific dollar amounts senator pell however faced complaints that the lack of number cons tituted an openended authorization consequently he introduced an amendmen t on the floor that replaced the such sums as may be necessary lang uage with an authorization of 620 million including 150 million for fy199254 the final conference version of the act authorized 410 million for humanitarian and technical assistance for fy1993 25 million for new state department and usia diplomatic posts 708 million for cultural and educational exchanges and 100 million of security assistance funds for nonproliferation and di sarmament activities55 the imf quota increase the one specific authorization in all versions

exp ected to amount to over 12 billion when deposited in the imf account following actment and subse quent appropriation the 12 billion figure drew much attenti on during the debate on the bill because of its size the smaller humanitarian and technical assistance requests were already included in the foreign aid budget for fy1993 the 12 billion request would be additional56 moreover the imf quotas connection to th effort to assist the fsu was only indirect the quota increase was agreed to by imf members in 1990 prior to the breakup of the former soviet union and w ith the anticipated loan requirements of eastern europe in mind the authorization language had been included in the foreign aid authorization bill conference report rejected by the house the previous october because

controversial this was th up to 3 billion that could be used for currency stabilization funds these funds would be taken from an already existing resource within the imf and therefore required neither an authorization nor appropriation the bill language only provided congressional endorsement for use of this money 58 congressional record july 2 1992 s9715as the 12 billion quota increase drew fire from some members the administration argued repeatedly that lthough large sum it would incur new outlays this was because the contribu tion in budgetary terms represented an exchange of assets although it would re quire an appropriati on it would not affect the budget deficit in defense of the incr ease the administration stressed the role of the imf in the multilateral aid package devised by the g7 for russia most importantly the act authorizes the imf quota increase step that the congress absolutely must take to s upport this multilateral effort declared secretary baker57 reluctance to support the 12 billion quot increase became evident in the course of the legislative bate aid supporters in the house hoped to include the imf appropriation in its version of the freedom support act thereby avoiding second difficult vote on the appropria tion the house foreign operations subcommittee bill hr 5368 did not include the appropriation at its markup on june 12 representative obey indicated he would have objection to an amendment directly attaching the imf appropriation onto the freedom support act but during senate debate on the freedom support act senator leahy insisted that the proper place for the imf appropriation was in the appropriations bill and he obtained the agreement of senator pell that any appr opriation language offered by the house would not be allowed into the confer ence report of the freedom support act58 when the house subsequently took up the au thorization bill it did attach the imf appropriation then the senate appropriations committee included the imf increase in its version of the foreign aid appropriations bill where to put the increase language was perhaps the last impor tant decision made regarding fsu aid legislation during 1992 fina

senate on october 5 and was signed into law pl 102391 on october 6 third issue related to the costs of the aid package was the creditworthiness of the former soviet union many member s argued that the amount of funds that congress was asked to approve under the ac t and associated ppropriation bills was actually far greater than the administration would lead them to believe this was partly reaction to the confusion created by the shifting figures and explanations provided by the administration in the course of the debate but it was also rooted in concern that russia might not be able to repay its debts and that the export loans and guarantees offered in conjunction w ith the proposed aid program might more honestly be labeled grants opponents of the legislati on attempted to show that the

bill was rejected by vote of 75 to 2160 concerns regarding fsu creditworthin ess induced both the house and senate to reject the administrations effort to relax creditworthiness criteria applied to the fsu for grain and other agricultural comm odity purchases the administrations version of the act would have allowed the secretary of agriculture to take other factors the extent to which the fsu carries out reforms for example into account besides simple ability to repay wh determining whether to provide loan guarantees61 the congressional budget office cbo suggested this might lead to provision of aid even if creditworthiness wa s questionable because that might mean increased budgetary outlays that coul d bump up against the budget ceiling for agriculture spending point of order

ignore an entire body of united states w i think may be excessive64 it was the notwithstanding language that attracted the most criticism by members in senator leahys view the act gave the president

popular way for congress to influence foreign policy early in the debate representative hamilton noted that strong conditionality must be in the bill in order to head off amendments on the floor citing experience from the year before when numerous restrictions on aid to the then soviet union were offered so successfully to the house version of the foreign aid authorization bill73 congressional conditions inserted in th freedom support ac t possessed several levels of stringency at one level were criteria that the president was required to simply take into account in determining the degree of economic assistance the administration imposed some of these criteria on itself having introduced the act with language that would require the president to weigh the extent to which the new states had taken steps toward establishment of democratic systems respect for human rights economic reform based on market pr inciples respect for international law obligations and

stringent language was strongly opposed by the administration the president wrote congress on october 2 that the amendment would result in cutoff of us assistance and noted that the issue was already

withdrawal or substan tial withdrawal had occurred77 the most stringent condition for assist ance adopted by congress in the freedom support act allowed waiver by the president it banned aid to azerbaijan unless it took steps to end its blockade and othe r uses of force against nagorno karabakh and armenia senator john kerry made the original proposal during foreign relations committee markup adopted by 144 vote and late r altered it on the floor the house foreign affairs committee adopted similar language at its markup offered by representatives owens tori celli and broomfield although the administration argued against the amendment when it was offered in the senate ambassador armitage later described it as quite struggle it later worked to soften the language and seemed to resi gn itself to its adoption by congress where should the money go the one issue on which the largest number of members weighed in with their views concerned which programs and activities to support whether the intent was to tablish program leading more effectively and efficiently to the goals of democracy and freemarkets to benefit us business or in some cases their own districts or to boost programs reflecting pet interests members frequently expressed their own set of priorities of where the money might best be spent the result was strong impact on the shape and substance of the aid program in the former soviet union the administration bill merely sketched the broad categories of assistance that might be provided and noted the names of specific programs like the special american business internship training program sabit the america houses concept and eurasia foundation as i ndications of the types of activities that might be undertaken specifi c programs were established there were nine different priorities outlined in the administration bill for some members like senator bob kerrey these were too many in response to his suggestion that the list be cut down to size ambassador armitage noted that although the administration was in agreem ent with this view other members had their own specific interests and sometimes the price for doing business for us is to include on the list some things that maybe you or i would not in vacuum have on the list78 even prior to the intr oduction of the freedom support act members had introduced bills that contained their own priorities of aid programs for the fsu many of these were turned into amendments offered in committee and on the floor the senate adopted the most program amendments the committee bill kept these to minimum on the floor however numerous amendments emphasized onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs26 79 the committee rejected one effort to include program of educational exchanges along lines similar to the bradley amendment in the senate 80 this paralleled language in the defense authorization bill and was reportedly added because chairman fascell had not participated in formulating the defense authorization languageactivity or another these amendments allowed the use of technical assistance to the agriculture sector for food processing f acilities support for policy reform for health and environmental protecti on laws and educational assistance for printing of educational materials the president wa s encouraged to support funding of capital projects assistance was promoted for such other activities as reform of the banking system family planning and ma ternal health services dr ug education and promotion of efficient intermodal transport systems several adopted amendments supported the use of aid to promote nuclear reactor safety the senate amended the bill to include number of peopletopeople exchanges 75 million was authorized to support an amendment originally sponsored by senator bill bradley providi ng exchanges of secondary college and graduate students pr ofessors business interns and government officials an international local government exchange act sponsored by senator wellstone provided for exchanges of local gove rnment personnel 10 million and 12 million were authorized respectively to set up fi ve us and three fsu agribusiness centers to facilitate exchanges among agribusiness practitioners to act as liaison for these and other exchange programs the bill authorized 5 million to establish american centers in the fsu noting the example of the senate bill house leaders were concerned that similar amendments would engorge their version of the bill and they made every effort to keep the bill clean neve rtheless during committ ee markup two major program amendments were added79 language offered by chairman fascell was adopted establishing nonprolifera tion and disarmament fund to promote destruction and dismantlement of weapons it set up sc ience and technology centers and allowed assistance to be used for defense conversion purposes80 the committee also adopted an amendment offered by representative hyde recommending establishment of democracy corps that would place teams of americans in the smaller cities to promote mocratic development b ecause the house debated the bill under closed rule w ithout ame ndment further program priorities were added the freedom support act as approved by congress greatly condensed the senate program amendments turning many specific programs back into general categories of activities that were recommended for presid ential consideration the conference report contained 13 generic categor ies of such programs in addition it emphasized and detailed certain specific programs including establishment of american business centers the democracy corps the nonproliferation and disarmament fund activities noted above and various earmar ked educational exchanges the result was bill that allowed considerable executive flexibility but also demarcated congressional priorities and interests that could be altered and expanded over timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs27 81 congressional record august 6 1992 h7594 82 new york times july 10 1992congress versus congress the internal debate the freedom support act was not simp ly the product of tensions and competition between the administration and congress an opposition of views within congress played key role in development and passage of the bill as well there were differences between the house and senate between the leadership and members among committees between democrats and republicans under the influence of an impending presidential election and between those regardless of party who supported quick passage of the b ill and those who used the bill to leverage support for domestic spending measures so aspects of the internal debate that shaped the final act are discussed below house versus senate as with most legisl ation the house and senate versions were different and required resolution in conference these differences as noted above included the numbers of sp ecific programs authorized and the prohibition regarding withdrawal of russian troops from the baltics the actions of one body were observed by and influenced actions of the other body the senate was expected to take up the bill first and some senators were reportedly concerned that their vote for the aid package would have little meaning and only hurt them if the bill failed in the house where arguments favoring domestic spending over foreign aid were particularly strong m eanwhile some in the house viewed senate action on the bill with concern attempting to discourage his colleagues from replicating the adding of amendments by the other chamber chairman hamilton suggested that the senate experience might be instructive for members of the house in his view several of the senate amendments were overlapping contradictor and would create layer upon layer of new bureaucracy he argued that bill clean of encumbering amendments would allow the house to be in the drivers seat when the time comes to shape better legislation in conference with the senate81 leadership versus members one interesting feature of the whole debate on the freedom support act was the strong support provided the bill by leadership of both bodies and both parties the rank nd file especially those facing the fall election were somewhat less thusiastic about voting in fa vor of foreign aid since 1985 the only major foreign aid authoriza tion to survive both houses of congress was the 1989 seed act providing assistance to eastern europe when both house and senate finally approved an aid authorization in 1991 the conference report was defeated in the house victim of the antiforeign aid mood that swept congress during the autumn given this histor many members re portedly believed that bipartisan leadership support of the act was requirement for passage members of each party were reluctant to support aid onl to find the other party had backed off neither party wanted to bear the responsib ility alone of providing funds for the fsu that could be spent at home82 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs28 83 congressional quarterly march 28 1992 p813 84 senate

the bill under other committees jurisdiction and allow them to offer amendments on the floor the administration made it clear that they would refuse to comment on the foreign relations bill unless they could see the entire package therefore most major sec tions remained in the bill prior to amendment on the floor senator pell congressional record july 1 1992 s9407the leadership was credited with successfully steering the bill through the house in the face of considerable opposition from rank and file members when for example the rules committee met to take up the bill it faced members hanging off the rafters with proposed amendments republican leader robert michel and majority leader richard gephardt were said to have played critical role in holding off this effort and gaining approval of closed rule committee versus committee because the freedom support act in its effort to be comprehensive package covered so many issues and types of assistance it fell under the jurisdiction of multiple committees in both houses this presented potential challenge to the lead ership because multiple jurisdiction could greatly slow down passage and might open up the bill to killer amendments at first senate leaders consid ered appointment of bipartisan task force that would lessen chances of jurisdictional fights83 in letter to committee chairmen chairman pell of the senate foreign relations committee the committee with primary jurisdiction suggested three options for c onsideration of the bill each portion could be considered by the committee of jurisdiction and then submitted to foreign relations for amendment the whole bill could be considered by foreign relations taking the advice of the other committees or it could be left as is it is going to be difficult problem to disentangle the different portions senator pell said84 noting that at least six committees had jurisdicti on in the senate senator lugar thought it possible that senate leaders mitchell and dole might have to draft leadership package to facilitate passage85 in the end the bill reported by th foreign relations committee was the product of closely coordinated ffort among the relevant committees86 in order to move most expeditiously the committ ee with administration support marked up the entire bill87 the committee deleted specific sections of the administration bill at the request of the finance and intelligence committees prior to reporting the bill and allowed the armed services agriculture and banking committees to offer amendments to the bill in the course of floor debate the senate procedure worked smoothly for example at the request of members of the appropriations committee an amendment was offered by foreign relations committee leaders removing the such sums as may be necessary language in order to take care of concerns regarding the appropriations committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32410crs29 88 congressional record july 1 1992 s9398 89

process88 as discussed earlier the chairman of the agriculture committee offered an amendment that prevented the administration from loosening creditworthiness requirements for provision of certain ccc agricultural commodity loan guarantees89 committee amendments negotiated in advance with the administration and the foreign rela tions committee were adopted easily in the house on the other hand committee prerogatives were handled somewhat differently after being reported out of the foreign affairs committee the bill was referred sequentially to the committees on armed services agriculture banking finance and urban affairs and science space and technology armed services and agriculture reported out the bill with amendments the substitute amendment to the bill that was debated on the floor hr 5750 reflected the changes suggested by most committees of jurisdiction but not all the banking committee had reported out provisions unde r its jurisdiction most important those regarding the imf quota increase in its own bill hr 3428 the international development trade and finance act of 1992 however in its substitute bill the foreign affairs committee chose to ignore the banking committees language elaborating environmental and other guidelines for use of the imf funds although the rule under which the bill was deba ted allowed the banking co mmittee some time to offer its views amendments were permitted that would give the committee an opportunity to change the bill represen tative mary rose oakar chair of the subcommittee on international development finance trade and monetary policy protested that the committee had exclusive jurisdiction called the decision unfair and opposed the bill90 foreign aid versus domestic concerns perhaps the most dramatic divergence of views existed within the house of representatives where supporters of the bill selfdescribed foreign policy pragmatists were pitted against an alliance largely composed of conservatives mo stly republicans and liberals mostly democrats who opposed foreign assistance to the fsu many opposed foreign aid in principle and traditionally voted against any aid bill others were sensitive to the impending election and sought cover from constituent views hostile to foreign assistance but substantial number opposed this particular foreign aid package only as long as the administration refused to support passage of legislation that would provide assistance for domestic programs it was this latter group consisting mostly of democrats that threatened to derail the freedom support act opponents of aid and those who sought to use it as lever for getting domestic aid program staked out their positions early in the debate one day after president bush introduced his aid package frequently vocal opponent of foreign aid representative james traficant argued th at 24 billion the g7 package should go to the states and cities charity starts at home he said91

supporters of the freedom support act wa s the position of members led by house majority whip bonior the only leader in either party who threatened to oppose the package its fine to embrace new world order for the exsoviet states but not by turning cold shoulder to jobs for the united states he said on april 292 after meeting with secretary baker representative bonior noted before we can consider aid to russia jobs for americans must come firsti am determined that this house should not support the administrations plan for additional assistance to the former soviet republics until the president first addresses the issue of jobs and economic growth for america specifically an extension of unemployment benefits and an accelerated jobs program for americans93 by may 5 letter circulated by representatives bonior and wise had obtained signatures of 103 house democrats who told the president that they would oppose aid unless he supported reform or extension of unemployment compensation and creation of 10 billion public works program to modernize us infrastructure linkage was considered serious thr eat by many supporters of assistance representative hamilton spoke out strongly ag ainst the linkage effort at the april 30 foreign affairs committee hearing with secretary baker both domestic and fsu assistance are important to the country but to link them will certainly complicate an already difficult path to passage of the legislation which you have presented to us today and might even je opardize passage of it94 not formally endorsed by house and senate leaders the bonior position linking foreign and domestic aid nevertheless became rule for many democrats in the house this position seemed to be strength ened in small measure by the influence of the approaching fall elections by early june when the bill appeared stalled in congress representative jim leach noted the real possibility that it would not be approved this is congressional re sponsibility and congress has not acted they have not acted because of fourletter word fear fear that they wont get reelected95 both democrats and republicans sought to deflect negative ramifications from their vote in favor of the bill not only by passing domestic aid legislation but also by demanding active presidential leadership in pushing for the aid package presidential leadership in support of the bill was cover

administration for having its priorities wrong96 the desire to protect themselves from constituent complaints encouraged members to emphasize the advantage to the united states in providing assistance to the fsu and draw up amendments th at would strengthen this point97 during floor debate many members noted the billions of dollars in defense budget savings gained by the united states through peaceful and democratic russia and pointed out long term advantages to us busine ss in trade and investment opportun ities that would result many spoke of dir ect benefits derived from the aid package itself including establishment of american business centers to assist us exporters and investors the use of us universities for training and pr ocurement of us goods and services for assistance programs although only third of the senate faced reelection in 1992 senators were not immune to the linkage argument98 during senate debate senators donald riegle and howard metzenbaum offe red an amendment to authorize us health youth and other domestic programs in an amount equa l to what the bill provided for the former soviet union while the sponsors asserted th at it was in the us interest to support reform in russia in their view it was equally important to support aid for economic recovery in the united states an allia nce of conservative re publicans and members of the foreign relations committee rose to speak against the amendment largely on the grounds that it would kill the bill if approved the amendment was defeated 643299 by midjuly prospects for passage of the freedom support act in the house improved largely because many of the dema nds made by linkage advocates had been met recognizing the strength of linkage forces democratic leaders foley and gephardt had reportedly told the white house that the aid bill would not be brought to vote until the administration supported four part domestic renewal program100 by the first week in july three of these

commerce appropriations bill funded usia educational exchanges and costs for the ne w diplomatic missions earmarked by the act the defense appropriations b ill funded nunnlugar demilitarization and nonproliferation assistance activ ities however the largest slice of the pie the broader technical assistance and humanita rian activities and the imf quota increase were appropriated in th fy1993 foreign operations appropriations bill the appropriation process was another opportunity for congress to influence the direction as well as the amount of aid to the former soviet union because of its recurrent failure to approve foreign aid authorization bills congress often included authorization language in the foreign aid appropriations bill but the house foreign operations subcommittee wh ich had reluctantly grown accustomed to including authorizing legislation in its bill avoided such language pertaining to the fsu in its fy1993 aid b ill in its report on hr 5368 the committee made point of supporting the normal authoriza tion process with regard to the proposed aid program for the fsu because the administration authorization provisions the freedom support act went far beyond the normal jurisdiction of the committee102 the bill reported on june 18 provi ded 417 million of which 50 million was earmarked for educational exchanges and 50 million was made available for agricultural commodities for women and children the report language was more extensive urging the administration to resolve outstanding pow and freedom of emigration issues with the fsu it recommended that the aid program focus on exchanges agricultural activities energy and environmental programs and transportation it offered s upport for particular programs such as those assisting parliamentary

the vicissitudes of partisan political fortunes107 in the end despite disagreements betw een the administration and congress and between elements within congress itself and despite the external pressures dictated by congressional and presid ential elections congress pproved and the president signed into law broad package and strategy for assistance to the former soviet union the bipartisan agreement sought by both administra tion and congressional leaders was achieved fortythree mocrats and 33 republicans supported the measure in the senate 161 democrats nd 94 republicans approved it in
