nominations occurring between 1900 and the present it focuses on the actual amounts of time that presidents and the senate have taken to act as opposed to the elapsed time between oﬃcial points in the process for example rather than starting the nomination clock with the oﬃcial notiﬁcation of the president of forthcoming vacancy eg via receipt of formal retirement letter this report focuses on when the president ﬁrst learned of justices intention to leave the court eg via private conversation with the outgoing justice or received word that sitting justice had died likewise rather than starting the conﬁrmation clock with the transmission of the oﬃcial nomination to the senate this report focuses on when the senate became aware of the presidents selection eg via public announcement by the

supreme court move through various stages in the nominationandconfirmation process is often of great interest not only to all parties directly involved but as well to the nation as whole shortly after his october 31 2005 nomination of samuel alito jr to fill the associate ju stice seat being vacated by sandra day oconnor president bush called on the senate to act promptly on this important nomination so that an up or down vote is held before the end of this year on november 3 2005 judiciary committee chairman arlen specter and ranking member patrick leahy announced that hearings on the alito nomination would begin on january 9 2006 with final senate action scheduled for january 20 2006 judiciary committee hearings on the alito nomination began and concluded as scheduled although the schedule announced in november 2005 called for committee vote on the nomination on january 17 the committee vote was postponed until january 24 2006 the full senate confirmed judge alito by vote of 5842 on january 31 2006 making him the nations 110 th supreme court justice this report provides information on the amount of time taken to act on all supreme court nominations occurring between 1900 and the present it focuses on the actual amounts of time that presidents and the senate have taken to act as opposed to the elapsed time between official points in the process for example rather than starting the nomination clock with the official notification of the president of forthcoming vacancy eg via receipt of formal retirement letter this report focuses on when the president first learned of justices intention to leave the court eg via private conversation with the outgoing justice or received word that sitting justice had died likewise rather than starting the confirmation clock with the transmission of the official nomination to the senate this report focuses on when the senate became aware of the presidents selection eg via public announcement by the president the data indicate that the entire nominationandconfirmation process from when the president first learned of vacancy to final senate action has generally taken almost twice as long for nominees after 1980 than for nominees in the previous 80 years from 1900 to 1980 the entire process took median of 59 days from 1981 through 2006 the process took median of 113 days although presidents after 1980 have moved more quickly than their predecessors in announcing nominees after learning of vacancies median of 12 days compared with 34 days before 1980 the senate portion of the process ie from the nomination announcement to final senate action now appears to take much longer than before median of 84 days from 1981 through 2006 compared with 17 days from 1900 through 1980 most notably the amount of time between the nomination announcement and first judiciary committee hearing has more than tripledfrom median of 125 days 19001980 to 52 days this report will be updated as additional historical information becomes available or another supreme court vacancy is announced

and confirmation of chief justice or an associate justice to the us supreme court is an infrequent event of major significance in american public life to receive what may be lifetime appointment to the court candidate must first be nominated by the president and then confirmed by the senate midway in the appointment process intensive hearings on supreme court nomination often taking at least three or four days are routinely held by the senate judiciary committee which then can vote on whether to report the nomination to the senate with favorable recommendation nominating and confirming supreme court justices is an interdependent process neither the president nor the senate acts alone the decisions that each branch makes determine how quickly nominations are made and considered and whether the nomination is successful this report provides information on the pace of all supreme court nominations and confirmations since 1900 focusing on the actual amounts of time that presidents and the senate have taken to act as opposed to the elapsed time between official points in the process events during 2005 and early 2006 underscored concerns about the speed with which the president makes supreme court nominations and the senate acts on those nominations 1 g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g16g152g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 late 2005 and early 2006 marked period of transi tion among supreme court justices associate justice sandra day oconnors july 2005 retirement announcement marked the first pending court vacancy since 1994 within few months however the senate considered three nominations as is discussed below judge john g roberts was initially nominated to replace oconnor but that nomination was withdrawn when chief justice william h rehnquist died in early september the roberts nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for the chief justice vacancy the senate confirmed roberts in september 2005 thenwhite house counsel harriet miers was initially nominated to fill the againpending oconnor vacancy but the miers nomination was eventually withdrawn judge samu alito was confirmed to the oconnor seat in january 2006 as is noted throughout this report media accounts and other research suggest that when these and other court vacancies arise the president members of the senate and their staffs can begin work on nominations immediately even if official nominations are days or weeks away particularly when multiple vacancies occur in close succession or simultaneously as they did in 2005 the president and the senate might have different preferences about how quickly new nominees should be considered until 1980 the president often took longer to announce nominee than the senate did to take final action on nominees by contrast since 1981 presidents have been quicker to announce nominations than the senate has been to confirm or reject those nominations the president and members of the senate especially the judiciary committee each proposed their own timetables regarding the roberts miers and alito nominations the following discussion provides additional details 1 for discussion of official actions for all supreme court nominations since 1789 see crs report rl33225 supreme court nominations 1789 2006 actions by the senate the judiciary committee and the president by denis steven rutkus and maureen bearden

president george w bush with oneparagraph letter announcing her retirement from the supreme court effective upon the confirmation of her successor2 her announcement created the first vacancy on the court in 11 years the court had just concluded its 20042005 term and the opening session of the courts next term on october 3 2005 was three months away finding new associate justice took on adde d urgency given the failing health of then chief justice william h rehnquist departure of the chief justice as well as justice oconnor could result in the need for two court appointments and create the possibility of at least one vacancy on the court when it reconvened in octoberunless the new appointments were made expeditiously hours after justice oconnor announced her retirement senior aide to senate majority leader bill frist told reporters that our goal is to have the court back at full strength by the first monday in october senate judiciary committee staff were reportedly poised to begin reviewing background materials on potential nominees 3 nevertheless appointment of new justice in time for the courts opening session seemed like challenging goal in recent years the senate judiciary committee and the full senate as well had been embroiled in controversies over some of the presidents nominations to the lower federal courts continued controversy seemed likely surrounding any future nominations to the supreme court on july 19 2005 18 days after receiving justice oconnors retirement letter president bush announced his selection of john g roberts jr federal appellate judge to be the next associate justice ten days later on july 29 the presiden t formally nominated judge roberts to the court with the nomination document immediately transmitte d to the senate where it was referred to the senate judiciary committee hearings on this nomination were scheduled to begin september 6 but those hearings would never take place when chief justice william h rehnquist died on september 3 judge roberts became the first supreme court nominee to be withdrawn by the president for one seat on the court and re nominated for another the senate judiciary committee quickly cancelled its associate justice hearings and began robertss chief justice hearings on september 12 2005 after receiving favorable 135 vote by the judiciary committee on september 22 the nomination of judge roberts to be chief justice was confirmed by the senate on the morning of september 29 2005 by 7822 vote later that day the confirmed nominee took both his constitutional and judicial oaths of office at the white house 4 due to the speed with which judge roberts was nominated to be chief justice and considered by the senate judiciary committee and the full senate his appointment was completed in time for the court to be at full strength at the start of its 20052006 term with the start of that term 2 justice oconnors retirement letter is availabl at

president bush announced his nomination of white house counsel harriet miers to succeed sandra day oconnor as associate justice on the supreme court the president said that the senate had shown during the confirmation of chief justice roberts that it could act promptly and called upon the senate to review mierss qualifications thoroughly and fairly and to vote on her nomination promptly 5 at press conference the next day the president said that he expected the senate to hold an upordown vote on harriets nomination by thanksgiving ie by november 24 2005 6 similarly senate majority leader bill frist called on his colleagues to move expeditiously but carefully and encouraged floor vote by thanksgiving7 several news reports suggested that confirmation hearings could begin as early as november 7 2005 senator arlen specter chairman of the senate judiciary committee reportedly told reporters that he hoped the committee would complete hearings by thanksgiving8 but also reportedly emphasized that thoroughness will be the objective as opposed to meeting particular timetable9 he also reportedly said that the timing of hearings on the nomination would in part be up to miers who would have to study so that she would have the grasp of these very complex decisions10 on october 27 2005 miers delivered letter to the president withdrawing her nomination as associate justice and the president reluctantly accepted her withdrawal11 both miers and the president indicated that the action was precipitated by the senates request for documents about her service in the white house however others suggested that other factors may have been involved 12 in his statement accepting the withdrawal the president said that he expected to fill the vacancy in timely manner 5 see

blackmun told president william j clinton of his decision to retire in 1994 more than four months before the decision became public on april 6 of that year19 justice oconnor on the other hand did not appear to have given president george w bush any advance notice when she resigned on july 1 2005 also the mode of presidential notification varies while president clinton learned of justice blackmuns plans to retire through an informal conversation justice oconnor apparently notified president bush of her decision through formal letter once the president chooses nominee he alerts the senateby public announcement as well as by formal transmission of written nomination to the senate frequently the president will announce and formally nominate his supreme court choice on the same day or take both actions within few days of each other less commonly presidents announce their intention to nominate candidate then make the official nomination week or more later the most extreme case of the latter involved president ronald reagan in 1981 on july 7 of that year president reagan announced he would send the nomination of sandra day oconnor then an arizona state appeals court judge to the senate upon completion of all the necessary checks by the federal bureau of investigation 20 however it was not until almost six weeks later on august 19 that judge oconnor was officially nominated21 as noted above after the senate receives supreme court nomination the judiciary committee normally holds hearings followed by final committee action and consideration before the full chamber

to execute their official duties surrounding supreme court nominations necessarily focuses on official dates of action taken the most important of these action dates include those on which 1 an outgoing justice officially informs the president of the intention to step dow n from the court or alternatively the date on which court seat is vacated due to the death of justice 2 president formally nominates someone to the court the senate receives the presidents nomination and the nomination is referred to the senate judiciary committee almost always all on the same date 22 3 the senate judiciary committee holds hearings on the nomination 4 the committee votes on the nomination and 5 the senate votes on whether to confirm or chooses to take action in addition to these dates however the president and the senate usually consider supreme court nominations outside official timetables just as the president can begin considering new nominee as soon as he knows vacancy will arise the senate can begin preparing to consider nominee as soon as the president announces his choice even if the receipt of the formal nomination is still days or weeks away fundamentally nominations and confirmations to the supreme court involve both formal and informal decisions while formal decisions are easily 19 us national archives and records administration office of the federal

to the supreme court from 1900 to the present during this period there were total of 60 vacancies and 66 nominees to the court 23 the analysis concentrates on the period 1900 2006 for two primary reasons 1 relevant historical data for this period are much more readily available and reliable than for earlier court appointments24 and 2 public confirmation hearings for supreme court nominations before the senate judiciary committeean important phase in the supreme court appointment process and one of particular interest to this reportwere unheard of before the 20th century25 although research on supreme court nominations often focuses on either presidential or senate decisionmaking this analysis considers the time both institutions take to make decisions about and act on nominees the report also takes unique approach in discussingas well as can be determinedhow long presidents actually take to decide who their nominees will be and how long the senate actually takes to act on nominations for example rather than starting the nomination clock with the official notification of the president of forthcoming vacancy eg the receipt of formal retirement letter this analysis focuses on when the president first learned of the vacancy eg private conversation with the outgoing justice likewise rather than starting the confirmation clock with the transmission the official nomination to the senate this analysis focuses on when the senate became aware of the presidents selection eg by public announcement by the president in many cases establishing precisely when president knew that he would have the opportunity to make supreme court nomination is impossible such information might never have been recorded or known by anyone except the presid ent and his inner circle however historical research reveals several instances when president had advance knowledge of an impending vacancy well before the public announcement of justices intention to leave the court data sources used to determine when presidents first knew of vacancies included historical newspapers official documents such as public presidential papers which contain justices retirement letters to various presidents and crs consultations with presidential libraries 26 dates 23 for an analysis of all unsuccessful supreme court nominees see crs report rl31171 supreme court nominations not confirmed 1789august 2006 by henry b hogue in addition to the uns uccessful nominations listed in that report for the 19002006 period the present report includes judge douglas h ginsburg as an unsuccessful nominee since one part of the reports focus is on presidential announcements of nominees president reagan announced his intention to nominate judge ginsburg in 1987 but ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration before being officially nominated the ginsburg case is briefly discussed later in this report 24 this particularly is the case for coverage of supreme cour t appointments in online full text historical newspapers where coverage as might be expected typically is found to be less comprehensive regarding the procedures of supreme court appointments farther back into the 19 th century 25 the earliest supreme court confirmation hearings held in open session were those in 1916 for the nomination of louis d brandeis to be an associate justice see crs report rl31989

appointment to the court arises when justice position becomes vacant due to death retirement or resignation or when justice announces his intention to retire or resign if the vacated seat is that of the chief justice the president if he chooses may nominate sitting associate justice to be chief thus setting the stage for the creation of an associate justice vacancy as well vacancies on the court also will occur if justices resign to receive new government appointments or to seek new government positions when nomination fails in the senate the president must select new nominee unless the president chooses to renominate his first choice g6g142g138g157g145g561g152g143g561g138g561g21g146g157g157g146g151g144g561g12g158g156g157g146g140g142g561 supreme court justices receive what may be

goldberg resigned in 1965 to assume the post of us ambassador to the united nations29 justice abe fortas resigned in 1969 after protracted criticism over controversial consulting work while on the bench and failed nomination to be elevated from associate justice to chief justice30 when justices retire or resign the president is usually notified by formal letter as noted previously there is evidence in few cases that president informally learned of forthcoming retirement in advance pursuant to law enacted in 1939 justice or any other federal judge receiving lifetime appointment may also retire if unable because of permanent disability to perform the duties of his office by furnishing the president certificate of disability31 prior to 1939 specific legislation from congress was required to provide retirement benefits to justice departing the court because of disability who otherwise woul d be ineligible for such benefits due to insufficient age and length of service in such circumstances in 1910 for instance congress took legislative action granting pension to justice william h moody as the washington post reported at the time although illness had kept justice moody from the bench for almost year he was not yet eligible for retirement32

when chief justice vacancy arises the president may choose to nominate sitting associate justice for the courts top post if the chief justice nominee is confirmed he or she must to assume the new position resign as associate justice requiring new nominee from the president to fill the newly vacated associate justice seat however this scenario is relatively rare during the 19002006 period presidents attempted to elevate associate justices to chief justice four times with the senate confirming three nominees most recently in 1986 president ronald reagan nominated thenassociate justice william h rehnquist to be chief justice 33 presidents may also nominate sitting justices to other political posts which if accepted require resignation from the court between 1900 and 2006 three

when any court nomination whether for an associ ate or chief justice seat fails in the senate the president may either resubmit the nomination or choose another candidate to fill the bench the entire process thus begins anew withdrawals and rejections can greatly increase the amount of time taken to confirm justices to the court controversial nominees who are eventually confirmed also usually take more time to consider the late 1960s and early 1970s were one of the most tumultuous periods of nominations and rejections in the courts history on may 14 1969 justice abe fortas resigned from the bench fortas had been embroiled in scandal surrounding his consulting income and failed to win confirmation as chief justice when president johnson nominated him to the seat in 1968 36 previously on october 14 1968 president johnson had withdrawn the fortas nomination as well as the nomination of homer thornberry to fill the vacancy that would have been created by fortass elevation the senate

impossible to determine the specific date that president first knew he would have the opportunity to name new justice to the supreme court the president always has the constitutional oblig ation to make nominations to the court when vacancies arise and is certainly aware of the possibility that vacancies could arise at any time however the actual or prospective vacancy became known to president columns in table 1 and table 2 focus on documented specific instances when the president knew he had or soon would have the opportunity to name new justice to the court39 these dates are based on extensive research about when the justices impending departure or death was made public and whether the president had advance knowledge of the vacancy before it became public in cases in which research revealed public evidence that the president had advance notice or in which the data are inconclusive the date of the first public account of the vacancy marks the beginning of the process the when column in table 1 and table 2 40 for example justice sandra day oconnor announced her retirement pending confirmation of successor on july 1 2005 there is evidence that president george w bush definitely knew that oconnor would retire until her announcement therefore july 1 2005 is used as the starting point for what became the john g roberts associate justice nomination 41 on the other hand although chief justice warren burgers retirement letter to ronald reagan was not released until june 17 1986 president reagans public papers reveal that burger informed the president of his decision to retire on may 27 198642 therefore may 27 1986 is used as the starting point continued of observations because each stage of the process can have different number of observations and because the data are also not normal ie bellshaped distribution the sum of the medians for individual stages generally is not equal to the median for the entire period for more information see chapter 4 in yalun chou statistical analysis for business and economics new york elsevier 1989 39 in table 1 and table 2 actual vacancies are those that already have been announced or occurred ie sitting justice announces retirement date or dies prospective vacancies for the purposes of this report are not merely speculative they require firm notice either throu gh notification from sitting justice or major media acc ounts that justice will leave the court imminently even if an exact date is not specified 40 this report it should be reemphasized bases the starting point at when presidents apparently learned of actual or prospective court vacancies these dates are based on published information or information obtained from presidential archives readers should be alerted as caveat that there might well have been instances unreported at the time as well as still unknown to presentday scholars in which vari ous presidents privately were alerted of upcoming court vacancies or had reasons to believe that vacancies were imminent in advance of the starting dates listed in this report to the extent that such instances are unaccounted for the full extent of time during which such presidents were aware of prospective court vacancies and were able to consider future court candidates before publicly nnouncing their choices is undermeasured in this report 41 as noted elsewhere in this report president george w bush withdrew robertss nomination as associate justice on sept 5 2005 42 president reagan had private conversation with chief justice burger on may 27 1986 when burger

unless otherwise noted the presidents announcementofnominee date in table 1 is the day when the president announced his nomination to the public or released the text of his nomination letter whichever came first this date is significant because it marks the senates first opportunity to begin considering the nomination even if informally there are few cases explained by table notes in which presidents announced their decisions less formally but still publicly for example president harry s truman casually told reporters during july 28 1949 press conference that he had offered an associate justice nomination to thenattorney general thomas c clark even though clark had not yet accepted the nomination 43 as discussed previously in some cases the announcement date differs by days or even weeks from the date the nomination was formally submitted to the senate

interval in the process of nominating and considering supreme court justices44 table 3 provides the median number of days for each major interval in the process the median is the middle number in set of observations in this case the number of days involved in each stage of considering supr eme court nominations the median is generally the preferred measure of central tendency in social science research 45 as statistician william h greene notes loosely speaking the median corresponds more closely than the mean to the middle of distribution group of numbers it is unaffected by extreme values46 in other words the median represents the best example of the average case regardless of extremely short or long individual confirmations however in describing the speed of the supreme court nominationandconfirmation process even median values should be considered carefully each nomination is different and political context and historical factors can have major impact on when various events occur several factors affecting individual nominations to the court are discussed later in this report 43 president truman did not announce that clark had accepted the nomination until aug 1 1949 edward t folliard clark accepts high court proffer washington post aug 2 1949 p 1 44 when calculating durations the date on which the final event occurs is not counted as full day for example if committee hearings began on july 12 and the committee took its final action on july 13 the duration is one day not two for cases in which durations are less than one day ie the committee final action and final senate vote took place on the same day the duration is listed as 0 days 45 although the arithmetic mean the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations is the true average number it has the disadvantage of being skewed by extremely high or low values for an introduction to median versus mean and arguments surrounding when each should be used see chapter 3 in alan

during the entire period covered by this report 19002006 the president and the senate have each taken varying amounts of time to act on supreme court nominations and confirmations as table 3 shows from 19002006 presidents took median of 28 days after vacancy occurred to announce their nominees compared with median of 22 days for final senate action once the nomination was announced the entire process from actual or prospective vacancy to final senate action lasted median of 76 days from 19002006 47 however the amount of time involved in each stage of the nominationandconfirmation process varies widely when individual cases are examined some supreme court nominations are unusually fast coming immediately on the heels sitting justices departure from the bench in these cases the president almost certainly knew in advance of the outgoing justices intention to retire yet delayed announcement of the retirement to coincide with announcing new nominee for example on may 27 1986 president reagan simultaneously announced the retirement of chief justice warren burger the elevation of william h rehnquist to chief justice and the nomination of antonin scalia to assume the associate justice seat being vacated by justice rehnquist 48 on the other hand some nomination decisions can take monthsat least to become public for example although justice harold h burton submitted his retirement letter to president dwight d eisenhower on october 6 1958 eisenhower did not publicly announce potter stewarts nomination until january 17 1959103 days after announcing justice burtons retirement the entire interval between burtons announced retirement and stewarts confirmation lasted 211 days the bulk of the interval due to long congressional recess 49

since 198150 when comparing supreme court 47 due to updated data in table 1 and table 2 some of the summary statistics here and in table 3 have changed from previous versions of this report this version of the repor t does not include when calculating the interval for total senate action nomination announcement to final senate actio n cases in which nominations lingered in the senate but for which the senate took final vote eg the nomination was withdrawn recommitted etc if the judiciary committee held hearings or held final vote those dates are included in median calculations 48 as previously noted although chief justice burger by letter on june 17 1986 officially notified president reagan of his desire to retire burger privately informed reagan of his plans on may 27 1986 remarks on the resignation of supreme court chief justice warren burger and the nominations of william h rehnquist to be chief justice and antonin scalia to be an associate justice us national archives and records administration office of the federal register public papers of the presidents of the united states ronald reagan 1986 vol 2 p 781 49 context provides important caveats as is always the case when exploring median decisionmaking surrounding supreme court nominations president eisenhower recessappointed justice stewart b ecause congress was not in session on oct 6 1958 when justice burton announced his retirement the 85th congress had adjourned sine die on aug 24 1958 the president nominated potter stewart to the court on jan 17 1959 after congress had reconvened for the first session of the 86th congress therefore although the interval between the starting date oct 6 1958 as shown in table 1 and nomination date jan 17 1959 is 103 days and the entire interval from the starting date until final senate action may 5 1959 is 211 days the presidents actual decisionmaking timetable could also be classified as eight days or the interval between burtons retirement announcement oct 6 1958 and eisenhowers recess appointment of justice stewart oct 14 1958 both intervals are used to calculate the median elapsed time from vacancy to nomination announcement nonetheless the long intervals have minimal impact on computing the median durations between stages in the process because the median is less sensitive than the mean to extremely high or low values 50

patterns stand out first after apparently learning of vacancies presidents have typically been quicker to announce nominees since 1981 than in the previous 80 years as shown in figure 1 and table 3 from 19001980 presidents took median of 34 days to announce their nominees after apparently learning of vacancies compared with only 12 days from 19812006 second and perhaps most notably the median interval between the presidents announcement of his nominee and the first judiciary committee hearing was substantially longer from 19812006 than from 19001980 as shown in figure 1 and table 3 this period more than tripledfrom 125 days during the 19001980 period to 52 days from 19812006 again however context is important even before hearings begin the senate can be actively working on the nomination for example prior to the start of john g robertss hearings and even before his nomination was submitted to the senate senators met privately with judge roberts and some pressed the white house to release records from robertss department of justice service 51 the harriet miers and samuel alito nominations followed similar patterns figur 1 speed in da ys of inter vals surr ounding supr

decisionmaking process surrounding the naming and the confirmation or rejection of supreme court nominees are known only to presidents nominees and few select advisors other elements are more obvious each nomination has its own political context making each nomination somewhat different however several factors appear to be relatively constant in affecting the speed of supreme court nominations and

nomination can depend on how the vacancy occurred when justices die unexpectedly presidents can be eager to bring the court back to full strength as soon as possible on july 19 1949 for example justice frank murphy unexpectedly died of heart attack after brief illness52 president harry s truman announced his nomination of thomas c clark at press conference nine days later on july 28 53 the senate also considered the nomination quickly beginning hearings on august 9 clarks entire nomination andconfirmation process lasted just 30 days few months later sherman minton was confirmed even fasterin 24 daysafter the death of justice wiley b rutledge nonetheless sudden death does not guarantee that either the president or the senate will make nominationandconfir mation decisions quickly for example when justice rufus w peckham died unexpectedly on october 24 1909 president william howard taft waited 50 days to announce nominee once taft announced his choice the senate confirmed horace h lurton seven days later retirements and resignations are often expected allowing the president time to prepare for his choice even before an official announcement that sitting justice will step down for example at the time of his retirement justice william douglass health had been so poor and abilities allegedly in such decline that seven of his fellow justices voted on october 17 1975 to effectively strip douglas of his power and excluded the aging justice from deliberations 54 by the time justice douglas officially wrote to president gerald r ford on november 12 1975 announcing

court nominations take to reach conclusion in the early 1900s several vacancies arose during summer recess or election years when congress was away from the capitol in 1910 for example congress adjourned on june 25 and did not return until december 5a break of more than five months 57 in the interim chief justice melville w fuller died of heart attack on july 458 as press coverage noted at the time although potential nominees were immediately considered president william howard taft waited to formally submit nomination to the senate until congress reconvened59 on december 12 five days after the senate reconvened president taft announced and formally submitted to the senate his nomination of former senator edward d white of louisiana to be chief justice that same day without referring the nomination to the judiciary committee the senate quickly confirmed senator white three times during the 1950s president eisenhower resorted to recess appointments when justices died or announced their retirement after congress had already adjourned for the year60 in each case president eisenhower formally submitted the nomination after the senate convened the following january of the five persons whom he nominated to the court three first received recess appointments and served as justices before being confirmedearl warren as chief justice in 1953 william brennan in 1956 and potter stewart in 1958 president eisenhowers recess appointments however generated controversy prompting the senate in 1960 voting closely along party lines to pass resolution expressing opposition to

appointments to the supreme court and recess appointments to the lower federal courts also have become relatively rare since the late 1960s while presidents constitutional power to make judicial recess appointments was upheld by federal court in 198562 such appointments when they do occur may cause controversy in large part because they bypass the senate and its advice and consent role because of the criticisms of judicial recess appointments in recent decades the long passage of time since the last supreme court recess appointment and the relatively short duration of contemporary senate recesses which arguably undercuts the need for re cess appointments to the court president in the 21 st century might be expected to make recess appointment to the supreme court only under the most unusual of circumstances63 today congresss availability is less of an obstacle to speedy consideration of nominations than in the past given congresss increasingly yearround schedule extended decisionmaking is more often the result of waiting for presidential decisions background investigations of nominees or preparations for judiciary committee hearings

would be highly unusual for the judiciary committee not to hold supreme court confirmation hearings lasting at least few days in the past however the judiciary committee often handled supreme court nominations without holding hearings at all as table 1 shows of the 22 nominees to the court from 1900 to 1937 only three had judiciary committee hearings louis d brandeis in 1916 harlan f stone in 1925 and john j parker in 1930 whose nomination was eventually rejected in contrast of the 41 nominees after 1937 only three did continued appointees during the probationary period of their appointment took positions to please the president in order not to have the president withdraw their nominations or to pl ease the senate in order to gain confirmation of their nominations it also was argued that senate investigation of nominations of these recess appointees was made difficult by the oath preventing sitting justices from testifying about matters pending before the court opponents however said among other things that the resolution was an attempt to restrict the presidents constitutional recess appointment powers and that recess appointments were sometimes called for in order

testifying at their own hearings until john m harlan did so in 195565 when the judiciary committee holds hearings senate floor consideration can be pushed back sometimes by weeks or even months controversial nominees often spur protracted hearings for example the judiciary committee spent 19 days considering justice louis d brandeiss nomination in 1916 and the interval between the start of hearings and final committee action lasted 105 days the final senate vote came eight days later more recently the judiciary committee after learning of president ronald reagans selection of robert h bork took 76 days to hold its first day of hearings on the nomination and then 21 more days to conclude action on the nomination senate custom plays an especially large role when sitting or former senators are nominated to the court the senate has almost always considered their colleaguess nominations to the court within days of receiving the nomination often without committee hearings or floor debate 66 for example although president taft waited five months to nominate edward d white former senator from louisiana for chief justice the sena confirmed the nomination with debate in less than one hour67 since 1900 three sitting senatorshugo l black of alabama 1937 james f byrnes of south carolina 1941 and harold h burton of ohio 1945have been nominated to the court and all were quickly confirmed68 senators george sutherland of utah 1922 and sherman minton of indiana 1949 were nominated to the court after having concluded their senate service sutherland was confirmed on the same day on which president warren harding announced the nomination and minton was confirmed in 19 days the decades since 1945 have yet to test again the senate tradition of bypassing the judiciary committee when the supreme court nominee is sitting us senator president since then has nominated sitting senator the last former senator to be nominated to the court in 1949 was judge sherman minton of indiana after defeat for reelection to the senate in 1940 he had been appointed by president franklin d roosevelt to federal appellate court j udgeship in break with tradition the supreme court nomination of former senator minton was referred to the judiciary committee and senate confirmation followed the day after the committee approved the nomination 64 this number does not include instances such as the john g roberts associate justice nomination in which the judiciary committee did not have the opportunity to hold hearings hearings before the judiciary committee were dispensed with for three nominees frank murphy in 1939 james f byrnes in 1941 and harold h burton in 1945 all of whom had prior service in high public office murphy had previously served as governor of michigan and us

lengthen the process in these cases although presidents often name nominees fairly quickly consideration of the nominations can be drawn out in the senate during judge robert h borks controversial nomination for example senate consideration of bork lasted more than month from the first judiciary committee hearing on september 15 1987 until the senates floor vote to reject the nomination on october 23 1987 the entire processfrom president reagans announcement of his intention to nominate bork to senate rejectiontook 119 days controversy can also delay confirmation of nominees who are ultimately successful despite relatively quick nominationandconfirmation process of 42 days in late 1924 and early 1925 for thenattorney general harlan f stone his nomination was temporarily set back when it was recommitted to the senate judiciary committee apparently because of stones investigation as attorney general of senator burton k wheeler 69 more recently although judge clarence thomas

nominationandconfirmation process has taken and what factors affected that schedule can provide useful perspective on presidential decisionmaking and the senates preparations for future nominations while presidents and supporters of nominees want justices confirmed quickly some senators will continue to emphasize their right to consider nominees carefully and their responsibility to hold sufficient hearings against that political backdrop this report demonstrates that the length of time required to nominate and confirm or reject nominee varies widely even median durations must be interpreted cautiously the context surrounding each nomination is particularly important in understanding how long the process takes given the advanced ages of some members of the current court more vacancies in the near future are widely anticipated should those vacanc ies occur unexpectedly such as with sudden retirement or death the court could well be operating without full benchmaking the timing of nominations and confirmations even more pressing in such scenario the senate would likely be under intense pressure to confirm successor quickly this report indicates that from 19001980 the presidents portion of the process took longer than the senates since 1981 though there has been substantial increase in the median duration between the presidents announcement of nominee and the start of judiciary committee hearings as result the senates portion of the process has taken longer than the presidents prior to 1981 lengthy nominationandconfirmation processes usually occurred because either the senate was out of session when vacancy on the court arose or the nomination was controversial in recent decades by contrast slower decisionmaking has taken place during an era when congress is in session longer than during the early 20 th century 69 on stones testimony before the judiciary committee regard ing the investigation see albert w fox stone tells senate committee he assumes

median of 113 daysalmost twice as long as the 59day median from 19001980 although the data in table 1 table 2 and table 3 provide median measure of the process political context is an essential backdrop for understanding the numbers the president and the senate share decisionmaking responsibilities for placing new justices on the court ultimately the choices each institution makes determine how long nominations and confirmations take one possible explanation for the paradox of slower decisions despite more time in session is that as some critics on both sides of the aisle contend supreme court nominations have become battlegrounds for larger political debates70 another possibility is that the senate is considering nominations more carefully than in the past and therefore taking more time to make decisions about nominees similarly the senate might be using longer decisionmaking and scrutiny of nominees as method of counterbalancing presidential power especially when senators believe that the president has chosen an unqualified nominee some early 20 th century appointments to the supreme court were confirmed within days of vacancy occurring more recent nominations and confirmations by contrast typically have taken several weeks or months how and when vacancy occurs the senates schedule judiciary committee involvement institutional customs and whether or not the nomination is controversial all affect the speed with which the president nominates and the senate passes judgment on prospective justices 70 on increasingly controversial judicial nominations see
