complimented us french ct cooperation calling it exceptional and recognizing that both countries were fighting common enemy and both had experienced losses frances ct fight was led by intelligence

services needed to cooperate closely in order to attack terrorist networks before they struck 3 sbu in response to questions from the attorney general concerning the dsts view of the evolving nature of the terrorist threat bousquet expressed concern that democracies not compromise their essential values in combating terrorism as this could weaken the foundation of their societies most important said bousquet was to win the battle of communication videos of usg actions were continuing source of motivation and repulsion for extremists although usg communication regarding terrorism was focused on convincing its citizens images of abuses in iraq and the messages of the usg as received overseas both rebounded negatively overseas and encouraged muslim youth to join extremist movements said bousquet 4 sbu bousquet said france was most concerned about the worldwide upsurge of radical islam for this reason the gof was building french islam moderate islam that worked within the french culture all those who refuse to participate in this system would have place in french society said bousquet he believed that the next generation of terrorists would be born and wellintegrated into french society since welleducated and integrated french muslims were already beginning to be seen in jihadist circles he called for continued close coordination between intelligence and police

counterterrorism officials counterterrorism investigative judge jeanlouis bruguiere prosecutor general of paris yves bot prosecutor of paris jeanclaude marin and director of the criminal division of the justice ministry jeanmarie huet the attorney general started the discussion by thanking the officials for their assistance and asked them for their assessment of the current counter terrorism situation led by the commentaries of judge bruguiere the officials noted the advantages they operated under including their ability to protect the sources of intelligence information that they use in their investigations the fact that they do not need to detail facts to the same extent as in the us to arrest persons or undertake searches and seizures or wiretaps and the fact that there was jury system formal rules on admissibility of evidence and hearsay rule there followed general legal discussion on these aspects of the french system 9 sbu judge bruguiere also outlined the two general threat trends france was experiencing first that french youth were being drawn into terrorist activities to greater extent reflecting that the threat was moving from east to west second that the new terrorists were on an increasing level of sophistication and education recent arrests had demonstrated that highly educated electronics experts had been recruited by jihadist networks for purposes of executing attacks in europe and that they had developed highly sophisticated methods for detonating explosive charges at long distance 10 sbu the attorney general next met with ron noble secretary general of interpol on march 3 the discussion sipdis commenced with the attorney general inquiring about the recent request for interpol red notices made by italy concerning the alleged abduction of an individual from italy by usg officials noble advised that the procedure at this stage is for interpol to review the requests to determine whether issuance of the red notices would be consistent with the interpol constitution which prohibits interpol from participating in political matters or pursuing politically motivated requests 11 sbu noble also briefed the ag on number of current issues including push to list with interpol those qaida and taliban members on the sanctions list so that interpol could generate new kind of notice providing details on these persons to police in member states and to facilitate wider contribution to and use of the interpol database on lost or stolen passports regarding loststolen passports pilot project conducted between interpol and the swiss government demonstrated that the interpol database could be used in realtime leading to marked increase in the seizures and prosecutions for those using false travel documents he cited the example of one seized passport that had been in use since april 2003 had passed through 19 countries and had successfully gone through border controls 46 times without being caught 12 sbu noble requested that the attorney general consider detailing legal attachprosecutor to interpol headquarters given the rise in legal issues in recent years the attorney general expressed concern that doj prosecutor might
