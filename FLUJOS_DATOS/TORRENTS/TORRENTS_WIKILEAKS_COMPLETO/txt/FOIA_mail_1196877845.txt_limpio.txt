klein21mailllnlgov xflowed dear folks thank you very much for all of your emails and my apologies for the delay in replying ive been on travel for much of the past week peter i think youve done nice job in capturing some of my concerns about the douglass et paper our ccsp report helped to illustrate that there were large structural uncertainties in both the radiosonde and msubased estimates of tropospheric temperature change the scientific evidence available at the time we were finalizing the ccsp report from sherwood et 2005 and the thenunpublished randel and wu paper strongly suggested that residual cooling bias existed in the sondebased estimates of tropospheric temperature change as you may recall we showed results from both the ratpac and hadat2 radiosonde datasets in the ccsp report and the santer et 2005 science paper from the latter see eg our figure 3b and figures 4cd it was clear that there were physicallysignificant differences between the simulated temperature trends in the tropical lower troposphere over 1979 to 1999 and the trends estimated from ratpac hadat2 and uah data in both the science paper and the ccsp report we judged that residual biases in the observations provided the most likely explanation for these modelversusdata trend discrepancies douglass et come to fundamentally different conclusion and ascribe modelversusdata differences to model error they are not really basing this conclusion on new model data or on new observational data the only new observational dataset that they use is an early version of leo haimbergers radiosonde dataset raobcore v12 leos dataset was under development at the time all of us were working on the ccsp report and the santer et science paper it was not available for our assessment in 2005 as leo has already shared with you newer versions of raobcore v13 and v14 show amplification of surface warming in the tropical troposphere in reasonable agreement with the model results that we presented in fig 3b of our science paper douglass et did not use these newer versions of raobcore v12 nor did douglass et use any inconvenient observational datasets such as the nesdisbased msu t2 dataset of zou et or the msu t2 product of vinnikov and grody showing pronounced tropospheric warming over the satellite era nor did douglass et discuss the two timescale issue that formed an important part of our science paper ie how could models and multiple observational datasets show amplification behavior that was consistent in terms of monthly variability but inconsistent in terms of decadal trends nor did douglass et fairly portray results from peters 2007 grl paper in my personal opinion douglass et have ignored all scientific evidence that is in disagreement with their view of how the real world should be behaving i dont think its good strategy to submit response to the douglass et paper to the international journal of climatology ijc as phil pointed out ijc has large backlog so it might take some time to get response published furthermore douglass et probably would be given the final word my suggestion is to submit to science short update of our 2005 paper this update would only be submitted after publication of the four new radiosondebased temperature datasets mentioned by peter the update would involve 1 use of all four new radiosonde datasets 2 use of the latest versions of the uah and rss tlt data and the latest versions of the t2 data from uah rss umd vinnikov and grody and nesdis zou et 3 use of the t2 data in 2 above and the uah and rss t4 data to calculate tropical tfu temperatures with all possible combinations of t4 and t2 datasets eg rss t4 and umd t2 uah t4 and umd t2 etc 4 calculating synthetic msu temperatures from all model 20c3m runs currently available in the ipcc ar4 database calculation of synthetic msu temperatures would rely on method suggested by carl using weighting functions that depend on both the surface type land ocean and the surface pressure at each gridpoint rather than on the static globalmean weighting function that we used previously this is probably several months of work but at least it will keep off the streets and out of trouble 5 formal determination of statistical significance of modelversusobserved trend differences 6 brief examination of timescaledependence of amplification factors 7 as and both peter and melissa suggested brief examination of sensitivity of estimated trends to the selected analysis period eg use of 1979 to 1999 use of 1979 to 2001 or 2003 for the small number of model 20c3m runs ending after 1999 use of data for the postnoaa9 period this will be fair bit of effort but i think its worth it douglass et will try to make maximum political out of their ijc paper which has already been sent to andy revkin at the new york times you can bet theyve sent it elsewhere too im pretty sure that our colleague jc will portray douglass et as definitive proof that all climate models are fundamentally flawed uah data are in amazing agreement with sondebased estimates of tropospheric temperature change global warming is not serious problem etc one of the most disturbing aspects of douglass et is its abrupt dismissal of the finding by sherwood et and randel and wu of residual tropospheric cooling bias in the sonde data douglass et base this dismissal on the christy et 2007 jgr paper and on christys finding of biases in the nighttime sonde data that magically offset the biases in the daytime data does that sound familiar when did we last hear about new biases magically offsetting the effect of recentlydiscovered biases as yogi berra would say this is deja vu all over again i hope that one of the papers on the new sondebased datasets directly addresses the subject of error compensation in the daytime and nighttime sonde data this would be important to do its unfortunate that douglass et will probably be published well before the appearance of the papers on the new radiosonde datasets and before an updated comparison of modeledand observed tropospheric temperature trends id be grateful if you could let know whether you are in agreement with the response strategy ive outlined above and would like to be involved with an update of our 2005 science paper with best regards ben peter thorne wrote all there are several additional reasons why we may not expect perfect agreement between models and obs that are outlined in the attached paper it speaks in part to the trend uncertainty that carl alluded to taking differences between linear trend estimates is hard when the underlying series is noisy and perhaps nonlinear work that john and dian have done also shows this taking the ratio between two such estimates is always going to produce noisy results over relatively short trend periods when the signal is small relative to the natural variability also 1979 as start date may bias those estimates towards bias i believe this is unproven because of endpoint effects due to natural variability that tend to damp the ratio of tropsurf trends enso phasing and chichon for any trend period with this start date given the n9 uncertainty reasonable case could be made for an evaluation of the obs that started only after n9 and this may yield very different picture it also shows that the model result really is constrained to perturbed physics at least for hadcm3 unsurprising as convective adjustment is at the heart of most models certainly ours anyway this result was cherrypicked and the rest of the paper discarded by douglass et in addition to this the state of play on the radiosondes has moved on substantially with raobcore 14 accepted i believe leo haimberger should be in this im adding him which shows warming intermediate between uah and rss and i know of three additional efforts on radiosondes all of which strongly imply that the raobs datasets used in this paper are substantially underestimating the warming rate steve sherwood x2 and our automated system so theres going to be whole suite of papers hopefully coming out within the next year or so that imply we at least cannot rule out from the radiosonde data warming consistent even with the absurd mean of the model runs criteria that is used in this paper for info our latest results imply true raobs trend for 2lt in the tropics somewhere 008kdecade we cannot place defensible upper limit ruling out most of the datasets used in the douglass paper and ruling in possibility of consistency with models douglass et also omit the newer msu studies from the nesdis group which in the absence of reasonable criteria criteria i think we are some way away from still to weed out bad obs datasets should be considered placing all obs datasets and the likely new raobs datasets would pretty much destroy this papers main point theres been fair bit of cherry picking on the obs side which needs correcting here peter on tue 20071204 at 1540 0800 carl mears wrote karl thanks for clarifying what i was trying to say some further comments at 0253 pm 1242007 karl taylor wrote dear all 2 unforced variability hasnt dominated the observations but on this short time scale we strongly suspect that it has dominated for example the 2 sigma error bars from table 34 ccsp for satellite tlt are 018 uah or 019 rss larger than either groups trends 005 015 for 19792004 these were calculated using goodness of linear fit criterion corrected for autocorrelation this is probably reasonable estimate of the contribution of unforced variability to trend uncertainty douglass et have not shown that every individual model is in fact inconsistent with the observations if the spread of individual model results is large enough and at least 1 model overlaps the observations then one cannot claim that all models are wrong just that the mean is biased given the magnitude of the unforced variability i would say the mean may be biased you cant prove this with only one universe as tom alluded all we can say is that the observed trend cannot be proven to be inconsistent with the model results since it is inside their range it we interesting to see if we can say anything more
