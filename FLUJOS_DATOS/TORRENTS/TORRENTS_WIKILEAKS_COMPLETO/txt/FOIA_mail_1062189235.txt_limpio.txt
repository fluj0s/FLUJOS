from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to michael mann mannvirginiaedu subject reconstruction uncertainties date fri aug 29 163355 2003 cc kbriffaueaacuk attachments mann uncertaintydoc hi mike after few bits of holiday here and there ive now had time to complete my initial approach to estimating reconstruction errors on your nh temperature reconstruction this is all based on the calibration residuals that you kindly sent few weeks ago my rationale for doing this was that i wanted uncertaintyerror estimates that were dependent on the time scale being considered eg decadal mean an annual mean 30year mean etc i didnt think you had published timescaledependent errors hence my attempt second reason is that i wanted to be able to model ie stochastically generate time series of the errors with appropriate timescale characteristics again i didnt think that i could get this from your published results the attached document summarises the progress ive made there are few questions i have and im concerned that the reduction in uncertainty with increasing time scale is too great perhaps one should be ultra conservative and have reduction with time scale yet surely there ought to be some cancelling of partly uncorrelated errors the document is not meant to form part of any paper on this i hope to use the errors in paper but the point of the paper is on trend detection not estimating errors it just seemed appropriate to write it up like this to inform you of what ive done so far any comments or criticisms will be very useful cheers tim
