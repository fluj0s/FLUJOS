handling arc breaks lecture given on 28 may 1963 thank you thank you well its good thing you put into good mood with all that applause reports ive been getting on the zed unit for the last twentyfour hourspractically unprintable well take that up in moment i know youd better look sad because its pretty sad news all right this is what audience 28th twentyeighth 28th of may ad 13 all right now this lecture is not for people with weak hearts if you cant take it why i advise you to go over into the other building there where they have speaker and turn it off this auditing dissertation here actually is possibly passed by by the student who is doing other types of auditing but it applies to him very much ive discovered the common denominator to arc breaks and that common denominator of all arc breaksall arc breaksis bypassed charge thats the common denominator to all arc breaks and that includes therefore all misemotion exhibited by the pc at the auditor now we should define an arc break as the pcs transfer of attention from the bank to the auditor and dramatization of the bank directed at the auditor and that is an arc break now you can get the mechanics of an arc break just by dropping your meter or something of the sort and just calling the pcs attention off of his bank onto the auditor the arc break might not take place but you have approximated the mechanic of what happens and the probability is that it will take place see what i mean so we get down to this fundamental which is not terribly important at first glimpse but dragging the pcs attention onto the auditor you see and onto the session is precipitating factor even though the pc doesnt dramatize you see thats beside the point youve dragged his attention onto the session well thats an arc break in sort of reverse lets show you something you go like this clickclick clickclick clickclick youve not laid fundamental for the arc break but youve approximated one of its mechanics dont you see youve dragged the pcs attention onto the auditor well very often when you do that you leave the charge of the session not held back see the charge of the session now is not being asised and therefore provides background booster and the pc rowrows at the auditor see or becomes annoyed or something of the sort dont you see well so not even that one falls outside this definition its bypassed charge see pcs attention is on his bank the auditor does something weird attracts the pcs attention off the bank then you see youve bypassed some charge youve left some charge there the pcs attention is not on the charge but the charge is restimulated do you get that as simple mechanic so that in normal course of human events youre talking to this same pc out of session you know and you drop an anvil on his toe or something of this sort and hell argue with you about it but he wont arc break you see it is not then that social faux pas has taken place that causes the pc to arc break so an auditor very often feels terribly reserved and preservative of the social amenities and all of this sort of thing and walks around on tiptoe in session being terribly polite and so forth well you see that isnt necessary to prevent an arc break you see but this mystery is presented in common course of human events you make some crack at this person and they make crack at you and you yapyap and thats all there is to it you see and in session you make the tiniest inference about this person and all of sudden hes splattering all over the walls with an arc break well now if you understand what you have done you understand this matter of bypassed charge and so forth this most flagrant examplethe easiest to observe dont you see the easiest to observe and actually not of any really very vast importance but ive just given as an example to show you what this is in the session hes got his attention on charged areas and then you take his attention off the charged area and put it on the auditor you bypass charge and thats what causes the arc break see hes about to tell you and then they drowned in well hes saying and iiim standing here and im looking down into the thing and theres somebody grabs by the arm i can feel his arm and hes about to throw over and you say clickclick justjust minute let see if i can get some charge on this lets see click ii beg your pardon my meteri dont know i guess i forgot to charge the thing or something like that and the pc goes splatter oh thats very obvious you see whats happened there see hes got all this charge hes sitting down on and all of sudden his attention comes off of it and you in effect have bypassed the charge right there well now the other part of it is he is being cause over the charge right as long as hes running it hes being cause over it see all right now the moment that his attention is flicked off of it he is now the effect of that charge and any tone level or know to mystery scale level higher than the chronic tone of the pc now get this you know what chronic tone is the old know to mystery scale boy were back amongst the familiar tools here these days you know the know to mystery scale the expanded tone scale you seeall of those thingsquite valid see and lets say the pc is at apathy as chronic tonethats pretty high by the way very few pcs are there theyre more or less kind of wood you know theyre way down below that the other day i suddenly realized that i was feeling continuously apathetic and i thought something is happening my auditing is doing in or something of the sort i went around like that for about twentyfour hours and then suddenly realized it was i free thetan who was feeling apathetic all of sudden you know any consequences of it blew you see and i realized suddenly i was feeling much better than i had for long time see i hadnt felt like myself free thetan for some time you know you get the idea i mean gradually the tone scale had come up you see not as ron or human being you see but had gradually come up up up see id feel pretty good as ron you see fine feel very hightoned but id come up up up and i didnt get the sneaker of it and the first emotional response you get to it is feeling apathetic you know well guess im not worth much look what theyre doing over in the states these days you know people talking about rerunning kennedy you know i was kind of thinking about things that way you know and all of sudden hey thats you know thats im feeling about and it felt wonderful was great feeling after that i went around and enjoyed it you know well actually pc will come up through degradation as chronic tone and actually will come up from unconsciousness as chronic tone we had pc over in the states i mean it isnt anything esoteric you know he just lies there conked out all the time you try to audit him and heconkyou know and audit him andconk and talk to himconkyou know and hes actually existing above his chronic tone his chronic tone is unconsciousness and so this boy of course processyou process him now to get rid of his unconsciousnesswell cut your throat youll never get anyplace you see you just have to generally process his case with processes which are real to him and bring up general case advance and the unconsciousness will disappear you see that as different look that doesnt mean that there are chronic tone levels of maladies you know you dont have maladies as chronic tone levels but anything aboveanything abovethe pcs chronic tone you see being higher than the pc can be cause over the pc and therefore become dramatization there is nobody more amazed than the pc to find himself in raging anger in session hes absolutely flabbergasted well some charge gets bypassed and he doesnt know where to look he doesnt know what charge is bypassed he doesnt know where he lookshe doesnt know where to look he looks at the auditorthe auditor doesnt even have to fiddle with the meter see he looks at the auditor and there is something you see and anger or something like that being higher on the tone scale and contained in the incident which has been missed causes the pc to dramatize and the pc is actually as helpless as dish towel in hurricane hes totally helpless he says ohhaww whats going on and hes shouting and screaming at the auditor you know well you can get somebody who is dramatizing effort you know hes got to pick up the chair and break it in half you know something like that well thats pretty lowlevel dramatization that particular one anger is more common bored is something you very often dont recognize as dramatization pc is getting along fine and all of sudden arc breaks and feels very bored now similarly you could go further and find pc arc break into total manic i have never seen this but by extrapolation you could say he would become very manic you seeterribly wildly enthusiastic with glaring eyeballs you see be an arc break so an arc break then comes about whenever charge is bypassed which then puts the pc at its effectpoint and the pc then dramatizes the charge that has been bypassed this is actually far simpler than it sounds im just giving you all of the ramifications of itgiving you all of the ramifications of it these are the mechanics involved in the thing now the remedy for an arc break is to locate and indicate the bypassed charge at which moment the arc break ceases now that could be interpreted by qanda artist as meaning you have to go and run the bypassed charge right now you see he goes into do that gets into impossibility you find yourself fifth on the chain you are running the fifth engram and the pc is arc breaking on the chainwell then you would interpret it and say well you cant possibly run the fifth engram because the pc will arc break you see some qanda artist would interpret it at once you see in that category and you will find them doing so matter if ive said so and if youll just remember ive told you this and remember this particular mechanic you can prevent this other consequence from taking place and the consequence is this well the pc is arc breaking running this engram so therefore you have to at once go run the earlier engram and that is not what i have told you if that were the ease then to prevent everybody from arc breaking would require continuous auditing see that is not the remedy the remedy is to find and indicate the bypassed charge and the arc break ceases right like that find and indicate the bypassed charge its actually as simple as that nothing to it now you are all of you cognizant of the trick of turning off somebodys anger at you by saying somebodys missed your withholds sometimes it doesnt work sometimes it doesnt work the person just gets more insulted well thats because missed withhold isnt the source of the bypassed charge you just indicated the wrong bypassed charge but this fellow does have missed withholds somebody has missed withhold on him in session he doesnt even know this and hes ranting and raving at you or something of the sort and you say boy somebody missed withhold on you man he cools right down it isnt as you might think that it introverts him so that he immediately begins to look around inside of his skull i wonder what the missed withhold is and so pulls him off of your neck that isnt whats happened there you take good close look at it get some experience on this and get some reality on it yourself and this material will really be in your grasp now sometimes youve said to somebody well somebody missed withhold on you man and the person has said goddamn dont you pull that on well it wasnt withhold that was missed see somebody missed goal get the idea and if you were to pursue it right then and say well lets see was itit was probably goal that was missed probably somebody missed goal on youmissed whole gpm somebody missed whole ri somebodys missed some ris on you and hes just about to let out of his mouth horrendous scream and follow this thing through and he all of sudden says i wonder if it could have been missed ri probably was see so the trick of turning off an arc break is to find and indicate the bypassed charge but it must be the charge that was bypassed see thats where the accuracy comes in and that makes you an artist now its still within the realm of scientific approachstill within the realm of scientific approach because there are only few charges that can be missed see theres engrams and gpms and goals and ris an engram more basic on the chain or an incident more basic on the chain or failure to acknowledge or refutation of reality or rejection of affinity this character is feeling youre pretty good auditor and you say ah nuts see all right hes got charge there of affinity see and that isnt acknowledged and you bypass it you rejected it so you get this thing firing back in your face dont you see what that is now these are not mechanisms which are totally relegated to session but they relegate themselves to life now youre registrar and somebody is coming in or youre signing up pcs all of you have to wear registrars hat at one time or another and youre trying to get somebody to get some auditing youre registrar see and there you are one fine day with yowyowyow and screamscreamscream standing in front of your face seventyfive hours of auditing have been deliveredhe feels terrible he says oh i could kill everybody in the place and he ought to go out and sue everybody and hes going to inform the government that so on and so on and so on and so onyap yap yap you never hear such thing dont worry too much about the threats because the person totally lacks direction person will go halfway down the steps and change his mind and do something else dont you see theyre incapable of carrying forward program that has any cohesion or direction see now you actually are very foolish to engage this individual in any reasonable conversation because its not reasonable situation that attitude is wholly the product of bypassed charge and as registrar you simply should hunt and punch around till you find the bypassed charge thats all just hunt and punch around till you find the pcs bypassed charge all of sudden the thing expires it just goes because youve found and indicated it be perfectly all right to just grab meter andtrying somehow or another to get him to hold the cansand just give him the standard sort of an assessment did somebody run an engram too late on the chain you see theres more basic engram run oh clang that fired ah yes well somebody was running an engram on you and theres an earlier engram oh is there yes you know yeah wheres all this rage well you see the rage is an automaticity and i have told you often often often often often the tenuous character the extremely delicate balanced character of neurosis and psychosisand such other nasty wordsmakes it almost impossible not to undo it because it is incapable of continuation it is set up in such delicate balance that almost anything can make it slip if its effective you understand that you see some guy is down in padded cell someplace and hes raving gamaniac and he is screaming away and throwing stools at the warders and so forth and although i dont blame him for throwing stools at these blokes this is the point his condition is not condition of terrible difficult hard mean impossibletoreach goonforever dramatization see that is not true actually the difficulty of maintaining such state is almost impossibly difficult you can make it go bzzzt and all of sudden it longer hangs in balance and cant go on dramatizing youve heard talk to you before about the slip old arc straightwire the way you can knock apart neurosisthe difficulty of maintaining neurosis old arc straightwire has broken up more neuroses than you can count see ittoo difficult for the pc to go on being neurotic on this particular point and this of course is at wild variance to the commonly held belief the commonly held belief is person is psychoticwell thats it theyve had it you see and theyre psychotic and thats all you can do about it you cant do anything about it you see because its very tough vigorous dangerous enduring condition see thats the commonly held belief they believe that neurosis is fantastically arduous thing read funny story somebodypeople send clippings all the time i get lots of clippings appreciate them and one of the clippings i got the other day was yapyap about psychiatrist it was very funny it seems like hed been treating this fellowhes telling his story you see and hed been treating this fellow for four years at an hour day and when the fellowhed had tremendous success the psychiatrist was saying because when the fellow first came to him why he just felt terrible all the time because he just had this urge to kill somebody and so he gave him an hours treatment every day for four years and at the end of that time why the fellow walked into the office and the psychiatrist knew hed had wonderful success because the fellow said he just felt wonderful he just felt wonderful hed never felt better and so forth and that neurosis that he had been working with that always used to make him feel terrible now made him feel wonderful and as the fellow pulled the iron bar out of his pocket the psychiatrist said and that was the end of the story in other words there are two things you see that argue in favor of lie in this direction one the absence of technology and the absence of understanding of these states combines with the professional need of tough eases you see if psychosis wasnt unsolvable you wouldnt find theand very tough and very enduring and very terribleyou wouldnt find the us government shelling out sixteen billion quid or bucks or whatever theyre using these days to build themselves up endless numbers of sanitariums and ten research centers theyre going to build ten research centers and so forth and they might even get up to prenatals in these things you know because theyll probably use our work and man look at the kitty sixteen billion see and thats just the initial appropriation thats going to cost five billion year afterwards the armedforces construction program of the united states is only 16 or 18 billion give you some weird perspective that is fantastic look at the vested interest in psychosis being incurable these nuts that are in charge of the nuts will never do anything of course its worth too much to them not to somebody comes along and said all you have to do is find and indicate the bypassed charge and the person go fftt and hes sane oh theyd say take that nut out and kill him hahahaha hes about to cost us sixteen billion hardearned legislative bucks shoot him its not for nothing the fda is mad at us you see they dont for moment believe any of their charges see they have made comprehensive thorough investigation all up and down the land and they havent found one single human being who ever was told that an emeter would cure anything but theyve invented the statements why well we constitute fantastic threat to fantastic vested interest these are not men of goodwill theyre cavedin dramatizers themselves never make that error you can very easily make that error these guys are dramatizing i dont knowmuch care what theyre dramatizing but they themselves are doing heavy hard dramatization by which they say we can do what we do without conscience because man is after all an animal and is nothing see so they spread the plea that man is an animal and is nothing as an effort to get over committing overts so this hangs them with being an animal and being nothing i imagine that if you took thirty psychiatristsi know its unpopular to talk about these people but if you took thirty psychiatrists at random at least one of those thirty would be sitting there barking if you just called on thirty in row you think im kiddingtry it sometime im not kidding these people need help probably worse than their own patients how would you like to be up against something that you advertisedly considered incurable totally damaging nothing could be done about it and youre collecting money right and left to do something about it krrrrr thats pretty nasty position for anybody to work himself into now we probably cut those blokes off by my continuous saying this and that we probably deny them help one way or the other but every time i have ever tried to work with any group of psychiatrists or anything of the sort the only thing theyll send is one of their number who has already gone potty this birds around the bend or something like that and ive never been able to teach them anything and they actually have worn out their welcome with thats all but i would still help them today thats beside the point the point im making on the thing is that you can work yourself into position where you consider an arc break unremediable terribly powerful and overwhelmingly destructive so that you will label certain pcs as arcbreaky pcs you can fear this arc break you see you can become afraid of these arc breaks occurring and that can make you unwilling to audit or if you dont even go that far will rough you up enough to do stinking auditing job which of course causes more arc breaks you got that so unless you corral the arc break unless you yourself get good reality on handling the arc break unless you understand this one and you develop the skill necessary to find and indicate the bypassed chargethats the only skill youve got to developyoull get into position where youll audit for while and then feel like it isnt worth the candle and man is good and go the route man another half century youll be telling congress well we need sixteen billion dollars becauseto handle the nuts you see what youve got to break through with you is one condemnation of arc breaks they dont mean anything theyre not diagnostic in any way shape or form theyre not diagnostic thats all they dont tell you the ease with which pc runs or the unease with which he runs they tell you nothing see the pc who runs like welloiled player piano may arc break all over the ceiling and some pc that you couldnt get gain on with building jack never arc breaks at all so you see its indication at all theres index there the pc who is very easy to audit very often is the pc that is very hardest to get gain on and the pc who is very difficult to audit very often gets the highest gains so you see these are not coordinated factors so this is something that should tell you that temporary or permanent conditions of misemotional stress are something that you have to face up to as an auditor or just get out of the auditing chair itll catch up with you sooner or later man i catch myself every once in while in some kind of session pc says rowrow rowrowrowrow rowrowrowrowrow see you just ask for one more of those suppresses on this ri and im going to blow because there arent any suppresses left on the ri you get that kind of an approach i say to myself this pcs trying to convince that i mustnt take the charge off the ris this pc is in big sell see well actually that would be the inevitable effect of it i eventually would say well all right and all right that rocket read you know it rocket read and so on get the next one the next one the next one and so on all right yeah youve finished the bank to hell with you you know see youre doing the very thing you must have done in the first place that caused the arc break and you got to get some wins on this auditoryou got to get some wins on this this one you got to get wins on i want you to get confidence that when pc goes rowrowrow that you can find the bypassed charge either just by knowing what it must be because it couldnt be anything else because you werent doing anything else dont you see and checking on meter or going into fulldress parade of assessment to get the bypassed chargehowever you get that bypassed chargefind it and then by indicating it to this pc realize the tool that is in your power by the fact that the mere indication of it turns off the arc break right like that you didnt do thing about it except indicate it how do you indicate it you say to the pc whatever you say to the pc that indicates it thats all i mean its as elementary as that there isnt any hidden magic here its not like that if youi can teach you now how to make gold and the way to learn how to make gold the way to make gold is to go up at twelve oclock on night of the full moon and sit down on punky stump with two pounds of lead and one pound of arsenic rub these two together and if you dont think of the word hippopotamus you will find you have made gold see impossiblecompletely impossible assignment now this is not an impossible one this lies well within your reality your action your ability and so forth there isnt anything else spotted here see that is esoteric or outside i didnt mean to degrade your reality or anything like that im saying just its something that you can have reality on right now the only times youll miss on this you very often will pick it up session or two later you had an arc break bow and you couldnt find anything toand then nothing happened and you couldnt cure the thing and blooww and you couldnt do anything about it and two sessions later you find outmy god you had passed whole gpm you all of sudden remember hey two sessions ago when i jumped that bank you know i got that next goal andhaha and we just found out that in between there is the goal to spit hey what do you know hoho and you say to the pc hey what do you know about that and the pc gets very calm all of sudden you very often find out couple ofsome time afterwards what the bypassed charge was and that will make you very enthusiastic on what im saying just now youll get more enthusiastic than that because you find out its an invariable fact it doesnt vary why didnt you find the bypassed charge at the time the charge was bypassed now the rest of it is you actually shouldnt let an arc break endure more than two or three minutes because arc breaks multiply by the square theyre not lineal development you let an arc break run one minute and it doubles you let it run two minutes and it quadruples you let it run three minutesyou get the idea there it goes this thing is developing on very steep curve and you actually owe it to the pcnot because youre afraid of it but because youll have more trouble and waste more session timeyou owe it to the pc to get in and turn it off fast now you see whole government can be intimidated by riot the united states government is actually being conducted today by riot the only people who get any attention or get anything passed are those people who riot see the japanese government went by the boards because there was riot somebody went down and slipped few yen to few students and they went up and went yowyowyow and eisenhower was unable to visit the country and so forth because after all students are pretty dangerous you know and cant have all that shouting you know and so forth and the government fell this governmentmy hats off to this government they ban the bomb you know and the police go out and pick them up and put them away and they ban the bomb and the police go out and pick them up and put them away and i dont think theres been ripple in parliament i dont think parliament has even heard about it its very very remarkable theyve gotten used to that over here see so theyre not being run by riot get this as method of government running government by riot there are many methods of government which i have studied from time to time and been called to my attention and so on which arent in the civics textbooks you know you elect the mayor and the mayor does this and the aldermen do that and all that sort of thing these arent in the civics textbook but they are basic methods of government government by assassination there are many texts on this subject texts the government of japan for some vast vast vast period of time was run by the black dragon society some bird dramatizing the helatrobus implants i think theyre called the sharif mohammedans or something like that they were at the time from which you get the word assassin old hashshashin the old man of the mountain used to kidnap young fellows and tell them that when they got killed they could come back to paradise hed give them few days in paradise you know and hed get lot of goodlooking dolls and rivers of milk and honey and all that sort of thing and the guy up therethats where you get the word hashish too theyd get this young fellow in some cafe and feed him some hashish take him up there and these babes would chuck him under the chin for few days and then the old man with the false halo would come around and say now the way you get back here and live forever in perfect enjoyment is to do exactly what we say and what is that well go get yourself killed of course well how am iget myself killed well you have to assassinate the sultan of persia well the young fellows look at these girls and all the curves and hed say tsk tsk why not see and the next drink of wine they slipped to him why itd have some more hashish in it and hed wake up in the capital of the shah next time the shah walked through the streets or rode through the streets or something like that there he was and off went the shahs head see of course the guards would kill the fellow but that was exactly in the plans and lot of young fellows got surprised by not being able to find the top of this mountain again and there they were but that was government by assassination and all the old man of the mountain ever had to do was just indicate to the chinese head of state that hed like couple of camel loads of gold please and they would be on the way at once everybody was terrified of this person government by assassination any policy could be laid down anything else because of this fear of assassination this lasted couple of hundred years by the way and its oddly enough direct dramatization of the helatrobus implants the helatrobus implants didnt have that as purpose they just had purpose as doing you init was far more elementary butthats why theyre so easy to deal with theyre so monomanic on the subject you were supposed to be human have body not fly around anymore not trouble anybody and then you were supposed to have such diverse purposes that you could never unite on single cause easy to govern yes i must say so but of course the helatrobus government never got around to establishing the government they had then set up rest their bones rest their bones they must have had the whole galaxy laid out for total conquest and they were too covert to ever take over covertion became the order of the day you see they could never assert dominion of what theyd set up interesting interesting point i see that that saddened you dont worry about it dont worry about it we can straighten that up anyhow getting back on this other you realize that if you governed all of your actions by reason of arc breaks youll get government of scientology by arc break and you as an auditor in your auditing actions will be governed by arc breaks do you see that do you see that thats why i was taking this political excursion just to show you there that it is possible to have your actions governed by that you are never governed by that which you can handle with ease so therefore the greater the facility you develop in handling arc breaks the less you are governed by arc breaks until youre not governed at all by arc breaks it just becomes another phenomenon pcs nose is running or he startstears leaking out of his eyes hand him kleenex has an arc break why locate and indicate the bypassed charge bangbang you see and keep on with what youre doing you got it now at first in developing these activities you will make mistakes as to what the bypassed charge is on and your faith will quiver and grow faint and youll say the arc break must be caused by something else because look i found and indicated the charge and the pc still has an arc break therefore there must be something about this that ron did not tell us there was something about it that you didnt hear you have to find and indicate the right bypassed charge there are only few of them but you have to find the right one and the arc break vanishes at once therefore there is reason under the sun to have arc breaky sessions reason to keep pc arc breaking now those pcs who have continuously arc broken sessions can be run on process which is the threeway arc break process im not talking now about they have an arc break you run this process you get that one wrong way to and ill get cross because we used to have processes to handle the arc break but they wont handle the immediate arc break you understand were not interested in process that handles the immediate arc break we got that technology and its much faster than process but somebody whose bank is mixed up because of arc breaks has this other arc break process and an auditor who has gotten himself stuck around and messed up because he has just run too many arc breaky pcs with this run on him finds it all stripped away in sessionin auditing you know what attitude has been refused you know the in auditing what reality has been rejected in auditing what communication has not been acknowledged its that trio and theyll straighten up using in auditing as prefix more auditing than any quantity of midrud buttons ive gotten repetitive process which upscales this we needed repetitive process at this time for many reasons but there is doll because this one even runs an implant you see we have good history on this process because this is old arc straightwire nineteen fiftyeight the only thing thatd go into implants and open them wide open was arc break straightwire remember that process 1958 all right this is the immediate successor and heres one of the most workedover areas of repetitive processes known its based of course on the whole technology of the arc triangle now im giving you the rest of the technology why does it work you see because it does nothing but spot bypassed charge thats how i redeveloped it and redeveloped it you see and i got it redeveloped along this line and theres trick ways of clearing the auditing command and so forth ill put into your hands so that you can do an assessment on certain words so the pc has complete understanding of what youre doing and this is doll it isnt any toolittle twobit process in fact you will be doing it on fridays well what im getting around to here is your attitude on the subject of arc breaks must never be one whereby youre driven by the arc break because youll be driven man into not getting the items clean youll be driven into taking the pcs orders because pc arc breaks just for so much time and then starts to issue orders because his duress is so great and those orders are the direct result of dramatizations so the orders are the significance see hes dramatizing the significance contained in what you just put him at the effect of see not only is he capable of dramatizing the emotion of the bypassed charge but hes also capable of dramatizing the significance contained in the bypassed charge and therefore its very dangerous thing to take the ordersits very dangerous to the pc to take the orders of very arc broke pc very dangerousto the pc not to you so whats this add up to this adds up to two things that you should learn to handle bypassed charge and be good enough as an auditor not to ever bypass charge period how do you do that well just get hot man how can you bypass charge you can bypass charge by not finding any you get pc who is on suppress suppress suppress and is all upset and going sideways and you try to find the next goal youre pressing on with the session in the teeth of some kind of weird apathetic arc break or low morale see so you do this list only he never puts the goal on the list he puts some other goal three goals down the bank on this list you take that goal you see because you cant do anything else and so forth and you just really cant do good job on it so you take this goal and you bypass couple of gpms now brother youre going to have picnic see you were driven into auditing somewhat carelessly or apathetically or defensively or something of the sort so you did bad job of auditing and then you laid in more chargebypassed see you layyou didnt lay in more charge you bypassed more charge see the harder you are driven into doing bad job then the more charge you bypass so then you try to find the top oppterm of this new one you found it doesnt fire got two gpms ahead of it or you try to find its terminal and that takes you two sessions what do you think the magnitude of builtup charge is by this time on the bypassed charge the bypassed charge is always prior to the charge you were working you seealways prior what do you think this does well it just confirms the bypassed charge the reason you cant get anyplace with what you are doing is because you have bypassed charge and therefore look on the arc break as blessing in disguise it tells you even more accurately than the meter that you have bypassed some charge well it tells you you havent got basic on the chain of the engrams regardless of the meter is there more basic incident on this chain the meter doesnt do thing it just sits there and does nothing if the pc arc breaks well brother there is more basic incident on that chain in other words he can look deeper than the meter see youve said all right now lets pick up the first incident good what are you looking at oh im looking at the clouds going by here all right good now see anything else around you yeah i see this black cord that seems to be coming down from the sky all right now go to the moment just before that black cord reaches the ground or reaches toward you pc arc breaks well you say well imi was just sitting here trying to run the basic engram on the chain and it said on the meter that it was the basic engram andandhuuhmmmm dont feel so damn pathetic you asked him to go to the beginning so that restimulated it and then he didnt get there and he saw picture that was the fifteenth incident and you started to run the fifteenth incident there were fourteen before it so the pc arc broke now you say well ive got to run this incident because i cant get any trace of the earlier incidents unless i run through this one once so therefore i dont dare run through this one once because the pc will arc break not unless you havent heard word i said in this lecture see you wont be able to if you havent heard word ive said you will always have to run the basic and of course its not available its seldom available till youve peeled off couple off the top of it look at the trouble youre having trying to get the first goal on the first series look at the trouble youre having why are you having trouble thats because youve got to audit few later ones to get the charge off enough to find the first one well all right isnt that automatically bypassed charge its bypassed charge but youve already cured the arc break how you told the pc i cant find the first goal right now and its undoubtedly there were going to run the one weve got our hands on so youve already found and indicated the charge so the pc wont arc break of course because he knows theres charge up ahead all right all you have to do is find and indicate the basicthe fact that there is basic on the chain well the pc arc breaksstart to run this chain you just try it on for size you say well you know the engram that weve just started into here thats evidently late on the chain isnt it and you look at your meter and itll fire right about that time because you said now were going to run the one we get through so we can get back earlier oh welloh yes all right fine and the pcll go right through it hell runhell run the eightyninth on the chain as long as he knows not even that its the eightyninth but that theres an earlier one on the chain its that elementary its that elementary now why does pc arc break when youre putting in rudiments well the rudiment is out in the incident that you are running and of course thats prior to the session you try to put the rudiment in in the session it is out in the incident so of course youve bypassed the charge so therefore the pc arc breaks and said all youre doing is sitting there running mid ruds and mid ruds and mid ruds and youre midruding to death see thats just another case of bypassed charge pc arc breaks in mid ruds you sayyou dont have to find it in fact you better hadnt theres probably suppress in the incident see youre running suppress and the pc arc breaks you say well in the incident well probably run theres probably suppress and the pcoh yes thats the end of the arc break you understand you get how many ways this cookie crumbles see its the number of ways this pie can be cut its always bypassed charge and whats that make you for chickening off on cleaning an ri whats that do when because the pc is so arc breaky and restive that you dont get all the charge off ofout of an ri what does that set up what does that set up for the next two or three ris learn to think in those terms it sets up an arc break of course because you didnt get the charge off the ri the next ri now has bypassed charge behind it least thatll happen is your pcs morale goes down and you cant get the charge off the next one and you get cumulative error see but of course you are so protective of your skill as an auditor you never say to the pc hey i dont think ive gotten any of the charge off the earlier incidents in this bank and the pc says oh havent you well careless of you and thats the end of that arc break look at the cumulative error item one you got it to fire it fired over sixteenth of an inch sensitivity 128 on the meter well thats the end of that one all right what opposes it nix scrambled eggishness you know all right that fired sixteenth of an inch so you say good all right lets take the next one number two absolutably scrambled eggishness you know well that ticked well thats good enough there probably wasnt any charge on it probably the speaker was out that day so lets get the next one nix scrambled eggishness hmhm that fell slightly tone arm went up so you got tone arm action on it oh you say well i better get industrious perfectably scrambled eggishness i better get industrious and ill really clean this one this item been suppressed anything in the session been suppressed protested upset anythinganything been upset anything protested upset invalidated perfectable scrambled eggishnessanything been perfectabled and youre sitting there looking at the wildest arc break you ever heard of where did it come from just because im trying to put in couple of rudiments on perfectable scrambled eggishness this pc is arc broke because he doesnt want to looks mysterious doesnt it well it comes from nix absolutable absolutable nix and the top oppterm want to set up an arc break you can set it up perfectly mechanically just start going down the list just drop onejust drop an ri see notice the pc is little abstracted and say give number thirtyone ticks you say all right thats fine give number thirtytwo this pc will get weird look in his eye and certainly by thirtythree thirtyfour or thirtyfive you will have godawful arc break on your hands and then you say i didnt take the charge off number thirtyone didnt take the charge of it off oh oh i wouldnt say youd do this to any pc but you actually could and its just as predictable as that one two three you bypass the charge keep it secret arc break now you start struggling around with pc and ramming around one kind or another and harassing the pc and chewing the pc up after youve bypassed two and threequarters banks full of blown charge and what do you think youre going to be able to do with this pc exactly nothing youre going to get nothing to discharge youre not going to be able to run session and so forth whats your remedy your remedy ordinarily is find an earlier goal and run it well what if the pc is so bogged down by this time that you cant get up to an earlier goal well run this arc break recall process for half session your pc will be able to find some earlier goals yeah well thats crude remedy any trouble you have with routine 3 today is caused by bypassed charge any arc break that youre having is caused by bypassed charge which has neither been found nor indicated its all under the heading of bypassed charge get reality on it how many ways can you bypass charge then youll be able not only to run smooth session but youll have everything blowing left and right all the way on down there are numbers of ways to run charge off of risnumbers of ways to do it but dont take the charge off of gpm your next gpm isnt going to fire dont take the charge off of four or five consecutive ris the sixth isnt going to fire thats all now dont yammer at the pc on the seventh trying to get it to discharge well thats nonsense how can it discharge pc is all of suddenhis morales down hes arc broken and so forth the perfect way to keep these implants from running is to bypass charge then youre not going to get anything to run well ive even given you weapon that puts the pc back together again so you can bypass the charge youve left on the bank and thats your arc break process and thats marvelous anyway the only thing known thatll cut into an implant like band saw good straightwire processsit there and run it for while pcs that upset but find out the charge reason first cure these arc breaks before running process now theres the trouble you is havingif you have any trouble with pcs and if you have any trouble running banks it all comes under that one heading of bypassed charge youre going to have arc breaks and rocket reads everybody was sitting marveling at the big rocket reads i was getting on that tv demonstration well it might strike you as very interesting that it was one of the most difficult sessions i have given for very long time and those were the smallest rocket reads i have had for long time it was very difficult the pc was very restimulated by the amount of electronic hum on the television cameras because he was going through an electronic implant that hummed therefore wasnt firing very well and i fought that on down the line and there was bypassed charge of cognition which almost caused an arc break and finally gave you the cognition only it had been bypassed and then you saw some rocket reads that were really rocket reads you saw lot of rocket reads those things were clean theres waymany ways to blow ris this is not lecture on how to blow ris but let tell you that if you start bypassing charge early on youre going to find charge later and let tell you something else dont buy an ri that doesnt rocket read full dial got it just dont buy them lets see that thing fire man lets see it really fire there isnt pc made that wont give you dial rocket read per item now how much charge do you think youve left on the bank how long do you think your pc will remain arc unbroken all right now i told you you wouldnt like this lecture but there it is thank you very much
