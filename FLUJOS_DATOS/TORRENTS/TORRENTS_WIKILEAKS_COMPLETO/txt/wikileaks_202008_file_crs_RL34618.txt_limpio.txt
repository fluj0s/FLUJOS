peace plan calls for all parties to the conflict23 to cease hostilities and pull troops back to positions they had occupied before the conflict began other elements of the peace plan include allowing humanitarian aid into the conflict zone and facilitating the return of displaced persons it excludes mention of georgias territorial integrity the plan calls for the withdrawal of russian combat troops from georgia but allows russian peacekeepers to remain and to patrol in larger security zone outside south ossetia that will include swath of georgian territory along south ossetias border the plan also calls for the opening of international discussions on the modalities of security and stability of south ossetia and abkhazia this seems to provide for possibly greater international roles in peace talks and peacekeeping both of seminal georgian interest however it does not specifically state that international peacekeepers will be deployed within south ossetia supposedly the russian peacekeepers will cease patrolling the area outside south ossetia after the modalities of international peacekeeping are worked out and monitors are deployed within this area process that could take

on august 20 russias general staff deputy head nogovitsyn claimed that the 6 point peace plan permitted the establishment of buffer zones and nofly zones near georgias borders with abkhazia and south ossetia he specified that the zone around abkhazia would include georgias senaki military base precluding georgias use of the base these zones appear somewhat like those established by armenia during

disputing this recognition was fantasy sarkozy hailed the accord as possibly clearing the way for the eu to soon reopen partnership talks with moscow30 on september 9 the russian defense minister asserted that around 3800 russian peacekeepers would remain in abkhazia and the same number in south ossetia31 this assertion triggered criticism by the united states georgia and others that the ceasefire accords called for the numbers of russian peacekeepers to revert to preconflict levels which before the buildup in abkhazia were about 2000 troops and in south ossetia were 1000 troops 500 russian troops and 500 north ossetian troops whom were in actuality mostly south ossetian on september 14 nato secretary general hoop scheffer reportedly criticized the eu for not insisting that

monitors to georgia by october 1 2008 to patrol areas along georgias borders with its breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia in accordance with ceasefire accords russian troops pulled back by october 9 from socalled buffer zones they occupied outside of the borders of the regions troubling aspects included russias apparent backing to efforts by abkhazia and south ossetia to increase the size of their territories at georgias expense in abkhazia russian troops remained in the kodori gorge area and appeared to support abkhaz efforts to move the border to the inguri river in south ossetia russian checkpoints remained in akhalgori district which was within the regions sovietera borders but had been administered by georgia since the south ossetian conflict of the early 1990s the united states continues to argue that the 6point ceasefire plan calls for russian troops in excess of preconflict numbers to withdraw from south ossetia and abkhazia implications for georgia and

august 12 that russian troops were ending their offensive against georgia he stated that russias aims had been accomplished and the aggressor punished various observers have suggested several possible russian reasons for the punishment beyond inflicting casualties and damage these include coercing georgia to accept russian conditions on the status of the separatist regions to relinquish its aspirations to join nato37 and to replace saakashvili as the president38 in addition russia may have wanted to punish the west for recognizing kosovos independence for seeking to integrate soviet successor states which are viewed by russia as part of its sphere of influence into western institutions such as the eu and nato and for developing oil and gas pipeline routes that bypass russia the

georgia and the 1999 nato bombing of serbia yugoslavia which was aimed at forcing serb president slobodan milosevic to end serbian attacks in the kosovo region moscow opposed the nato operation according to former greek diplomat alex rondos russia wants to serve up to the west textbook copy of what the west did to serbia but of course its ghastly parody67 these observers point to the largescale ethnic cleansing and the deaths of thousands of kosovars they are critical of russias disproportionate response in georgia and stress that natos military aircraft and artillery did not target civilians in serbia as russian forces and allied militias allegedly targeted ethnic georgian villages in south ossetia and across the border they also stress that nato halted operations after serbia pulled its forces out of kosovo and accepted international peacekeeping while russia continued operations after georgias withdrawal of troops from south ossetia and its calls for ceasefire lastly the international community spent several years discussing the status of kosovo and strengthening the capacity of the regional government for selfrule while some commentators objected to

president bush called for russia to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world by meeting its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and withdrawing all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days he raised concerns that some russian troops remained in the vicinity of gori and poti he announced that he was sending secretary rice to france to confer with president sarkozy on the eu peace plan and to georgia where she will personally convey americas unwavering support for georgias democratic government and continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of free georgia he also announced that defense secretary robert gates would direct humanitarian aid mission which already had begun with an airlift of medical supplies to tbilisi90 the bush administration has hoped to maintain cooperation with russia on antiterrorism including assistance in operations in afghanistan nonproliferation and sanctions against iran and north korea on august 14 however secretary gates stated that the russiageorgia conflict had forced the administration to reconsider efforts to carry on longterm strategic dialogue with russia and that russias behavior has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato91 in seemingly harsh language on august 19 secretary rice asserted that russia is becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict and that by invading smaller neighbors bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and wanton destruction of this infrastructure russia is isolating itself from the community of nations92 deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza presented the most detailed administration position on the events in georgia in briefing on august 19 and in testimony on september 10 he appeared to argue that the outbreak of fighting in georgias breakaway south ossetia region on the night of august 78 was preplanned and provoked by russia he pointed out that south ossetias government and its security structures are run by russian officials who were commanding these south ossetian forces that were shooting at georgian peacekeepers or troops and villages he also asserted that there was an offensive under way from russia through the roki tunnel toward tskhinvali and kurta and other ethnically georgian villages and at that point the georgian leadership told 90 the white house office of the press

but to defend our villages and our people and lift ceasefire that georgia had declared earlier93 despite this evidence bryza maintained whoever shot whom first is now longer the issue at all it is that russia has escalated so dramatically and brutally russia has moved well beyond south ossetia it used strategic bombers to target civilians blocked the port of poti and destroyed eastwest rail lines moreover he stressed russian forces also invaded georgia from its breakaway abkhazia region which has nothing to do with south ossetia at all in the case of abkhazia it was the abkhaz who attacked the georgians bryza stated that the administration in early august had strongly recommended to georgia that it not engage in direct military conflict with russia indicative of heightened tensions in usrussia relations prime minister putin alleged on august 28 2008 that the united states may have orchestrated the conflict in georgia to disguise its economic and foreign policy problems and boost the prospects of presidential candidate he also alleged that the united states not only failed to dissuade georgia from operations in south ossetia on august 78 but armed the georgians and directed them to attack white house press secretary dana perino responded that the allegations were patently false and not rational and that it is time for the countries who believe in sovereignty independence and territorial integrity to band together to fight against russias violation of such principles94 president medvedev later repeated the allegations that saakashvili had received direct orders or at least silent approval from the united states to launch an idiotic action against south ossetia95 vice president cheney visited georgia on september 4 to assure that america will help georgia rebuild and regain its position as one of the worlds fastest growing economies saakashvili and his democratically elected government can count on the continued support and assistance of the united states he also stated that the united states was coming to the aid of georgia as it had aided georgia after the 2003 rose revolution that had brought saakashvili to power to help georgia to overcome an invasion of your sovereign territory and an illegitimate unilateral attempt to change your countrys borders by force we will help your people to heal this nations wounds to rebuild this economy and to ensure georgias democracy independence and further integration with the west96 he visited ukraine on september 5 to similarly reassure the country of us support for its sovereignty and

has violated the sovereignty of democratic georgia made and then breached solemn agreement in direct affront to the eu severely damaged its credibility and global standing and undermined its own relations with the united states and other countries this chain of aggressive moves and diplomatic reversals has only intensified the concern that many have about russias larger objectives for brutality against neighbor is simply the latest in succession of troublesome and unhelpful actions he stated that such actions include russias use of energy as tool of force and manipulation in central asia the caucasus and beyond russian arms sales to syria and iran and russian antagonism toward nato enlargement and the advance of democracy in europe he concluded that such actions are way for responsible power to conduct itself97 secretary rice delivered speech on september 18 that similarly strongly excoriated russia for its aggressive foreign policy behavior including the invasion of georgia she stated that russias leaders had laid the groundwork for what by all appearances was premeditated invasion of georgia months ago distributing russian passports to georgian separatists training and arming their militias and then justifying the campaign across georgias border as an act of selfdefense however she did not call for us or international sanctions on russia and stated that the sochi declaration signed earlier this year provided strategic framework for the united states and russia to advance our many shared interests we will continue by necessity to pursue our areas of common concern with russia whatever the differences between our governments we will not let them obstruct deepening relationship between the american and russian people98 in retort on september 22 to secretary rices speech the russian foreign ministry asserted that russias military response to georgias attack on russia had been proportionate99 the major administration action to date has been the september 8 withdrawal of consideration by congress of the usrussia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation submitted to congress in may 2008 in his letter of withdrawal president bush stated that his decision was in response to recent actions by the government of the russian federation incompatible with peaceful relations with its sovereign and democratic neighbor georgia he added that if

some observers in georgia and the west have argued that natos failure to offer georgia membership action plan map at the april 2008 nato summit emboldened russias aggressiveness toward georgia others consider that natos pledge that georgia eventually would become member as well as georgias ongoing movement toward integration with the west spurred russian aggression106 saakashvili argued on august 10 that russia wanted to crush georgias independence and end its bid to join nato france and germany which had voiced reservations at the april 2008 nato summit about extending map to georgia may argue even more forcefully against admitting georgia citing both the higher level of tensions over the separatist regions georgias military incursion into south ossetia and the danger of war with russia although the united states strongly supported map for georgia at the april 2008 nato summit recent events may have dimmed this prospect an emergency meeting of nato ambassadors on august 12
