the critical challenge in the short term is posed by the space debris resulting from the prcs intentional destruction of satellite it was the first such destruction of satellite since the asat tests conducted during the cold war by the united states and the soviet union in the 1980s since then neither the united states nor russia has destroyed satellites in space while many more civilian and military satellites have been used by countries and companies in leo up to 2000 km or 1242 miles altitude reconnaissance and weather satellites and manned space missions including the international space station space shuttle and chinas manned flights are vulnerable to the increase in space debris resulting from chinas satellite destruction this debris cloud estimated at 950 pieces 4 inches or bigger plus thousands of smaller pieces threatens space assets in leo according to the johnson space center the director of space operations at the air force said that his staff tracked about 14000 particles before january 11 and that number increased to about 15000 the commander of the strategic command stra tcom testified that the last us kinetic asa t test occurred in 1985 and at the lower altitude of leo and even so the debris took ov er 20 years to come down out of space and burn up in the atmosphere chinas test was in the upper altitude of leo and the resulting debris is 1 craig

air force space command the space debris increased the collision risk for about 700 spacecraft2 china has known about international concerns about space debris its space white paper of october 2006 stated that china has actively participated in the interagency space debris coordination committee initiated space debris action plan and increased international exchanges on space debris research the longerterm implications concern some questions about chinas capability and intention to attack us satellites whereas the secretary of defense has reported publicly to congress since 1998 that chinas military has been developing an asat capability3 some observers doubted the pentagons assertions chinas january 2007 test confirmed chinas longsuspected program to develop asat weapons program that could potentially put at risk us military and intelligence satellites that are needed to provide tracking and targeting for rapid reaction or other operations china demonstrated limited capability to use missile to launch kinetic kill vehicle to destroy one of its own satellites in leo under testing conditions that it controlled the mobility of this asat weapon under development also could present challenges for us tracking and warning time aside from developing and testing this asa t capability china does not have enough satellite interceptors although it can produce enough of them by 2010 to destroy most us satellites in leo with little warning estimates the defense department also the asat test did not threaten the us missile defense system the director of the defense intelligence agency testified to congress that the test demonstrated chinas capability to eventually deploy an asat system that could threaten us satellites 4 threat consists of capabilities and intentions stressed the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general peter pace at news conference on march 7 2007 he visited china on march 2226 and reported that the intention of the asa t test remained unclear china has not explained how it intends to use this asat weapon that has been tested various comments by pla officers and prc civilian analysts have justified the asat test as needed to counter perceived us hegemony in space and target the vulnerability of us dependence on satellites pla air force colonel wrote in late 2006 that us military power including longrange strikes have relied on superiority in space and that leveraging space technology can allow rising power to close the gap with advanced countries more rapidly than trying to catch up 5 prc specialist at fudan university indicated that chinas asat program is developed partly to maintain chinas nuclear deterrence perceived as undermined by us space assets6 an analyst at the plas academy of military science argued that china does not

speculated that this asat test surprised us intelligence although chinas test confirmed longstanding defense department reporting about chinas counterspace program some warnings seemed inconsistent with chinas january 2007 kinetic kill asat test in the three annual reports on the pla from 2004 to 2006 required by the fy2000 national defense authorization act the secretary of defense reported to congress that china could destroy or disable satellites in space only by launching ballistic missile or space launch vehicle armed with nuclear weapon 8 however the pentagons 2003 report warned that china was developing directascent asa t system that could be fielded between 2005 and 2010 also us intelligence reportedly knew about the pla s previous tests and preparations for this latest asat test number of us intelligence agencies had full court press underway to monitor the asat test on january 11 and it was the fourth test that the united states monitored using missilewarning satellites

despite foreign protests china did not issue an official statement until january 23 12 days after the asa t test chinas foreign ministry simply stated that its experiment did not target or threaten any country and that china opposes the weaponization of space or an arms race in space beijings lack of prepared explanation and delay in issuing statement raised questions about whether the top leaders approved the pla s asa t tests coordinated between the foreign ministry and the pla miscalculated foreign responses or approved the asat program and anticipated criticisms but decided anyway to test adding to concerns about chinas intentions the asa t test did not come at time of bilateral tensions after the uschina summit in april 2006 nasa and the stra tcom proposed civilian and military space contacts with china and nasas administrator visited china in september 2006 in this debate national security advisor stephen hadley questioned whether chinas leaders knew about the plas asat test in advance suggesting that us protests sought to compel top ruler hu jintao to become directly involved or responsible however deputy unde r secretary of defense richard lawless called the

some in china argued that the new us national space policy prompted chinas test while us officials have contended that regardless china has developed range of counterspace weapons to challenge us space dominance news reports stressed hardline tone of the policy signed by president bush in august 2006 with public version issued in october 2006 which stated opposition to new space arms control and denial of the use of space to adversaries hostile to us interests under secretary of state for ar ms control and international security robert joseph contended that the united states does not monopolize space or deny access to space for peaceful purposes he characterized the space policy as responding to growing threats from number of countries that are exploring and acquiring capabilities to counter attack and defeat us space systems when the united states is more dependent on space than other nations 13 even before issuance of the us space policy china conducted three previous tests of this directascent asa t weapon and by september 2006 china had used groundbased laser to illuminate us satellite in several tests of system to blind satellites 14 before and after this latest asat test prc military and civilian analysts have voiced concerns about chinas perceived vulnerability against us dominance in military and space power after the test senior colonel of the plas academy of

space paros adopted by the general assembly however paros seeks to prevent the weaponization of outer space and even if there were such an agreement it would not ban the type of landbased asat weapon not spacebased weapon that china tested fo rmer pla officer at chinas arms control and disarmament association noted that the foreign ministrys silence about the test was baffling and that if it is negotiating chip its illogical not to come out and announce something16 chinas foreign ministry had not prepared any explanation for the asa t test and its short statement of january 23 did not mention arms control it was at regular news conference week later that the ministry called for legal document indeed china had already subtly shifted its stance on space arms control at the united nations dropping an original call for not testing deploying or using on land at sea or in the atmosphere any weapons for warfighting in outer space 17

china and other countries about an arms control agreement such as paros code of conduct or other security building measures18 chinas asat test did not violate any existing arms control treaty although
