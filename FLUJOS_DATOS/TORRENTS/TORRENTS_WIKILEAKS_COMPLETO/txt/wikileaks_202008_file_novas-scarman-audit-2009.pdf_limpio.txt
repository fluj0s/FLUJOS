runs the imminent risk of being insolvent under the terms of the insolvency act 1986 section 123 the inability to pay debts is defined as follows company is deemed unable to pay its debtsa if creditor by assignment or otherwise to whom the company is indebted in sum exceeding 750 then due has served on the company by leaving it at the companys registered office written demand in the prescribed form requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for i t to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor 122 at present novas is unable to pay creditors as they fall due wit h number of creditors have threatenedbegun legal action against novas short t erm viability is dependent on number of oneoff inflows from property sales on not pay ing standard creditors as they fall due and on either not paying durkan construction durkan in full prior to reimbursement from camden counc il or on having an overdraft facility in place to allow durkan to be paid shortly before camden reimburses novas as at 2 december 2008 camden are sti ll to pay the 850000 owed to novas although aib have indicated that tempora ry facility is being made available until this payment is re ceived it has also been indicated to us that camden are now prepared to pay durkan directly rather than through novas 123 provided that all of these factors are managed carefully and tha t proceedings to wind up any of novas companies have not commenced it is possible that novas can continue in the short term bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 4 13 medium and long term viability of novas 131 we have assessed the medium and long term viability of novas on the ba sis of the business plan forecast model produced by matthew brown interim financial controller these forecasts do not appear to be complet with the reduction of rental units not currently being reflected several dr afts of these forecasts have been provided and have contained several significant errors 132 three scenarios are now being considered one in which arlington house i s retained one in which it is disposed of and third in which both arl ington house and dean street are disposed of 133 in the latter two scenarios the model shows business that is cash generati ve in the base case in most years 134 on the assumption that arlington house is retained and that the busines s is obliged to fund several million pounds of unfunded capital spend on the property the latest version of the model we have seen assumes loa n of 10 million is required 135 the correct interest and capital repayments on this loan which wer initially wrongly calculated would result in significant cash outflows in ll but the current year 136 it is difficult to understand how these outflows could be funded without furt her property disposals such as the liverpool cuc or refinancing somethi ng which is not modelled bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 5 14 key issues identified during our review of going concern are as follows 141 cash the total aggregated cash balance as at close of business on 9 d ecember 2008 was 144517 novas also has access to 250000 overdraft facility which expires on 19 december 2008 142 overdraft novass previous 3 million overdraft facility expired on 31 october 2008 on which day v at rebate of 25 million was received without which novas would have been significantly overdrawn without an authorised overdraft furthermore on friday 7 november 2008 novas considered attempting to pay durkan without having sufficient funds ava ilable to do so 143 audit the audit of the novas financial statements for the year end ed 31 march 2008 has not yet been completed due in part to the fact that the accounting records of the scarman trust which merged into novas ouver tures to form the novas scarman group ltd were not complete when the merg er took place the scarman trust finance staff responsible were ma redundant prior to effective handover taking place the accounts should have been submitted to the housing corporation by the end of september 2008 144 finance department novas finance function has undergone significant reorganisation over the past two years with significant reduction in staff headcount further reorganisation is underway with several staff having been advised that they are at risk of redundancy consultation process has commenced and at risk staff are due to be informed of their stat us by 15 december 2008 if significant number of the existing finance tea m are not retained following this process it is likely that considerable amount of systems and in house knowledge will be lost 145 weekly cash flow model numerous

2008 private confidential 6 2 arlington house 21 introduction 211 it is clear that novas longer have the cash flow to finish the ar lington house project the novas smt would argue that this is moot point because i they have already decided to move away from the provision of beds and ii they have agreed with another rsl one housing group to take over the completion of arlington house 212 from evidence obtained during the inquiry and from interviews with micha wake and maria donoghuemills cochief executives it would appear tha t discussions commenced with one housing group during april 2008 yet it was not until 17 september 2008 that clg were informed of novas cashflow difficulties by michael wake 213 one possible rationale for novas seeking to retain arlington house unt il the last possible minute was in order to utilise its grantrental s tream to complete the renovation of the liverpool cuc 214 in order to refurbish arlington house funding of c27m was initially required with cash being raised by the sale of eleven properties to st mungos for 1426m the remaining 1277m was provided by way of grant from clg bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 7 22 funding streams disposal of hostels by novas to st mungos 221 clg had objection to the disposal of the stock provided there was cert ainty that the proceeds from the sales would be fully reinvested in order to ensure that other schemes in the improvement programme were properly addressed 222 st mungos did eventually receive funding from both the housing corporation c52m and clg 74m with st mungos contributing c16m giving total of c142m 223 michael wake writes to maff potts specialist advisor with t he homelessness and housing support directorate clg on 4 may 2005 to confirm that there will be further disposals in line with novas current strategie s and that ennersdale house in lewisham and mare street in hackney will be included in the disposals programme mr wake indicates that the disposals ready agreed would raise approximately 7m which would enable the first stage of the remodelling of arlington house 224 however michael also states that there is further 7m to 8m to find and if this money were not available then the remodelled arlington would have large areas unrefurbished until the additional funding was found michael ide ntifies the disposals of ennersdale house and mare street as being able to provide these additional funds bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 8 23 the actual spend on the arlington house project 231 according to spreadsheet prepared by gerry glover interim head of renewals finance at camden the total paid to novas by camden was 5212049 up to 13 october 2008 in addition to this novas have incurred further costs of 1893154 in respect of construction work undertaken by durkan limited and 99613 mostly in respect of professional fees therefore it would app ear that the total spend on the arlington house project to date is 7204817 novas architects 232 novas architects are mentioned at this juncture as they have charg ed costs in relation to the arlington house of 811245 it appears that they should ve only received 630000 based on 4½ of the construction costs of 14000000 there is lack of clarity over an additional 180000 of architects fees received by novas architects we have als noted that benchmark of 45 was used for arlington house whereas costs on the liverpool cuc were only 26 although the same inhouse architects w ere utilised on both schemes bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 9 24 the obligations incumbent on novas relating to the project 241 novas told the housing corporation on the section 9 disposals forms that the hostels were being sold in order to raise capital for arlington house scheme new social enterprises as agreed by odpm housing corporation relevant local authorities 242 the social enterprise schemes were criticised by maff pot ts as he did not see any evidence that consideration had been given to their content their busi ness case or sustainability 243 in an email of 31 may 2007 michael wake recognises the need to have the budget confirmed but he also notes will nee sic to open up the fact that we do not have 14m as we have had other costs eg loan etc to pay off 244 mr wake asks his finance director will melia in his email of 12 december 2007 silly questionso we do not have the 14m set aside for ah development 245 will melia responded on the same day stating michael although we have reserve to cover ahlpoolcucsoho cuc it is not fully backed by cash so i guess long winded answer is we have not got the 14m cash set aside for arlington 246 on 9 march 2008 michael wake drafts an upbeat letter to maff potts it is not known if the letter was eventually sent the salient parts of tha t letter are as follows i write to inform you that the group will honour its commitment to refurbish arlingtonthe novas group will fund the project up to xm matching and exceeding the funds obtained from the clg bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 10247 it would therefore seem that michael wake having being told that the 14m was not set aside for the arlington house project by will meli then proceeded to draft letter to the clg in upbeat terms saying that the c apital raised from the sale of the hostels would go towards arlington and dean street refurbishments we also suspect that when he asked will melia if the monies were present he was feigning ignorance because he knew in may 2007 that they were not 248 it seems that novas held on to arlington house as long as possible bef ore seriously looking at its disposal this may be because arlington h ouse generated income in the form of rental income which novas would not wa nt to forego until the last possible moment bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 1125 the potential recipients of the 14m raised from the sale of the hostels 251 as noted above it appears that the funding provided by clg via camden has been used so far for the redevelopment of arlington house however the us of the funding received from the sale of the hostels to st mungos is not as clear 252 of particular interest is that there is mention is made in c orrespondence we have seen with clg of the spending by novas on the liverpool cuc we have established that the total spending on the cuc was 16789270 the building includes areas for restaurants coffee shops art galleries offi ce space and conference facilities 253 further the explanation of matthew pike in relation to the spending of the 145m of cash generated from the sale of the hostels to st mungos ap pears now to be incorrect as it is clear that it is impossible for 138m to be spent on the cuc in liverpool when also taking into account the 145m spend which was set out by matthew pike taking the two together would give t otal spend of 283m 138m 145m novas do not appear have this level of cash reserves between 2005 and 2008 the monthly cashflow prepared by bdo shows that the maximum level of cash held was 223m as at 1 febr uary 2006 leaving shortfall of 6m 283m 223m conclusion 254 monies were received from funders after novas smt made verbal wr itten and email assurances as to the use of the proceeds of the disposals of the st mungos properties these monies are now not available and the end use has deliberately been hidden from central and local government and novas regulator bdo stoy hayward

diligence report prepared by beever struthers 311 beever struthers bs were commissioned by novas to prep are due diligence report in respect of the proposed acquisition of the scarman trust under their letter of engagement dated 8 october 2007 312 the resultant report makes it clear that it was not all encompassing 313 the due diligence report sets out further areas of concern and recommendations 314 it is clear that the report raises number of serious concerns that bs suggested should be dealt with prior to the transfer taking place email documentation identified regarding the due diligence report 315 michael wake accepts at this point prior to undertaking any exte rnal due diligence that the scarman trust has numerous issues in respect of the financial management eg weak cash flow position weak finance tea m and trustee board he also highlights the various positives of the merge r eg improved image more political and government links potential for furthe r partnerships of similar nature 316 michael wake emails gnosoulla tsiouppralewis in this matter stating our auditors have undertaken due diligence and did not raise any significant concerns although not too in depth due to time scales 317 it is important to note that this email dated 7 november 2008 is providing feedback on the due diligence review carried out by bs prior to t he bs report being received by novas further michael wake claims tha t the due diligence review did not raise any significant concerns as can be seen above bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 13the due diligence report outlines numerous areas of concern some of t hese areas of concern were considered of such importance that bs ggested further work be undertaken to resolve or gain greater understandin g of them prior to the transfer being finalised 318 these concerns were raised despite the limitation on the scope of the work there is obviously the probability that if their scope had been wi dened they would have uncovered more concerns 319 an email from michael wake to will melia and maria donoghuem ills relating to the due diligence report and its findings dated 29 november 2007 states that they needed to be proactive with the auditors in what they present 3110 we have also identified an email dated 1 october 2008 from paul byr ne management accountant at novas to michael wake maria donoghuemil ls matthew pike and the senior members of the finance team matthew brown liza ryan and lindsey mccormick asking whether novas requested full due diligence report 3111 maria donoghue mills immediately responds to this email solel to michael wake stating paul needs to go 3112 it would appear that it was portrayed to the board that the issues with the scarman trust would be easily managed and rectified once the t ransfer was complete 3113 the extent to which the actual due diligence report in respect of t he scarman trust was distributed to the board members is not clear however following meetings that we organised we understand that that at least t wo of the board members present at this meeting do not remember receiving or revi ewing the due diligence report bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 143114 gnosoulla tsioupralewis stated that the due diligence report may have been distributed but stated that she was likely to only have read the xecutive summary bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 1532 allegations concerning misuse of company credit card and abuse of senior management perks 321 since our inquiry began michael wake has reviewed the expenses tha t have been claimed on the company credit card and he has identified over 1600 of personal expenses that should not have been claimed for it is not clea r whether michael wake would have taken this measure had the inquiry not been announced 322 in respect of the hotel accommodation at the pangkor laut resort both michael wake and erwina aghafar have claimed that erwina sta yed with friendsrelatives on the weekend of 15 17 august 2008 however we have obtained an email confirmation sent to erwina aghafar dated 12 au gust 2008 for sea villa which indicated that it was for doubletwin occupanc and that the reservation was in the name of erwina aghafar erwina has told us that she booked the accommodation in her name because she would obtain better rate for michael but she states she did not stay there bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 1633 purchase of artwork by staff 331 we understand based on discussions with gnosoulla tsioupralewis chair of the board of novas that the art scheme was introduced because novas d previously bought too much art and as result an art director had been sacked 332 it appears that an employee of novas can get 10 discount for each year that they lend the purchased piece of art back to the gallery the art would be used in exhibitions staged by novas at any of the cuc buildings all t he proceeds will go back into the gallery and the artwork will be insured by novas art purchases made by michael wake 333 it has been noted that michael wake was the only employee who took par t in the scheme purchasing art for approximately 6300 334 although it was the original intention that the art scheme was to be used to reduce the amount of art held by the organisation in the permanent col lection it was on at least one occasion used to increase the amount of art 335 on 23 october 2008 the day after our inquiry commenced michael wake sent an email stating for the sake of clarity and transparency that all art work that i purchased under this policy will remain with nsg and all purchases will be null and void 336 it is clear that there are also v at issues surrounding this scheme and matthew pike suggested to us that specialist art v at query may have d elayed the november v at repayment that was crucial

year and it would appear that the correct procedures were not adhered to it is possible that the previous relationship between ta ra and michael wake may have had an unfair influence on the decision to ree mploy her 342 erwina aghafar has had various promotions from architectural empl oyee to director in the last few years however there is clear audi t trail in respect of these promotions 343 as with tara muthoora above relationship between erwina aghafa r and michael wake may have had an unfair influence on the decision to promote her and casts doubt on whether there was sound business case for her t go on business trips to malaysia with michael bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 1835 nepotism and manyee uk ltd 351 we have been able to confirm the

her commitment to the voluntary sector 372 there is also separate letter from gill saunders then the d irector of new initiatives dated 26 april 2004 stating that the trust will be est ablished with funds of 120000 this was due to be funded by 35000 from elspeth kyles legacy and 85000 from novas 373 it is worth noting that accounts or returns have been filed at the charity commission for this organisation since it was incorporated amount of funds to be transferred to elspeth trust 374 will melia confirmed that he refused to sanction payment of 160000 requested by michael wake which was to be used for the set up of joint venture company in ireland to attempt to draw down funds from the iri sh government in relation to international development work saying that board approval was

of the novas ouvertures tender book which provides pro forma tender opening and recording form we have undertaken an initial review of the tender book and we have noted the following points i there are numerous instances when details of only one or two tender s are noted on the tender form in respect of tenders in excess of 10000 whereas the policies and procedures state that three quotations s hould be received in these circumstances ii there are few occasions when the staff noted as being present at the opening of the tender documents have not actually signed the relevant box within the form the reason for this is unclear and iii out of eleven of tenders where george jones sons were involved they withdrew from providing tender on five occasions 382 it is also clear that on page 41 of the tender book blank copy f the page has been glued on top of the original page the original page had writing on it relating to quotation relating to some additional work for the cuc and the parties involved were manyee and john fox terry lau stated that the quotes were too expensive and so they were asked to quote again 383 terry lau claimed that the page was stuck on top due to the fact that the work should have cost c5000 where only 2 written quotes are required whereas the quotes were in excess of 12000 384 we also understand that on one occasion samuel prem ananth was asked b terry lau to sign the tender book to state that he had witnessed t he opening the documents relating to respective tender when samuel had not actual ly been present 385 we understand that liam bedson senior purchasing officer at novas d expressed concerns about the tender process and procedures not bein g followed and as result will melia asked him to compile report in this regard bdo stoy hayward

the report by liam bedson michael seems interested only in the authorisation under which liam carried out this work 388 it may be worth noting that liam bedson has now left the organisati on and will melia also handed in his notice on 9 september 2008 less than two weeks after the above exchange 389 terry lau advised that there is some leeway of up to 25 above the agreed figure which he is able to

instructe d to make payments in respect of the cuc as and when they were request ed by certain specified individuals these would appear to be stuart ball erwina ghafar madhu gajjar tony graham and

pike gnosoullas response was that she was ware of this and was waiting for the opportunity to deal with it when we int erviewed soulla she denied this exchange had taken place gnosoulla said that mic hael was not bully but proceeded to caveat this by saying that alt hough he did not shout at people he could probably do with mentor when we interviewed maria she was fairly open in responding to most questions but refused to satisfactorily answer the question on whether she was bullied b michael an examination of emails shows that maria donaghuemills tells michael that she feels threatened and will melia states i feel bullied lack of financial expertise on the board 3112 it appears that the board itself recognised that they are l acking in experience in certain areas specifically they recognised the need to hav board member who possesses financial expertise 3113 despite first being raised as an action point and potential are of weakness in march 2007 it can be seen that this issue has not been addressed 3114 it is clear that there are number of areas where the board should have been more robust on certain decisions for example i the decisionspeed to acquire scarman ii resisting the sale of arlington house in march 2008 but acquiescing in its disposal one month later without reviewing adequate financial information iii michael wakes allowance re living in liverpool and iv the art scheme that only benefited michael bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 264 conclusions 41 financial viability of novas short term viability 411 novas runs the imminent risk of being insolvent it has number of creditors who have threatenedstarted legal action and it appears that novas cannot pay its debts as they fall due novas had 3 million overdraft fac ility that expired on 31 october 2008 there was plan b if large vat refund which was credited to the novas bank account on 31 october 2008 had not arrived novas is still producing inadequate and optimistic cash flow projecti ons although novas bankers have made some encouraging noises there are still serious concerns about how they can meet their ongoing obligations 412 it may be the case that if novas manage to sell properties in the next quarter then they may remain viable through this period however these prope rties will have to be sold at severely discount prices for example the acquisition and refurbishment costs of the alima centre were over 26 million and we believe they will struggle to sell this asset for more than 500000 it d reserve price of 750000 at an auction held on 4 december 2008 but it did not attract any bids the auction appeared to be for the sale of repossessed and sub standard housing and the prices for other lots were far below the r eserve price set for the alima centre we would question whether this was the best way in which to attempt sale of this property 413 the reason for the loss in value in assets cannot be purely blamed n the current economic conditions property prices have fallen dramatica lly but as in the case of the alima centre they have not fallen by 71 on of the reasons the alima centre has fallen in price is that it was spec ulative decision to build an arts centre at the edge of the baltic triangle re generation area in liverpool this regeneration has now halted the attractiveness of this property has also been affected by the decision to remove the car parking facilities and replace these with chinese theatre which has had limited if any use bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 27414 indeed the liverpool cuc which has cost 17 million has the same car parking issues novas is to be congratulated on building facility for disadva ntaged groups in deprived areas they must however be aware of the requirement to provide secure parking facilities if they are going to attract the cross subsidisation effect they require from more affluent visitors to their centre medium term viability 415 it is apparent that novas will only survive in the medium term b disposing of unencumbered properties noone can predict how long the present rece ssion will last and it is unclear whether novas will be able to gene rate significant funds from these disposals unless it makes decision to dispose of t he liverpool cuc long term viability 416 it would appear that even if novas disposed of their unencumbered proper ties it is unlikely that the revenue from their social enterprise ctivities can cover their costs and under the current business model the present direction of novas does not look viable bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 2842 arlington house 421 it would appear that there was legal contract between clg cam den and novas that committed novas to completing arlington house using the funds provided from the sale of hostels to st mungos and the clg grant h owever there are correspondence emails and representations made by nov as smt that until very recently committed them to completing arlington house 422 it is extremely unlikely that the housing corporation would have ag reed to the hostel sales to st mungos if the proceeds were not for arling ton house the section 9 notices signed by novas employee state that the proceeds were for arlington house and social enterprise 423 it is now accepted that arlington house cannot be completed by novas be cause even if they were to raise loans on their unencumbered properties t hey do not have the cash flow to cover the interest on those loans novas rema ining hope is that one housing group will complete this project negotiations with one housing appear to have stalled and we believe that one housing grou p are asking for further 3m andor the transfer of the dean stree t hostel it must now be questionable whether the one housing transaction will take place 424 maria donoghuemills now accepts that 10 million is needed to complet arlington house and that novas will not be able to raise this amount f rom their bankers who in her view will probably only sanction loan of 2 million t 3 million what is of great concern is that neither matthew brown michael wake maria donoghuemills nor gnosoulla tsioupralewis have at thei r finger tips the cost to complete arlington house what we do know is that over the time period of the arlington house project novas have buil t the north west cuc in liverpool at cost of approximately 17 million 425 although the proceeds of the hostel property sales to st mungos did not directly go straight from st mungos to the liverpool cuc it i s accepted by maria and gnosoulla that the funds went to the central novas pot and funds were paid out of that pot in respect of liverpool cuc at this the reserves of novas were approximately 8 million therefore even if the tot reserves bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 29went into liverpool cuc and taking into account the north west development grant of 3 million it is still clear that approximately 6 mill ion of the proceeds of the hostel sales to st mungos went into the cuc in liverpool 23 million of v at has been refunded but novas would have had to pay these funds out in the first place from some source before they could be reclaimed 426 although social enterprise is to be commended it is not clear whet her the funders of arlington house clg and the funders of the hostels disposal predominately the clg and the housing corporation would have agreed to funds previously identified to improve the provision for homeless people i n london ending up in social enterprise centre in liverpool unlike arlington house and dean street cuc liverpool does not have any bed provision but has malaysian restaurant theatre number of art galleries further separate restaurant coffee shop and conference facilit ies such as meeting rooms 427 it is clear that novas would argue that these facilities gen erate revenue although we understand that profit or surplus has been generated by liverpool cuc and that revenue can go back into novas to benefit nants and disadvantaged groups however we would argue that as novas moves away from bed provision for the homeless and into social enterprise novas shoul d have made this clear to funding providers they should not have used funds that were earmarked for the homeless in london 428 with some justification novas could argue that they owned the hostels sold to st mungos and therefore they could do with those proceeds as they wi shed however it is clear that without the representations they made t odpmclg the funders would not have agreed to put 12 million of tax payers money i nto an unfinished project ie arlington house further to that in order to get arlington house finished it is clear that either the project will be diluted or b that an acquiring rsl will requirerequest an input of fur ther substantial grant from funding providers bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 30429 the reason why novas can longer fulfil their obligations is bec ause they have not managed their finances correctly novas would argue tha t this is due to the recent fall in the property market and also that it is the fault of inadequate staff in their finance department it is true that ec onomic events over the recent three or four months make it very difficult for novas t dispose of some of their unencumbered properties however from the away day in march 2008 if not before and the board meeting in april 2008 it was clear that arlington house had to be disposed of or substantial loans obtained in order for novas to survive 4210 even at that late stage there are still things that could have been done ie for example loans secured on the liverpool cuc that could have led to arli ngton house being completed unfortunately that window appears to have passed 4211 with regards to blaming present and former finance employees we find this disingenuous there were many basic fundamental errors for example not having satisfactory business plan for 17 million project such as the liverpool cuc the responsibility of this must lie at the cochief executive level and cannot be blamed on individuals that process payments and provide financial reports to senior management this is the case even if the individuals appear to get bit uppity when their jobs are at risk 4212 there appears to be culture that whenever anybody in the financ team raised difficult and challenging questions about the financial circumstanc of novas those raising the issues were portrayed as being difficult not seeing the bigger picture or even racist some of the staff that have raised i ssues about expenditure cash flow etc are now being faced with redundancy we ar still not clear whether these redundancies are warranted or whether t hese are vindictive actions by senior management at novas for example it was very damming that when one of the management accountants paul byrne r aises an concern over the extremely poor due diligence report produced prior to the acquisition of the scarman trust the cochief executives immedia response was paul needs to go bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 314213 there are number of decisions that we as inquirers fail to how they benefit the homeless for example the decision to charge novas rchitects out at market rate rather than at cost half way through the arl ington house project has meant that there is less money available for beds or social enterprise activities at arlington house novas would argue that these funds are still in novas and are supporting social enterprise activi ties in liverpool from what we are seeing these activities support small group of people and not cross section of the homelessnessdeprived communities for ex ample in liverpool we would expect to see the liverpool cuc catering for t he needs of large cantonese west indian or refugee communities however lot of time has been spent on the malaysian community 4214 our information is that the malaysian community of liverpool is s mall compared to other ethnic communities eg the afro caribbean population in liverpool lot of decisions seem to have been made according to the whims or ethnicity of novas employees rather than the requirements of t heir local constituents group structure 4215 novas smt would argue that they have arrived at their present ci rcumstances because i there was fall in the property market ii their regulator that does not understand their business iii there were poor quality previous finance employees and mutinous present finance staff and iv some elements of institutionalised racism 4216 we would argue that the reasons are much simpler than that the st ructure of novas is unsound it did not have enough financial acumen at senior level and it was inadequately supervised by its board novas two chief xecutive officers are maria donoghuemills and michael wake although thi s is bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 32unusual this arrangement could probably still work if there was cl ear delineation of duties ie all aspects of novas were properly managed by c hief executive who had the right skills to manage that part of novas 4217 what appears to have happened is that maria donoghuemills was respon sible for operational and financial issues michael wake was responsible for visionary social enterprise and cultural activities so something like the liverpool cuc which cost 17 million was classified as social ente rprise and was managed by michael who did not possess the required financial management skills further the situation has arisen where michae l has set up his own parallel finance function within the liverpool cuc for exampl he has finance officer who reports into tara muthoora with tara t hen reporting directly to michael bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 3343 allegations of financial mismanagement 431 tara muthoora was recently brought into the organisation as consult ant and there are number of issues surrounding this for example she was made redundant from her position of director of regeneration receiving redundancy package of c30000 and was rerecruited as consultant with the same title of director of regeneration there are also issue s about michael having relationship with tara in the past and the lack of clarity about the way she came back into the organisation 432 it is inappropriate that an organisation can have capital projec t like liverpool cuc which is outside the normal finance function without an effective business plan michael wake says tara was rerecruited to amon gst other things to produce an effective business plan we find it unusual that n effective business plan is produced after 17 million building has be completed 433 erwina aghafar was recruited for the architects department nd later became director of the organisation with responsibility for art erwina spent considerable time travelling to malaysia three times in ei ghteen months to purchase asian art during interview we asked erwina why novas could not purchase ethnic art eg malaysian art from malaysians within the uk we were told that their art had been adulterated 434 when we asked for details of erwinas qualificationsexperiences she said she had studied art as part of her baccalaureate ie during her secondar education on one of her trips to malaysia erwina said she went to buy thai filipino indonesian and malaysian art it was telling that she could not gi ve us the name of any thai filipino or indonesian artists during our interview with her 435 during interview erwina denied having an affair with michael wa ke who accompanied her on trips to malaysia and michael wake initially denied this too until eventually he admitted it bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 34436 also michael said that this relationship and the potential conflict of interest it caused was signed off by john humble vice chair on the novas boar d john humble is previous tenant of arlington house john is adamant that michael never divulged this relationship to him and stated in the int erview that until our interview he did not know that michael was having relations hip with erwina 437 john humble describes michael as his mentor for over 20 years it i s quite obvious that his relationship with michael is not one of equals theref ore it is clearly inappropriate that he was the board member michael ask ed to sign off his expenses including the malaysian trip john has stated to us t hat he did not check michaels expenses we are also aware from speaking to the chair that she became aware that john signed michaels expenses in our view as chair she should have been questioning who was approving michaels expenses much earlier 438 in terms of greater issues of board supervision as stated earli er the chair did not know the exact costs to complete arlington house she also had complaint from matthew pike who said he was going to make public i nterest disclosure part of this complaint was that there were managem ent issues in that michael wake systematically bullied maria donoghuemill s matthew alleges that when he told the gnosoulla this she responded by stating that she was waiting for the opportunity to deal with it gnosoulla denies thi s when we asked maria donoghuemills directly whether or not she was bull ied by michael she refused to clearly answer that question although she was quite open on other issues 439 as inquirers we would not normally be interested in who has had relat ionships with whom however we also discovered that michael has had relat ionship with maria in the past there is obviously the possibility that as well as fundamental structural weakness the areas of social enterprise that did not get sufficient oversight the dynamics between michael and maria have led to her not being able to challenge him sufficiently the chair tells us that maria bdo stoy hayward executive summary 15 december 2008 private confidential 35would often confide in her but that she could stand her corner we have not seen much evidence of this 4310 it is also concern that an agreement was made by the cha ir and others on the remuneration committee to give michael an allowance so that he coul d purchase property in liverpool in the current economic climate t hat property has probably fallen in value but over the last twenty years that decision would normally have led to an increase in property value fo r the individual rather than the organisation at one point we know that it was raised that novas would buy the property and that subsequently it was decided t hat michael be given an allowance so that he could buy property soul stated that the reason for this was that they thought they might have p roblems disposing of the property without sign off by the regulator 4311 it is also concern that manyee chinese building supplier to the liverpool cuc the alima centre and the dragon theatre had family connections to the novas architect terry lau who was in charge of that project 4312 in conclusion we believe novas is poorly managed it was poorly govern ed by board that did not have enough financial expertise and also did not sufficiently challenge dominant individual like michael wake in our opinion novas is an at risk organisation 4313 in our opinion the senior management team of michael wake maria donoghuemills terry lau matthew brown matthew pike mary connolly and erwina aghafar have collectively mismanaged the business 4314 the actions of michael wake maria donoghuemills and terry u may additionally in our opinion be regarded as misconduct
