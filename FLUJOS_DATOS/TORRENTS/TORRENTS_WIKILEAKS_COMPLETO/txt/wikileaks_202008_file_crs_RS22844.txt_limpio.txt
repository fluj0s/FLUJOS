wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22844 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs22844 capital punishment constitutionality for nonhomicide crimes such as child rape alison m smith american law division march 21 2008 abstract the united states has not executed any individual for committing nonhomicide crime since the united states reinstated the death penalty in 1976 however this may change as several federal and state statutes authorize capital punishment for certain nonhomicide offenses such as treason espionage aircraft piracy aggravated kidnapping and drug trafficking in large quantities more recently some states have authorized the death penalty for some instances of child rape the constitutionality of these statutes has been called into question in light of the us supreme courts capital penalty jurisprudence earlier supreme court cases appear to stand for the proposition that the death penalty in the united states is largely restricted to crimes in which the defendant caused the death of another human being during the present term the court may determine whether states may constitutionally impose the death penalty for any crime other than murder in particular whether death sentence is disproportionate penalty under the eighth amendment for raping child the court will address these issues in its review of louisiana supreme court decision in kennedy v louisiana order code rs22844 updated june 27 2008 capital punishment constitutionality for nonhomicide crimes such as child rape alison m smith legislative attorney american law division summary in kennedy v louisiana the united states supreme court by vote of 5 to 4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22844 held that the 8th amendment prohibits the death penalty for the rape of child where the crime did not result and was not intended to result in the victims death the court established brightline rule regarding the constitutionality of imposing capital punishment for nonhomicide crime against an individual after reviewing the history of the death penalty for other nonhomicide crimes against individuals state legislative enactments and jury practices since 1964 the court concluded that there was national consensus against the imposition of capital punishment for the crime of child rape based on precedent as well as other subjective factors the court concluded that the death penalty is disproportionate punishment for such crime the immediate effect of this decision is to invalidate statutes authorizing the death penalty for nonhomicide cases of child rape legal background the 8th amendment applicable to the federal government and to the states through the 14th amendment bars the use of excessive sanctions in the criminal justice system it states specifically that excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted1 underlying this provision is the fundamental precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to the offense2 the us supreme court has stated that only the worst of the worst may be executed for their crimes3 however the court has provided minimal guidance for the worst of the worst category of offenders andor 1 us const amend viii 2 weems v united states 217 us 349 367 1910 holding that the 8th amendments cruel and unusual clause requires that punishment for crime be proportional to its severity 3 see roper v simmons 543 us 551 568 2005 stating that capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit narrow category of the most serious crime and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution quoting atkins v virginia 536 us 304 319 2002 crs2 offenses the court has held that the death penalty is disproportionate and therefore unconstitutional punishment for some nonhomicide crimes4 in more recent cases the court reinforced and refined its proportionality analysis utilizing an evolving standards of decency standard using this standard the court found that the imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded is unconstitutional5 in coker v georgia6 the court held that the state may not impose death sentence upon rapist who does not take human life7 the court announced that the standard under the 8th amendment was that punishments are barred when they are excessive in relation to the crime committed punishment is excessive and unconstitutional if it 1 makes measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment and hence is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering or 2 is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime8 according to the court to ensure that applying these standards not be or appear to be the subjective conclusion of individual justices attention must be given to objective factors predominantly to the public attitudes concerning particular sentence history and precedent legislative attitudes and the response of juries reflected in their sentencing decisions9 while the court thought that the death penalty for rape passed the first test it felt it failed the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22844 second georgia was the sole state providing for death for the rape of an adult woman and juries in at least nine out of 10 cases refused to impose death for rape aside from this view of public perception the court independently concluded that death is an excessive penalty for an offender who rapes but does not kill stating that rape cannot compare with murder in terms of moral depravity and of injury to the person and the public10 although the court in coker did not explicitly hold the death penalty unconstitutional for all crimes not involving homicide11 many have read the decision as such since the court based its holding largely on the distinction between crimes that cause death and crimes 4 see eg coker v georgia 433 us 584 1977 5 roper v simmons 543 us 551 568 2005 atkins v virginia 536 us 304 319 2002 6 433 us 584 1977 7 although the court stated the issue in the context of the rape of an adult woman the opinion at point sought to distinguish between adults and children justice powells concurrence expressed the view that death is ordinarily disproportionate for the rape of an adult woman but that some rapes might be so brutal or heinous as to justify it id at 601 8 id at 592 9 id 10 id at 598 11 see coker 433 us at 600 plurality opinion stating that in georgia person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought either express or implied causes the death of another human being he also commits the crime when in the commission of felony he causes the death of another human being irrespective of malice but even where the killing is deliberate it is not punishable by death absent proof of aggravating circumstances it is difficult to accept the notion and we do not that the rapist with or without aggravating circumstances should be punished more heavily than the deliberate killer as long as the rapist does not himself take the life of his victim crs3 that do not12 the court reasoned that because the crime of rape does not result in death punishing rape by death would be unconstitutionally excessive13 the court utilized the same type of proportionality analysis in enmund v florida14 by applying its reasoning from coker to hold that the death penalty is disproportionate punishment for the crime of felonymurder15 imposed on the getaway driver in robbery gone wrong because robbery like rape does not compare with murder which does involve the unjustified taking of human life16 the court stated that as was said of the crime of rape in coker we have the abiding conviction that the death penalty which is unique in its severity and irrevocability is an excessive penalty for the robber who as such does not take human life17 thus the court seemed to say that for crime to be proportional to the punishment of death the crime committed must cause death since coker and enmund the court has refined its proportionality analysis first articulated in weems v united states18 to determine which punishments are unconstitutionally excessive in weems the court explained that the cruel and unusual punishment clause is progressive and is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by humane justice19 as such in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22844 determining what is constitutional under the 8th amendment the court generally looks to evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of maturing society20 the evolving standards of decency principle appears to be flexible rule of construction intended to evolve with societal norms as they develop so that the court may reflect these norms in its constitutionality review this principle now appears to be the primary framework within which the court reviews constitutional claims challenging the application of the death penalty the court employed this framework in both atkins v virginia21 and roper v simmons22 cases that narrowed the category of offenders eligible for capital punishment to exclude the mentally retarded and juvenile offenders the courts methodology in deciding these cases had different focus from its prior jurisprudence regarding the constitutionality of capital statutes in both roper and atkins the court examined objective indicia of national consensus to determine whether the 12 see eg annaliese flynn fleming comment louisianas

circumstances in atkins and roper the court employed threepart analysis to determine whether under evolving standards of decency imposing the death penalty would have been so disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual under the 8th amendment in both cases the court first looked for national consensus as evidenced by the acts of the state legislatures23 the court then assessed the proportionality of the punishment to the relevant crimes considering whether the death penalty was being limited as required to the most serious classes of crimes and offenders and whether its application would serve the goals of retribution and deterrence24 lastly the court looked to international opinion to inform its analysis25 state supreme court decision on may 22 2007 in louisiana v kennedy26 the louisiana supreme court held that the us supreme courts decision in coker prohibiting the death penalty does not apply when the victim is child under the age of 12 the defendant was convicted and sentenced to death for the aggravated rape of his 8yearold stepdaughter the louisiana court explained that capital sentences for rape of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22844 child were justifiable under the 8th amendment in reaching its conclusion the court followed the 8th amendment framework set forth by the us supreme court in atkins v virginia27 and roper v simmons28 first examining whether there is national consensus on the punishment and then considering whether the court would find the punishment excessive the louisiana court determined that because five states had adopted similar laws in the past decade the national trend was toward capital punishment for child rape moreover the court held that because children are uniquely vulnerable permitting the death penalty for child rape is not unduly harsh and is proportionate to the crime on january 4 2008 the us supreme court announced that it would examine the constitutionality of permitting the execution of child molester who did not kill his victim29 united states supreme court decision in kennedy v louisiana30 divided court held by vote of 5 to 4 that capital punishment for defendant convicted of nonhomicide child rape is unconstitutional writing for the majority31 justice kennedy stated that such punishment would be excessive violating the 8th amendments ban on 23 see 543 us at 60911 536 us at 34348 24 see 543 us at

consisted of justices kennedy breyer ginsburg souter and stevens crs5 cruel and unusual punishment following the standard set forth in atkins and roper the court rested its decision on several rationales first there is national consensus against the imposition of the death penalty for child rape second evolving standards of decency require that the categories of capital offenses not be expanded but rather be reserved for the most heinous crimes lastly imposition of capital punishment for the nonhomicide crime of child rape does not fulfill the death penaltys social purposes of retribution and deterrence in determining objective indicia of national consensus regarding capital punishment for nonhomicide child rape the court looked at legislative enactments and state practices with respect to executions32 the court noted that while six states have made child rape capital offense 44 states and the federal government had not according to the court the relatively small number of states which make child rape capital offense is analogous to the activity in enmund where the court found national consensus against the death penalty for felonymurder despite eight jurisdictions allowing capital punishment33 in addition the court noted that louisiana was the only state since 1964 to sentence defendant to death for child rape34 the court rejected louisianas contention that the coker decision itself deterred states from adopting capital child rape statutes and thereby httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22844 influenced the courts view of developing national consensus the court explained that several state courts recognized that cokers holding was limited to the crime of rape against an adult woman and did not expressly prohibit imposition of capital punishment for child rape moreover the court noted that the state failed to cite any reliable data to support its assertion35 the court also concluded that the absence of executions for rape or any other nonhomicide crime since 1964 demonstrated that there is national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape36 as such the court determined that viewed in its totality the limited number of states authorizing the death penalty for child rape as well as the absence of executions for rape or any other non homicide crime since 1964 demonstrates national consensus against capital punishment for child rape after looking at objective evidence of national consensus the court moved to subjective analysis while the court acknowledged that rape is heinous crime causing traumatic and longlasting anguish which is exacerbated when the victim is child it does not follow though that capital punishment is proportionate penalty for the crime the court reasoned that the evolving standards of decency require restraint in the application of capital punishment as such capital punishment should be reserved for narrow category of crimes andor offenses the court acknowledged the reprehensibility of the crime of rape however the court reasoned that child rape cannot be compared to murder in terms of severity and irrevocability37 32 2008 wl 2511282 at 11 33 id at 17 34 id at 18 35 id at 14 36 id at 18 37 id at 21 crs6 the majority found that imposition of the death penalty for nonhomicide child rape would be counterproductive to the goals of rehabilitation deterrence and retribution as for retribution the court questioned whether the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes balances the wrong done to the victim the court concluded that there was evidence that child rape victims hurt would be diminished when the law allows capital punishment for the perpetrator instead it reasoned that it is likely there would be additional harm as minors would be forced to endure the stressors of reliving the traumatic events repeatedly in addition the court noted systematic concerns in prosecuting child rape cases including the problem of unreliable induced and even imagined child testimony that may lead to wrongful execution in some cases38 the majority felt that allowing capital punishment for the crime of child rape had additional negative implications that are counterproductive to the goal of deterrence for example victims may be more likely to shield the perpetrator from discovery thus increasing underreporting39 in addition punishing child rape with death may remove strong incentive for the rapist to spare the victims life40 in its analysis the court distinguished child rape from other deatheligible crimes because it is crime against an individual person it ruled that the death penalty should httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22844 not be permitted when the victims life was not taken however the court did not address and consequently left open the possibility of imposing the death penalty for non homicide crimes against the state such as treason espionage terrorism and drug kingpin activity41 justice alito writing for the dissent42 expressed the view that the majoritys decision conflicts with the original meaning of the 8th amendment and ignores the moral depravity of the crime in addition he felt that the small number of states which enacted child rape statutes was not based on national consensus against execution of child rapists but rather on the broad dicta presented in coker also he felt that the 8th amendment protects an accuseds right and does not authorize the majority to strike down criminal laws on the ground that they are not in the best interest of crime victims or society at large 38 id at 24 39 id at 25 40 id stating that assuming the offender behaves in rational way as one must to justify the penalty on grounds of deterrence the penalty in some respects gives less protection not more to the victim who is often the sole witness to the crime 41 id at 20 42 joined by chief justice roberts and justices scalia and thomas
