political instab ility and economic dislocation to countries where narco tics production has become trenched economically and socially drug supply interdiction progra ms and us systems to facilitate the international movement of goods people and wealth are often at odds us international narco tics policy requires cooperative efforts by many nations that may have domestic and foreign policy goals

which currently accounts for about 645 of the federal antidrug control budget is sought by programs aimed at destabilizing the operations of illicit drug cartels at all levels and severing their links

office argues for the development of bette r counterdrug performance measures by government agencies and warns that the commitment of military assets to iraq and afghanistan is likely to hamper the ability of us law enforcement to intercept drug shipments in the future7 proponents of strong drug interdiction polic ies have long been concerned that the nations focus on antiterror objectives will detract from resources and political will needed to combat foreign illicit drug production and trafficking major challenge facing the counte rdrug law enforcement and intelligence community is how best to target criminal facilitators who may be working both for drug organizations and terrorist groups as links between terrorist organizations and criminal groups appear to be growing phenomenon

international coopera tion by use of diplomatic initiatives both bilateral and multilateral the department of state encourages and assists nations to reduce cultivation production and trafficking in illic it drugs these bilateral agreements and international conventions have been seen thus fa r as largely ineffective in reversing the growth of international narcotics trafficking in part because they lack strong enforcement mechanisms and ar not uniformly interpreted by member nations us international narco tics control strategy also requires cooperation among governments to coordinate their border operations to interdict traffickers to this end the us government has provided t echnical assistance for antidrug programs in other countries for fy2006 the state departments international

assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs6 policy approaches overview the primary goal of us international narcotics control policy is to stem the flow of foreign drugs into the united st ates number of approaches have been proposed to reshape us international narcotics control po licy and implement it more effectively it is estimated that the illicit drug trade generates as much as half of the approximately 750 billi on in ille gal funds laundered inte rnationally each year policymakers face the challenge of deciding the appropriate level of funding required for the nations international narcotics control efforts within the context of competing budgetary priorities another challenge facing the us inte rnational drug cont rol efforts concerns how to implement policy most effectively some observers argue that current us policy is fragmented and overly bilateral in nature these analysts suggest that to achieve success policy options must be pursued within the context of comprehensive plan with multilateral emphasis on implementation for example they point out that some studies indicate that interdiction can actually increase the economic rewards to drug traffickers by raising prices for the products they sell they agree however that interdiction as pa rt of coordinated plan can have strong disrupting and destabilizing effect on trafficker operations some analysts suggest that bilateral or unilateral us policies are illsuited for solving what is in effect multilateral problem they cite the need for enhancing the united nations ability to deal effectively with the narcotics problem and for more international and regional cooperation and consultati on on international narco tics issues proponents of bilateral policy do not necessarily reject more multilateral approach they point out however that such multinational endeavors are intrinsically difficult to arrange coordinate and imple ment effectively four major approaches to reduce demand for illicit drugs and the foreign source supply of illicit drugs to the ited states are set out below expansion of efforts to reduce production at the source this option involves expanding efforts to reduce the volume of narcotic plants and crops produced in foreign countries be fore the crops conversion into processed drugs illicit crops may either be eradicated or purchased or seized and then destroyed eradication of illicit crops may be accomplis hed by physically uprooting the plants or by chemical or biological control agents development of alternative sources of income to replace peasant inco lost by nonproducti on of narcotic crops may be an important element of this option proponents of expanded efforts to stop the production of illicit drug crops and substances at the source believe that reduction of the foreign supply of drugs available is an effective means to lower levels of drug use in the united states they argue that reduction of the supply of co caine arguably the nations top drug control priority is realistically achievable optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs7 proponents of vastly expanded supply reduction options and specifically of herbicidal crop eradication argue that th is method is the most costeffective and efficient means of elimina ting illicit drug producing crops they maintain that coupled with intensified law enforcemen t such programs will succeed since it is easier to locate and destroy crops in the field than to locate subsequently processed drugs on smuggling routes or on the streets of us cities put differently kilogram of cocaine hydrochloride is far more diffi cult to detect than the 300 to 500 kilograms of coca leaf that are required to make that same kilogram also because crops constitute the cheapest link in the narc otics chain producers will devote fewer economic resources to prevent their detecti on than to concealing more expensive and refined forms of the product in addition eradication successes have been recorded in individual countries such as in colombia for the period 20042005 opponents of expanded s upply reduc tion policy generally question whether reduction of the foreign suppl of narcotic drugs is ach ievable and whether it would have meaningful impact on levels of illicit drug use in the united states they argue that aerial spraying in colombia has failed to contain the spread of coca cultivation and point to drug syndicates moving into opium poppy cultivation in colombia and more recently peru total andean cultivation has remained relatively stable in the past decade despite us efforts and because farmers are finding ways to increase productivity per unit of land according to state department figures critics also suggest that even if the supply of foreign drugs destined for the us market could be dramatically reduced us consumers would simply switch to consumption of domesticallygrown andor synthetic drug substitutes thus they maintain the ultimate solution to the us drug problem is wiping out the domestic market for illicit drugs not trying to eliminate the supply in source countries some also fear that environmental damage will result from herbicides as an alternative they urge development res earch and funding of programs designed to develop and employ biological control agents such as cocadestroying insects and fungi that do not harm other plants others argue that intensified eradication will push the drug crop frontier nd the attendant polluting eff ects of narcotics industries farther into ecologically sensitive jungle areas with little or decrease in net cultivation in addition repor ts have surfaced in colombia of toxic effects of herbicides on legal crops and on the hea lth of animals and humans although the veracity of such accounts is debated others question whether global po licy of simultaneous crop control is politically feasible since many areas in th world will always be beyond us control and influence such critics refer to tinuously shifting sources of supply or the socalled balloon effect when squeezed in one place it pops up in another nevertheless many point out that the number of large suitable growth areas is finite and by focusing simultaneously on majo r production areas subs tantial reductions can be achieved if adequate funding is provided some also question the value of s upply reduction measur since world production and supply of illic it drugs vastly exceeds world demand making it unlikely that the supply surplus could be reduced sufficiently to affect the ready availability of illicit narcotics in the us market such analysts also suggest that even if worldwide supply were reduced dramatically the effects would be felthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs8 9 see jerry seper mexican cops in border trade washington times national weekly edition sept 30oct 6 2002primarily in other nations drug markets the us market they argue would be the last to experience supply shortfalls because us consumers pay higher prices and because us dollars are preferred narcocurrency political and economic tradeoffs some suggest that expanded and effective efforts to reduce production of illicit na rcotics at the source will be met by active and violent opposition from combin ation of trafficker political and economic groups in some nations such as colombia traffickers have achieved status comparable to state within state in others allegations of drugrelated corruption have focused on highlevel officials in the military and federal police as well as heads of state in mexico according to washington times report smugglers often are protected by heav ilyarmed mexican military troops and police who have been paid handsomely to escort the drug traffickers and their illicit shipments across the border and into the united states9 in addition some traffickers have aligned themselves with terrorist and insurgent groups and have reportedly funded political candi dates and parties pronarcotic peasant workers and trade union groups and high visibility popular public works projects to cultivate public support through robin hood image because some constituencies that benefit economically from coca are well armed if the united states were successful in urging foreign governments to institute widespread use of chemicalbiological control agents cooperating host govern ments could well face strong domestic political challenge and violent oppos ition from affected gr oups heavy military protection at minimum might be requi red for those spraying or otherwise eradicating drug crops some critics have argued that an important tradeoff with respect to colombia is that eradication campaigns can have the unintended effect of aggravating the countrys ongoing civil conflict since co lombias guerrilla groups pose as advocates of growers spraying may broaden support for such groups thereby contradicting the objectives of the governments counterinsurgen cy efforts in the affected zones these observers believe that colombias enforcement priorities should shift to targeting critical nodes in transportation and refining and to the extent possible sealing off traffic routes to and from the main coca pr oducing zones the argument is made that interdiction can disrupt internal markets for coca derivatives and that compared to eradication it imposes fewer direct costs on peasant producers and generates less political unrest for some countries producti on of illicit narco tics and the narcotics trade have become an economic way of life that provides subsistence level of income to large numbers of people from whom those who rule draw their legitimacy crop reduction campaigns seek to displace such income and those workers engaged in its production in this regard these campaigns may threaten real economic and political dangers for the governments of nations with margin economic growth consequently some analysts argue that the governments of ch lowincome countri cannot be expected to launch major crop reduction programs without the substitute income to sustain those whose income depends on drug productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs9 use of sanctions or positive incentives those promoting expansion of efforts to reduce production at the source face the challenge of instituting programs that effectively reduce pr oducti on of narcotic crops and production of refined narcotics without creating unmanageable economic and political crises for target countries major area of concern of such policymakers is to achieve an effective balance between the carrot and the stick approach in us relations with major illicit narcoticspr oducing and transit countries proponents of sanctions po licy linking foreign aid nd trade benefits to us international narcotic s objectives argue against busin ess as usual with countries that permit illicit drug traffi cking production or laundering of drug profits they assert that this policy includes moral dimension and that drug production and trafficking is wrong and that the united states should not asso ciate with countries involved in it such analysts maintain th at us aid and trade sanctions can provide the needed leverage for nations to reduce production of illic it crops and their involvement in other drug re lated activities they argue that both the moral stigma of being branded as uncoope rative and the threat of economic sanctions prod many otherwise uncooperative nations into action they further stress that trade sanctions would be likely to provide highly eff ective lever as most developing countries depend on access to us markets opponents of sanctions policy linking aid and trade to us international narcotics objectives argue th at sanctions may have an undesirable effect on the political and economic stability of target countries making them all the more dependent on the drug trade for income that sanctions have little impact because many countries are not dependent on us ai d that sanctions hi storically have little effect unless they are multilaterally imposed and that sanctions are arbitrary in nature hurt national pride in the foreign country and are seen in many countries as an ugly manifestation of yankee imperialism finally an increasing number of analysts suggest that if sanctions are to be fully effective they should be used in conjunction with additional positive incentives subject perhaps to an expanded certificationapproval pr ocess to foster antidrug cooperation alternatively some suggest positive incentives instead of sanctions they believe that illicit drug producing countries must be mo tivated either to refrain from growing illicit crops or to permit the purchase or destruction of these crops by government authorities ma ny argue that since short term economic stability of nations supplying illegal drugs may depend upon the production nd sale of illicit substances it is unrealistic to expect such nations to limit their drugrelated activities meaningfully without an alternative source of income it has been suggested by some analysts that massive foreign aid effort socalled minimars hall plan is the only f easible method of persuading developing nations to curb their producti on of illicit drugs such plan would involve multilateral effort with the participation of the united states europe japan australia other industria lized nations susceptible to the drug problem and the rich oil producing nations the thrust of such plan would be to promote economic development replacing illicit cash crops with other marketable alternatives within the framework of such plan crops c ould be purchased or else destroyed byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs10 herbicidal spraying or biological control agents while substitute crops and markets are developed and assured in this view any such program woul d be coupled with rigid domestic law enforcement and penalties for noncomplia nce thus it could require us commitment of substantially increased enforcement assets to be used against both growers and traffickers and some observe rs assert it might require direct us military involvement at the request of the host country significant coercion might be required since drug crops typically produce better cash flow than licit crops grown in the same region for example in afghanistan hectare of opium might earn 30 to 45 times as much as hectar of wheat at prevailing prices 13000 compared to 300 to 400 even if the international community bought up the entire afghan opium crop the temptation to plant new opium could prove irresistible to farmers critics have concerns regarding positive incentive concepts they warn of the precedent of appearing to pay protecti on compensation that is providing an incentive for economically disadvantaged c ountries to go into the drug export business they also warn of the open ended cost of agricultural development programs and of extraterritorial police intervention finding markets for viable alternative crops is yet another major constraint some experts argue that typical conditions of drug crop zones such as ge ographical remoteness marginal soils and in certain countries extreme insecurity tend to limit prospects for legal commercial agriculture according to one report the soils in colombias putumayo department an important center of coca cultivation are simply too poor to support the number of people currently farming in the province if all converted to growing legal crops such observers believe that more promising strategy is to foster development of the legal economy in other locales including ur ban settings in orde r to attract people away from areas that have comparative advantage in coca or opium production in the view of these analysts the best substitute crop for coca or opium could well be an assembly plant producing electronic goods or automobiles for the international market expansion of interdiction and enforcement activities to disrupt supply linesexpanding the role of the military drug supply line interdiction is both fo reign and domestic issue many argue that the united states should intensify w enforcement activities designed to disrupt the transit of illicit na rcotics as early in the productiontransit chain as possible well before the drugs reach the streets of the united states this task is conceded to be very difficult because the united states is the worlds greatest trading nation with vast volumes of imports daily flowing in through hundreds of sea air and land entry facilities and its systems have been designed to facilitate human and materials exchange this has led some analysts to suggest that the military should assume more active role in antidrug activities some in congress in the late 1980s nd prior to appropriations for fy1994 had urged an expanded role for the military in the war on drugs the idea of using the military is not novel outside the united states us military personnel have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs11 involved in training and transporting foreign antinarcotic s personnel since 1983 periodically there have also been calls for multilateral military strikes against trafficking operations as well as increased use of us elite forces in preemptive strikes against drug fields and trafficker enclaves overseas the militarys role in narcotics inte rdiction was expanded by the fy19901991 national defense authoriz ation act the conference report hrept 100989 concluded that the departme nt of defense dod can and should play major role in narcotics interdiction congress in fy1989 and fy19901991 authorization acts required dod to promptly provide civilian law enforcement agencies with relevant drugrelated intelligence charged the pres ident to direct that command control communications and intelligence networks dedicated to drug control be integrated by dod into an effective network rest ricted direct participation by military personnel in civilian law enforcement activitie s to those authorized by law permitted the military to transport civilian law enfo rcement personnel outside the us land area and expanded the national guards ro in drug interd iction activities dods requested drug budget total for fy2007 was 9269 million as compared to 9361 million appropriated for fy2006 despite the militarys obvious ability to support drug law enforcement organizations questions remain as to the overall effectiveness of major military role in narcotics interdiction proponents of substantially increasing the militarys role in supporting civilian law enforcement na rcotics interdiction activity argue that narcotics trafficking poses national security threat to the united states that only the military is equipped and s the resources to counter powerful trafficking organizations and that counter drug s upport provides the military with beneficial realistic training in contrast opponents argue that drug in terdiction is law enforcement mission it is not military mission that drug enfo rcement is an unconventional war that the military is illequipped to fight that drug enforcement role detracts from readiness that drug enforcement role exposes the military to corruption that it is unwise public policy to require the us military to operate against us citizens and that the use of the military may have serious political and diplomatic repercussions overseas moreover some in the military remain c oncerned about an expanded role seeing themselves as possible scapegoats for polic ies that have failed or are likely to fail expansion of efforts to reduce worldwide demand another commonly proposed option is to increase policy emphasis on development and implementation of programs worldwide that aim at increasing public intolerance for illicit drug use ch programs through information technical assistance and training in prevention and treatment would emphasize the health dangers of drug use as well as the danger to regional and national stability the state departments office of public diplomacy and pub lic affairs and aid currently support modest efforts in this area some believe these programs should be increased and call for more active role for the united nations and other international agencies in development and imple mentation of such mand reduction programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs12 expansion of economic disi ncentives for illicit drug trafficking proponents of this approach say that the major factor in th international drug market is not the product but the profit thus they stress international efforts to reduce the flow of drugs into the united states must identify means to seize and otherwise reduce assets and profits generated by the drug trade some critics point out the challenges of tracking separating out and confiscating criminal assets these include the huge volume of all international electronic transfers more than 2 trillion each day and the movement of much illegal money outside of formal banking channels such as hawala type chains of money brokers policymakers pursuing this option must d ecide whether laws in countries where they exert influence are too lenient on financial institutions such as banks and brokerage houses that knowingly f acilitate financia l transactions of traffickers if the answer is yes national leaders might th take concerted acti on to promote harsher criminal sanctions penalizing the movement of money generated by drug sales including revocation of licenses of institutions regularly engaging in such practices finally those supporting this option favor increased efforts to secure greater international coope ration on financial inve stigations related to money laundering of narcotics profits including negotiation of mutual legal assistance treaties mlats arguably such an approach would not only assist in combating illicit drugs but also in combating other forms of criminal activity as well as terrorism major policy initiatives three major ongoing policy initiatives th at are prominent components of us international drug control efforts are described below they

strategy the direction of drug policy does not appear to be an immediate top foreign policy priority for the george w bush administration to date pressing concern over issues such as terrorism and hom eland security appear to command more attention this does not mean that internati onal drug policy has been neglected by the administration or given lower priority than by preceding administrations for example in addition to finetuning the na tions annual national dr ug control strategy the administration has crafted and publishe d the nations firstever synthetic drug control strategy 2006 national drug control strategy in february 2006 the white house rel eased its annual national drug control strategy18 central to the international compone nt of the strategy is disrupting the operations of drug traffickers including stroying the economic basis of the cocaine production business in south america by fumigating the coca crop seizing enormoushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs16 19 see us national synthetic drug control strategy focus on methamphetamine and prescription drug abuse 2006 depts of justice health and human services and the office of national drug control policy th nonprescription component of the strategy focuses primarily on methamphetamine and not on other synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and lsdamounts of cocaine from transporters and selectively targeting major drug organization heads for law enforcemen t action and ultimately extradition and prosecution in the united states 2006 synthetic drug strategy on june 1 2006 the bush administration released its synthetic drug control strategy19 central goal of the strategy is to curb the diversion of ephedrine pseudoephedrine and pheny lpropanolamine precursor chemicals commonly used in the production of methamphetamine fro m legitimate pharmaceutical markets into illicit drug production through be tter control of the international market for these precursor chemicals the united nations commission on narcotic drugs is seen as playing central role in implementing the strategy by collecting sharing and analyzing data on the trade in such precursors primary and immediate concern of the strategy is the growing presence of illicit methamphetamine super labs in mexico and the growing control of the us methamphetamine market by mexican drug organizations possible issues relating to policy and strategy implementation possible issues of concern to congress relating to international drug control policy and strategy implementation include the following 1 can plan colombia and the and ean counterdrug initiative as currently envisioned have meaningful impact on reducing drug shipments to the united states and in reducing the current level of violence and instability in colombia to what degree can counterdrug plan which does not aim to deal decisive blow to insurgent operations in colombia be expect ed to meaningfully curb drug production and violence there 2 how does us involvement in antidrug efforts in the andean nations affect other aspects of american foreign polic in the region and in latin america generally does concentration on drug related issues obscu re more fundamental issues of stability governance poverty and democracy ie to what degree are drugs major cause or result of the internal problems of certain latin american countries might us pursuit of drug control objectives conflict in certain ways with efforts to resolve colombias ongoing civil conflict for instance by alienating large rural constituencies in c ontested regions of the country 3 in the case of colombia and other nations where insurgents are heavily involved in the drug trade how can the ited states ensure that us military aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33582crs17 and equipment are in fact used to combat drug traffickers and cartels rather than diverted for use against dom estic political opposition or used as an instrument of human rights violations how great is the risk that such diversions could take place and is the degree of risk worth the possibl gains to be made against drug production and trafficking 4 how extensive is drugrelated corr uption in the armed forces and police of the andean nations what impact might such corruption have on the effectiveness of us training and assistance to these forces 5 will the evolving strategy under the bush administration produce better results than previous strategies in reducing illicit drug use in the united states and in supporting us narcotics and other fo reign policy goals overseas is proper balance of resources being devoted to dom estic the demand side vs foreign the supply side components of an overall nati onal antidrug strategy are efforts to reduce the foreign supply level futile wh ile domestic us mand remains high are efforts to reduce domestic demand fruitless as long as foreign supplies can enter the country with what some see as relative impunity 6 to what extent will the administr ations current priority in fighting terrorism affect implementation of antid rug policy has repositioning of equipment and resources to improve us defenses against acts of terrorism for example the shift of coast guard vessels from the eastern pacific and the caribbean to perform coastal patrols and port secur ity functions lowered defenses with respect to curbing drug flows on the other side of the issue to what degree has committing antidrug resources to support antiterrorism objectiv significantly enhanced or could significantly enhance the effectiven ess of counterterrorism efforts 7 to what extent should us military assistance programs in colombia target groups that use narcotics operations to fina nce terrorist activities including leftist guerrillas and militaries as opposed to the narc otics trafficking infrastructure itself 8 as links between terrorist organizati ons and criminal groups appear to be growing phenomenon how does one effectively use the law enforcement community especially the drug law enforcement community to target criminal facilitators who may be working both for drug organi zations and terrorist groups through what mechanisms does one effectively share targeting information and how does one decide which agencya gencies take action 9 are us counterdrug policy and drug related foreign assistance overfocused on colombia and afghanistan and if s how might policy focus and resource allocation be realigned 10 how do or should antidrug goal s dovetail with antiterrorism goals in afghanistan and what programs there if any are likely to best serve us policy goals for example should the us tinue to press for aer ial crop eradication in afghanistan against the wishes of the local afghan leadership even if this means alienating and losing their support fo r counterterror goals and objectives
