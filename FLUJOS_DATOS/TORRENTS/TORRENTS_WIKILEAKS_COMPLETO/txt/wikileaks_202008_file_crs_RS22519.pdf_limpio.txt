correct the perceived problems created by the absence of statutory regulation of credit rating agencies credit rating agencies rate the creditworthiness of public companies and the debts of those companies so that potential creditor or investor will have pres umably professional objective opinion as to the likely risk of any investment in particular company these ratings have become an important component of the financial reputation of rated company ratings have taken on great significance in the market with investors trusting that good credit rating reflects the results of careful unbiased and accurate assessment by the credit rating agencies of the rated company credit ratings which are expressed in letter grade provide an assessment of creditworthiness or the likelihood that debt will be repaid 1 over the past several years particularly with the scandals involving such major corporations as enron and worldcom increased attention has focused on the role of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets 2 section 702 of the sarbanesoxley act of 20023 required the securities and exchange commission sec or co mmission to conduct study of the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities market in january 2003 the sec issued its report report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets in june 2003 the commission issued concept release in order to solicit public comments about issues concerning credit rating agencies including the issue of whether credit rating agencies should continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws and whether if these ratings are used there should be formal process of determining whose ratings should be used and what kind of oversight to apply to these credit rating agencies4 the secs 2003 concept release stemmed from ongoing concerns regarding the development of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro concept in 1975 the commission issued the net capital rule5 which set new net capital requirements for broker dealers and required these brokerdealers to take larger discount on below investment grade bonds than for investment grade bonds the rule required that the ratings come from nationally recognized statistical ratings organization there was some concern that there was official federal statutory or regulatory definition of nationally recognized statistical ratings organization instead upon request the staff of the division of market regulation

identified by the commission staff as nrsros but that with consolidation there are currently five am best company inc dominion bond rating service limited fitch inc moodys investors service inc and the standard poors division of the mcgraw hill companies inc7 ratings by nrsros despite there having been official federal statutory or regulatory definition were given significant weight in such areas as federal and state legislation rules issued by financial regulators and private financial contracts credit rating agency particularly one with nrsro status was exempted from certain federal securities regulations 8 in 1997 the sec proposed to amend the net capital rule in order to define nrsro9 among other requirements in the proposal for receiving nrsro status was that credit rating agency would be required to register as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act10 the rule was not adopted but in the apparently somewhat informal process that the sec has used in issuing its noaction letter to credit rating agency providing it with nrsro status the sec appeared to desire registration under the investment advisers act by credit rating agency seeking nrsro status on april 25 2005 in response to number of concerns the sec published proposed new rule which would have defined nationally recognized statistical rating organization11 the rule which was to be added to the code of federal regulations at 17 cfr section 2403b10 would have defined the term as any entity that issues publicly available credit ratings that are current assessments of the creditworthiness of obligors with respect to specific securities or money market instruments b is generally accepted in the financial markets as an issuer of credible and reliable ratings including ratings for particular industry or geographic segment by the predominant users of securities ratings and c uses systematic procedures designed to ensure credible and reliable ratings manage potential conflicts of interest and prevent the misuse of nonpublic information and has sufficient financial resources to ensure compliance with those procedures 12 7 70 fed reg 2130621307 april 25 2005 8 one of these exemptions concerns regulation fd 17 cfr part 243 which prohibits issuers from making selective disclosure of material information in order to atte mpt to make certain that the public has information needed to make investment decisions this prohibition does not appl to an entity whose primary business is the issuance of credit ratings provided the information is disclosed solely fo r the purpose of developing credit rating and the entitys ratings are publicly available 17 cfr 243100b2iii another exemption concerns sec rule 436 17 cfr 230436 which was issued pursuant to section 11 of the securities act of 1933 15 usc 77k the statute provides for civil liabilities for those attesting to the information contai ned in registration statement rule 436 provides that rating assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating orga nization is not to be considered part of the registration statement thus arguably shielding nrsro from liability under section 11 of the securities act the rule states that the term nationally recognized sta tistical rating organization emphasis in original shall have the same meaning as used in rule 15c31c2vif 17 cfr 24015c31c2vif 17cfr 230436g2 9

adequate statutory authority to oversee the credit rating agency industry with the introduction of hr 2990 titled the credit rating agency duopoly relief act of 2005 on june 20 2005 the 109th congress began the process of considering legislation to regulate the registration of credit rating agencies at the end of this legislative process s 385013 the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 was passed by unanimous consent by the senate on september 22 2006 and under suspension of the rules by the house on september 27 2006 it was signed into law by the president on september 29 2006 as pl 109291 section 2 of pl 109291 sets forth the congressional findings leading to the need for regulation of credit rating agencies this section referencing the abovementioned section 702 of the sarbanesoxley act and comments on the secs concept releases and proposed rules states the finding that credit rating agencies are of national importance among the reasons provided for the need for legislation to regulate credit rating agencies are that the two largest credit rating agencies moodys and standard poors serve most of the market and that additional competition is in the public interest and that the sec has stated that it needs statutory authority to oversee the credit rating industry section 3 adds five new definitions to the securities exchange act of 1934 14 credit rating credit rating agency nationally recognized statistical rating organization person associated with nationally recognized statistical rating organization and qualified institutional buyer 15 the definition of nationally recognized statistical rating organization would appear to resolve uncertainty which might have existed concerning the secs somewhat informal recognition of such an organization under the new statute nationally recognized statistical rating organization is credit rating agency that has been in business as credit rating agency for at least the three consecutive years immediately preceding the date of its application for registration as nrsro and which issues credit ratings certified by qualified institutional buyers concerning financial institutions brokers or dealers insurance companies corporate issuers issuers of asset backed securities issuers of government securities municipal securities or securities issued by foreign governments or combination of one or more categories of obligors described in any of the aforementioned categories in order to be deemed by the sec as nationally recognized statistical rating organization credit rating agency must submit in its applicati on to the sec detailed information such as the following 1 credit ratings performance measurement statistics over shortterm midterm and longterm periods 2 the procedures and methodologies that the applicant uses in determining credit ratings 3 policies or procedures adopted and implemented by the applicant to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information 4 its organizational structure 5 whether it has in effect code of ethics and if not why not 6 any conflict of interest relating to its issuance of credit ratings 7 on confidential basis list of the twenty largest issuers and subscribers that use its credit rating services by amount of net revenues received in the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of submission of the application and 8 any other information and documents 13 on february 8 2005 the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs committee held hearing titled examining the role of credit rating agencies in th capital markets on march 7 2006 the committee held hearing titled assessing the current over sight and operations of credit rating agencies the committee on august 2 2006 ordered an original measure to be reported on september 6 2006 the original measure with written report 109326 was reported to the senate 14 15 usc 78a et seq 15 adding sections 3a6064 to the securities exchange act of 1934

public interest or for the protection of investors16 the sec is required to follow specific time frame and procedure in determining whether to grant the application for treatment as nationally recognized statistical rating organization the legislation makes it unlawful for any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to represent or imply that it has been designated sponsored recommended or approved by the united states or by any united states agency officer or employee the legislation requires each nationally recognized statistical rating organization to establish maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address and manage any conflicts of interest that might arise pl 109291 fits within the general philosophy of all of the major federal securities laws this philosophy is premised upon the belief that so long as there is full and accurate disclosure of all material information by covered company the investing public will have sufficient information upon which to make its investment decisions the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 requires credit agency wishing to have the status of nationally recognized statistical rating organization to disclose to the sec significant information about its business and its methods for issuing credit ratings so that the investing public will have information to help determine the likely accuracy of credit ratings which the agency has assigned g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 michael v
