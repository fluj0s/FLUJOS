problems this aid is often monetary but occasionally it may take the form of federal regulations affecting local activities for example in the case of the safe drinking water act the needs of the locality are met through legisl ation providing funds but also requiring that certain national standards be met national legislators attempt to design such legislation in fashion that favors conditions in thei r state or district supreme court constitutionality the highest court in the nation interprets the laws congress passes legislation ruled unconstitutional by the court or policy decisions or directives made by the court in its ru lings often find their way back to congresss agenda in the form of new legislative proposals foreign governments congress serves foreign as well as domestic policy function the senate is c onstitutionally charged with dvice and consent on appointment of ambassadors and ratif ication of treaties with foreign governments the needs of individual countries and global regions are ddressed in congress as legislative proposals constituents members of congress serve legisl ative and representative functions as representatives they seek to address

is introduced others seek to influence the legislative agenda itself incl uding which measures should be considered and which should be kept off the ag enda in addition to providing legislative proposals these groups actively seek action on them press an internal joke on capitol hill says that the day after the television show 60 minutes is on or the day after the magazine readers digest hits the newsstands are the worst days to work in congressional ffice especially as caseworker or press secretary these two outside sources are believed on cap itol hill to provoke more ideas for more legislation for more members than all other sources combined the press is potent watchdog for congress and an equally potent advocate for the citizenry ideas raised in the media especially local media elicit serious consideration by members
