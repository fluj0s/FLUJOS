june 18 that googlecm search engine was not filtering returns for pornographic sites the government on june 24 again blocked the companys services for 24 hours resulting in the loss of 20 percent of its traffic that dayxxxxxxxxxxxxx believe the real reason for the governments wrath is the companys refusal to remove link to googlecom from the googlecn website they argue doing so would be in violation of commitment the company made with congress end summary 2 sbu in conversations xxxxxxxxxxxxx told adcm and econoff that the chinese government has been blocking several of googles internet sites periodically for the past three years they said the blocking and other harassment had intensified in june 2009 purportedly because of the search engines failure to filter some inappropriate or illicit content found on the web 3 sbuxxxxxxxxxxxxx said that xxxxxxxxxxxxx group of chinese internet users reported that googlecn was not effectively filtering pornographic sites xxxxxxxxxxxxx said google china representatives were called to meeting cohosted by the state council information office scio responsible for controlling internet content the ministry of industry and information technology miit responsible for internet technology and policy and the ministry of public security mps responsible for internet crime the ministries demanded google provide better filtering on its googlecn search engine and temporarily stop indexing sites outside of china xxxxxxxxxxxxx the company refused this request 4 sbu google then experienced wave of attacks in the media reporting that pornographic material could be found through the google search engine note in the nine days following the june 18 incident an incomplete list of reporting in the chinese press contains 57 separate articles attacking google end note on june 24 servers in china were virally infected causing them to redirect computers attempting to reach google pages to an unknown web site these attacks made google services unavailable to many chinese users for approximately 24 hours and caused the company to lose 20 of its traffic on that day lose the googlecom 5 sbu bothxxxxxxxxxxxxx believe the real reason for the governments wrath is googles refusal to remove the link to googlecom from the googlecn websitexxxxxxxxxxxxx explained that when the company decided to enter the chinese market it testified before congress that it would agree to censor its search results in china as required by chinese law based on three principles first the company would not store private user information so as to avoid persecution of individuals based on their use of googles services second the company would disclose to users when search result had been censored third google would maintain link from the googlecn homepage to googlecom 6 sbu according to xxxxxxxxxxxxx from 2007 through 2009 google received numerous informal inquiries from the chinese government as to the possibility of removing the googlecom link the company repeatedly explained that it could not based on its promise to congress xxxxxxxxxxxxx said the government for the first time verbally requested the company remove the link google china explained removing the link was not required under chinese law and reiterated that doing so would violate the companys commitment this was the first time the company had explicitly denied government request xxxxxxxxxxxxx stated pulling out an option 7 sbu xxxxxxxxxxxxx said the june 24 blocking of googles services is only the most recent of three year history of blockings he noted the companys you tube service has been entirely blocked since march 24 he believes the company is being harassed xxxxxxxxxxxxx said the negative press coverage and service outages have caused the company to lose market share xxxxxxxxxxxxxsays the company is regularly audited by tax authorities and xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx said that faced with the continual beijing 00001957 002 of 002 difficulties of doing business in china the company may even consider pulling out of the market 8 sbu comment google is the only international search engine still doing business in china it is an important symbol if google were forced to withdraw from the market the move could attract heavy international attention end comment
