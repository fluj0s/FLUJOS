infrastructure protection updated january 27 2005 paul w parfomak specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress guarding america security guards and us critical infrastructure protection summary the bush administrations 2003 national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets indicates that security guards are an important source of protection for critical facilities in 2003 approximately one million security guards including airport screeners were employed in the united states of these guards analysis indicates that up to 5 protected what have been defined as critical infrastructure and assets the effectiveness of critical infrastructure guards in countering terrorist attack depends on the number of guards on duty their qualifications pay and training security guard employment may have increased in certain critical infrastructure sectors since september 11 2001 although overall employment of us security guards has declined in the last five years contract guard salaries averaged 19400 per year in 2003 less than half of the average salary for police and well below the average us salary for all occupations there are us federal requirements for training of critical infrastructure guards other than airport screeners and nuclear guards twentytwo states do require basic training for licensed security guards but few specifically require counterterrorism training state regulations regarding criminal background checks for security guards vary sixteen states have background check regulations the federal governments role in protecting us critical infrastructure has been concern of congress since 911 part of this concern involves the possible imposition of federal security requirements including guard requirements on infrastructure which is largely private the private security officer employment authorization act of 2004 pl 108458 sec 6402 facilitates employer access to fbi criminal records to conduct background checks of security guard employees other legislation proposed in the 108th congress would have required private security guard companies to perform criminal background checks would have prohibited the hiring of guards who failed background checks or would have directed the department of homeland security dhs to conduct security guard emergency training including training for acts of terrorism the dhs currently does not have counterterrorism training programs specifically for private security guards there appears to be federal or state policy that explicitly addresses critical infrastructure guards as distinctive group if homeland security policy evolves towards special treatment of critical infrastructure guards responsible agencies may face challenge identifying those guards because of uncertainties in identifying critical assets federal counterterrorism funding for critical infrastructure guards may also present policy challenge since 87 of these guards are in the private sector it is an open question whether private operators of critical infrastructure have hired trained and otherwise supported security guards to the degree warranted by the social value of the facilities they protect as congress continues its oversight of homeland security funding for private guards may emerge as security

department of homeland security dhs issued terrorism alert for critical financial institutions in new york washington dc and newark nj press reports indicated that these institutions employed security guards and that surveillance by terrorists included the location armament and activity of those guards1 widely deployed among transportation hubs power plants and other nationally important facilities such security guards are viewed by many as both vital element of terror deterrence and the first line of response to terrorist attacks the bush administration shares this view in the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets the administration identifies security guards as an important source of protection for critical facilities2 the nations dependence on security guards for critical infrastructure protection gives rise to questions as to the status and capability of these guards and federal efforts to help them combat terrorism in 2003 there were approximately one million security guards including airport screeners employed in the united states compared to 650000 us police officers3 nearly half of these guards were employed directly by the institutions they served the rest approximately 53 of all guards worked for contract guard companies providing outsourced guard services this report provides background information concerning security guards in the united states and their role in critical infrastructure protection it analyzes trends in the number and deployment of security guards including effects of the terror attacks 1

press oct 17 2003 crs2 of september 11 2001 911 it discusses the wages paid to security guards compared to similar workers and the relationship between pay and workforce effectiveness the report reviews the qualifications and training of security guards including background checks highlighting recent changes related to counter terrorism and statetostate differences in qualification requirements finally the report discusses policy considerations of potential interest to congress issues facing congress the role of the federal government in protecting the nations critical infrastructure has been fundamental concern of congress since 911 part of this concern involves the potential imposition of federal security requirements including guard requirements on infrastructure which lies largely in the private sector among nuclear power plants for example the federal government has required more training and staffing of private guards since 911 airport screeners have been federalized outright as us homeland security policy evolves direct federal intervention in the protection of other critical infrastructure including chemical plants banks and communications networks is becoming an increasingly important issue critical infrastructure is found in many congressional districts by definition terrorist attack on such infrastructure would affect not only local communities but the nation as whole faced with the widely perceived need for greater critical infrastructure protection some in congress are examining the adequacy of current us counterterrorism activities including the role and capabilities of security guards if congress concludes that the effectiveness of security guards could be enhanced congress may consider additional guardrelated legislation such as hr 4830 of the 108th congress or may exercise its oversight authority in other ways to influence security guard capabilities and deployment background what is critical infrastructure what us policy makers consider to be critical infrastructure has been evolving and is often ambiguous twenty years ago infrastructure was defined primarily with respect to the adequacy of the nations public works in the mid 1990s however the growing threat of international terrorism led policy makers to reconsider the definition of infrastructure in the context of homeland security successive federal government reports laws and executive orders have refined and generally expanded the number of infrastructure sectors and the types of assets considered to be critical for purposes of homeland security currently the usa patriot act of 2001pl 10756 defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters sec 1016e crs3 this definition was adopted by reference in the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 sec 24 establishing the department of homeland security dhs the national strategy also adopts the definition of critical infrastructure in pl 10756 and provides the following list of specific infrastructure sectors and assets falling under that definition information technology drinking water water treatment telecommunications energy chemicals banking and finance transportation systems national monuments and icons emergency services defense industrial base postal and shipping services key industry technology sites agriculture and food large gathering sites public health and healthcare the critical infrastructure sectors in the national strategy contain many physical assets but only fraction of these could be viewed as critical according to the dhs definition for example out of 33000 individual assets cataloged in dhss national asset database the agency considers only 1700 or 5 to be nationally critical4 the 33000 assets in the dhs database themselves constitute only subset of all assets in the critical infrastructure sectors5 because federal agencies state agencies and the private sector often have different views of what constitutes criticality compiling consensus list of nationally critical assets has been an ongoing challenge for dhs the implications of this challenge as it relates to security guards is discussed later in this report security guards and critical infrastructure protection protecting people and property from accidents and crime is the principal role of security guards they monitor patrol and inspect property to protect against fire theft vandalism and other illegal activity they may enforce laws on their employers grounds conduct incident interviews prepare incident reports and provide legal testimony guards may work at one location or may patrol among multiple locations to conduct security checks security guards typically use radios and telephones to call for assistance from police fire or other emergency services as required they may be armed as required by specific duty assignments consistent with state and federal laws governing private ownership and use of firearms 4 liscouski robert asst sec infrastructure protection dept of homeland security testimony before the house select committee on homeland security infrastructure and border security subcommittee april 21 2004 note that dhss list of 1700 critical assets may not include the 430 us commercial airports with passenger screeners whose security is primarily administered by the transportation security administration 5 for example in the chemicals sector dhs has identified 4000 facilities as potentially critical out of 66000 total us chemical sites see liscouski robert asst sec infrastructure security dept of homeland security dhs testimony before the house committee on government reform subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations combating terrorism chemical plant security serial 108 156 feb 23 2004 p 13 crs4 although security guards in general share many common responsibilities they may also face unique duties at particular institutions in banks for example guards protect customers money safety deposit boxes and records they may work with bank detectives to prevent theft and apprehend criminal suspects before police arrive by comparison transportation terminal guards eg airport screeners protect travelers freight luggage and equipment they may screen passengers for weapons and explosives ensure property is stolen while being loaded or unloaded and watch for fires and criminal activity6 security guard police powers although security guards have long supplemented public law enforcement they typically have more limited authorities than police and other law officers specific powers vary by jurisdiction but they generally correspond to the police authorities of private citizens in most states citizens may make arrests only when crime is committed in their presence suspicion that crime has taken place is not enough and in some states citizens may only make arrests for felonies and then must immediately turn the suspect over to police officer even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest with caution unlike police officers civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects into custody are liable for false arrest7 security guards may have other authorities or may face further limitations to their police power according to state licensing or other regulation where it exists for example the following authorities are listed in californias security guard training manual as an agent of the employer security guard can question an individual on the employers property and may prevent entry to the property by standing in the individuals way although security guard has the power of citizens arrest guard is not obligated by law to make arrests security guard should never touch criminal suspect except for self defense or when necessary to use reasonable force in an arrest if security guard believes an arrested person is armed the guard may search for weapons only suspect may not be legally searched for weapons unless he is actually arrested security guard cannot legally carry firearm or baton without state permit and valid security

responsibilities since the terror attacks of 911 protecting against terrorism has been an additional responsibility for many security guards especially for guards associated with critical infrastructure security guards are viewed by many as necessary supplement to the counter terrorism activities of public law enforcement agencies which have limited resources and broad responsibilities according to congressional testimony by one guard company executive law enforcement agencies have been called upon to fulfill two fundamentally different and competing missions to deter domestic crime while also being engaged in the fight against potentially new and devastating terrorist attacks orchestrated from abroad unfortunately there are simply neither the public resources nor the personnel to do the job consequently security officers are being asked to fill the gap9 the increased counter terrorism role for security guards has become apparent in many private and public sector security plans in the refinery industry for example security guidelines during dhs orange alert call for engaging trained and knowledgeable security workforce increasing patrols inspecting vehicles and other security activities that may rely on security guards10 counter terrorism activities of security guards in other key sectors are discussed later in this report guards deployed at critical infrastructure according to the bureau of labor statistics bls there were approximately 1022000 security guards working in the united states in 2003 table 1 for the purposes of policy analysis these guards may be separated into two categories of employment and three categories of service contract guards work directly for private guard companies and are deployed under contract to other institutions staff guards are employed directly by institutions as regular line employees both contract and staff guards may work either at private facilities government facilities or airports guard forces at airports are mostly airport screeners whose duties and employment characteristics warrant their distinction from other guards the approximate number of contract and staff guards working at all three types of institutions in 2003 is summarized in table 1 the bls reports that over 14 of all security guards work parttime the number of parttime employees is higher among contract guards than among staff guards according to 2002 survey of major contractors 20 to 30 of contract 8 continued training manual west sacramento ca feb 2002 pp 68 9 walker don w chairman securitas security services

source crs analysis of bureau of labor statistics bls and trade press data13 critical infrastructure guards how many security guards actually protect critical infrastructure only rough estimate can be made although there is source of data detailing the number of contract security guards serving specific industry and government sectors the bls does report such data for staff guards by totaling 2002 bls employment figures for the appropriate industries crs estimates that approximately 122000 28 of staff guards excluding airport screeners worked in industries corresponding to the nspp critical infrastructure sectors14 as noted above however critical assets typically comprise only fraction of sectors total assets assuming for simplicity that guards are found only among assets in dhss national asset database and that guards are uniformly distributed across those assets it may be reasonable to estimate that consistent with dhss critical asset ratio up to 5 of staff guards actually protect critical infrastructure further assuming that contract guard deployment reflects staff guard deployment the total number of security guards protecting critical assets could be on the order of 50000 such critical guard force would be comparable in size to the 55000 transportation security administration tsa and contract screeners working at the nations commercial airports in 2003 note that airport screeners are also considered to be critical infrastructure guards for purposes of this report 11 security magazine securitys top guarding companies january 2004 12 bls occupational outlook

2004 httpwwwicegovgraphicsfpsindexhtm crs9 decline in overall guarding jobs since 2001 notwithstanding the nations heightened concerns about terrorism would appear to contradict popular perceptions about us guard deployment many analysts have assumed that private guard contractors in particular would see an increase in business as infrastructure owners stepped up guarding of their facilities under more protective security plans one reason this increase may not have occurred is because private sector reactions to 911 may have been shortlived as one major guard contractor noted in recent investor publication following september 11 2001 there was sharp increase in demand for security particularly in the usa most of this additional demand has proved to be shortterm total market growth in 2003 was around zero percent20 others have suggested that due to the us economic recession which followed 911 many companies were forced to cut discretionary expenses including security guard expenses to maintain profitability although the total number of us guards appears to have declined over the last several years it is not clear to what degree the number of guards at critical sites reflects this trend it is possible that the deployment of critical infrastructure guards increased but that these increases were offset by larger reductions in noncritical infrastructure guards the following examples suggest that there are more critical infrastructure guards at least in several infrastructure sectors airport screener trends the employment trend for airport screeners has differed from that of other guards figure 2 shows total us employment of airport screeners from 1999 to 2004 when airport screening was federalized after september 11 2001 the number of screeners more than doubled to approximately 60000 in november 200321 the tsa has subsequently reduced the screening work force to 44000 workers although this number of screeners is still 57 higher than in 2001 20 securitas inc the security industry the security market company web page httpwwwsecuritasgroupcom 2004 21 note that approximately onethird of these 60000 workers were employed specifically as baggage

note because screener employment estimates are only available for specific months during the 19992004 period annual averages may differ from these values nuclear plant guard trends nuclear power plants have long been recognized as potential terrorist targets consequently their security is regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc in response to the terror attacks of 911 and specific intelligence about potential attacks on us nuclear facilities the nrc has increased nuclear plant guard staffing requirements along with other security requirements as result the total number of guards deployed among the nations 67 nuclear sites reportedly increased from 5000 in 2001 to 8000 in 200422 guard trends in other critical sectors there is little public information available on security guard employment trends at the sector level for infrastructures other than airports and nuclear plants anecdotal reports within sectors suggest some increase in guards at other potentially critical facilities it may not be appropriate to generalize these anecdotes to all other critical facilities nor is it clear whether these guard increases have been sustained nonetheless the following examples do illustrate range of guard deployment policies among critical infrastructure sectors since 911 security costs at four downtown angeles skyscrapers including the us bank tower reportedly increased 25 between 2001 and 2002 primarily due to additional guard expenses security at these buildings was budgeted slightly lower for 200323 in 2002 security review of 15 financial market

for patrols others for greater armed response and one to initiate vehicle screening24 in 2003 the gao found that seven chemical facilities visited by gao staff had increased the number of security guards in response to chemical industry security guidance developed after 911 nineteen other chemical facilities were unwilling to host gao visits25 the gao did not indicate if any of the facilities might be considered critical the angeles department of water power ladwp spent 7 million to double its city and groundbased security patrols in fy2001 this patrol budget decreased to 5 million in both

operators of critical systems have used guard patrols at certain facilities under certain threat conditions27 the api does not report baseline increase in guards among pipeline operators the jamestownsurry virginia ferry system hired 1215 guards under sixmonth contract for passenger and vehicle screening beginning july 200428 the examples above indicate that the timing level and duration

associated press random checks to begin on jamestownscotland ferries june 30 2004 crs12 policy issues in considering the role of security guards in us critical infrastructure protection policy analysts have focused on several key issues staffing pay background checks and training few additional policy issues such as counter terrorism support and contract guard costeffectiveness have also received some public attention guard staffing levels the relationship between the size of guard force stationed at critical facility and its effect on facility security is the subject of debate many policy analysts assume that the security of critical asset is proportional to the number of guards protecting it ie more guards means better security for example in 2002 campaign speech one us presidential candidate called for congress to require much better physical security for chemical plants including more security guards29 president bushs national strategy likewise calls for recruiting and training more skilled security personnel to protect our critical infrastructures30 significant increases in the number of airport screeners and nuclear plant guards since 911 appear to be based at least in part on similar thinking31 while in many cases it may be true that increasing guard numbers can make facility more secure in other cases the relationship between guard deployment and facility security may be less clear in guarding quantity does not necessarily ensure quality analysts have suggested several reasons why increasing the number of guards at given facility might not make it more secure or might even make it less secure guards can only meet guardable threats such as physical intrusion or surveillance by potential terrorists any number of guards could not be expected to prevent attack by commandeered airliner or remote cyberattack on facility safety systems if the nature of terrorist attack is potentially guardable but guards are not trained to recognize it additional guards may be more likely to respond to it effectively than fewer guards32 29 sen john edwards agenda for homeland security speech at the brookings leadership forum brookings institution washington dc dec 18 2002 30 office of the president feb 2003 p 28 31 hiring of additional airport screeners was also driven by desire to avoid excessive traveler screening delays while meeting tighter airport security requirements 32 seifman david insecurity guard rips training new york post oct 27 2004 p 20 crs13 if an increase in the number of guards at facility is accomplished by making the existing force work more hours the guards may become fatigued disgruntled and consequently less effective33 increasing the size of guard force may lead to confusion about individual responsibility and reporting relationships which may reduce guard effectiveness34 expanding guard force may increase opportunities for hostile insiders to infiltrate that force35 having larger guard force however might make it more difficult for such an insider to successfully conduct hostile activities debate about the relationship between guard numbers and security suggests that enhancing critical facility security may not be as simple as posting more guards as practical matter the effectiveness of guards in countering terrorist attack also depends on the specific types of threats the guards may face the training they receive their organization the conditions of their employment and background checks when these factors are taken into account at given facility analysts may conclude that increasing the size of its guard force may not significantly increase its security against terrorism or that the facility operators might realize greater security benefits from additional training better organization or security technology investments pay for critical guards policy analysts often assert that security guard employment pays too little and offers too few benefits to sustain wellqualified pool of workers36 pay advocates claim that the us guard force could attract better workers and consequently could be more effective if guards were better compensated these claims have been directed especially at critical infrastructure guards in its 2000 report on airport security for example the gao linked longstanding problems with airport screener performance to personnel factors including low pay and associated high 33 bunn matthew thinking about how many guards will do the job risk analysis vol 24 4 2004 p 949 see also horwitz sari police show strain from endless alerts washington post oct 18

included pay increase of more than 100 from near minimum wages of 12000 per year in 2000 these pay increases appear to have improved both employee quality and retention some policy analysts suggest that similar reconsideration of guard pay might be warranted for other critical infrastructure guards guard salaries and qualifications analysis of the available data demonstrates that security guards are relatively low paid workers according to figure 2 contract guard salaries averaged 19400 per year in 2003 less than half of the average salary for police and well below the average us salary for all occupations staff guards earned nearly 25 more than contract guards in 2003 pay for both government and contract airport screeners in 2003 is estimated to have averaged over 28700 nearly 50 higher than contract guards but still 16000 less than police officers there is publicly available report on average pay for all nuclear plant guards although one study in 2002 found that salaries among five specific nuclear plants started at 19364 to 32117 and ranged up to 40393 after three years of employment38 contract security guards who work full time often also receive benefits such as health insurance paid leave and retirement plans low pay for guard employment reflects the minimal qualifications required by guard employers according to the bls many contract guard companies have specific educational requirements although they prefer high school graduation or equivalent certification for armed employees armed guards must be licensed by appropriate government authorities and may receive

the house appropriations committee transportation subcommittee june 20 2002 note 2002 screener pay is adjusted by 41 federal pay increase for 2003 higher pay for critical infrastructure guards airports and nuclear plants are nationally critical facilities and are perceived to be at greater risk for terrorist attack than many other facilities consequently airport and nuclear plants are deemed to require guards with better qualifications experience and counter terror training than other guards given their presumed experience and skills airline screeners and nuclear plant guards are paid more on average than other contract or staff guards it is possible that an informed assessment of security needs across all critical assets would demonstrate need for more capable guards and associated higher salaries in such case higher guard salaries would impose added security costs on the critical asset owners for purposes of illustration if 50000 critical infrastructure guards had their salaries increased from the average contract guard salary 19400 to the average airport screener salary 28732 total annual guard costs would increase by 466 million imposition of such costs on guard employers especially private guards contractors might be met with resistance however since the provision of guard services is highly costcompetitive business background checks the potential for terrorists to infiltrate critical facilities by hiring on as security guards has long been concern in specific critical infrastructure sectors the nrc for example requires exhaustive background checks of nuclear plant guards under the atomic energy act pl 83703 the federal aviation administration faa began requiring background investigations and criminal history checks for airport screeners in 199839 since 911 heightened concern about terrorism has prompted some legislators to call for increased federal background screening of other security guards to help determine whether or not employees pose threat to the facilities and persons they are supposed to protect40 similarly the bush administrations national strategy states that timeefficient thorough and periodic background screening is an important tool for protecting against the insider threat41 congressional interest in federal background checks for security guards stems in part from inconsistent or incomplete screening requirements at the state level according to 2004 survey 23 states including the district of columbia have licensing requirements which authorize federal criminal background checks for contract security guards an additional 12 states authorize only state criminal checks 39 federal aviation administration faa faa expands employment background checks to airport security screeners press release sept 25 1998 40

remaining 16 states had background check regulations42 even in states with authorizing regulations however federal background checks are not necessarily performed on all prospective guards consequently as one legislator has stated background checks of both state and federal criminal history for private security guards are the exception rather than the rule43 the private security officer employment authorization act of 2004 pl 108 458 sec 6402 facilitates federal background checks of private security guard company employees or job applicants by authorizing employer access to federal bureau of investigation fbi criminal records under pl 108458 fbi backgrounds checks could presumably be made for both contract and staff security the act includes provisions for states that either do or do not have state government standards for security guard qualification sec 6402d1dii other legislation proposed in the 108th congress would have required private security guard companies to perform federal criminal background checks and would have prohibited the hiring of guards who failed such checks hr 4022 section 5a criminal backgrounds and terrorism from the standpoint of crime prevention and employee reliability many analysts have argued that screening guards specifically for criminal history is only prudent it might be unwise for example to hire convicted bank robbers to guard banks furthermore qaeda and other terror groups have been known to recruit disgruntled us citizens such as alleged dirty bomber jose padilla from within the us criminal justice system44 however there is also evidence that sophisticated terror groups deliberately recruit operatives without criminal histories the irish republican army ira for example viewed new recruits with criminal records as ideal to undertake missions which would be difficult for members known to security authorities45 united states officials cite similar recruiting preferences for terror groups like qaeda46 it appears therefore that the direct relationship between criminal history and terrorism is debatable background check limitations both us and international experience suggest that federal criminal background checks may be valuable for weeding out some security guard job applicants with terrorist connections however the fbi cannot readily estimate how many prospective guards might fall into this category 42 service employees international union seiu report card on security standards web page oct 12 2004 httpwwwseiuorgbuildingsecuritystatesecuritygradescfm 43 sen carl levin april 2 2003 p

without criminal records or known terrorist ties specially chosen to avoid detection by us immigration authorities crs17 due to limitations in the federal criminal records database47 moreover federal background checks may not identify clean operatives specifically recruited for their lack of criminal or terror record so such checks may be only partially effective note that background checks for nuclear security guards extend beyond criminal offenses to any circumstances which tend to show that the individual is not reliable or trustworthy or may be subject to coercion influence or pressures to act contrary to the national interest 10 cfr 1021011 airport screeners likewise are reportedly subject to an analysis to determine whether candidates present or may be associated with potential terrorist threats48 even these higher standards however which are comparable to federal security clearance requirements might not be effective against carefully selected terrorist operatives finally if background screening laws apply only to statelicensed contract guards hostile insiders may still find infiltration opportunities as unlicenced staff guards federal criminal background checks may also be limited by incomplete state records the gao recently reported that as of 2001 11 of state criminal records had not been automated and made available nationally the agency further found that automated information on the disposition of felony and other arrests as opposed to convictions is not always widely available49 fbi officials have stated that resource limitations among law enforcement agencies and state identification bureaus limits their ability to conduct thorough and timely background checks for prospective employees50 given the potential relationship between criminal history and terrorist activity federal criminal background checks are viewed by some as potentially important but not insurmountable hurdles to terrorist infiltration of critical facilities furthermore as stricter criminal screening is imposed on critical infrastructure guards terrorist groups may divert recruitment and collaboration away from convicted criminals in greater effort to circumvent these screening requirements because federal criminal checks may only be partially effective policy makers may need to draw on complementary measures including guard supervision and access controls to help reduce the terror threat should terrorist insider penetrate critical guard force counterterrorism training counterterrorism training is an important part of the professional

statemandated security guard training have prompted some policy makers to specifically call for greater counter terrorism training requirements for example the mayor of angeles recently ordered security guards at the angeles department of water and power ladwp to attend three antiterrorism seminars taught by the angeles police department lapd the seminars include topics such as terrorism awareness surveillance detection and vehicleborne explosives detection57 according to the lapd this new utility guard training is unique because it uses intelligence data on qaeda tactics gleaned from

legislation some policy makers have called for security guard terrorism training legislation in the district of columbia the proposed dc enhanced professional security amendment act of 2004 would have

secretary of homeland security to develop and conduct training programs for security guards to implement emergency preparedness and response plans and operations procedures sec 510b8 according to its lead sponsor emergencies under hr 4830 was intended to include acts of terrorism61 hr 4830 would have applied to contract guards but not staff guards opponents of expanded governmentmandated guard training standards question the potential effectiveness of such training requirements especially if they do not distinguish among different guard assignments job responsibilities levels of oversight exposure to the public and stategranted powers vary to such degree that specific minimal training requirements could meet the needs of some security officer assignments without substantially exceeding the level required for others62 these concerns reflect real differences in facility security needs as determined by vulnerability assessments threat information and criticality evaluation given the variability of these factors across many kinds of infrastructure different facilities may need security guards in substantially different capacities telecommunications centers for example may require guards primarily for access control whereas sports stadiums may require guards for screening and crowd monitoring certain electric power facilities may require guards at all relying instead on remote surveillance and other means of physical protection because of these differences in facility guarding needs some analysts argue that training policies for security guards may best be evaluated on sectorbysector or even facilitybyfacility basis opponents of federal training regulation may instead wish to rely on private companies voluntarily providing such training to their workers there is little public information however on how many guard employers have been doing so 2002 survey of security guards in california found that since 911 60 of guard employers had issued new procedures 52

number of security firms and other institutions66 counterterror training for critical guards given the importance of critical infrastructure protection in the nations homeland security strategy some analysts have suggested that critical infrastructure guards specifically should be encouraged by federal agencies to receive additional counterterrorism training the national strategy for example directed dhs to initiate dialogue with state and local counterparts privatesector infrastructure owners and operators and private security firms concerning the creation of training and certification regime for private security officers67 likewise panel of drinking water experts convened by the gao identified specialized training of utility security staff as one of the water system security enhancements most deserving of federal support68 nuclear power plant guards for example are required to receive several months of special training in areas such as firearms first aid alarms and electronic security systems69 one barrier to special critical guard training is cost 40hour training course developed for office building security guards in manhattan for example was projected to cost approximately 20 per hour or 800 per guard70 if such training were required for 50000 critical infrastructure guards total costs would be 40 million assuming the same average hourly cost training

fy2005 government oversight of staff guards state security guard training and other licensing requirements generally apply to prospective employees of private security companies ie contract guards but not to staff guards some proposed guard legislation at the federal level likewise has been directed primarily at contract guards according to table 1 however approximately 489000 or 48 of all us guards in 2003 were staff guards and so would not be subject to such oversight many of these staff guards may be subject to screening and training by their institutional employers but these requirements would not necessarily be related to any governmentdefined standards as state and federal legislators consider greater training and other licencing requirements for contract guards they may need to address potential disparities between standards for contract and staff guards contract and staff guards may protect the same types of critical facilities so it could be argued that they should be subject to the same screening and capability requirements this is the case for example in nuclear power plants where both contract and staff guards are subject to the same nrc regulations contract and tsa airport screeners are likewise subject to the same background checks and training requirements other security guard issues in addition to security guard deployment and overall qualification several other guard issues have emerged in infrastructure security discussions full analysis of these issues is beyond the scope of this report but they are mentioned briefly below for purposes of completeness contract vs staff guard performance tsa officials and other policy makers have begun to consider potential performance differences between contract guards and staff guards or between private guards and government guards72 such comparisons are not straightforward however and there appears to be little research available on this specific topic recent gao study of airport screeners found for example that the post911 tsa airport screening program was not established in way to enable an effective evaluation of the differences in the performance of 71 department of homeland security office of domestic preparedness odp fy2004 state homeland security grant program guidance washington dc nov 2003 p 31 72 government guards include tsa airport screeners and other guards employed directly by government agencies such as federal staff guards in the gs0085 security guard series crs24 federal and private screening and the reasons for those differences73 additional information may be needed to shed light on this issue civilian guards at military bases in the 2003 defense authorization act pl 107 314 congress authorized military bases to hire contract guards in place of military guards to meet new base security requirements sec 332 since that time contract guards have been hired at numerous us military installations including andrews air force base md fort hood tx and the us military academy ny while the hiring of civilian guards to replace soldiers at us military bases raises some interesting issues related to guard training and cost effectiveness the deployment of such guards may have more to do with overseas us troop demands than with critical infrastructure security per nuclear plant guard capabilities the training and effectiveness of nuclear guards regulated by the nrc has been questioned in the national media specifically the press has reported alleged lapses in nuclear guard performance questions about nrc security tests and perceived conflicts of interest in future guard testing by security contractor74 while potentially important these issues appear unique to nuclear security and have been addressed in other policy forums75 foreignowned guard contractors provision in the aviation and transportation security act pl 10771 allows only us owned and operated companies to provide contract screeners at us airports unless tsa cannot identify us firms with sufficient capability to meet screening needs this measure was presumably included in response to perceived inadequacies of airport screening contractors several of which were foreign controlled after the 911 attacks76 some analysts have criticized the restrictions on foreign ownership since many foreign security firms are located in countries that are close allies in the war on terrorism and have extensive international experience in infrastructure security which could be valuable in us critical infrastructure protection77 note that some us critical infrastructure in the private sector is actually owned and operated by foreign firms ban on foreign contract guards at such facilities might be difficult to implement78 73 general accounting office gao aviation

critical infrastructure79 counterterrorism support some analysts question whether or not critical infrastructure guards would benefit from more equipment technology or other resources in performing counterterrorism functions for example advanced communications links directly to dhs information centers and local police could improve guards ability to learn of imminent terrorist threats and could facilitate incident response identification and evaluation of such guard needs is an open issue conclusions this report addresses critical infrastructure guards as distinctive group but crs is aware of federal or state policy that explicitly makes similar distinction on the contrary federal criminal background legislation and state licensing regulations appear to apply uniformly to all guards under their jurisdiction without consideration of differing guard assignments as noted in this report uniform requirements for all one million us guards may be excessive for some and insufficient for others questions remain however about what is the appropriate role of the federal government with respect to security guards especially private guards protecting critical infrastructure while there appears to have been relatively little congressional debate on this subject it may become increasingly important as homeland security strategy evolves and the distinctive security requirements of us critical infrastructure become better understood if homeland security policy does evolve towards special treatment of critical infrastructure guards responsible agencies may face challenge in identifying those guards because of uncertainties in identifying critical assets in april 2004 the dhs information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate iaip reported that it had compiled the list of 1700 critical us assets referred to earlier in ths report but confusion among private sector and state government partners about what constituted critical asset cast doubt on the validity of that list80 among electric utilities for example there was some question as to why certain assets were considered critical by iaip since some of those assets were not in use and others did not support significant electric loads81 according to press accounts subsequent classified briefings with members of congress to review lists of critical assets in their states have continued to raise concerns about iaips critical asset 79 swedishbased securitas for example provides guards to major us oil refineries united kingdombased group 4 securicor is the parent of wackenhut which provides guards to many us nuclear plants wackenhut also provided airport screening services before 911 80 these 1700 assets considered to be nationally critical by iaip were derived from database of 33000 assets considered regionally or locally critical compiled from submissions by state agencies and other infrastructure security partners 81 personal communication with industry official september 29 2003 crs26 identification82 without clarity about which assets are critical policies directed at critical infrastructure guards may be difficult to implement counterterrorism funding for critical infrastructure guards may also present policy challenge because the overwhelming majority of these guards appear to be in the private sector the dhs assistant secretary for infrastructure protection recently stated that the department will not provide money to the private sector to remediate vulnerabilities83 but as table 1 shows approximately 87 of all us security guards in 2003 were employed either by private guard company or directly by private institution as one member of congress recently remarked private security workers play vital role protecting critical infrastructure both public and private from threat of terrorism84 even critical government facilities such as national laboratories military bases and courthouses often rely upon private security guards for counterterror protection if the private sector could be relied upon to make socially warranted counter terrorism investments in guards and training federal funding for guards might not be an issue however as some analysts have suggested there are economic reasons why private companies may not make such investments in homeland security private markets do not automatically produce the best result to be sure private firms have some incentive to avoid the direct financial losses associated with terrorist attack on their facilities or operations in general however that incentive is not compelling enough to encourage the appropriate level of security85 it is an open question whether private operators of critical infrastructure have hired trained and otherwise supported security guards to the degree warranted by the social value of the facilities they protect at this time there does not appear to be sufficient information to make such judgments furthermore the overall balance between public and private funding of homeland security is an expansive topic beyond the scope of this report nonetheless as congress continues its oversight of homeland security funding for private guards may emerge as security consideration where public benefits and private resources may not align 82 starks t and andersen congress industry both in dismay over homeland securitys performance on critical
