countries and problems of pr oliferation concern in part the failure to make progress on the most pressing npt problems north korea iran and nuclear disarmament is rooted in longstanding differen ces in how npt compliance is viewed1 as they have in the past nuclear weapon states argued that the international regime needed to strengthen its ability to address the noncomp liance of nonnuclear weapon states such as iran and north korea while nonnuclear wea pon states argued that nuclear weapon states needed to better comply with their obligations to eventually disarm and to share the peaceful uses of the atom background the npt which entered into force in 1970 has often been described as grand bargain under the treaty nonnuclear weapon states agree to give up pursuit of nuclear weapons but not their pursuit of the peacef ul uses of nuclear energy the main obligations of the nonnuclear weapon states are to foreswear nuclear weapons article ii submit to iaea safeguards inspections article iii

not to supply cer tain nuclearrelated items unless they are under safeguards article iii to fac ilitate the exchange of peaceful nuclear energy technology article iv and to pursue nego tiations toward nuclear disarmament article vi the bifurcation of states into nuclear haves and havenots has led at times to opposing views on many aspects of treaty imp lementation for example some states would like to focus on whether the nuclear w eapon states are complying with articles iv technical cooperation and vi nuclear disarmament of th treaty while other states would like to focus on whether the nonnuclear weapon states are complying with articles ii obligation not to develop or receive nuclear weapons and iii safeguards the npt itself is silent on how to assess compliance how to resolve compliance disputes and what procedures to follow in the event of noncompliance specifically there is verification of compliance with the obligations in articles i and ii not to transfer or receive nuclear weapons3 the treaty contains language on verification other than to require states to accept nuclear safeguards article iii the director general of the international atomic ener gy agency iaea reports on safeguards implementation every year and sometimes on specific compliance issues at board of governors meetings4 for articles iv and vi the treat offers definitions or ways of assessing whether states are living up to thei r obligations nuclear weapon states in the past have provided inform ation about their nuclear cooperation efforts their contributions to the iaeas technical coope ration program and scriptions of their efforts toward nuclear disarmament at the 2000 npt review conference the parties agreed to what have become known as the 13 practical steps toward disarmament since 2000 the united states has withdraw n its support for some of those steps5 compliance vs verification all arms control treaties have obligations but not all have verification measures ie measures that help nations monitor activities and assess compliance with treaty obligations the biological weapons conve ntion on the one hand obligates parties not to develop produce or stockpile biological ag ents or toxins but contains verification measures while the chemical weapons conve ntion spells out verification measures in detail under the antiballistic missile treaty the united

the fulfillment of states obligations assumed under this treaty with view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear wea pons or other nuclear explosive devices6 safeguards briefly refer to system of inspections reports and accounting procedures designed to detect discrepa ncies between what state reports and what inspectors find7 there are publicly available guidelines for determining how serious safeguards violation might be there is automatic translation from safeguards violations into npt violations8 this may help explain why the iaea has found many disc repancies but has not yet formally found iran to be in nonc ompliance with its safeguards agreement article xii of the iaea statute contai ns procedures for reporting noncompliance the inspectors shall report any noncomplia nce to the director general who shall thereupon transmit the report to the board of governors the board shall call upon the recipient state or states to remedy forthwith any noncompliance which it finds to have occurred the board shall report the noncompliance to all members and to the security council and general assembly of the united nations in the event of failure of the recipient state or states to take fully corrective action within reasonable time the board may take one or both of the following measures direct curtailment or suspension of assistance being provided by the agency or by member and call for the return of materials and quipment made available to the recipient member or group of members the agency may also in accordance with article xix suspend any non complying member from the exercise of the privileges and rights of membership9 key issue for many npt member states has been the lack of procedures for the security council to follow in the event of npt noncompliance in the case of north korea the iaea director general requested special inspection in february 1993 which north korea refused the iaea board of governors concluded on april 1 1993 that the north korea was in noncompliance and referre d the matter to the security council on may 11 1993 the council called upon north korea to comply with the agreement the agreed framework ultimately was negotiated virtually suspending north koreas nuclear program for eight years when confronted by the united states with allegations of covert uranium enrichment progra m in

past and ongoing nuclear activities and in monitoring its spension pledge the security council has the authority to require and enforce spension of irans enrichmentrelated and reprocessing activities in each of these areas the security council can support and reinforce the iaeas ability to pursue its in vestigations in iran until the agency can provide this board with all the necessary assurances it requires11 on september 24 2005 the iaea boar d of governors passed resolution gov200577 which concluded that iran was in noncompliance with its npt safeguards agreement the resolution is notable because it was not unanimous consensus is the norm and did not immediately refer the issue to the security council12 the iaea statute requires that once the board has made finding of noncompliance it must report it to the security council the resolution not ed that the board would address the timing and content of the report required under artic xiic of the statute reportedly several states wanted to keep the focus of efforts in vienna rather than in new york without the s upport of russia and china both of which have veto power at the security council referral to the security council could potentially be damaging rather than helpful according to the iaea statute if insp ectors find state in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement they report that to the director general who informs the board of governors in the case of iran the dg did not declare iran to be in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement despite numerous discrepancies but c oncluded in september 2005 according to gov200567 that the agency is however still not in position to conclude that there are undeclared nuclear materials or activities in iran13 this opened the way for the board of gover nors to make

npt article ii nonproliferation obligations14 this position infers that there is some way to find state in noncompliance with its article ii oblig ation not to acquire nuclear weapons however as noted above the npt is silent on how to assess article ii compliance other than through presumption that safeguards violation that is not corrected is evidence of states bad intentions us official s may have wanted to stress the seriousness of irans actions in the absence of the iaea calling iran into noncompliance but that rationale is probably moot after the september 24th resolution some press reports have cr eated confusion on the scope of iaea responsibilities in verifying compliance with the npt in particular the direct or general mohamed elbaradei has been quoted seve ral times that in the case of certain states he has evidence of nuclear weapons programs wh ile those statements are undoubtedly true observers may erroneously conclude that the iaea must find evidence of nuclear weapons program before calling state into noncompliance the case of libya where officials turned over documents proving it s ought nuclear weapons may be an exception rather than the rule15 despite hard evidence that libya sought nuclear weapons the iaea boards resolution on libyas noncompliance simply stated that libya had not complied with its safeguards agreement the legal authority of the iaea at present is limited to the range of activities within negotiated safeguards agreements president bush proposed in february 2004 that the iaea form verification committee to ensure that the iaea is organized to take action when action is required in june 2005 the iaea established committee on safeguards and verification if the committee addresses as dg elbaradei has suggested areas such as information sharing emerging technologies enhancing the agency s independent analytical capabilities and ensuring that the agency has an adequate and uniform legal author ity to conduct credible verification it is unlikely to branch out in to monitoring weapons related activities article iv in addition to stating the inalienable right of all parties to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy article iv says that all the parties to the treaty undertake to facilitate and have the right to participate i n the fullest possible exchange of equipment materials and scientific and technological informati on for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy there are standards for measuring whether npt parties are meeting these article iv obligations for the fullest possible exchange during treaty negotiations the conventional wi sdom was that the npt woul d provide favorable basis for the spread of peaceful nuclear technology and the united states recognized in article iv commitment to action by nuclear powersto contribute16 however that cooperation must also be in conformity with the article s i and ii obligations not to develop manufacture or tran sfer nuclear weapons technol ogy some

treaty us officials have argued to make india an exception to nonproliferation norms in order to strengthen nonproliferation17 article vi similarly there are measures in the npt to verify compliance with the article vi obligation to pursue nego tiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament and on treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control in 1967 us negotiators argued that it would not be feasible to incorporate specific obligations toward disarm ament in the treaty itself the differences that have prevented agreement on these measures have not yet been resolved18 the 1995 and 2000 review conferences identified p ractical steps toward disarmament but there are still disagreements about the legal stat us of those steps and their implications for noncompliance assistant secretary of stat stephen rademaker remarked in april 2005 that the 13 steps do not encapsulate the oblig ations of article vi in the npt the obligations of article vi are encapsulated in article vi19 the united states has reported on article vi implementation20 highlighting those steps it has taken to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in its deployed forces other states however complain of us noncompliance because the united states tinues to conduct resear ch and
