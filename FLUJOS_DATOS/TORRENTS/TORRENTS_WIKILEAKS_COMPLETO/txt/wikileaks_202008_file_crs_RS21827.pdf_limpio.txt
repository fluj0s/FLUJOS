congressional intent by discriminating against banks or their subsidiaries or affiliates10 the act implemented the concept of functional regulation the bill generally adheres to the principle of functional regulation which holds that similar activities should be regulated by the sa regulator different regulators have expertise at supervising different activities it is inefficient and impractical to expect regulator to have or to develop expertise in regulating all aspects of financial services accordingly the bill is inte nded to ensure that banking activities are regulated by bank regulators securities activities are regulated by securities regulators and insurance activities are regulated by insurance regulators11 the concept of functional regulation as implemented in the glb act has been praised and criticized some praise it for opening communication among sectoral regulators12 others criticize it for not modernizing financial services regulation at all but rather

under that expedited review the us supreme court in october 2003 decided not to review an important decision of the 4th circuit court of appeals24 that action left standing the 4th circuits decision in cline v hawke25 in effect upholding the comptrollers letter ruling preempting certain provisions of west virginias insurance law26 those provisions had imposed some restrictions on bank employees selling insurance to loan applicants and had require d banks to sell insurance in an area separate from its lending and deposittaking activities27 in its letter the comptroller had found that those provisions prevented west virginia banks from crossmarketing effectively and efficiently therefore significantly interfered with their federally granted power to sell insurance and were thus preempted28 the naic had disagreed with that standard of preemption arguing that the glb act had ex pressly reaffirmed the mccarranferguson act and codified functi onal regulation of insurance by the states29 observers generally agree that the effect of this supreme court decision and other court cases has been to allow the comptroller to expand the scope of preemption under the glb act30 the

national banks are insurance31 in essence debt cancellation contract functions like credit insurance borrower pays fee for contract or contractual provi sion promising to cancel or pay the loan in the event of some specified event such as the borrowers death disability or unemployment32 state insurance regulators have maintained that debt cancellation contracts are insurance and therefore subject to their jurisdiction ev when issued by national banks the comptroller has maintained just as steadfastly that debt cancellation contracts are banking products not insurance and are theref ore not subject to insurance regulation33 the glb act attempted to resolve this conflict title iii of the act titled insurance provided that th insurance activities of any person shall be functionally regulated by the states 34 in the next section title iii provided an exception for products authorized by the comptroller as of january 1 199935 most but not all states have accepted an interpretation of these provisions that excludes their insurance supervisors from regulating debt cancellation contracts36 other states have determined that debt cancellation contracts are insurance but they have declined to regulate them37 particularly after the comptr oller adopted consumer protect ion rules in 2002 that flatly excluded state regulation38 these disagreements over the scope of functional regulation are not academic they affect the regulatory burdens that attach to particular product designations in this example credit insurance is arguably mu ch more regulated than analogous products offered by national banks as debt cancellation contracts39 redefining the coverage as banking product not subject to insurance regulation eases banks regulatory burdens

whether such proposed improvements in insurance regula tion will improve the operation of the risk transfer marketplace generally in the us or the regulation of insurers as financial intermediaries45
