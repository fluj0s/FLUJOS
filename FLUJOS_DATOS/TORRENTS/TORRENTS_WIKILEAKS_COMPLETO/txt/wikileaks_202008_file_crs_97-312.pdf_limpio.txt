first brought the issue to national prominence when the state health commissioner declared state of emergency there on august 2 1978 cerclas purpose is to authorize the federal government to respond swiftly to hazardous substance emergencies and pr otect public health and the environment by cleaning up the nations worst hazardous wa ste sites the law seeks to make those responsible for the improper disposal of hazardous waste bear the costs and accept responsibility for their actions and it also established the zardous substance superfund trust fund to fina nce response acti ons where

not enacted legi slation to reauthorize the tax fy1995 was the last full fiscal year in which the department of the treasury collected the tax however interest and cost recoveries from responsible par

epa has conducted three rounds of superfund reforms that consist of various initiatives and pilots implemented within the existing statutory framework under cercla in june 1993 epa introduced the first round of reforms to increase the pace of site investigation and construction completion activities in february 1995 epa introduced the second round of reforms to address concerns over enforcement economic redevelopment of sites community involvement and outreach environmen tal justice consistent program implementation and state empowerment in october 1995 epa introduced the third and final round of reforms consisting of 20 initiatives designed to make costeffective cleanup choices that protect public health and the environment reduce the volume of litigation and the amount of legal expenses and sure that states and communities are more informed and involved in cleanup decisions epa reports that the implementation of its reforms through the end of fy1997 has accomplished

and institutional controls removal or emergency removal is an action taken by epa under the emergency removal provisions of cercla which enables the agency to take preliminary steps to clean up site or reduce its danger when there is an imminent and substantial threat to public health or the environment an emergency removal cannot exceed 2 milli on or one year for any one action at any one site the most recent data on the types of re medies selected were compiled in 1991 at that time epa selected treatment as the remedy for 78 of sites with ground water contaminati on and 65 with surface water contamination when soil contamination occurred epa selected treatment at 50 of sites epa tends to select containment remedies for large volumes of waste at sites for example greater than one
