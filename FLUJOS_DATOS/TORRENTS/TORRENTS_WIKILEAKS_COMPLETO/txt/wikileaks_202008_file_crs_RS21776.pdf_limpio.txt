select the data and design methodologies to make the antidumping calculations6 it makes international economic policy choices for the us governme nt the us government has very broad discretion in calculating cost and price of sh rimp exports from the six countries including cost and price definitions and comparisons that will affect any dumping margins opponents of the petitions seek
