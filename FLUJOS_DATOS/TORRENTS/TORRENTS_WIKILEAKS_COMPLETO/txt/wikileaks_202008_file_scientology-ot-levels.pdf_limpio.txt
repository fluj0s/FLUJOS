grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 22 september 1966 clearing course students ot course confidential students clear and ot definition of clear thetan who can be at cause knowingly and at will over mental matter energy space and time in clearing you move the being up to where he is cause over mental mest clear has erased the matter energy space and time connected to the thing called mind he has been cleared of the mass pictures etc it is negative gain clear occurs when he stops mocking up bank or realizes he is doing it clear has perhaps not entirely lost the automaticity of mocking up mass but at least he knows he is putting it there and practice increases his general reality clear may at first have little trouble with thought his think is quite powerful and is not influenced by bank but may be influenced by his own past postulates thus he may run into difficulty with his own postulates in present time his own past postulates and others present time postulates especially when he has two or more postulates or similar magnitude opposing each other at first his postulates will contain force probably and he may experience pain from these as thetan clear will have considerable influence upon others around him people whose ability to confront is not very high will begin to fall to pieces in the presence of clear one mechanism of this is that the clear tends to raise the people around him to slightly higher level of confront and they begin to confront their own mind and this really shakes them up this is particularly so of an sp who dares not look at his mind because he knows that if he does he will go insane the emeter will read on clear on thought it will read on postulate and assert the clears think influences the body thus causing the meter to read definition of an operating thetan thetan who can be at cause knowingly and at will over thought life matter energy space and time subjective and objective after clear we are starting to move into cause over thought and life in part one of the ot course the clear uses the same materials as are used on the clearing course and runs any banks he did not complete before he went clear this activity is in the realm of thought but it is these banks which brought the being down the dwindling spiral and we must be sure that they are never again going to have any effect on the being there are also positive gains to be had from this activity the being is becoming more at cause over thought he is on his way to operating thetan when clear moves up to cause over his own and other thought life matter energy space and time he is an operating thetan the width between wog and clear is very great the width between clear and ot is bit wider lrhfh l ron hubbard copyright 1966 by l ron hubbard all rights

you are clear well done and congratulations this state has not previously been attained in this universe and we must all work towards getting more people many more people up to this level essentially you are clear on the 1st dynamic and still have lot of work in front of you to attain ot which is to say the remaining dynamics but nevertheless you will find you have many abilities hitherto undreamed of an ethical code already exists for ots so at the state of clear one should not assume one has license to do just whatever one will you still have the remaining dynamics to go so dont use the abilities you have attained already to enslave others or indeed yourself with freedom comes responsibility and with responsibility comes the need to assess ones actions and to take only such actions as will do the greatest good over the greatest number of dynamics so the policies of scientology which have enabled you to reach the state of clear still apply to all clears in fact they apply more because you have the reality of their value and the necessity of seeing that they are followed those who have not yet attained clear will be watching you with some awe so you have the duty of setting an example of exemplary behavior in all aspects of your life as clear you have privileges beyond being declared clear as result bigger responsibilities will be given and expected of you so you must be prepared to responsibly educate yourself where necessary so that you can do whatever is assigned to you in proper manner in keeping with the main goals and aims of scientology so for you there is sitting down and resting on your laurels waiving of policy promiscuous 2nd dynamic activities improper assumption of power control or influence or assuming that you automatically know best in every situation it is crime to invalidate the state of clear see to it that you dont do this in your conduct as clear particularly as regards yourself you still have the rest of your dynamics to go you have now become more than ever part of team obsessive individualism and failure to organise were responsible for getting into the state we got into as soon as you have gone the rest of the way this will become abundantly plain i expect and need your help to carry out the broad mission of decontaminating this area of the universe if you wish to help your first duty is to protect the repute of the state of clear by exemplary conduct your second duty is to attain ot as soon as possible your third if you wish to help is to become part of the endeavour to clean up this sector of the universe and make it safe not only for ourselves but the billions of others who have been harmed as clear you are welcomed and honoured dont do anything that will wear out your welcome or bring dishonour on yourself or upon other clears thank you for what you have done so far thank you for what you will do in the future i know i can count on you lrhlrh l ron hubbard copyright 1967 founder by l ron

assnorg sec hat as the first issue in the keeping hco sec hat scientology working series case sup hat ds of p hat ds of t hat staff member hat franchise issued may 1965 keeping scientology working series 1 note neglect of this pol ltr has caused great hardship on staffs has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out international effort to restore basic scientology over the world within 5 years after the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and execu tives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it special message the following policy letter means what it says it was true in 1965 when i wrote it it was true in 1970 when i had it reissued i am reissuing it now in 1980 to avoid again slipping back into period of omitted and quickied fundamen tal grade chart actions on cases thereby denying gains and threatening the viability of scientology and of orgs scientology will keep working only as long as you do your part to keep it working by applying this policy letter what i say in these pages has always been true it holds true today it will still hold true in the year 2000 and it will continue to hold true from there on out matter where you are in scientology on staff or not this policy letter has something to do with you all levels37keeping scientology working hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and all new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the technology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only where there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the task of the assn or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the technology three knowing it is correct four teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out incorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently seven is done by few but is weak point38eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in any area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the nottoobright have bad point on the button selfimportance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evolve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had longrun value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basic suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so 1 know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical and undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures selfabnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorses degraded novels selfabnega tion has filled the southeast asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had not supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that if in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there remains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuableonly so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defense of organization of dissemination of application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are39discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is factthe group left to its own devices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatizations of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolvepsychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seven eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth nj wichita the early organi zations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bankagreement has been what has made earth helland if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselves thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructive when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bankdominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail40so just dont play that game do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end auditor b qd and ad with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all too typical example the instructor should have done seven eight nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained their certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet they were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on the course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertaken because nobody at levels to iv is going to get that much ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an emeter ta dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win41actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straight ened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncomprehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree the most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so proper instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enroll who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrolls consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universenever permit an openminded approach if theyre going to quit let them quit fast if they enrolled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of uswin or die in the attempt never let them be halfminded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one nambypamby bunch of pantywaist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it seem mild but only the tigers surviveand even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger when we instruct halfmindedly and are afraid to offend scared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs pattycake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in her eye into fixed42dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humor her and we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead than incapable fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high priests its our possible failure to retain and practice our technology an

10acting in any way calculated to lose the technology of dianetics and scientology to use or impede its use or shorten its materials or its application reason the effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades the pressure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions reinstituting full use and delivery of dianetics and scientology is the answer to any recovery the

clearing course instruction booklet mechanics of the bank anything in the bank that occurs several times will not erase unless its the earliest time it occurred this is known as the basic on the chain number of similar things early to late in different points of time make chain when you have the earliest erased the rest erases easily however when the earliest one is erased the next to last is the new basic and must be erased in its turn and so on as this goes on the items of the chain eventually begin to blow erase very easily therefore if items cease to erase easily you have not properly handled the item just before it and may not have handled the same item in the earlier run even if you get reads out of later run than the one you are supposed to be in you will find the later one still reads when you get to it properly and will then erase nicely the real sneaker in the r6 bank is the person himself at the time this we call the thetan in the item each item has an impression of the being as he was at the moment of the item long ago if one does not spot this each time it will not erase and mass builds up as we go along this means look at or locate yourself as thetan at the time of the incident it is not the light it is right where you are in the auditing chair but of course ages past spot means glance at q greek letter theta qn is trick way of saying thetan if as you read this you can glance at the wall you can spot it reads well one then has to get the earliest moment of ones own beingness in the bank and spot it then one has to spot it for each item one runs one spots the thetan and the item or in the objects the items at the same time this is bit of trick it is simultaneous spotting spotting the thetan in called verbal item can be done at the same time as the item is called ordinarily one calls or spots the item few times and then also calls and spots the thetan the thetan can also then be spotted without calling or spotting the item the right way is the way you get the most reads soon one begins to be expert at it but then one must be expert at it with item 1 part 1 run 1 or it builds up one had tiny bit of mass on him right at the start as he was protesting this is slight as it is enough to tie down the chain by leaving it with basic so spot the thetan each time spotting the environment at the time is also possible48duration of auditing find quiet place in which to audit audit an hour or two at time preferable the same time each day day you dont audit is session lost trying to make up session is useless audit daily when you dont you lose sessions it isnt how much you get done in session its the getting on bit by bit that counts its like digging long ditch what you dont dig isnt dug the bank contains less than was first thought but it contains enough in three or four months you will have make it if you do good job on each item and dont fool about with the bank it goes into restimulation if you stir it up and dont decide lot of things your ability to postulate is increasing and you can decide run is flat or doesnt need to be run and have it behave that way but it will still be there to knock you down the cause of trouble the only way one can get ill or in trouble is not auditing in trying to correct the items given or in not following instructions what doesnt make items read properly loud shouting body movement while calling fiddling the onehand electrode tensing muscles getting angry with the lack of read gritting teeth auditing past an arc break doing list 7 every time you dont get read or feel odd what makes items read properly doing regular sessions not self auditing out of session staying calm keeping calm keeping the auditors code on the pc you following directions exactly adding nothing finding arc breaks when they happen with list 7 list 7 run as an assessment for arc break will run easily locate and indicate the bypassed charge as it shows up if you are not classed auditor get this done in qual division that has classed auditor either on or through the clearing course if you really bog down auditing by list 7 will give you the relief sought auditing in place you feel secure and where you wont be disturbed audit daily not auditing too long at one time 1 to 2 hours is optimum closer to 1 than 2 not trying to get rid of it all at once considering it routine piece of ditch digging not expecting to fly suddenly not dwelling on your case out of session49when you end session end it being plodding and methodical just getting on with it getting all the reads off by calling or spotting going on to the next item if it doesnt read get more off last item and return to the one that wouldnt read getting in the buttons supp inval protest when needed only checking for earlier or later runs only when in trouble only handle trouble when it arrives dont try to handle it before it does the best way to stay out of trouble is read study and understand these instructions before beginning basic basic the first earliest bit in the bank is not an item but light it appears to the left front of the face some distance away look ahead and to the left bit and youll spot it it is the source of unconsciousness and produces it when contacted there is light before each run in the middle of each 7s gpm every 4 pairs at the start of basic end words at the start of confusion gpm and at the start of the objects and at the end of each type of item in the objects every 8 items each time you feel groggy its light doing it each major change then is preceded by the light mark these in on your platens if they are not there flatten each one by spotting it and it and thetan anaten unconsciousness can be spotted away it is part of the light when the light went on the thetan went anaten instead of solo auditor going anaten in his session it is only necessary to spot the anaten in the thetan when running the light when you spot light or object or combination of objects you should get read on the needle by spotting the same thing again you get another read by spotting it again you get another read and so you continue to spot it time after time until more reads occur by reason of spotting you repeat verbal items aloud getting read each time you repeat until it has more reads verbal items are found in the 7s basic end words and confusion gpm but you silently spot lights objects combinations of objects repeatedly same one until you have more reads you should get as many falls etc from spotting light as you do from calling an item spotting the thetan follows the same rules you spot repeatedly until there are more reads on the needle by reason of spotting the thetan self at that instant and place you dont have to see the light to spot it or see the thetan or see the object or objects you only need to spot the place where they are with the idea of what should be there of course seen at first or not continued spotting makes it blow50 pattern of the bank the apparent pattern of the bank is as follows there are five parts these occur in row this row of 5 parts is called run the first earliest of these is the 7s the second just above the 7s is the basic end words the third just above the basic end words is the confusion gpm the fourth just above the confusion gpm is the objects hollow the fifth just above the objects hollow is the objects solid after run of b c d and we begin again with the 7s for the next run the parts go as they do in the first run 7s then basic end words then confusion gpm then the objects hollow then the objects solid therefore the trick is always to run only the earliest run available and not get into later runs the bank has 10 runs or 50 parts none of these use gpm line plot they only contain what is given on the platen you are issued the proper way to run it all is to get on with it after 10 runs you may have to go from run 1 to run 10 all over again anyway to get any final bits so your first running of the whole 10 runs may not be your final run51 how to use platen each student must supply himself with foolscap paper the platen is then laid aside the foolscap paper and you repeat the number on the actual foolscap paper across the top of the foolscap paper is written the students name the name of the part being run the number of the run and the date the reads on the items are written on the foolscap paper alongside the number of the item to keep from cramping your reads and have enough paper on all parts just take legal foolscap size paper and use the items consecutively numbers and go down the page as far as necessary to record all reads then leave space and write the next number it is too hard to keep the numbers even on the platen and worksheet number work sheet by page number of platen consecutive letter page 1 of platen becomes page 1a b c of worksheet label each worksheet well in order to save paper bulk continue down your piece of foolscap paper from session to session dating each new session start 52use both sides of your foolscap paper but use separate auditor reports for each session of course any comments that need to be written down must be put on another sheet of paper only the actual reads including any buttons that are used and any cognitions should be written on your foolscap paper do not write the name of the items only the pair number and item number leave some space on your foolscap paper when you complete an item so that if the next item does not read you then have sufficient space to go back and add more in if necessary to the previous item do not write anything on the platen when you return your auditors reports and worksheets always use paper clips never use stapler on this course running items always run the earliest item first flatten it and go on to next item complete the part go to first item in next part etc one calls the item and marks its reads until one longer gets reads then one calls the next item and marks its reads until it longer reads then one can call the first item of the pair again and second item calling them as pair until they longer read the reads obtained on an item by calling pair are put under the appropriate item number all the reads for any one item are recorded in the same place on the worksheet regardless of when the item is called such as calling as pair or in rerunning space should be left after each item so that reads can be added when calling the pair or in the case of having to go back and get more charge off an item whenever you move the tone arm down mark on your worksheet bd and put the new ta position in the blank space eg bd 30 if an item does not read the moment it is called then you have left the item just before it charged so call the earlier item again and get the read or reads off it making sure you dont go into later run then call the item that didnt read the first time and you will find it instantly reads when you leave an item to go back to previous one put on the item you leave and at the item you go back to if you go back more than one item put for as many items as you go back ie if you go back three items you put on the item left and on each item gone back over each item must be called in turn up to the place where you went back from note this can easily be overdone getting all reads off earlier items as you can put yourself into later runs so moderation in this goes long way but never ignore the fact that new item didnt read the first time it was called it always means you didnt get all reads off the item immediately before or that you failed to spot the thetan at the moment never go past nonreading item when running clearing course material you find you get certain amount of reads on an item correct run type reads are fs lfs sbds bds then the following item in the same session will get approximately the same amount of reads if not and you get only few reads then go back to the previous item that read well and you will find there is more charge on it after that the next item will read with approximately the same number of53reads as the previous one one doesnt muck about with concepts or other maunderings the item is the item and cognitions do or dont appear the item is the thing and calling it is what makes it read if the items go on reading dont try to suppress them items read big and many times you may get as many as 25 or more large reads on every item the main thing is to clear get all the charge off each item for the run you are in be sure to keep in the correct run remember if you get bored with so many reads to take the boredom off as button you can just throw away reads because you get tired of seeing it read your purpose is to clean each item not make yourself interested or happy or entertained lot of it is just hard slogging work if you clean them up as you go all will be well you can sometimes erase an item and have it then read as lock or lock item test it for lock if it reads too long if you find you are getting small reads ie ticks small falls check to see if there is any charge left on the previous item and check to see if you are in the correct run falls and blowdowns are expected on each item not just small reads dont go on calling the item if you are getting small reads find the outness and correct it keep auditors reports for each session dont try to run the same item out of all runs at one time just proceed from bottom up run by run in order item by item part by part take care to stay in the correct run it is now proved fact that none of the basic bank will erase on preclear until all the lower grades are properly established on preclear and then the basic bank confronted in its exactness item by item in sequence and in its exact relationship to the rest of the bank know then that 1 there is haphazard blowing of bank 2 item blows out of context 3 there are prior holes blown in the bank for anyone matter what the nature of any prior auditing might have been until the item has actually been run pain pain pn occurs only when you left something charged behind you earlier sicknesssickness is part of the somatic it runs out flattenflatten every item thoroughly erasureyou are not seeking release from the bank at this level you are erasing therefore the bank has blown is nonsense one has blown from the bank so get back in it and run it total erasure is the aim readno read on new item is always followed by long falls and blowdowns never bypass an item just because it didnt read sure passport to upset is to leave items alive and go on or to skip an item because it didnt read they all will read rerunif you start getting pain or sickness you got into later run or you by passed some charge and must rerun the earlier area you just did some thing is still alive if in doubt rerun the lot from the start of the part erase thoroughly but if it is later run get back into the correct one54neglectif you run upwards getting reads at all on several items and still go on you will become quite upset do not go past nonreading items find out what is wrong immediately and remedy it bypassed charge use l7 on yourself if you dont quickly find reasons for pain or upset readswrite down using the code every read you get after the item that it occurred on write for item that didnt read at first read even when it then reads example lfsbdfffsbd

56mistakes and illness about the only thing that can make you ill on the clearing course is your own error losing your place on the plot skipping or rerunning between sessions little can happen you cannot repair but at the start of session you may pick up in error something you have already run or skip and pick up late ie you have done 133 you start at 129 the next session more seriously you have not done 141 to 144 but begin the next session at 145 if you skip 4 items and do light you will surely become ill by illness is meant colds flu dysentery etc to prevent becoming ill be very careful of your place very careful to pick up where you left off very careful not to skip and you will do very well if you do become physically ill down in bed it is almost certain you missed items

auditor materials which could be skipped gradient for him gpm goals problem mass 1if you took two fire hoses and pointed them at each other their streams would not reach each others nozzles but would splatter against one another in midair if this splatter were to hang there it would be ball of messed up water call hose the force the pc has used to execute his goal call hose b the force other dynamics have used to oppose that goal where these two forces have perpetu ally met mental mass is created this is the picture of any problemforce opposing force with resultant mass where the pcs goal meets constant opposition you have in the reactive mind the resultant mass caused by the two forces goal force of getting it done opposition force opposing it getting done this is the goal problem mass 2the problem created by two or more opposing ideas which being opposed balanced and unresolved make mass its mental energy mass implant gpm implant goals problem mass an implant gpm is gpm made up of goals and their opposing forces which are not the pcs own but which have been implanted in him an implant is an electronic means of overwhelming thetan with significance an implanted goal is goal the thetan himself has not decided upon but which has been induced in him by overwhelming force and persuasion in the case of implanted goals problem masses use was made of the mechanics of the actual pattern of living to impress and entrap thetan and enforce obedience to behaviour patterns the goal selected was not entirely based on any goal of the thetan but was an entirely arbitrary selection both as to goal and pattern by those conducting the implanting terminal also refered to as term 1it would be any fixed mass utilized in communication system that i60think is the best of the various definitions that have come out for this any mass used in fixed position in any communications system thus you see man would be terminal but post could also be terminal 2an item or identity the pc has actually been sometime in the past or present is called terminal it is the pcs own valence at that time in the goals problem mass the black masses of the reactive mind those identities which when contacted produce pain tell us at once that they are terminals the person could feel pain only as himself thetan plus body and therefore identities he has been produce pain when its mental residues black masses are recontacted in processing opposition terminal also referred to as oppterm 1an item or identity the pc has actually opposed fought been an enemy of sometime in the past or present is called an opposition terminal as the person identified himself as not it he could experience from it only sensation an opposition terminal when its mental residues black masses are recontacted in processing produces only sensation never pain electrically terminal is one of the two poles between or through which current flows we got the idea of two different types of terminals in gpms because thats the way they are one the pc thinks of as his own or himself the other he thinks of as an opposition hence we use terminal to mean what the pc thinks is his idea and mass in the gpm and we use opposition terminal or oppterm for short to mean the mass and significance he thinks of as the enemy to the one he is in both the terminal and the oppterm in the gpm have mass and significance and have the appearance of receiving and giving communication and so they are called terminals item 1in gpms what we now also call items were first called terminals because they interacted with each other electrically they were always in pairs when one is speaking of either terminal or opposition terminal and isnt being specific as to which it is term or oppterm one says item pair 1 set of two two that go together dichotomy 1a dichotomy in scientologese means plus and minus plus word and minus word they are of the same order of things always crude example would be an apple and applelessness thats pair dichotomy plus and minus interchange current as you will find on any battery so we dont61want activepassive for example the active such as man and the passive such as woman we want the bold plus and minus the opposites the nature of things is major idea each major idea has two parts plus and minus these are opposed to each other they interchange current the conflict what is generally agreed to be the unwanted or poor side is minus what is generally conceived to be all right is plus for example in modern society we would have the major idea that an individual has an ecconomic status wealth is the plus and poverty is the minus so dichotomy means to two parts of major idea 2 opposites two things which when interplayed cause action line plot 1 each gpm has line plot line plot is the pattern of items for every gpm for example each full goal like to grab books would have line plot with items like grabbing books or just grabbed books etc end word an end word is the final word of goal it is always noun or condition made into noun for example with goal such as to grab books books is the end word each end word however has many verb or action words related to it thus making up series of goals end words are called end words because they come on the end of each of series of goals it is the end word that is the common denominator to the whole of gpm whole track 1the whole track is the moment to moment record of persons existence in this universe in pictures and impression form chain 1a series of recordings of similar experiences chain has engrams secondar ies and locks 2 incidents of similar nature strung out in time 3 series of incidents of similar nature or subject matter entities 62the basic definition of entity as contained in standard dictionaries is something that has real and separate existence either actually or in the mind being or existence which is considered distinct and self contained there are various types of entities described in the full works on dianetics and scientology for example cell is living animal all by itself there is the genetic entity ge which is the entity which carries foreward from the earliest formation of the mest body there can be injected entities or sythetic entities some of these are ridges on which facsimilies are planted each one of those things can be thinking entity it thinks it is alive it can think its being as long as energy is fed to it these follow all the rules and laws and phenomena of single beings the full subject of entities is not taken up in this

in the bank or mind it is negative gain clear cognition clear occurs when one stops mocking up bank or realizes that he is mocking it up or has been mocking it up that is the clear cognition the realization that he is or has been mocking up the mass and pictures etc that make up the bank when the person arrives at this realization he can then of course cease mocking up bank clear has perhaps not entirely lost the automaticity of mocking up mass but at least he knows hes putting it there and practice increases his general reality the person who has actually gone clear will express the clear cognition or some version of it upon going clear or at some point on the dianetic clear special intensive he must have expressed this in some way for the cs to know he has in fact gone clear and before being permitted to attest the state of clear can be achieved prior to doing the clearing course it can occur on dianetic auditing especially new era dianetics sometimes it has occurred on goals processing and even on objective processes it is not however attained by feeding people cognitions clears are made through auditing ___________ non confidential verifying and declaring the state of clear when the individual before doing the clearing course thinks he is or might be clear or when he has read on correction list such as cs 53 green form etc as having gone clear he must be given the dianetic clear special intensive to verify the state and rehabilitate it if valid when the steps of the dianetic clear special intensive have been thoroughly done to full end phenomena and full

offense clears are made through auditing not by feeding eps or cognitions to pcs this is important as someone who has not made clear will not make it on ot levels org cses who are clear or above however will need to be able to recognize the state of clear when it occurs on dianetics or otherwise to ensure using the steps of the dianetic clear special intensive that the state is real and to declare any such pc clear when the state has been truly attained once declared the persons pc folders must be clearly marked dianetic clear for security and for purposes of further programming the individual is then issued the standard clear certificate by certs and awards which states simply that he has attained the state of clear this standard certificate bears qualifying statement of the state once the person has attested to clear he may then be csed for further auditing per the programming data above ______________ i am entrusting clear cses with the responsibility of ensuring that

to guide or handle person it is necessary to know something of the nature of being if being were single unit separated from all other beings conditions and current influences the task of understanding him would be relatively simple and philosophers would have had it all worked out long before dianetics and scientology single unit being responds to the most elementary and simple rules and laws you will find in dianetics and scientology affinity reality communication and under standing the time track mental image pictures the earlier incident holding the later in place responses to matter energy space time form as well as force and the axloms on this you can rest assured and one might even wonder why we need all the additional bulletins and cautions and provisions and lectures the fact of the matter is that when one addresses person human being in the flesh one is not addressing simple being possibly an example will illustrate this i had just finished giving congress and staff member had made some appointments for to see people who wanted to talk to and in conference room i was suddenly confronted by woman who was demonstrably and actively insane she was incoherent she was being pursued she was utterly agitated well i was not then and never was in the business of treating the insane yet here was situation which had to be handled if only to maintain social calm in those days there were many techniques for exteriorizing people and so i used one of them putting her back of her head promptly she went sane calmly reviewed her problem with her husband sensibly made up her mind what she was going to do to properly resolve the matter thanked and departed for brief time she had temporarily become single unit being i have not given the example as lesson in what to do in such cases for exteriorization techniques are not reliable but only to illustrate the complexity of people what you see as human being person is not single unit being in the first place there is the matter of valence person can be himself or he can be under the belief that he is another person or thing entirely this removes him step from being simple being then there is the matter of being in body body is very complex contrivance quite remarkable quite complicated and it is also quite subject to its own distortions there are also the entities as discussed in dianetics the modern science of67mental health pages 8490 and also the history of man pages 1314 43 75 77 these follow all the rules and laws and phenomena of single beings and then there is the matter of influences of other people around this human being from single simple being there is progressive complication setting in as one adds all these other factors the single simple being without any further associations can be out of valence even miles away from other contacts it is the aggregate of all these factors which you address when you seek to guide or handle the usual human being this is also why objective processes are so effective they get many of these factors all going in the same direction for once none of this is to say that it is impossible to handle all this far from it but it does tell one why all the additional precautions like dont overrun like careful session procedures are there in all those materials but mainly it tells you that full recoveries seldom happen last and that cases require an awful lot of work and often for very long time and like the woman at the congress one sometimes gets sudden nearmagical result the trouble with that one was that she soon went back into her head and became again composite even though she now did have sane plan of action to follow results if you follow the rules and laws carefully and with good heart can be obtained and you knowing your business can obtain them but dont become discouraged if it all doesnt happen fast and if it takes long time when you are handling human being you are handling composite we did not construct the human mind or human body we did not put the universe there to involve oppress or complicate life we are working with the end product of an awful lot of trials and tribulations if we were working with single beings it would be nothing to do we are not we are working with complexity and we can do an awful lot far more than anyone could do before us and our work with life has effects and influences far beyond our auditing tables it took vast vast numbers of years and eons for life to get that involved and complicated be glad that it doesnt take even tiny fraction of that to dig it out and smooth it out with

he receives from the practitioner an acknowledgment that it has occurred that i the auditing cycle sh spec 189 6209c18 2 there are basically two communication cycles between the auditor and the pc

action goes through where in the action is started is continued for as long as is required and then is completed as planned scientology abridged dictionary the definitions above are taken from the technical dictionary in solo auditing the auditing question or auditing command is provided in the materials the solo auditor has to ensure that he understands the auditing question or auditing command gets the answer to the question or carries out the command and recognizes that he has done so and completes that cycle solo auditing mainly consists of carrying out cycles of action this is easy to do as these are given in the materials and it consists of doing what the materials say to do verbalization the solo auditor does not verbalize questions or commands in solo auditing it is done on thought or intention level there is solo auditing action in which the solo auditor calls items verbally but otherwise solo auditing is not verbalized meter error in solo auditing the meter worksheets and materials must be arranged so that the solo auditor can read the meter at the same time as he reads the question or item in the materials this is because the question or item will read on the meter when the solo auditor reads the question or item in the materials one should not ignore the meter read when first reading the question or item in the materials this is especially true when checking reads on ruds or doing bpc assessment as the read might not repeat the initial read when the question or item is first read and understood by the solo auditor is taken this is because the read occurs when the solo auditor thinks the question or concept of the item another meter error could occur if the solo auditor didnt understand the question or item you could get reaction because the question or item was misunderstood and if the question or item is misunderstood then you wouldnt be able to audit it therefore it is very important that the solo auditor knows to clear the meanings of words in auditing commands and items solo drills the solo drills are designed to familiarize the solo auditor with the tools of solo auditing and to become skilled so that when the time comes to start solo auditing he can put his full attention on the auditing and thus be fully in session l ron hubbard founder as assisted by snr cs int lrhdmdr copyright 1979 by l ron hubbard all

saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 20 may 1968 corrected reissued 5 march 1974 only change is in this type style remimeo overtmotivator sequence dianetics courses level two solo audit ot sections there was an important discovery made in 1952 on the subject of engrams which did not get included in book one dianetics the modern science of mental health this was the overtmotivator sequence of engrams an overt in dianetics and scientology is an aggressive or destructive act by the individual against one or another of the 8 dynamics self family group mankind animals or plants mest life or the infinite motivator is an aggressive or destructive act received by the person or one of the dynamics the viewpoint from which the act is viewed resolves whether the act is an overt or motivator the reason it is called motivator is because it tends to prompt that one pays it backit motivates new overt when one has done something bad to someone or something one tends to believe it must have been motivated when one has received something bad he also may tend to feel he must have done something to deserve it the above points are true the actions and reactions of people on the subject are often very falsified people go about believing they were in an auto accident when in actual fact they caused one also people may believe they caused an accident when they were only in one some people on hearing of death at once believe they must have killed the person even though they were far away268police in large cities have people turn up and confess to almost every murder as routine one doesnt have to be crazy to be subject to the overtmotivator sequence it is not only used on him continually by others it also is basic part of his own case there are two extreme stages of overtmotivator phenomena one is person who gives up only motivators always done to him and the other is the person who has done only overts done to others in running engrams you will find 1all overt engrams that hang up wont audit easily have also motivator engram as the same or different incident 2all motivator engrams that hang up have an overt engram in the same or different incident the two types of engrams then are overt engrams and motivator engrams example of overt engram shooting dog example of motivator engrambeing bitten by dog the rule is that the subject matter must be similar they can be in different points in time when you cant run out erase dog bite engram why then you find the shoot dog engram psychosomatic ills or aberrations that do not resolve by running one side usually resolve by finding and running the other when you cant erase an engram about shooting dog why then theres bitten by dog its all very simple really there are always two sides to the coin if one wont run you try the other basics finding the basic engram on chain also applys to finding the basic overt or basic motivator engram engrams then hang up wont run out when the other type needs to be run and b the one found has earlier engrams on it269nonextant engrams an engram sometimes didnt exist pc can be trying to run being run over by car when he never was what needs to be done when the incident wont run is get the pcs incident of running over somebody it also works in reverse pc can be trying to recall an engram of running over somebody when he was in fact only run over himself and never did run over anyone so both engrams can exist and be run or only one side exists and can be run or with heavy foulup on overts and motivators one side can be nonfactual and wont run because only the other side exists it is easy to visualize this as matter of flows an overt of course is an outflow and motivator is an inflow secondaries it may never have been said that secondaries always sit squarely on incidents of actual pain and unconsciousness also secondaries can exist on the overtmotivator sequence pattern just as in engrams this is the cause of frozen emotions or unemotional people also some people complain they cant feel anymore this works out by overtmotivator sequence person in grief over loss grief is always loss who then cant run it has caused grief and that overtsecondary can be run also person misemotional over causing grief has been caused grief it works both ways with all points on the tone scale the last is newer discovery and wasnt known to early dianeticists the overtmotivator engram phenomena did not receive adequate dissemination the principle applied to secondaries has not before been released it is basically dianetic engram running that resolves all cases in the end so one had better be pretty good at auditing engrams and secondaries motivator and overt both l ron hubbard founder lrh jpntcdenjh copyright 1968 1974 by l

called cumulative cluster cluster is group of body thetans crushed or held together by some mutual bad experience cumulative cluster is group of two or more clusters crushed or held together by some mutual bad experience cumulative cluster looks like this the shapes are for illustration only 3 clusters impacted together driven or wedged tightly together by1898 impact horse accident276b the type of mutual incident is first established in this case an impact when the 1898 incident is then datelocated one cluster the square part blows on the meter you get lf or bd and fn when the incident is

meter read as electric shock when the incident is datelocated 93 million years ago on planet x or more exact location another cluster blows one cluster the earliest portion of the cumulative cluster now remains f the type of mutual incident is established as an implant this is datelocated 72 trillion years ago in area of planet z and the final cluster blows277notein datelocating you get an fn on dating blow and an fn on locating blow each fns handling any single bts remaining from cluster aa single bts remaining from cumulutive cluster bb you must check by meter read for any bt remaining from cluster if there is one locate the bt and handle him to blow with inc ii and inc i the needle will fn as he blows off important note if one of the incidents you ran on the cumulative cluster happened

supervision i have lately been case supervising number of temporarily failed ot iii cases and have them all running well on solo now the errors made are more or less as follows 1the solo auditor cannot audit has not absorbed his training or at least isnt putting it into practice heshe cannot put ruds in or do other elementary auditing actions the remedy is to get the solo auditor better trained this may be matter of cramming or it may be matter of the pre ot retreading his solo course if the person then still has trouble on this level he would need thorough retread of his solo auditor course part two the best idea by far is to be at least class vi auditor those who make fastest progress on iii are class viiis of course 2the case has not been well prepared due to earlier quickied or incomplete grades or rundowns the case is so overcharged that the solo auditor cannot front up to auditing at ot iii out of this you get the pathetic case that declares none on ot iii and tries to attest or the one who runs five or six says thats all and tries to attest there have been cases that took one look at ot iii materials rabbitwhich is to say run away and attest hurriedly the remedy for all these is to get ruds well in and use the correction lists appropriate to the solo level they have done including an ldn b get the person more training as in 1 above and c get the person through the level standardly using review as needed to an ot iii attest these two actions take care of the majority of difficult cases on ot iii280these two points have been pretty prevalent poor auditing and finding none or few on ot iii so much so that i have found few true completions on ot iii and an awful lot of ot vis who were really only ot ii all such should be brought in and remedied as per 1 and 2 above it is poor thing to have them stumbling around with false grade ot iii is not fast grade further iii remedies the common garden varieties used by case supervisor in day to day ot iii session csing or the troubles an ot ii solo auditor runs into on ot iii now and then in sessions follows 3high ta this comes from not completing the incidents ii and i on body thetans bts 4the solo auditor puts too wide an attention span on the bt and runs two or three when he is intending to run only one 5a cluster just wont break up the remedy is to check for cumulative cluster or mutual incident of another date with mutual incident of another date the type of incident would first be established and the incident then datelocated per hcob 15 nov 78 dating and locating cumulative cluster would be handled per hcob 25 oct 69ra rev 16 aug 83 secret cluster formation cumulative until the cluster was completely blown when these actions are done in review and completed the solo auditor is sent back to solo to continue with ot iii there is another action which may be done in review when cluster wont break up the review lists for impacts or incidents that would cause cluster and handles the item obtained from the list with datelocate when the review action is complete the pre ot goes back to solo auditing ot iii 6ruds go out on bts this is the usual reason solo auditor suddenly feels he doesnt want to audit or needs review the solo auditor doesnt realize sometimes he is dealing with living individuals and roughs them up putting the ruds out on them the remedy of course is to locate bts who have out ruds put the ruds in and run incident i at which the bt should leave 7a theta bopping meter sometimes puzzles solo auditor on ot iii this means bt is trying to exteriorize and cant the remedy is to complete the partially run incident ii or incident i or in extreme cases put the ruds in on the hung up bt 8one hand electrode giving wrong ta read baffling the solo auditor with floating needles with high ta the remedy is to have two hand electrodes handy and trim the trim knob so the 1 hand electrode reads the same as the two hand electrodes to check the real ta on occasion 9a suppressive body thetan sometimes isnt auditable the remedy is to run grade iv then inc ii and inc i if this doesnt do it get power run on the sp bt the greatest error is to get upset with one of these put the ruds out and make him submerge in this case the suppress button is put in or he is prepchecked and then run on grade iv power inc ii and inc i these sp bts are far less common than is supposed solo auditors281with faults as in paragraphs 1 and 2 above or who miss other matters blame every fault on sp bts they do however exist 10by far and large the corniest error and which has been very prevalent is not knowing the materials of ot iii or the content of inc ii or inc i this can get pretty bad ive seen people running inc ii with the date of i but the funniest error under not knowing the materials is reading wild adventures alleged to be inc ii and inc 1 inc i and inc ii are very precise indeed the remedy is to send the solo auditor back to starrate his ot iii pack 11a bt can be overrun this fact sometimes causes solo auditor to believe ot iii is overrun if he asks is ot iii overrun he may get read and blowdown this is actually just one bt or cluster that is overrun the way such an overrun can occur is covered in hcob 4 may 68r rev 16 aug 83 issue ii overrun on iii the remedy is finding out who was overrun discovering and indicating the point of overrun and getting the charge off in that way the bt or cluster may then just depart if not one then runs inc i on the bt or handles the cluster to blow then one carries on with ot iii running with discharged meter with cans not plugged in or with meter at all in short any of the errors you find in auditing can also occur in solo auditing however the faults or troubles 1 to 11 above cover any and all the errors i have found specifically applying to ot iii this grade ot iii is long and very valuable grade it determines whether or not the solo auditor will eventually be real ot but the carelessness and casualness with which some solo auditors often approach ot iii and solo auditors willingness to run one bt and say well the rest dont bother is simply an indication of weakness or treason on the 1st dynamic there is status value to having none on iii or in only finding few or who blew them all in dianetics these indicate solo auditor who is weak and cannot affect others and who needs the handlings in 1 and 2 above ot iii is vital grade one fronts up to it and does it when he is really done the rewards of ot iii exceed his wildest dreams l ron hubbard founder rtculrhrwiw

security certain phenomena develop it will be found that emotions and somatics etc will assess as ever without difference on health form there is change in this however in running the chain may be found to consist of incidents which are connected with ot iii solo auditing as well as events thetans which were not run due to interruptions of solo iii due to errors by the solo auditor and incidents in which the pc received bts as well as impacts making clusters may be encountered such auditing can be apparently full of arc breaks but only if the dianetic auditor departs from the auditors code or regular procedure the auditing situation may seem to demand changed commands etc but the only fallability can occur if the auditor goes nonstandard for example the pc cognites he is not running his own incident but body thetan this requires only tr 4 as it is only an origin acknowledging the fact the auditor simply goes on evaluation by the auditor can easily and dangerously occur for example the pc finds he is relaying the auditing commands to the bt this would seem to indicate that the auditor changed the wording of r3r to have him move ________ or some such alteration to alter commands is fatal soon the pc will find the bt is taking the auditing commands directly and and change of command was needed the pc relaying bt comments back to the auditor is only tr 4 situation unless of course the command was wrong or clarification is rsquested even then the auditor does not go nonstandard the primary dianetic auditor error in running one bt on inc 1 after another is to use abcd instead of 1 2 3 4 the last bt blew the new bt hasnt got date to move to if you just use abcd you do 1234 on the next bt you should realize he is different pc running chain of one emotion or somatic you can get lots of bts who have part of that chain so if one goes down the chain to inc 1 and blows with an fn you may find284the same somatic or emotion on new bt which will run as in any r3r and again get down to an inc 1 example the solo auditor has not audited for 6 months he gets dianetic session assessed is feeling of sadness the dianetic auditor runs chain consisting of 1an interrupted solo session 2an overrun inc 2 3an inc 1 to blow and fn now the same item feeling of sadness reads chain is run consisting of 1an interrupted solo session 2where the bt picked up the pc blow fn now the same item reads feeling of sadness chain is run 1an overrun on inc 2 bt 2the cluster the bt was in blow fn once more feeling of sadness reads the chain is run 1an arc brk from now getting audited 2inc 2 overrun 3inc 1 blow fn the somatic is checked and the item does not read only fns so thats all there is to that reassess or add to the health form __________________ this does

__________________ ot iii pre ots got reputation of being hard to run on dianetics early in dianetic redevelopment only five reasons exist for this 1a person that high on ot grades audits fast and comm laggy dianetic auditor can drive him up the wall 2too quiet or too blurred tr 1 3a tendency to evaluate instead of using tr 4 4the numerousness of bt chains on the same item the bts being separated now making several chains of the same item which if not all run separately leave the pc arc broken with the bypassed charge of unrun bts 5the ot ii who is still an ot iii and has been on it awhile probably himself has pictures and all the pictures he has are bt pictures the lower grade pc before clear reacts as composite being all on one chain so to speak he is separared into himself and individual bts and clusters of them when he gets to ot ii and so audits differently he easily misowns the pictures thinking they are his and the big blowdowns you get on such pcs item indicates several bts have it in common if lower grade pc ever got separated out like this it could be that he has several chains of the same item meaning he has separated bts if the class viii sees lower grade pc whose illness wont recover he need only have the same items checked that have already been run on the pc and if one gives bd get it run again or again and again but this means this pc was alreadychopped up in sessions in some way so that unknown to the pc and you dont inform him or her other bts than that one run had the same somatic or emotion and only one was run on it you just leave all items already run on the list and run them again if they read again if really flat the item briefly fns but you disregard the fn while assessing in this case the phenomenon is rare that lower grade pc has to run more than one chain on the same item solo iii however will be found to have the same item on more than one bt in many cases l ron hubbard founder lrhrs copyright c 1969 by l ron

low ta is unflat otiii phenomena if person has had low ta in lower grades see hcob 8 june 70 issue 1 the keynote is take it very easy as auditor and cs this applies also to any auditing given on upper ot levels that pcs ta goes below 20 is certain indicator of unflat ot iii hes still got some when person cannot handle ot iii he is too much at effect he cannot project his intention and so cant run tiii the new ot i and ot ii particularly ot ii are designed to increase pcs ability to project his intention to others if he cant they overwhelm him and you get low ta or none on iii harsh overbearing auditing or life incidents have to occur apparently to drive the ta down overts disagreements expressed as obsessive agreement and other lower lovel matters are at the bottom of this in any being but any case of low ta i have ever found has been 1overwhelmed in life 2unable to praject intention 3physically inactive 4loaded with bts 5tends to go out of valence easily in all this 4 is the important point the cure is given in hcob 8 june 70 issue 1 and the only thing that this hco b issue ii adds is that it is 4 above endless ot iii and low ta are alike inability to project intention pc at effect remedy by lightly causing pc to come to cause to be able to project his intention and thus flatten otiii that will complete and finish off low ta lrh dz l ron hubbard copyright c 1970 founder by l ron

for ots auditors ao review auditors ot iii acs checksheet class xii c n f i d n t i l handling correction lists on ots when you get read on correction list on preot who is on ot iii or above you should find out from what area it is reading ie find the position in relation to the body of the bt or cluster on whom that correction list question read otherwise the reading correction list line gets assigned to all areas when it only applied to one this creates bpc as it gives the rest wrong item or wrong indication and it makes the reading question appear to be generality when in fact it only applied to one bt or cluster by finding the bt or cluster that the read applied to the auditor then clears the read on that bt or cluster and then takes any additional steps to get it to blow and blow it the above does not apply to cases below ot iii and must never be mentioned to such case there is tendency of an auditor trained on general correctlon lists to simply clear the read without finding where it is coming from and as this omission can jam up case who is on ot iii or on nots such auditors when doing nots or actions on preots ot iii or above must learn to handle correction lists in this way it can mean the difference between failure and success l ron hubbard founder lrh dm kjm copyright 1979 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved290hubbard communications office saint hill

solo cs series 7 ruds going out on bts hcob 11 aug 78 rudiments definitions and patter flying rudiments at ot iii and above is piece of tech solo auditor on iii must know and be able to use at this level when rudiment is out the pre ot must be able to determine whose out rudiment it is his own bts or that of cluster misownership scientology axiom 29 in order to cause an as is ness to persist one must assign other authorship to the creation than his own otherwise his view of it would cause its vanishment this axiom is especially relevant to auditing at the level of ot iii and above because at this level the pre ot is handling other being than himself bts and clusters axiom 29 tells us that it is necessary to establish correct ownership of charge in order to get an as is ness of the charge furthermore incorrectly assigning charge to the wrong being can cause bypassed charge bpc as it is now misowned hence the instruction in the ot iii materials that one must use narrow attention span so as not to restimulate or confuse other bts with the one being audited finding charge without establishing whose charge it is and fully handling the charge for that being can result in generality the idea that the charge belongs to all when it only belongs to one being this can cause wrong indication to the others to whom it does not belong finding more than one charge without establishing whose charge it is and fully handling that being can result in generality the idea that the charge found belongs to all when it only belongs to one being this can cause an arc break or bad reaction as it acts as wrong indication to the others to whom the charge does not belong by correctly establishing the ownership of charge and handling the correct charge on the being to whom it belongs you get an as is ness of the charge291how to fly the ruds the rudiments questions which contain the word you ie do you have an arc break are for use on lower level pcs but not at ot iii or above when the word you is used in rudiments question on pre ot who is ot iii or above it is evaluative it says whose charge it is the correct wording of rudiments questions for use by the solo auditor on ot iii or above is is there an arc break is there present time problem is there withhold is there an overt and when full ruds are being flown is there an invalidation is there an evaluation by using is there ana ________ you are not evaluating whose charge it is then the solo auditor can establish whose charge it is by asking is charge found mine bt clusters and handle which of these read note sometimes you may find that charge can belong to and read on more than one of the above in which case you would handle both reads one at time it is also possible that an arc break for example could be shared by all present and that it is the pre ots out rud and also bts or clusters the question used in this case would be is it also mine bts clusters when one rudiment has been fully handled using the steps above the solo auditor continues on down the rudiments questions to the next reading rudiment and handles it as above exception sometimes the rudiment will run and fn and blow just on one of the first rudiment questions alone such as is there an arc break or is there present time problem etc and without differentiating whose charge it is it is possible that the solo auditor may not be able to determine whose it is this is how rudiments run all the time on lower level cases it just runs generally as the rudiment without establishing whose it is the trouble one can get into however is misownership whereby you are running charge that belongs to bt as if it were your own the pre ots charge or the charge of one bt is misowned as belonging to some other bt or cluster292when misownership of charge occurs it wont run or asis or blow you cant fn it and it will start turning on more mass or solidity if you get into this sort of situation narrow enough attention span sort out whose it is and handle accordingly but if when flying rudiment or other charge found such as reading line on prepared list it just runs and blows realize youve had lucky break dont interrupt this to try to find out whose it is or try to take it up again after it has blown this is obvious enough when it happens because as soon as you get onto the reading rudiment or reading line the charge starts coming off and the whole thing fns and blows this is special condition and if it doesnt occur you always proceed according to the steps given under how to fly the ruds rule unless you get discharge and blow of the rudiment as described under exception above it is essential to find out if any charge found belongs really to the pre ot himself or to bt or cluster when the charge is found dont fly all the ruds for example and then ask are all these as that would generalize it the rule is on ruds or on prepared list or when finding charge on case at once check if that charge belongs to bt or cluster and if so find where that bt or cluster is and limit your attention to that specific area when fning the read and then take any additional steps to blow that bt or cluster and blow it these rules for the solo auditor on ot iii or above apply when putting ruds in at the start session and apply as well to ruds going out during the session ref hcob 16 aug 83 confidential solo cs series 7

clusters are affected by drugs they mock up the biochemistry and they mock up the drug and drug incidents drug taking in this lifetime restimulates earlier incidents of drug taking on the track when the case is viewed as composite of bts and clusters you will see that drug taking in this lifetime causes highly multiple restim drug incident can be cluster making incident earlier drug cultures on the track were much worse than this drug culture in some cultures the psychiatrist priest and medico were all one and the same person and frequently used drugs some implanters used drugs either as part of the implant incident or to keep population enslaved thereafter when bts and clusters who have whole track drug incidents are restimulated by this lifetime drug incident there is multiple restim and if severe enough can form new cluster composed of the bts and clusters thrown into restimulation by the drug324the residual drug remaining in the body tends to keep these bts and clusters in restimulation and they by mocking it up tend to hold onto the drug and keep the drug pictures in restim there are two factors regarding drugs 1 there is the factor of residual drugs in the body and 2 there are bts and clusters who are stuck in whole track drug incidents which they are mocking up these two factors are interactive the residual drug deposit in the body causes drug effect and tends to keep bts and clusters in restimulation it is this residual drug deposit that is gotten rid of by sweat out on the purification rundown bts and clusters who are stuck in whole track drug incidents continue to mock it up they actually mock up the drug as well as the incident this can give the apparency that the drug is in the body after all thetan can create mest and because they are mocking up the drug and because they are stuck in it totally you can get the apparency that there is residual drug remaining in the body where you have both factors present the residual drug deposit in the body and bts clusters stuck in drug incidents its absolutely deadly the drug deposit in the body tends to hold onto bts and clusters and to keep them in restimulation and bts and clusters who are stuck in whole track drugs mock up the drug and the drug incident giving the apparency of drugs in the body these two factors are interactive both ways the actual residual drug in the body affects the body and keeps bts and clusters in restim who because they are mocking up drugs that they are stuck in are creating the apparency of more drugs in the body and so it goes the purification rundown will handle lot of this by getting rid of the residual drugs in the body and this in itself not only improves the person physically but also will allow much of the bt and cluster pictures to drop out of restimulation or at least to drop out of chronic restimulation there is another process pretty well forgotten about called freewheeling this was discovered in earlier research and is described in science of survival ii p 260 where it is pointed out that guk see all about radiation can cause the somatic strip to freewheel the active ingredients of guk being vitamin b1 and niacin and these cause bts and clusters to freewheel through engrams they are stuck in on the track they dont get down to basic or anything they unstick from the stuck point in track engram this permits that engram to drop out of chronic restimulation so we have another phenomenon going on the purification rundown that persons below ot iii case level would not be aware of the b1 and niacin by moving bts and clusters out of the engram they are chronically stuck in permits these bts and clusters to drop out of restimulation and thus cease mocking it up this too brings about an improvement in the case condition of the person you should also know that when the bt or cluster is freewheeling through such drug incident it can turn on the apparency of that drug in the body this could be puzzling if you didnt know this datum maybe the guy has never taken lsd or phenobarbitol in this lifetime and doesnt have any of that drug actually in his body but the bt or cluster freewheeling through an incident containing the drug mocks up the apparency of that drug in the body making the guy feel that he is on that drug and there have been other drugs on the whole track quite different from any drugs in existence today so during the purification rundown you can have bt or cluster freewheel through and out of stuck drug engram and while hes going through it there can be an apparency of that drug in the body even though hes never taken it in this lifetime but when the bt or cluster freewheels on out of that stuck point it ceases to mock up the apparency of that drug in the body hence get two way result on the purification rundown by getting rid of both the residual drug in the body and the apparency of the drug in the body mocked up by bt or cluster325how many of these bts and clusters actually blow during the purification rundown is unknown but there definitely will be less of them present when hes through the rundown and the case will be lot better off though not completely and entirely handled on the subject of drugs caution the attention of auditors and cses is called to the ot iii data that person can also freewheel straight through inc ii this is different from freewheeling out of drug incident as described above in this issue but should someone start freewheeling through inc ii and we know of instances of this having occurred the possibility is that it can occur the description of freewheel through inc ii is given in the ot iii materials and the handling is given in hcob 2 oct 68 ot iii and 3rd note running incident ii of 28 oct 68 both of which are in the ot iii pack normally we would run objectives and ned drug rundown after the purification rundown and these actions particularly running out drug incidents would handle much of these btcluster drug pictures without the case ever being aware of it at that level but there are also cases who are dianetic clears who are in body stuffed up with drugs in fact there is probably high incidence of clears who are now doing the purification rundown and these cases cannot be run on r3r or r3ra as they are clears this poses problem of how to handle these clears after their purification rundown clears can be run on objectives though you must not rerun an objective process that has already been run to ep clears can be run on recall or straightwire processes and thus can be run on recall processes on drugs and the l3rf and end of endless drug rundown can be done on clears provided you handle reading lines by indication and do not attempt any r3r or r3ra these actions will handle lot of the mental aspect of drugs and drug taking and will enable you to then get the case up the grade chart to ot iii on ot iii the solo auditor will handle and blow many of these bts and clusters without necessarily ever being aware of nor having to address drug pictures but some bts and clusters can be so held down by drugs or hung up in drug cluster making incidents that the solo auditor is unlikely to be able to audit or handle these and will need auditing by an ot iii drug rd auditor liability of handling drugs at ot iii as drugs and drug incidents have been so common on the whole track to simply generally ask for drugs or drug incidents when dealing with bts and clusters could cause total restim it would be likely to throw large number of bts and clusters each of whom individually have different incidents into restim on drugs the liability then is that of throwing the whole case into restim on the subject of drugs how to handle drugs at ot iii by adding drugs into an existing list or prepared assessment the subject of drugs is then only mentioned in relation to specific area and the liability of overrestimulation is avoided this makes it possible to handle drugs at the level of ot iii 1having found the position of cluster or pressure area in relation to the body the auditor has the preot limit his attention to that area so as not to restim other areas 2find the type of incident that made it into cluster by assessment of accident impact injury illness drug shock implant heat freezing electrical explosion implosion psychiat ric incident lightning burning vacuum radiation usually the read will occur early on the assessment dont go on assessing after you have got the read the auditor indicates the type of incident that read on the assessment and confirms the read sometimes you will get bd and break up or blow on this step alone3263date the incident to blow 4locate the incident to blow 5handling any remaining single bts to blow 6check for and handle any copy it is essential that the auditor have the preot limit his attention to the specific area of the body found so as not to stir up other bt or cluster masses and it is essential not to overrun this action and start in on other bts who were not part of this incident and to whom this does not apply one can ask for drug or drug incident on specific bt or cluster provided it is limited to that area and not asked generally on prepared list such as cs 53 being done on an ot iii or above if you get read on any of the lines in the drug section of the cs 53 be sure to find the position of the bt or cluster that the read is coming from per hcob 4 jul 79 handling correction lists on ots heavy this lifetime mutual drug incidents or drug trips can be dated and located but realize that this lifetime incident is late on the track and that there could be an earlier whole track mutual incident ref cumulatlve clusters there was case who refused to do purification rd who was handled by the techniques given above and then became willing to do the purification rd as he now realized that he had been the effect of drugs and now wanted to get it handled prior assessment there is way to use the prior assessment to taking drugs at this level by taking up the somatics and misemotions the person experienced prior to taking drugs as is done in drug rd you can then find the bt or cluster and blow it instead of running the prior assessment item by r3ra as one would do on drug rd and you must be very careful not to run any r3r or r3ra you simply take up reading somatic or misemotion from the list of somatics prior to taking drugs have the preot locate where the bt or cluster is by position in relation to the body and blow the bt or cluster by usual techniques this technique has proven very effective in handling two somaticshutoff cases somatic shutoff cases you can find bt with misemotion on drugs and especially with an absence of emotion absence of sensation absence of perception absence of feeling the lack of_____ or the absence of_____ the blank being any emotion feeling or perception is just as common on drugs and drug items as the somatic item connected with the drug hence somatic shut offs caused by drugs and medicines etc these have in earlier materials been called negative items due to the absence or lack of an expected emotion feeling or perception whether this negative item is the result of somatic being suppressed by drug or anesthetic or whether it is an inability to feel or perceive due to drug in the body or an accumulation of drugs in the body such negative items are equally important to ask for and to handle in the handling of drugs as are somatics and misemotions induced by drugs as these negative items are an omitted not thereness of something they may not be noticed or volunteered by pc unless asked for them and sometimes pcs come up to an awareness of numb area of the body case histories the following case histories reported by fso cses of case handlings piloted on327the subject of drugs on ot iii preots show what can be done case 1 lsd case ran bts and clusters stuck in drug experiences datelocated bad drug experiences he experienced relief and stopped complaining that the auditing was having effect on him case had tendency to blow out quickly without big wins unable to continue session was able to run longer sessions after handling drugs as above case 2 lsd constant rollercoaster critical felt crazy lots of restim an rsing cluster went to basic incident of an lsd trip said grief charge persisting from acid trips lsd came up frequently in her auditing the grief was handled case 3 lsd had many drug trips that created clusters on lsd and lsd mixed with other drugs cs 53 handled per hcob 4 jul 79 handling correction lists on ots was done and drugs read lot each read was handled and each cluster connected blown also handled bts stuck in drugs he got relaxed in the environment felt there was hope and destimulated it was the first significant gain he had made case 4 lsd and other heavy drugs she was also overrestimulated was put on gf 40 expanded and drugs read she blew many clusters made during lsd and speed she finished the gf 40 expanded and later would find masses that were related to lsd and say that was made on acid and it would bd and was handled to blow she then ran smoother and her comm line was better and the overrestimulation ended case 5 heavy drug history somatic case was 2wced to find what he was like prior to drugs which revealed back somatics and misemotions bts connected with the misemotions and back somatics were handled as well as bts stuck in drugs he ran much better after this and it ended the somatic shutoff case 6 very similar to case 5 above bts stuck in drugs and prior somatics to drugs were handled and he came around and ran properly case 7 heavy druggie case opened up dramatically on the handling of drug clustermaking incident which had been the major point of case deterioration this lifetimebecame psychotic in the incident the handling of this incident changed his life case 8328slow resistive case had been bumping into bts and clusters stuck in anesthetics this lifetime still needs to be directly addressed not gotten to as he had wins and completed current auditing hours paid for case 9 heavy drugs and alcohol run on bts and clusters stuck in drugs restimulated by drugs stuck in alcohol restimulated by alcohol had cs 53 and gf 40 expanded reads on drugs handled case running better after the above still has more to be handled case 10 lsd and alcohol drugs often came up as clustermaking incident was stuck in drug exteriorization was actually flashing drug picture had good win on handling btcluster influenced by drugs on handling btcluster restimulated by taking drugs number of old drug pictures and sensations turned on and blew on handling btclusters stuck in drugs reasonableness he still had on drugs was handled these handlings were win point he had felt paranoid about drugs up until now he also felt lighter later on cs 53 lsd read and on handling turned on and blew an electric shock type somatic case had lot of gain from the above handlings program for the ot drug rd asetup the case must be setup for the ot drug rd by doing the purification rd and this is essential obviously there would be point in trying to handle btsclusters hung up in drugs while there is still residue of drugs remaining in the body the only apparent exception to this rule would be as described in this issue where some drug handling might have to be done in order to get the purification rd done but this would be rare and would be followed by the purification rd then the full steps of the ot drug rd not only is the purification rd required setup but there is very great deal to be gained from doing it as the reader of this issue will understand bthe ot drug rd 1based on folder study and as deemed necessary by the cs case can be prepared for the rd by assessing and handling cs 53 in accordance with hcob 4 jul 79 handling correction lists on ots or even gf 40 expanded ref cs series 1 10 cs series 17 this step would at least include getting the ruds in and may contain other specific needed repair actions if the case has had rough time in previous auditing or on advanced courses this step requires some cs skill so as not to overdo nor underdo the repair as covered in cs series 17 2datelocate reading charged clustermaking drug incidents ie heavy trips anesthetic operations severe medicinal drugs or medication in this lifetime these having happened to the preots current body tend to be held in common as mutual incidents329use the procedure for handling clusters or cumulative clusters 3handle any pressure areas and any numb lacking sensation areas of the body by locating where the area is assessing for the mutual incident datelocating it iis and is copies 4take any previously given drug somatic items or newly list any additional items connected with reading drugs medicines etc and assess for reading somatic item do not run any r3r or r3ra if the bt or cluster that had that item is still there it will read on the meter locate the bt or cluster that the somatic item belongs to by meter read on the position in relation to the body blow the bt or cluster by usual ot iii actions ie inc ii inc i or cluster handling or cumulative cluster handling caution it can occur that the bt or cluster who had that item has already blown but some other bt or cluster is copying it giving false apparency that the item still exists this is described and the handling for it is given in section iii ot additional sheet notes on running page 2 be sure to include here any negative items previously given or to list for these and handle these too as above on this step one exhausts all reading drug somatic items and all reading drugs caution never run anything that does not read buttons may be checked on unreading items but if it doesnt read do not take it up note if you run into an item that was badly messed up in earlier auditing on r3r or r3ra you may have to repair it by assessing an l3rf using the item as the prefix with the preot holding his attention on that specific bt indicate only do not attempt any engram running when repaired blow the bt or cluster with usual ot iii techniques if not already blown on the l3rf 5 prior assessment take up any previously listed now reading misemotion or somatic item or negative item given on prior assessment to drugs or alcohol or medicine and handle with the same procedure given in 4 above find out when the person started taking drugs or medicine and 2wc for any prior somatics and negative items and handle any of these that read as in 9 above 6ldn ot iii rb assess and handle an ldn ot iii rb to clean the case up this will either go to an fning list rather easily or the case will return to solo as some cases who have attested previously may find more to run after the ot drug rd but this will not always be so warningalthough it is stated in earlier materials that an item once having read even though it does not currently read should be run that does not apply to the ot drug rd if the bt or cluster whose item it is is still present the item will read if the item longer reads the bt or cluster has already blown or it is suppressed or invalidated one must not run any unreading item as doing so risks giving other bts and clusters on the case to whom this item does not apply wrong item which can be very upsetting to the case it can also result in other bts obsessively copying the item and making it more solid refer to the section on misownership in hcob 22 dec 79 false reads will have the same effect so the auditor must know how to read meter and should only use serviced meter preferably mark vi flows of an item are not taken up only the item for obvious reasons completion and next step when the preot has completed the above steps 1 6 the ot drug rd is complete and the preot is sent to declare he or she would then be advised of the next step either next ot level ned for ots sometimes return to solo iii materials the preot will be in330very good shape and if the ot drug rd has been well audited and csed will probably make faster case gain on subsequent actions and will probably have faster learning rate in addition to case gains made on this rd although these should not be promised their absence should result in an immediate fes and repair of the rd while it is possible that the solo auditor will blow lot of these bts and clusters that were affected by drugs during solo auditing on ot iii or ot iii expanded and while some cases might not have to have the ot drug rd it is probable that the majority of cases will need this rd to handle the effects of drugs medicines etc especially those who have had heavy drugs each of the methods given herein have been tested and proven workable sometimes there have been dramatic results from these handlings of drugs given herein on cases who hung fire or were resistive provided you do not make the error of broadly asking for drugs on cases at this level which would cause overrestimulation you now have the means for handling drugs at the level of ot iii and ot iii expanded l ron hubbard founder as assisted by senior cs int for the boards of directors of the

sussex hco bulletin of 15 september 1978 issue i limited distribution advanced courses specialist checksheet acs auditors acs cses ned for ots series 1 c n f i d n t i l ned for ots rd theory of as has been announced there is special handling for ots who have been run on dianetics since clear it is called ned for ots this rd is prerequisite for ot viii its ep is cause over life the rd steps are covered in separate issues this issue covers the theory behind the action and also includes ot iii data which has never before been released the reason dianetic auditing messes up clears and ots is that when an auditor asks for an earlier similar which doesnt exit youll probably go over into cluster or bt where it does exist you see the clear or ot doesnt have pictures of his own so the dianetic chain is being run on bt or cluster and it really caves in somebody when asked for an earlier similar that doesnt exist on that bt or anywhere else and itll jump the guy straight into another bt or cluster and you get chaos bts are easily monitored by the think of the pc and they can actually respond to anything he thinks theyre totally at effect their banks are controlled by exactly what the person thinks at them just like an auditor can control the time track of pc same phenomena person can see the pictures of bt or cluster because there is an intimate tactile connection between the person and the bt person can think at bt or cluster picture will turn on in the bt or cluster representing that think and the person will see it as picture and erroneously suppose it is his own if he doesnt know this phenomenon somatics bt or cluster has three choices it can run its own life or run yours or run nothing the things you run into with somatics are not likely to be of the category of your life theyre more likely to be in the category of the bts life so it gets to be dizzy scene374theres way you can detect that person is not really running his own incident lets say the listed somatic is pain in the ear well great when he runs the thing heay even get little twitch in the ear but he will get something having pain in the ear it would be uncommon for him to actually get pain in the ear in other words he doesnt get the somatic where it is supposed to be on the body thats because the bt isnt in that position hes liable to get pain in the kidney do you see or pain in the eye this isnt inevitable once in while the guy gets pain in the forehead lets say this somatic was pain in the forehead he actually runs an incident and theres slight somatic in the forehead but its kind of weird because it doesnt actually run out on his own forehead it might disappear but it didnt disappear on his own forehead mental transmission when you talk about telepathy there is proximity factor when thetan is pressed straight up against another thetan very tight total tactile communication you get this type of mental transmission you can achieve it by reaching when there is tactile you have to reach your attention considerable distance you can do it an example of this is where two guys who are in relatively good shape start putting postulates at the same point on wall thats maybe twenty feet away in front of them when theyre sitting side by side and they start putting postulates at certain preconceived spot on the wall both of them will perceive bzbzbzbzzzzz of sort of little energy explosions not small maybe 3 or 4 feet wide and couple of feet high its when they both did it simultaneously two postulates will collide in the same exact place in the mest universe and go bzzzzzzt it will happen thats at distance but apparently theres such thing as tactile after all you realize the amount of mass that is connected with bt hes massed up you put an impulse into that mass and the mass is up against the body you put an impulse into the body it goes into that mass the bt can respond unwittingly unknowingly totally at effect makes him hard to handle by the way thats how you can make them run an incident i and an incident ii they just run it willy nilly they cant help themselves and it asises in the bank and that normal phenomena takes place and they go bzzzzzt unless you yourself have put up ridge with anger or emotion or something of the sort i know some guys try to do it vocally or something stupid whats interesting is the number of bts that have strings into the body you think they blow and they still have connection beams valences and shell bt the sizes of incidents are very often wrong and an out of valence phenomena occurs the bulk of bts and clusters are out of valence and often the pictures seen are very small now on the other hand preot who thinks he is running his own incident but is actually running bt or cluster can seem to be totally in valence at one point of chain just one point the rest of it and what the preot should suspect at that time is that he has bt that surrounds his whole body this would be shell bt clear can go into the valence of and see the pictures of this bt or cluster all these things confuse person trying to run this because hell take this one point of valence and it sort of proves it to him that it must be his incident the shell bt is composite body entity which is mockup that thinks mistakenly that it is holding the body together you can collide with that i suppose thats really probably what they think is the astral body collection of bts and clusters molded into semblance of body structure as this astral body is highly electronic bts and clusters can easily get stuck in it even though they themselves are creating it375data on misrun dianetics theres another interesting phenomena which occurs on any pc that is misrun on dianetics if an auditor asks for an earlier similar which doesnt exist the pc will look over into cluster or bt where it does exist so therefore you mustnt ever pressure pc for earlier incidents which dont exist in the same being or beings guy can find it easily or it isnt there because its different kind of jumped chain the pc isnt jumping from one of his chains to another one of his hes jumping from one of his chains to bt or clusters chain clear or above would be jumping from one bt chain to another lets say the guy is running his own chain and then all of sudden the auditor goofs and insists there must be an earlier incident hes got an erasure going and instead of paying any attention to this erasure he demands an earlier incident hell jump the pc over into bt thats probably been stone dead for god knows how long the auditor jams up the case and the way he prevents this from happening is to never run past the postulate just as it says in r3ra dubin as the preot increases in power and has more thetan power the bts and clusters will mock up what the preot thinks and become totally the subject of the preots control the preot doesnt realize that hes getting suckered into believing that they are his pictures it seems to prove itself the preot thinks can of beans and he is instantly presented with picture of can of beans that is the actual liability mechanism but youre not running them out of you you see so it can look like the fellow is running out his own incident thats why clear or dianetic clear can get suckered into believing that his pictures have come back thats the exact mechanism hes gone up in horsepower any bt or cluster he has anywhere around him will respond exactly and totally subordinated they go into almost instant control he thinks thought in their direction and they can actually mock up picture which isnt their picture or anything else you get dubin they didnt know anything about it but they mocked up the picture and thats the explanation of dubin memory the dubin phenomena also affects clear or aboves memory you say well i was aloysius george smith in 1862 and you get picture of aloysius george smith in 1862 gratuitously furnished you by bt and it will behisversion of 1862 now it will be correct that you were aloysius george smith in 1862 but the truth of the matter is that you as preot dont have any pictures of it its interesting because you wont find you have consecutive life in pictures itll be kind of like very poor slide show subtituted for movie you can say you were in flanders in 1803 or you were at oxford and you will notice if you watch closely you may still have some very active bts that you will get gradually dawning picture of oxford from but they may think that oxford is the same thing as arcturus so god knows the accuracy of the pictures that you get when person is clear he does have an accurate memory but because this other phenomenon occurs and somebody furnishes him with picture of oxford then he says id better look at the pictures of oxford and instead of remembering it straight he gets all fouled up dormant bts and clusters in ned for ots you are actually handling in the main dormant bts and clusters376these are not really alive enough to run incident iis and incident is on they have different considerations these dormant bts and clusters but they add up to being dead or below being dead theyre in the state that fbi agents and government officials eventually wind up in when they arent already simply an animated dormant cluster if people who are busy trying to smash up scientology realized what they themselves were heading for they would have couple of other thinks as the state of these dormant bts and clusters is pretty grim they are not really dead they just hope they are and its pretty poor view looking forward to the next trillion years in that state these arent normally touched in basic ot iii auditing but one can become aware of them because they can produce somatics and out body conditions now when you audit dianetics on preots you possibly wake up very dormant bts and clusters that actually have never been hit on ot iii never dreamed they existed these will be uncovered especially when preot is run on never happened wasnt there type chains these are denyer type chains and running them will open up some bt channels that had been completely dormant theres mention of this back in the early 50s you will sometimes get into parts of the bank which had better be left closed this is actually the phenomena that was discovered at that particular time i just knew it existed it was dormant something in totally dormant condition they cant be awakened with hand grenade normally they also wont assess so you get into these when the auditor has taken up nonreading item they are usually not live on meter they practically run on being dormant to the end of the universe unless somebody disturbs them they dont usually activate when you just put your attention on them theyre really dead you have to actually put some life into them to activate them theyre like pebbles on beach anyway the ep of ot iii gives only an apparency that all bts and clusters are gone theres an axiom that says absolutes are unobtainable if you dont ever want to run into any more bts or clusters well youd better go find some universe where they dont exist but actually there are fewer of them hitting people and bouncing around than one would think they light less often than one would suppose but listen youre living in universe which is crawling with this type of stuff and planet earth was dumping ground to end all dumping grounds actually the end of ot iii is when those bts and clusters that are easily put into communication are gone its not when all bts in the whole universe that ever will be are gone ned for ots handles those bts and clusters which while they could still affect the body are not readily responsive to ot iii handling as ned for ots is run these cats wake up and get handled this relieves the preot of lot of phenomena which puzzles him and can hold him down as you go along in running it you will find that the material to which ned for ots is addressed seldom considers itself live beings it thinks it is mest body parts significances conditions anything but live being because thetan cant do anything but survive the states he can get into exceed what we normally think of as living beings even though you will occasionally find live bts and clusters in running ned for ots the bulk of the material you are handling considers itself outside that category while it responds to all the laws of life it requires special address to get it into the realm of awareness that it is alive youve never had any pcs like that unless youve worked in an institution and have seen some

they are in perpetual reviv in that time and that location they can be activated or awoken by the preot copy thetans in the body bts may obsessively copy the pictures of other thetans therefore you can find it seems that the thetan who just left is still there because there is picture left spot the fact that someone else copied it and it usually goes add sheet sect iii ot crosscopying when

the bringing back to life of an engram in which pc is stuck the engram or some portion there of is being acted out in present time by the preclear it is called revivification because the engram is suddenly more real to the preclear than present time has ever been he relives that moment briefly he does not merely recall or remember it hcob 11565 during research on ned for ots i discovered that dormant bts are stuck in reviv ie they are stuck down the track in an incident which is present time to that bt i also discovered that these bts are revivd in location meaning that they are stuck in past location they are chronically stuck in past time and place which for them is still going on it is pt and is where they are as far as they are concerned insect on ot iii insect means thetan who is an insect without body these stick to other bts and clusters sometimes you can run into whole swarm of them bird similar to above thetan who is bird without body and sticking to other bts and clusters

attitude the best way to audit bts and clusters is highly impersonal not impolite not rough savage blame shame regret nothing just dead calm unfriendliness friendliness zero attitude the best way to handle it is just zero everything if you engage in chatter or conversation with them it just stirs them up more getting rid of them angrily they dont get rid of and of course you audit them telepathically not verbal comm an audited not solo action one of the reasons ned for ots is an audited action and not solo is because two cans give greater depth of read than solo can on solo can you get to point where all of the more available charge has been removed and the needle doesnt read and just fns however on two cans you can get reads on bts and clusters that didnt read on solo can this is because you are now dealing with bts and clusters in states below unconscioiusness and stuck down the track oddity preot on ned for ots may feel invalidated by the fact that he still sees pictures even though he is not making pictures the reason for this is because all bts are picturemakers being can go below making pictures and when it comes alive it starts making pictures again this is the condition of most bts hence the phenomenon of the preot still seeing pictures even though he isnt making pictures the preot could be mystified unless this mechanism is understood exterior perception during this rd or even while running ot iii preot will sometimes get what is apparently exterior perception as bt is blowing and while the preot has an attention unit on the bt there can be feedback of the bts perception to the preot you may get the bts visio of the room or environment as the bt is leaving this bt perception folds up quickly and ceases when the bt has blown it is usually very brief and is quite different from ot perceptions actual exterior perception in fact to begin with objects tend to look rather thin and flimsy to an ot when exterior as the body acts as sort of collector and magnifier of perceptions and sensations some preots tend to invalidate their own exterior perception because of this but ot perception improves further up he line it is necessary to handle all bts and clusters first though benign and helpful bts most bts and clusters arent vicious or vengeful theyre mostly benign though misguided they are not in fact of use or value to you they only hold one back some are convinced that they are necessary to the body or to the functioning of some part of body this is not so some think they are helpful or being helpful many are quite confused most are dormant and below unconsciousness ad as these are awoken or activated you may feel anaten from them as you progress through the rd your own abilities will increase and the fewer bts and

l misconceptions misconceptions of identity time place form and event hang thetan up the only reason why cluster hangs together is such misconception thetan can have misconception of time by having wrong date for an incident or he can conceive that past picture is now or he can have two incidents switched in time and think the earlier incident is later and think the later incident is earlier such misconception of time hangs it up and prevents blow and you can get blow by straightening out the time misconception misconception of place occurs when thetan thinks something happened in location when it happened in location b you can get misconception of both time and place eg cluster gets recent heavy restimulation they think the incident was the restim they made picture of the restim and think thats where it occurred originally think the cluster was formed at the time and place of the restimulation so they have both the time and place in error this misconception of both time and place confuses them and hangs the cluster up misconception of identity thetan x thinks he was implanted in woof place but actually hes copying the picture of somebody who was implanted in woof he hangs up on the misconcption of identity thinks hes the other thetan and misconception of event thinks he was implanted when he wasnt the whole reason why cluster stays one is misconception of identity time place form and event which is why datelocate works the cluster is hanging in time and space disorientation thats what louses bt up some sort of misconception of time space form and event or beingness that ties them up and they are hard to untangle and blow386they can switch all over the place with identity he thinks hes thetan but hes really thetan b mocking up and that will cause stress thats probably the anatomy of stress from earlier research i found it takes two viewpoints to make somatic you dont get somatic on primary concept it has to be secondary concept thats why objectives work it gets the guy back to the primary viewpointprimary concept and the somatic blows something is formed originally then taking another viewpoint of it it gets more solid you do objectives and the guy comes around to the original viewpoint and the somatic asises this is from earlier research and is expressed in terms of different viewpoints rather than different beings or different bts you can have bt thinking hes two beings theres an implant on the track that did this all is one one is all bt can think hes cluster or can think hes several bts cluster can think its an individual all you have to do is weed the misconception out of it and it goes bongo with misconceptions of identity time place form and event you get ridges because you cant occupy the correct viewpoint to blow it and when you do straighten out the misconception it blows obviously if it wasnt misconception it would blow this is why wrong dates and wrong locates hang up and why getting correct date correct location blows them if you get several misconceptions it gets really tangled up one we handled had more than one cluster the earlier cluster thought it was the later cluster and the later cluster thought it was the earlier cluster the earlier cluster was from cc implant around i quad in the universe before this one which is now in the dark horse nebula in orion so they thought their universe location had disappeared they were lost in time and place on top of that was some power processing and wrong item from an outlist it was pretty tangled up but they untangle on straightening out the misconceptions and blow only the truth will set you free but you have to know what is the truth of identity time place form and event l ron hubbard founder lrhdmkjm copyright c

specialist checksheet acs auditors acs cses ned for ots series 6 c n f i d n t i l blowing bts and clusters per the ot iii materials you can run grades 0iv on bt but it has to be addressed to that bt and it rolls rather fast may only take 4 5 minutes you can datelocate clusters and run inc ii inc is you can datelocate clusters and blow them off but the auditor who does this has got to be shark at dling its the moment the cluster was formed that you date not when the cluster hits the individual and datelocate is not always recommended on ned for ots copies youve always got to handle copies bts will copy obsessive duplication is bt characteristic maybe all that engrams are is excessive copying the 3 10 days to destimulate rule its not the incident that was restimulated that takes 3 10 days to destimulate it takes 3 10 days for all the copies and copying to fade out stress is also heavy button you get lot of copying of stress so you handle the original then copies somebody copying what was run new techniques the fastest and best way of blowing bts and clusters is by inspection acknowledgement is very effective lot can be blown with pure acknowledge ment another way of blowing them is simply to sort of jolt them bit earlier in time and388then they run on forward and blow you use sort of impulse to move them bit earlier in time it blows them off stuck point on the track blowing by inspection theres trick in this dont look at the picture look at and find the shape and mass of the bt if you see the picture shift your attention to the shape and mass of the bt you dont have to see their pictures they use pictures as sort of misdirection so you concentrate on masses not pictures the technique is you see picture trace it back to the bt ie whose picture and find the bt this way and it blows preot may have somatic in one body part being put there by bt in another body part say he has somatic in his leg and you find the bt putting it there is in the head and when you find the bt doing this it blows bt can also be being somatic he is pain in the arm bt pattern bts do crush in pull back its almost an attitude its sort of tense heavy physical pull back the basis is fear theyve been hit hard by something causes their timidity they pull back into solidity its hide phenomena and pull back in pattern this causes pressure the pressure is caused by them pulling back in on themselves sort of like thetan trying to duck and when bt is awakened it immediately mocks up mass mass is produced by outofvalenceness hes out of valence into the valence of an object or other things mechanism there is mechanism of somebody being body who has valences of past bodies superimposed on the body bts and clusters go into valences of pictures and things too these guys have been parked in time and gone into total reviv you can look down the track and wake them up they do lot of onness stuck on things as different from in things they went on and couldnt get off the ned time track ie time track of dianetic auditing on clear or above is composed of bts parked on the time track not in pt you look down the time track and wake them up they are stuck on the track and they also have pictures of themselves stuck on the track it is actually possible for bt or cluster to be totally out of pt by which is meant it is physically parked in past time bt or cluster can also be in pt while thinking it is in the past and mock up picture of the past and consider that that is pt bt or cluster can be parked in the past so thoroughly that its only concept of future is future from that past which is already long gone by this is the phenomenon of future pictures it is also the cause of worry about the future terror stomachs fortune telling visions and dreams another mechanism that frees some is the realization that some other bt is holding them in and its the truth bts and clusters stick to other bts and clusters389black bts sometimes bt will put other bts in front of him as sort of protection you get black area covered by white area in front of it bt in the black area is holding some other bts in place in front of it as sort of protection or shield the way to handle this is to blow the black bt who is holding the others in place then the others come off easily otherwise if you try to blow the front ones first nothing happens if you encounter bts not blowing suspect and check for bt or cluster holding the others and handle it first then the others blow easily you can get partial blows where the bt or cluster comes off the preots body but stays in the room plastered on wall or outside the room these can push ta up until blown fully when they hang up it is because they still have connecting string to the body or because they conceive some barrier they have hit is impenetrable the handling is to cut the beam or push them through the barrier or simply repeat the process what has actually happened is that the mass of bts contain amongst them one or more bts to which they are stuck which have not been handled bt or cluster can go into the valence of person cluster can go into the valence of single beingness eg person known to the preot in pt and there could be stuck picture of this person it actually isnt picture as such it is complete mocked up identity plus mock up of the identitys surroundings this is very puzzling to the pre ot as it doesnt blow as picture he is really looking at the copied beingness and characteristics of the person who isnt there but which is some bts and clusters thinking they are the person and being the person this is discussed under the heading of ghosts in the lst american acc in camden the preot feels haunted seeing his exgirlfriend in front of him or even hearing his mother talking to him with brand new dialogue nearly everybody has ghost if he looks it blows like any other bt or cluster but the preot will be puzzled when looking around for whos mocking it up when nobody is except the ghost itself the way to handle is to move the cluster down the time track to moment before it knew the person and it blows the ideal method of blowing bts and clusters is by inspection you get into difficulty blowing bts and clusters when the session has gone too long pc getting tired or overrestimulation usually the further through the rd you get the faster and easier they blow however you can hit what appears to be bog point particularly if the preot is tired or you overrun for several sessions at such point just keep on giving sessions and soon youll get session of massive blows and after that they will blow faster and easier than ever at such bog point you may have to resort to the thetan hand technique until its handled after which you can return to blowing by inspection or what are you

valence of person or animal some bts go into the valence of molecules minerals as well as cells some go into the valence of objects theres trick of getting them to shift valence you find out what it is out of valence into and indicate it this is done by simply asking them what they are having found out what he or they have gone into the valence of you acknowledge it and ask them who they are and they generally blow off psychologists have an operation going of convincing people they are brain because they think b convincing people theyre an animal meaning they have soul this sticks bts and clusters into the head brain and into the body and invalidates that they are being so it pins the bts and clusters in into the body and if you ran on psychologist youre brain youre an animal it would cave the psychologist in because he has so many overts of doing this to others on the time track bts were lied to and told they were being built into body they have nothing to do with the body track at all except to sit in or on the body they had391model forms and bts were made to assume model forms its another valence trick theyre in the valence of body or part of body such as torso brain arm etc these arent vicious in attitude they are benign but misguided they feel they are necessary to the body they are sometimes stuck on the external perimeter of the body 2 3 feet out from the body surrounding it they are in the valence of something they consider these safe valences or safe beingnesses what does bt consider safe to be in it is one of the systems of being in protected and defended be in the valence of something theres also scarcity of forms and being becomes form they can also be significance and try to be in form they can be picture or an unsafe picture to remind one that nothing is safe because one might forget so bt can be picture or part of picture or he can be being ridge or being problem etc bt can be in the valence of anything at all there are actually five steps to shifting valence you find out what valence the bt is being and acknowledge it and ask who he is he will usually cognite im and blow bts think they are pictures things beings body parts objects significances somatics they can be anything at all if that is realized they will tell the preot what they are and blow the basic misconception when handled flips them into own valence and they blow sometimes disintegrating explosively with succession of im im im mesometimes they go out several hundred feet and explode violently if the preot asks what are you theyll answer up im valence and then realize theyre not valence theres another action of acknowledgement maybe nobody has ever acked these beingnesses because theyre so bizarre so far out you must acknowledge what the bt or cluster tells you they are youre flipping them out of obsessive beingness or misconceived area the full steps of shifting their valence 1 preot asks what are you 2 bt or cluster answers im valence 3 preot acknowledges bt or cluster 4 bt or cluster realizes theyre not valence and blows or 5 preot asks who are you and bt or cluster realizes and normally says im and blows and sometimes its highly multiple blow 6 if they repeat what they just said ask what were you before you became that they say and blow if you dont acknowledge bts answer after what are you the second question who are you tends to be invalidative if they dont answer youre talking to an energy mass and not bt or theyre really392dead theres one trick tell them to go earlier and if its ridge go behind the ridge and youll get them if they dont answer what they are persist say good and ask well who are you and they wont persist in their chatter theyll go silent and probably answer im and blow most of the time you dont have to do anything though just lookand they blow different responses blowing bts and clusters by this valence technique is almost the basic rundown it is the hottest technique there is there are only three situations under which it does not work at once these are when you dont get an answer b they give you significance or identity in answer to the who are you question c the criminal type when you dont get an answer if you dont get an answer you may be talking to simply an energy mass put out by some other bt or cluster or they are really dead then tell it to go little bit earlier jolt it little bit earlier with an intention or impulse and then it will run on through and blow but if its ridge being put out by some other bt or cluster just look behind the ridge and address your actions to the bt or cluster behind the ridge and then youll get an answer b they give you significance or identity answer if you ask who are you and get an answer which is an identity such as george smith or willy the red you simply acknowledge that answer and ask who are you again sometimes you may have to run back down the track through whole chain of past identities but if you persist the bt or cluster will eventually realize and say im and blow c the criminal type these may give criminal response yah yah im your nemesis im going to eat you up thats what i am it can get very confused because your next question is who are you and theyre kind of telling you who they are they havent answered the auditing question of what they are they cant conceive of it theyre demon or something whatever they think they are however if you persist good you say who are you you dont persist in asking them what they are ignore the chatter just say good and ask who are you and they quite commonly dont go on with that performance they simply go silent and they say im and they blow393nulls bts and clusters who are so dead and unresponsive that you cant get any response from them at all response can be woken up by having the preot run hellos and oks on them this will put them into communication and they can then be handled with the valence questions generally theyre very fluent and quite easy to handle though probably what makes preclear as whole hard to audit at lower levels is that youre auditing all of these misconceptions simultaneously but on ned for ots you will find the majority of bts and clusters easy to handle and blow many of them simply blow on inspection and the basic usual technique for blowing the rest of them is the valence technique valence technique 1 what are you 2 answer 3 acknowledge 4 realizes it isnt ________ and blows or 5 who are you im and blows 6 if they repeat what they just said ask what were you before you became that they say and blow those steps above are the basic and most workable technique if the preot realizes that bt or cluster can be being anything anything at all and accepts the bts or clusters answer and acknowledges that answer this technique will work very smoothly and well l ron hubbard founder lrhdmkjm copyright c 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved394hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco

ots rundown is based what you are really handling is crossinfluence of life and the idea that can assume the characteristics of b so now in trying to audit youre auditing b but hes not there its the general crossinfluence somebody copies picture somebody copies copy its all on the basis of the misconception that all is one and they cant tell whose picture is whose or whose somatic is whose youre basically trying to untangle this mishmash and whats amazing is that there are as many life beings as there are there are lots of them in this rd youre handling for the main part dormant bts so its different that ot iii these are beings that wouldnt even run on ot iii on ot iii or ot iii expanded you run those beings that can be run on the track because they do have some incidents in common if you run the wrong one it doesnt matter too much youll run the right one anyhow ned for ots untangles the mishmash and the crossinfluences you see them all the time on people in behaviour or life basis the old time faith healers themselves pick up the somatics from the patient one time i did an emergency assist i asked pc her feet were killing her and there was nothing wrong with her shoes i asked whose feet are they she said my sisters and that was the end of the sore feet because of the number of beings it can get quite complex it all starts out originally with thetan obsessively copying the physical universe around him and when he starts doing that he sets himself up for copying other beings universes and then he gets pretty confused and the basis of it all ismisconception first and foremost ismisconception of identity thats actually what the rd is structured on its not structured on hes got395bts so blow off the bts its structured on the disentanglement of confusions this rd handles the entanglement of the bts this rd runs best short sessioned because the restim then has chance to key out between sessions and youve always got the 3 10 days keyout on your side you could call it the misconception rd or the iamyou rd or the allareone rd this rd proves very conclusively that all beings are separate individuals because the only thing that gets them into trouble is loss of their own identity misownership of identity they are definitely individual and separate beings the greeks got into lot of trouble believing they were all part of zeus there must be other implants on the track too that give them this idea but it is now proven by this rd that people are individuals so are bts the only thing that forms cluster is misapprehension agreement and shared experience they are under the misapprehension that they are one being what hangs it together is similarity of identity this is the that forms cluster because they have got the same picture they must be the same person those are the basic philosophical concepts back of the rd and they have never been tackled head on before for example misconception i am mamie glutz how many crazy people in an institution think they are napoleon some misconception sanity is the ability to recognize differences similarities and identities so misconception adds up to insanity misconception is the key to any trouble being

they will now have that item it persists eg you run sore toe on somebody who doesnt have one theyll end up with sore toe if you now try to handle sore toe with auditing it will worsen because it was wrong item in the first place you have to repair the wrong item bt could be run on nonexistent somatic and to be obliging mocked it up they can get run on imaginary incidents and on things that are

run thats their misconception foisted off on them by being given the belief that the item existed or read when called on to run something they will furnish copies misowned and manufactured items you need to check for bts run on wrong items unreading items and sort it out some bts went exterior and were audited past it some bts had already gone clear not just oin the clearing course some went clear on objectives so you dont just have dianetic auditing on somebody after clear you also have dianetic auditing on bts after they went clear resulting in invalidation of he state of clear the mistake of misowning others pictures and then misidentification of identity ned auditing after clear applies to bts as well as preots so there are residual bts with invalidated erasure invalidated clearing and the originally overrun thetan may have blown and left copies of the overrun398grinding an incident on dianetics or ned will result in some bts run past erasure so they have to mock it up again to run or they never got to basic and erasure because the auditor never asked for ebeg or esim and were left hanging incomplete on the chain and other bts will copy all this obsessively out l n lists and wrong items will do the same thing and also can be repaired auditor command flubs lack of acknowledgement couldnt hear the auditor session distractions all these will hand up bts even false dates could be copied they can be twice removed from reality in trying to date something now you could wind up dating the wrong date or dating the date that the wrong date was given and it might not have been that bts or clusters incident that was being dated in the first place the incident may have been misowned not their incident you cant run ned for ots on somebody who has been run on wrong or unreading items without repairing them also beware of getting into overcorrection because what you are correcting on one bt can start uncorrecting on another bt so you check past auditing for read and interes as the first step if it reads and preot is interested you handle it if not skip it but be alert and if preot hits bog you recheck past auditing remember not to run anything just indicate it this doesnt mean that all previous auditing was bad far from it but some auditors due to poor training bad metering or nasty habits will be found to have messed up cases so you repair past auditing by auditors by auditors name and also see that such auditors are handled too thats the bug on ned for ots you can collide with bts and clusters messed up in past auditing and this can recoil heavily and physically upset the preot so you keep the repair list andy and if you run into bog use the repair list and next session cs to take up past auditing remembering not to continue to run engrams but only indicate repairing past auditing by auditors name make list of names of auditors and test these for read include selfauditing and solo auditing too those that read you repair the items run by that auditor or in self auditing and make provision for occluded auditing you may think youve got it all only to find an occluded session or sessions spring to view later this is why you must teach fesers to fes and make up ffts that include the auditors name and thats why the advanced courses specialist auditor must know what hes doing in training to deliver this rundown its not piece of cake do it

available nb some old timers may have been audited on secondaries and engrams prior to folder records having been kept and there is always the possibility of false reports and unrecorded items having been run this repair action is done by name400of auditor and those auditors who audited the case on engram running after clear or who most grossly misaudited the case will be found to be charged reading and it is their auditing which most likely will need to be repaired auditors whose names come up as aving grossly misaudited the case in the past should be crammed or retreaded or retrained or subject of an ethics action in order to safeguard any other pc in future make up list of names of auditors from the full flow table and include self auditing and solo auditing allow for the possibility of occluded auditing showing up later as charge is taken off during this repair assess the list of auditor names including selfauditing and solo auditing for read and note size of read start with the largest reading and repair the items run by that auditor as follows 1 take the dianetic item that was run eg pain in the zorch and test it for read if read skip it 2 find the error in running such as unreading item wrong item such item ever existed run past erasure etc usually the preot will be able to get this if not the auditor can find out quickly by meter 3 indicate the bpc found only indicate do not start running anything 4 is the bt or cluster this was run on still around and note whether this reads it wont read if the bt or cluster has already blown have the preot find the bt or cluster by position on the body sometimes the bt or cluster will blow on inspection on this step alone if it doesnt 5 blow the bt or cluster 6 copies the auditor asks copy and if reading has any copies spotted and blown often the bt or cluster who originally ran the item will have blown leaving bts or clusters who copied the auditing or copied the overrun etc and dont nag the preot for copies or youll start some other bt copying now as with any repair auditing this can very quickly repaired and the auditor must be alert for this and not get into overcorrection you must also be alert for what you are correcting on one bt or cluster uncorrecting on another bt or cluster eg overrun may be correct for one but not correct for another you can check for this and if so indicate that overrun did not apply to the rest step 2 above finding the error may go earlier similar the same bt or cluster may ave been misaudited in an even earlier session or sessions and these too may need to be repaired but only if earlier auditing bpc exists on the bt or cluster you started with or youll jump from one bt or cluster to another handle each reading item run by the assessed reading auditor in the sequence these items were run then take next best reading auditor by name or reassess the list of auditors be very alert for this whole repair action eping well before all auditors or items have been addressed and when that occurs end it off401stuck picture remedy 1the stuck picture 2what was the error in running 3indicate 4who was it run on or whose stuck picture is it

continuing to run an incident that has already erased grinding incidents running unreadinguncharged items or wrong items will mess up bts and clusters that were not in restimulation or who were dormant when very bad such session can itself have been cluster making incident and is the latest mutual incident for those bts and clusters stirred up in that session there will have been considerable crosscopying do not attempt to r3r or r3ra such session handle it as described above under repairing past auditing repeat those steps until all bts and clusters have been blown off that session past mismetering misdating or locating if the preot has been mismetered in the past this may need to be repaired meter evaluation by which is meant the auditor keeps telling the pc that this or that didnt read etc can be highly evaluative and invalidative especially when that auditor was misreading the meter the pc was left hung up in things that did read but werent taken up and when things that didnt read are taken up it will stir up dormant bts and clusters and misownership and misidentification occurs add to that crosscopying of bt pictures and you get mess that can recoil very heavily against the preots body dangerously so meter evaluation can be repaired by getting off when the pc or preot was told something read when it didntand vice versa and handling evaluation esim to f n misdating and partial locating is similarly corrected by getting off any wrong locations that were given or locations that were wrong for other bts or clusters note that on dating and locating you can get build up of mass and pressure even protest ridge due to the date for one bt or cluster being the wrong date for some other bt or cluster the mass and pressure will blow on indication that it was wrong date or wrong location for them technique as powerful as dating and locating which will blow clusters and cumulative clusters when done right can also mess them up badly when done

they cant go through solids so they went on plastered on to something another way to blow them is to scan them back to when they went in and they blow out like plusminus reaction went in blow out bt with outint affects its ability to blow not the preots ability to blow them off the bts ability to blow you scan them down chain of went ins to the first went in and it will blow you could handle very difficult one by recalling times they went in for very difficult ones fast way to blow them would be to get them to scan back through went ins when did you go in and they blow onness theres also went on went onto something and lot are stuck on something you scan them back through times when they went on they went onto something and couldnt get off sometimes bt will blow from inside the body and catch on the outside of the body or within 2 3 feet of the body you can get too many restimulated on the surface of the405body you have to blow off these surface ones being stuck on the surface of something would have something to do with the button cant go in for bt and that button produces blows bts who cant go in to something went on and stuck onness is different from outint they are stuck on not in onness is handled in the same way as outint but with went on or got on the earlier than phenomenon applies to on as one has to first get on something before he gets off trying to persuade stuck went on bt or mass to get off can run into the same phenomenon as outint and he wont blow handle it the same way as went in but with the difference of went on one could in theory find thetan who was stuck on handle that and then find that the same being had outint outint sometimes bts have outint because they cant get out or couldnt get outthey are in the valence of something that cant be out even fatal to be out eg the inside of body or an internal organ they consider these safe beingnesses and its safe to be in so you ask what couldnt get out and they blow if you ask them to point which way is in they cant getting them to point which way was in works and produces blows use the past tense which way was in and they will blow recurring int trouble if preot on ned for ots has recurring

when theyre pinned into other bts they think theyre interiorized into the body when theyre pinned into bts how could being get stuck to body theres some kind of central core in the body that the being mistakes for the body the central core sticks to the body and the thetan sticks to it some bts think they are body there are clusters that think theyre body and other bts stick to the cluster and wind up thinking theyre body they would have to be stuck by postulate i am body or i am head or i am the brain etc someone on ot iii can think hes complete on ot iii because he thinks the solidity he perceives as the body is the body it is mistaken apparency of solidity of the body this apparent solidity of the body is composed of bts and clusters and may be the same size and shape as the body when first contacted so someone on ot iii perceives this and assumes its the body and thinks hes done on ot iii this solidity he perceives as the body is composed of bts and clusters the body becomes transparent to an ot to the degree he clears this up it is body built of thetans you have to learn youre not looking at the body but false body composed of bts and clusters preot on ned for ots will become aware of this during the rd it is not drawn to his attention by the auditor its not the solidity of the body but the solidity of bts and clusters formed as body the body acts as magnifier of perceptions it collects and magnifies perceptions some thetans think they cant perceive well exterior as the actual body and objects and walls look pretty flimsy and transparent to an ot the guy gets fooled he thinks hes looking at this body and hes not hes looking at solid mass of bts and clusters the actual body looks transparent to an ot unless you get the guys perception up he wont be able to perceive this and if he cant perceive them he wont be able to run them the preliminary step of ned for ots is to get the preots perception up enough so it can be run this false body composed of bts and clusters is blown off piece by piece on the rd composite masses composite mass such as the false body composed of bts and clusters needs to be handled or blown off in pieces you could make the mistake of trying to blow it all at once instead of piecemeal you may also encounter layered clusters which is layers of clusters on top of each other use the thetan hand technique to separate ridges and masses you can split ridges apart and separate masses and clusters by passing thetan hand between them then blow off the bts and clusters spearately you can look up and down inside mass rather than outside it and it starts to go there are so many bts and clusters that the preot can wonder if hes pulling in any that werent there before or wonder if all space is full of themthat isnt so it

exterior view as they blow its not an actual exterior view but an apparency of an exterior view its the bts visio feeding back to you while the bt is blowing this visio folds up when the bt has blown and your attention is off it its not your own exterior view its their exterior view as theyre blowing and it fades as they blow and your attention comes off them its to do with viewpoints and attention if you get one of your viewpoints attention unit in one bt or cluster it will carry it and you sort of see through their perception its how you see their pictures and why you get some of their visio as they blow it has also been noted that when you do get feedback visio from bt as it blows that it is actually not single bt but two or three and the feedback is coming from another or other bts who have not cognited that he is himself in other words it is an uncleared bt or cluster who is carrying this visio anchor point away not all exterior perception comes from bts though the preot can also get an exterior view which is his own actual exterior perception if the preot gets stuck or fixed exterior view it is easily handled by having the preot look the other way ie look in the opposite direction and the fixed direction of view will unfix it is easy to differentiate between actual exterior perception of preot and the phenoomena of the exterior view of bt during blow by checking on the meter if it is the view of bt partially blown it will read as such partially blown bts should be handled to complete blow at which point the relayed bt visio will cease there is positive way to handle this if it hangs up this is for the preot to extend his attention out to the point to which the bt or cluster has blown and ask it again what it is give it an ack and then ask who it is the untouched or uncleared bt or cluster that is being carried away goes poof and the exterior visio ceases instantly theres also perception by tactile contact when the bt is attached to the

phenomenon you will encounter is the preot getting apparent exterior perception picking up the bts exterior visio as the bt blows the second prediction factor is that the amount of restim and pressure remaining at session end becomes less from one session end to another session end during the rundown the preot may wonder if hes pulling in bts and clusters to run whether all space is filled with bts etc this isnt so but may seem this way the preot will get realization similar to the straightwire ep that heshe wont get any worse this isnt the ep of the rundown but shows progress is being made during the rundown the preot will become aware that what has been mistakenly assumed to be the body is not the actual body but the solidity of bts and clusters in shape of the body the preot may comment that his actual body or walls or objects look flimsy or transparent and this is actual ot or exterior perception and become aware that he is perceiving bts and clusters where the body looks or feels solid he is perceiving the difference between the false solidity of the body and the actual body as this false body is audited out the clusters and masses remaining will swell to greater size with less mass and solidity further through the rundown there are fewer bts and clusters remaining and the mass expands and gets softer its not under so much pressure theres less mass and what is left is less dense and they blow easier and faster with decreasing ta action toward the end of the rundown there are less and less bts and clusters to trap his attention into the body and his attention goes out onto the physical environment an ots409attention can get so exteriorized that it is very difficult to get his attention onto the body his attention is on the walls room building area or planet the meter will read on wall or room etc wherever his attention is you can get similar phenomenon of the ot getting perception of wall or environment via blowing bt or the bts can get perception of physical environment via the ots body this phenomenon is different the ot is in direct communication and perception of the physical environment meter read will establish which it is in earlier research i discovered what we call leaning on wall the ot leans against an object in pt and feels it and it can put ta high eg the being is leaning against milk carton and gets waxy cardboard feeling realization of what is going on handles it but the phenomenon encountered toward the end of ned for ots is different the ots attention becomes so exteriorized that he goes into direct comm with the environment and finds it hard to put his attention on the body about this time bts and clusters do not read well and the sensitivity has to be turned up high to get reads on bts and you have pretty constantly fning needle the auditor needs to be sharp on ta and needle handling to keep the needle on the dial and detect small reads on very loose needle fning ta becomes more frequent dont try to push session past big win or marked case change several of these will occur during the rundown its the ep for that session not for the rundown it is possible for the preot later in the rundown to blow distant bt stuck to somebody else if the preots attention is drawn to something outside the session environment check for bt or cluster in the area where his attention fixes and have the preot blow it off this action is effective and permanent there are two changes going on during the rundown preot as thetan is getting bigger and stronger b there are less bts and clusters left the preot will get more and more relaxed less mass less tension in the body at first on the rundown these masses are very tense and hard they feel like tensed muscle later the mass gets less and lighter and the body more relaxed toward the end of the rundown the amount of mass left is so slight that after fairly short session it can become unprofitable to audit as theres so little left and what can be found blows so fast and easily these last few will blow by inspection and when there are none at all in the preot or his environment then youve reached the end of the rundown the ep of the rundown is when the preot has transparent body and clear area around it to some distance barring perception of other peoples difficulties and when he realizes he is alive and very much himself lrhdmkjm l ron hubbard

datum that early in the session the preot quite often can blow bts and clusters by inspection while later in the session restimulation of other bts and clusters or possibly tiredness of the preot makes it difficult to blow them there is session factor of crossrestimualation if the session goes on too long you can get some too restimulated to blow easily this can build up pressure and push the ta up it relieves on indication of crossrestimulation bts go into restim on other bts pictures as the sessions are generally short tech services and tech pages will have to be very well organized and effective so that auditor time is lost waiting for next pc or folder cses and auditors will have to ensure that executives in and above tech services know and follow cs series 56 and bfo 46 value of services delivered how to raise and cram them on these issues whenever lines or terminals drop out the sessions are generally short and frequent you must not continue session past the session ep usually an fning ta or win you must not go on past the session ep or get into grinding due to overrestimulation show this to your d of p if he tries to push you theres also factor of incomplete blows you can meter check for this but dont nag the preot on it or youll stir more up because all the bts remaining are sort of incomplete blows as you run ned for ots theres certain amount of pressure or somatic remaining at session end this becomes less from one session end to another you can restimulate more in session than you blow this can be checked for on the meter and handle those restimulated in the session but not blown the session is usually started by 2wcing to fn or flying ruds but the auditor must realize that charge in restim comes from restimulated bts and clusters shocks or stress in life restimulate bts and clusters who then copy the restimulation and this411restimulation is wrong incident for them as it is only lock on whatever they are stuck in you handle any outrud bts or restimulated bts at the beginning of session if the ta is high do not try to 2wc it down or go off pgm onto cs 53 check for and handle bts or clusters in restimulation or if there is evidence of outint check for and handle any bt or cluster with outint first care must be taken at beginning of session not to ask for earlier similars that dont exist nor to restimulate more than is in restim youre only trying to get any outruds or restim out of the way so you can get onto the body of the session the preot probably shouldnt watch movies or tv during this rundown as bts tend to make pictures of the movie and hang up in them requiring handling at beginning of session if too much restim occurs due to watching movies or tv get the preot to stop watching them during the rundown i had earlier found that vitamin bl would turn off dreams or nightmares and that lack of vitamin bl would make pc more susceptible to having dreams or nightmares apparently lack of bl makes bts stick to bone structure more susceptible to restimulation and harder to blow session done on preot who had bl deficiency ran very slowly with great difficulty blowing bts and clusters the session was very gluey taking vitamin bl resolved this and bts and clusters became easy to blow again preots on ned for ots should take 500 milligrams of vitamin bl thiamine hydrochloride daily and if they experience dreams nightmares or difficulties blowing bts and clusters then the dosage should be increased right date or location for one bt or cluster can act as wrong date or wrong location for another bt or cluster as it isnt correct for their incident and pressure and mass can build up on this during session where datelocating is done meter check for wrong date wrong location indication of this when it has occurred will relieve the pressure and blow the ta down bts can also build up protest ridge on this generally the ta will move in pumping action bding as bts and clusters blow the general session pattern is for the ta range to get higher and higher and then pump on down to lower range which is the ideal point for ending session session continued past this resulted in crossrestimulation and difficulty in blowing bts the session must be well ended as you are ending the session for others bts and clusters not just for the preot end of session given tone 40 may have to be repeated to ensure the session is in fact ended you will also sometimes encounter last call bts and clusters just as you are about to end the session some bt or cluster may pop up to be handled this will often occur on say or ask let the preot handle any such last call bt or cluster to handle restimulation accumulated in the session you can tell bts to come to present time before ending the session then end the session well and thoroughly usual session ep is an fning ta l ron hubbard lrhdmkjm founder copyright c 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved412hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

behaviour reason why ned for ots is an audited action rather than solo is because two electrodes one can in each hand gives greater depth of read than one hand solo can preot can run out of reads on solo can to point where the needle just fns but on 2 cans reads will show this is because you are dealing with dormant bts and clusters that are dead even below unconsciousness and out of pt they have to be activated by preots attention during the rundown the sensitivity may have to be raised as there is getting to be less and less there to impinge and read on the meter this does not reflect the preots case state just the amount left to run fns will become more and more frequent during session the ta works up into higher range and pumps back down to lower range again the usual ending point for session eg ta at start of sesson 25 during session ta works up to 37 then pumps back down to 25 and the session is ended off continuing past this point results in over restimulation of remaining bts and clusters the ta moves with pumping action bding on blows the bd on blow is not the impulse of the bt or cluster leaving its the sudden decrease of resistance as the mass blows the size of bd is relative to the size of mass of the bt or cluster when you put attention on them and start waking them up theres sudden increase of mass when they blow theres sudden decrease of mass this is what registers on ta and makes the ta pump up and down the ta is an indicator of progress through the rundown you will start getting floating ta at some point which will become more frequent do not continue session past sudden large bd to fning ta just end off the session sometimes the preot will experience continuous blow or continuous flow phenomena this happens after the preot has blown bt or cluster who was holding others in then the rest will blow easily often in continuous blow this shows on the meter as continuous fall or slowly bding ta later it will show as bding fn the needle fns while the ta falls and this may go into an fning ta and that is the ep for that session later prediction factor which shows progress through the rd is change of needle pattern the lfbd on blow gets much faster than before this is not bigger bd it is faster fall and bd the rises are faster too so you have needle moving at about two or three times the speed it was moving previously and this speeding up of the needle can happen quite suddenly in the session and is very noticeable lrhdmkjm l ron hubbard copyright c 1978 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved413hubbard communications

l how you operate meter on ned for ots you have situation where the fns are getting wider and wider and often going into an fning ta you also have less and less mass or charge left on the case the further through the rundown you go therefore the auditor must be an expert at handling the ta sensitivity knob and keeping the needle on the dial when asking question or assessing initial reads are often small due to small amount of charge remaining and the sensitivity has to be cranked way up to catch these reads the way you do this is by handling the ta with index and second finger and the sensitivity knob with the thumb drill operating the ta and sensitivity knob with emeter drill 11 superlative ta handling until you have mastered it the total amount of ta action per session at this level is low usually around 10 20 divisiions rarely as high as 60 divisions it does not compare with ta action at lower levels at all an fning ta is often the signal to end the session so how do you

from flanders hes operating in pt from some place down the track thought disassociation thought disassociation follows point of view pattern in reviv theyre talking to you from an altered point of

accident she thought she left the body and went to between lives implant and returned to the body but there has been between lives implant in that place for eons what happened is she was revivd in between lives implant she had the accident and went exterior she thought she went to this between lives implant because thats the location she was revivd in this is matter of old fixed viewpoints in

picture of the wall and brings the picture back to him and looks at the picture of the wall hes so far south he cant confront anything thats in front of him you tell him to look at the window he sort of reaches out to the window with beam or something makes picture of it and pulls the picture back up to him looks at it and tells you the window has bars on it this case requires objectives until its

theres ridge when thetan feels under attack or maybe unacked first reaction is to stop so he mocks up mass bt sitting around or on nerve channel who is awakened and suddenly mocks up mass or ridge will shut down the nerve and knock the guy anaten knocks the body anaten not the pc in the head especially when cluster suddenly mocks up mass it shuts off nerve channels some people who are deaf or blind might simply have cluster sitting on nerve and its gone on so many years the nerve atrophies catatonics may be suffering from this sort of knockout this explains why tactile process works you run tactile on the bed etc after an accident and the guy comes out of it another source of anaten is being exuding anaten he can be piece of anaten and he also exudes anaten and beings around him go anaten it is feeling an unconsciousness feeling cluster going into anaten then influences cluster b and then cluster b comes up tone into unconsciousness and you get anaten these clusters exist as solidities way below unconsciousness and on iii dont respond at all both phenomena above produce anaten something that isnt there its also possible to run into bt thinking he is negative mass and cutting off perception or sensation in an area417occasionally you may run into some bts hanging together in mocked up vacuum some bts have something that isnt there they were withdrawing from something but there was nothing there its either suppressed out of existence or it happened once and they stuck in the pattern of withdrawing they can even justify and think thers something theyre withdrawing from they put something there to withdraw from negative mockup or they think another bt is putting something there that isnt there somatics sometimes they blow and somatic turns on two beings crunched together and at the point of crunch they get somatic it takes multiple mass to create somatic whether its number of bts or clusters the somatic mechanism is mass versus mass not cluster versus body but cluster vs cluster or bt vs bt or bts and clusters vs bts and clusters or cluster vs cluster with bt squashed in the middle the cluster vs cluster somatic is more severe than

blow until both mechanisms are handled bt could mock up pole trap and another bt come along and stick to it you blow the 1st bt and still have the pole trap which is being kept there by the bt who stuck in it so you ask what are you ack who are you and blow bt who was stuck to it the whole body is trap because its bts getting stuck to bts you blow the thetan mocking it up first and it tends to

specialist checksheet acs auditors acs cses ned for ots series 27 c n f i d n t i l ned for ots checklist the basic biological structure of the body is transparent to thetan the preots perception hangs up on bts and clusters these bts and clusters have the ability to change and control thetans perception whereas mest wont bts and clusters are too close to thetans wavelength and can therefore exert control primary target for ned for ots is things that are not part of the biological machine body but think they are and get in the way this is what you want to handle the preots sight hangs up on these btcluster masses the successive steps of the rundown have to do with the parts of the body he can see the phenomena encountered and the processes you handle these with the actual criterion the auditor uses is what is the preot looking at what can he see and can he blow it the ideal scene transparent body which does not interfere with the sight of the thetan and is free from unwanted sensations pains or pressures the primary error thetan makes is mistaking these btcluster masses for the body or mistaking anothers pictures as his own the procedure has cyclic pattern of getting rid of the obvious ones then dead or unresponsive ones then obvious ones over and over you are liable to run into any of these manifestations at any time and need to know the processes which handle 1handling what the preots attention is on establish this by folder or by d of p interview or both you should also check on what his attention is avoiding 1a repair using ldn ot iiirb if needed 1b repair of any recent bad session 1c any needed assist4261d remedy of any vitamin or mineral deficiency especially vitamin bl or calcium 1e end of endless int repair if needed all the above are optional steps and depend on the current state of the pre ot mainly determined by the question what is the preots attention on and what is his attention avoiding care must be used with the later not to throw the preot in over his head 2indoctrination step this consists of clearing definitions of misus in ot iii materials clearing definitions of terms used in ned for ots reading the basic theory issues of ned for ots and indoctrination in the basic technique of the rundown it is mandatory step 3perception step this is an optional step done if the preots perception is not up to perceiving mental masses an ability necessary to this rundown it could be tested as simply as asking the preot to close his eyes and tell you if he can see through the head or the body it is only done in order to get him able to perceive mental massesbts and clusters which is the ep of this step 4past auditing this step is done if past auditing reads and preot is interested if not dont take it up if not taken up at this point be alert for preot colliding with bts and clusters hung up in past auditing at later point during the rundown and if there is bog check for and handle past auditing 4a dl the point when preot went clear and handle ownership of pictures by preot 4b handle bts who went clear and were audited on engrams mistaking others pictures as their own and resulting in invalidation of their state of clear 4c bts who went exterior and were prevented from blowing or audited past exterior 4d bts audited past erasure resulting in invalidation of erasure 4e copies of any of the above including the situation where the original bt has blown leaving behind bt who copied the overrun etc 4f repair of past auditing by assessment of names of auditors including solo auditing and selfauditing4274g repair of wrong dates wrong locations including any partially or wrongly dated or located cluster note that right date or location for one will be wrong for those remaining nb do not overdo this step as auditing is late on the track and is not the basic for bts and clusters past auditing has to be repaired to the degree that it gets in the way of doing anything else on ned for ots if you tried to handle all the auditing there had ever been on the case you could go on forever you may run into some bt whos been misaudited when doing later steps but repair of past auditing is done to point where preot is happy with it and it isnt getting in the road of ned for ots the danger of handling too much past auditing is crossrestimulation phenomena you are likely to encounter on past auditing step dormant bts woken up by dianetic or ned auditing shell bt body itself being magnet for btsclusters due to dietary or mineral or vitamin deficiency misownership of pictures and of incidents bts in valences copying of current or recent stress or shocksbetween session restimulation bts with outint bts who are stuck on btsclusters stuck down the track or out of pt btsclusters jammed together by rough auditing or misdating btsclusters with an intention or goal opposed to auditing overcorrection ie what is being corrected on one is uncorrecting on another cognitions or eps encountered on past auditing step realization that pictures are bts or clusters and not the preots with confirmation of preots state of clear and the clearing up of attendant mysteries relief from bpc and somatics realization like the sw ep of im not going to get any worse4285mass mistaken for the mass of the body the primary error preot makes is in thinking that the mass or solidity or sensation heshe experiences is the body the action taken on this step is to have the preot look at his body and spot masses that are not the body and blow these either by inspection or by the various techniques phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step facsimiles of body or bodies superimposed over the body an impaction of pictures bt with an overt on other bts or cluster eg having made them into cluster getting misdirected by the picture or mass the bt puts up the preot needs to be taught to shift attention from the picture or mass to the bt or cluster bts or clusters stuck on the surface ie bts who went on bts who think they are body or think they are necessary to the running of body central core of btsclusters that other bts and clusters are sticking to cognitions or eps encountered on false body step realization that the body is transparent or translucent to an ot and that the mass perceived is not the body somatic relief and lessening mass false exterior perception caused by the preots attention being pulled out by bts as they aredeparting realization that bts think they are pinned to the body but are actually pinned to other bts and clusters body getting less tense and mass expanding and getting less rigid 6btsclusters being body parts this step directly addresses bts or clusters who are being body parts such as hand foot etc the preot should be asked to look at part of his body and see if it is solid and then blow the solidity by inspection or by various techniques body parts can be called off by the auditor and those that read handled429phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step bts and clusters being hand brain etc bts and clusters who think they cant leave as they think they are indispensible to the functioning of the body bts and clusters being negative mass invisiblebeing model forms in the valence of body parts ie terminals and btsclusters being body conditions ie unconsciousness or broken leg btsclusters sitting on nerve channel and shutting off perception or causing anaten and btsclusters exuding anaten composite masses that need to be split up by using the thetan hand technique and then blown piece by piece btsclusters being hand or leg btsclusters holding other bts and clusters in somatics caused by bts and clusters locked together ie bt vs bt or cluster vs cluster btsclusters being in the valence of anything btsclusters going into the valence of person in pt btsclusters holding other btsclusters in front as shield pts bts who have had one sp in common over several lifetimes btsclusters transferred from another person to preots body eg bts from his grandmother etc btsclusters being an illness or aberration or an accident pneumonia wound car wreck etc they are also in the valence of picture of it btsclusters being significances tired anemesis etc btsclusters being ideas or identities that are ideas christian scien tist insanity go to town etc plural identity an us one that thinks its many and many who think theyre one cognitions or eps encountered on body parts step less pressure and restimulation becoming more noticeable at session end and from one session end to another blows getting easier and faster430looks like the number is infinite and youll never get rid of them as they just keep popping up but realizing that it isnt really this way and that progress is being made case change of extroverted attention ie preots attention extro verted and on the environment 7btsclusters on or around the body this step is run generally with the preot finding and blowing bts and clusters as he encounters them this includes bts and clusters that are on the body inches from the body feet from the body yards from the body or way off all of these in which the auditor is interested are connected to and are influencing the body one is not interested in other peoples bts or clusters but only those directly influencing the preots body because the preots attention distance has increased by the time you get to this step this is relatively easy to do the auditor of course is not interested in using this one preot to clear the planet but should not object too strenuously if the preot engages in some side actions that do not directly concern him but realize that this is not this step or any other step care must be taken to ensure that only one mass or area or category is restimulated and fully handled before activating another the caution from ot iii pack about not using too wide an attention span applies here phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step misidentified bts and clusters who have copied each others incidents and implants btsclusters switched in time misconception btsclusters switched in location misconception remote bts ie stuck on another person or in another location where preots attention is fixed or drawn to btsclusters with something that isnt there multiple masses creating somatics invisible secret and hiding bts and clusters hypnotized bts and somnolent bts and clusters bts mocking up things they think they area old between lives areas remote implant stations of the past btsclusters who being stuck in the past and lookforward think they are looking at the future cognitions or eps encountered on this step431body getting lighter more relaxed and more in control much less mass around realization that btsclusters were causing body shape distortions and that body is moving back into position 8generally spotting and blowing bts and clusters this step consists of having preot locate and blow any bt or clusters that are visible or perceivable including handling any bts or clusters restimulated this is based on the old maxim that if you get enough charge off or if you keep on getting charge off you will make case gain and an entrance to the case will show up you are likely to encounter any of the phenomena or manifestations of bts and clusters there is general cyclic pattern of encountering btsclusters that are hard to blow or that are holding other btsclustersfollowed by series of easy blows then the same pattern repeats over and over 9remnant ridges partially blown ridges clusters there is mechanism of bt or cluster making ridgethen another bt or cluster comes along and sticks to the ridge you blow the bt or cluster who made the ridge first then remnant of the ridge remains containing bts who stuck in it and are now keeping it there and you have to blow these off too they generally blow easily another example of this is bt being pole trap another bt comes along and sticks to the pole trap you first blow the bt being the pole trap and then you have to blow the bt who stuck to it the auditor has the preot look for old ridges remnants of ridges and masses and completes handling these to fully blown phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step btsclusters left stuck in the ridge or picture that was mocked up by another bt or cluster btsclusters being objects in another bts or clusters pictures such picture is hard to blow unless you recognize that the picture is composed of bts being the parts of the picture hard core bts and clusters that are very hard to blow btsclusters with outint btsclusters with stuck flows bts stuck on the inside of ridge who tried to blow but get caught by the ridge when you blow the ridge you find lot of bts blowing out from under the ridge432bts and clusters being ridges apparent inert masses that behave like ridges and have to be brought to life with hello ok technique two bts pushing so hard against each other that each one thinks that its blocked by ridge and to blow the ridge you have to blow the two bts cognitions or eps encountered on this step body distortions clearing up cognition of i am well 10flow assessment recall process this process handles bts and clusters with very stuck flows it is run per the hcob on it to its ep phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step btsclusters unable to move on the time track because time itself becomes stuck flow forward to them btsclusters who dive down the time track on time stuck flow basis btsclusters who suddenly pop into view as they were in revivs down the time track and werent even in sight which is what gives the pre ot theidea that its endless btsclusters masses who appear to be in pt whose pressures are in pt but who are really way down the track and who need only small jerk given by the preot to unstick them from the track the erroneous idea of the preot that he is in the past because he is being influenced by bts and clusters that actually are in the past fear of the future which is really protest bringing about the apparency of being stuck on he time track and that the time flow can actually stick someone 11generally addressing the body with ned for ots the auditor now has the preot look at the body and in particular any somatic area or area of chronic somatics phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step false body parts ie false leg bt or cluster being false leg btsclusters transferred from another person who had such physical433condition or bts or clusters who copied such condition btsclusters stuck in drugs or painkillers or anaesthetics used or taken in the body area very small bts that come up to tremendous size before blowing some with concept of negative space heavy mass unresponsive or inert btsclusters bts stuck in body beingnesses both body parts and body conditions btsclusters who are making body identityless btsclusters btsclusters that are dead that think theyre mest that think they are molecules or planets cluster causing dislocated bone or trying to break bone or spine plus the bts or clusters being the damaged body part and holding onto the damage or copying it btsclusters who are being broken legs misformed arms cancer damaged brains or other nonoptimum body parts or conditions bts or clusters operating on refusal to make pictures the negative of obsessively mocking up cognitions or eps encountered on this step extroversion ep for session and fning ta awareness that anything perceived as mass or somatic in the body is not the body but comes from btsclusters cognition re mocking up pictures due to loss of memory actual exterior perception of preot increasing case change of reaching into body and finding nothing there ie in an area of body and it being clean for the first time cognition of personal identity much more intense than previously 12specifically addressing chronic somatic areas of body this is more specific address to any area of chronic or recurring somatic some chronic somatics depart very fast and dont return these are almost miracle in nature other chronic somatics gradually lessen and can disappear in the course of the whole rundown so dont despair if you dont get an instant alleviation of the chronic somatic but just keep on with the rundown and dont specialize in chronic somatics also be very cheered up when you434hit an instant disappearance of one both conditions can exist in the same pre ot on different chronic somatics phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step an aura which is whole package of bts and clusters formed into the shape of body and aura with other bts and clusters stuck in it very heavy anaten holding clusters glued together bts and clusters in other parts of the body affecting the somatic area bts and clusters in very suppressed or compressed state that blow up to huge size and mass and surround and go through the whole body bts and clusters behind or on the other side_of or inside bones or organs or on the other side of ridge these are very likely to be missed as one wouldnt think to look there nulls or unresponsive btsclusters that are totally out of communica tion and need to be put into comm by running hellos and oks on them bt or cluster believing he is his own picture or someone elses bts or clusters being negatives ie ___________ like stomach etc these come about from intentions to obliterate and probably are the root of sickness the manifestation of preot trying to look at or into body part or area and mass or ridge kicking in between the preot and the area cognitions or eps encountered on this step cognition i can do anything any other being can do lot of somatic blows and the first real gain on the somatic area 13mass that kicks in when preot tries to look toward or into an area of the body such mass can be quite severe and can knock the preot anaten as it is bt or cluster mass and prevents perception it must be handled in order for the preot to be able to see or reach into the body the auditor gets the pre ot to look and then handles the mass that kicks in until it is fully cleared up then has the preot look or reach into his body again and then clears up the next mass that kicks in and so on until he can reach into the area of the body then you clean up that area of the body fully and the preot will be able to reach further into the body as each successive area of the body is cleaned up and becomes transparent his reach is further extended toward the ideal scene of body that is transparent to the ot and does not impede his perception or control435phenomena you are likely to encounter on this step any or all of the previous phenomena bts outside of and at distance from the body putting mass on the body bts and clusters that are so inert that they have to be thrown off physically plus you also have to throw away the arms you threw them off with nb this difficulty in blowing off bts has also been caused by deficiency of vit bl andor insufficient rest btsclusters who apparently had outint but didntthey had copied other bts who had had out int bts and clusters who supposed they were being pulled in but werent they had just concluded that they were bts being damaged body part and because they were being damaged couldnt do anything about it cognitions or eps encountered on this step ability to look cleanly into areas of the body that couldnt be reached into cleanly before 14cleaning the body of btcluster masses the preot now works on cleaning up the body of btcluster masses one area at time until each is clean andtransparent to his perception each of the various techniques given in the materials are used as needed to blow these btcluster masses you may in some instances have to have the preot handle bts dianetically running them back through chain of incidents this can be complex with 3 or 4 bts and chains crossed it is very dicey to run engrams on bts as although they may have one mutual one each one has an earlier chain for it that is different than that of the others in the cluster so you limit the action to the mutual incident they have in common scn grades oiv can be run on bt but this would not be usual as the bts were dealing with in ned for ots are below that when the preot has transparent body and clear area around it to some distance barring perception of other peoples

ots series 28 c n f i d n t i l stuck flows the genus of bt youll get lot of blows early on the rundown when the preot realizes its not his body hes looking at but ridges composed of bts and clusters in the shape of his body then you get into more hard core ones theyre on such stuck flow they cant blow outint could be the genus of bt and outint would have to precede cluster if int were out each bt would start identifying into each others pictures when flow is run too long in one direction it will jam up and stick then it can snap back the other way eg he gets overrun on going out of things the flow jams and he snaps back in and stays in there are actually two stages of int aoverrun get out of bthe stage of go in before go out of course this is misconception too as how can thetan be in anyway what forces him to do it is the vector flow line the flow of going out gets overrun sticks then flips back on itself and he goes in and stays in its the overrun flow reversing on him that jams him in his think on it is like im so tired of going out so ill stay in thats his think but what sticks him in is the overrun flow of going out the flow jams and reverses theres also misconception of someone being told hes out when hes in and being told hes in when hes out and theres having pictures of being out when in and pictures of being in when out misconception that they are where their picture is what you have run into is hard core of bts with int so badly out you have hard437time blowing them finding the earliest time they went in works mechanically but it must be based on some postulate or idea that what comes later is made by the earlier the mechanism of an overrun flow sticking and then snapping back in reverse is based on agreement with some set of physical universe laws which are misconceptions hypnotism maybe outint and hypnotic condition align an overrun flow eventually winds up with unconsciousness and that would wind up to hypnotism hypnotism is the state of being under the duress of anothers command bts are so suggestible and mock up things theyd have to be hypnotized its an artificial state brought about by drugs shock or being under the misconception that they are hypnotized how do you wake them up one way is to count 4 3 2 1 and snap your fingers short cut is simply to tell them to wake up or you can ask him how do you wake up bt answers you do itand bt wakes up and blows one of the techniques from hypnotism is to ask the person how to wake them up eg how do you wake up bt says snore so you make snoring noise bt wakes up this works on people or bts in hypnotic state they can be hypnotized by shock or explosion and then stay in somnolent state part of the anaten you encounter is their state of unconsciousness stuck flows outint is prior to cluster they identify into each others pictures and become one so you have outint as condition for bts and clusters the first condition would be making pictures in the first place the book one reason for pictures is that they are safe way to live without thinking you dont have to think just act on reaction its putting an ability onto machine maybe what started the current wave of disassociation is that these people are living in tv stuck flow and computer age even kids at schools have electronic calculators why they make pictures is basically loss there are large periods on the track when there was universe or environment and pictures are havingness some verse or environment and pictures are havingness some thetans think pictures equates to memory mocking up pictures is inability to recall when they lose memories they then mock up pictures somebody mocking up pictures is identityless so theyre more likely to becoming bts or becoming part of cluster they become identityless and then go into false identities destruction of memory is actually caused by misownership of experience on ned for ots you get lots of blows then you run into these hard core bts that are hard to blow they have stuck flows and its matter of how to unstick flow one way to unstick flow is to reverse the flow these bts are hung up on stuck flows of out and in they think theyre up against another thetan and actually its their own stuck flows that stick them flows can stick both ways youd only be able to run process one direction for short while before it would stick one way of destimulating is to tell them come up to present time theres stuck flow of moving along the time track with time it becomes stuck flow of moving forward on the time track and one day they move backwards and stick on the track the stuck flow reversed that might be why ned works it moves them back down the track reversing the stuck flow of time moving back on the track is something they havent done and its438undoing the stuck flow more than anything we are dealing with stuck flow phenomena not pictures or anything else another stuck flow phenomenon is reduced awareness they go anaten and into hypnotic trance state maybe outint and hypnotic condition align stuck flow is what youre up against in ned for ots and that is the genus of bt and thats what bt is stuck flow so any ned for ots auditor is going to run into stuck flows the impact or explosion that forms cluster is the precipitation the stuck flow is the predisposition these bts already had stuck flows and are predisposed to becoming cluster the sudden shock or impact precipitates it and they become cluster theres special trick of blowing bts by doing an effortpostulate action go little bit earlier and they blow through later all you have to do is give them little jerk down the time track and they will spring up the time track as you have unlocked the stuck time flow preot doing this will find it very handy it has now been proven by the flow assessment recall process that int is stuck flows and it is the prior stuckflow they can try to outflow against an inflow but thats what ridge is the flow assessment recall process will tear up ridges that couldnt blow it handles bts that are so stuck they cant blow it is run by outflow inflow and flow on quad flows you have to run flow as thats the way lot of bts are and the past is flow the past doesnt flow and theyre stuck in the past steps of flow assessment recall process 1clear the word flow and clear each of the quad flows f1 f2f3 f0 and ensure that preot understands the direction of each flow 2clear inflow outflow and flow 3clear the flows on the assessment sheet 4this is targetted with the attention directed at one cluster with very narrow attention beam otherwise you will have every bt in the body going batty its very narrow atten tion at one small part of the body it doesnt take very long if your attention beam is narrow if the attention beam is too wide he will go mad for example the facethe chest this assessment has got to be directed at the same area and dont shift the area until you get bd and fn 5assessment as you are dealing with bts you will get better meter reads if the preot calls the assessment lines the auditor notes the reads put the name of the body part being addressed on the assessment sheet the word recall is not used in the assessment just the flow 6take the largest reading line and have the preot run recall assessed item on439bts telepathically this will produce reads and an sbd or bd and fn it is not run past the first sbd or bd or it will overrun and start jumping into another flow at first sbd or bd fn you cease running the process and indicate the fn 7reassess the assessment sheet and run the next largest reading line by recall process continue to reassess and run the largest reading line over and over and over it will eventually go into an fning assessment notes on process if you get an sbd or bd during the assessment take that line and run it by recall do not continue through the assessment as you have bding item if you get bd fn on assessment dont run that line by recall____________ as it will just overrun there was blow on that line indicate the fn then continue assessing for next line to run later in the assessment the sensitivity will have to be raised way up to pick up reads and you run any slightest read even if only tick or stop if during assessment or during the process the ta suddenly drops bds into an f ning ta you dont continue that session dont continue to assess or ask another auditing question just simply indicate the fning ta and end off the session take up the assessment tomorrow it may just fn or you may get further reads to run but do not continue the assessment or process past sudden bd to fning ta the ep is when you cant get any more reads with sensitivity cranked up and you just get an fning assessment l ron hubbard founder lrhdmkjm copyright c 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights

theres another process of getting rid of bts and clusters it is not always that magnificient but it is sometimes functional what you do is mock up thetan hand and using the edge of it as sort of knife you pass it between the body and black masses and sever them off these masses are attached to the body by strings or lines or suction cups or beams you sever the line or string holding them to the body sometimes the mocked up hand departs with them because after all it was mocked up and it would of course vanish composite masses and layered clusters you use this technique the thetan hand to separate ridges and masses or to split up opposite masses two or more ridges may be jammed together into mass sometimes there are layers upon layers of clusters pass the thetan hand between them between two ridges or masses or layer of clusters to sever the connection and split them up into separate pieces which can then be blown one piece at time completely unresponsive masses sometimes you will encounter mass that is so inert that it wont even come into communication with hello and ok such masses may have to be thrown off physically using mocked up hand the preot simply takes the mass and physically throws it off and then throws away the mocked up hand too so there is connection or line back to the body this has been referred to as the yoheave technique and while it isnt particularly of benefit to bts and clusters it is way of getting rid of completely unresponsive mass when all else fails such unresponsive masses are not that common most commonly any difficulties in blowing bts and clusters come from overrestimulaton due to too long session b overrun session ep fn ta c lack of sleep or tiredness of the preot or d deficiency of calcium or vitamin b1 those are the most common reasons for difficulty and are easily remedied l ron hubbard founder lrhdmkjm copyright c 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved444hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

missed bts if chronic somatic doesnt resolve there are missed bts and clusters causing it there are several ways in which bts and clusters can be missed or overlooked first of all is by the preot thinking that the mass he perceives is the body when it actually is the mass of bts and clusters next there is the bt or cluster producing somatic in another part of the body or influencing another part of the body have the preot trace back from the picture or somatic to the bt or cluster the preot can do this even though the bts and clusters are generally confused about whose picture is whose as the preot looks for where the bt or cluster is the meter will read and the auditor can steer the preot and help him find the position in the body of that bt or cluster some bts and clusters are hiding secretive being invisible hidden or withdrawn ask the preot to look for bts and clusters in each of these categories and blow them be sure to complete handling one category before taking up another category or youll get overrestimulation and beef up then there is the bt or cluster holding other bts and clusters in or one bt or cluster holding other bts or clusters compressed or suppressed handle the bt or cluster doing this first then the others will blow off easily when very small mass is activated it will increase insize before blowing there can be thousand or two bts in such mass and sometimes these explode apart as they blow although the mass becomes very heavy when it is activated its not big bt its lot of little bts under suppression you can run into cluster causing damage to the body and after blowing this cluster you then look for and handle other bts and clusters who were copying it or stuck in pictures of the damaged area and held in it or holding onto it there are bts and clusters who are refusing to make pictures as well as bts and clusters obsessively making pictures these need to be looked for and handled some bts and clusters are being inert masses and dont seem to respond until put into communication and could be missed unless the preot were asked to look for bts and clusters being inert masses bts and clusters being dead or who think they are dead being mest being molecules the preot may think heshe has an aura an aura actually is collection of bts and445clusters mocking up the aura and sticking in it as it is highly electronic mock up it is being mocked up by bts and clusters and has bts and clusters sticking in it you may encounter something like whole person body and bts and clusters that were suppressed down to nothing you contact it as very small mass and it increases in size to whole body and aura complete with bts and clusters mocking it up and sticking in it but thats what an aura is collection of bts and clusters and thats all it is very small dense masses these when activated can increase to huge size and mass knocking the preot anaten sometimes for quite long period of time as the anaten comes off the mass will start to disintegrate the anaten is the glue that holds them together and when the anaten runs out the bts and clusters will blow off easily the preot can work on cleaning out body part or area of bts and clusters and get the area looking clean then you have the preot look inside or behind or on the other side of bones or organs or ridges in the area to find bts and clusters unless you have the preot look inside or behind or on the other side these would be missed or overlooked in one instance somatic didnt start to resolve until this action was done bts and clusters can be conditions as different from being terminal conditions that they associate with the body whatever the body can do eg being who was being unconsciousness so have the preot look for bts or clusters being body conditions bt or cluster can believe that he is his own picture or somebody elses picture for that matter picture that is hard to blow is probably composed of bts and clusters being the objects in the picture eg picture of field with tree and cow in it the tree is being being tree theres being being cow and being being field together these beings compose the picture or you could have one being being pole trap and another thetan who came along and stuck to the pole trap so if picture is hard to blow check for bts and clusters being the objects of which the picture is composed and when you have blown the original beings also blow off any who stuck to it phrases such as man of my kidney got spine got to have spine stomach for it confuse bts and clusters in those body parts and play role in pinning them in you may run into such phrases or cliches when asking the what who questions just acknowledge and repeat the what who question probably the root of sickness or psychosomatics is in negative beingnesses bts and clusters being the negative of body part such as hand or stomach body etc when you ask the what who questions youll run into answers such as hand then it will flip to the positive hand before blowing these negatives come about from intentions to obliterate so they become ________ they tend to act as negative terminal to positive terminal and thus keep things pinned down after youve cleaned up somatic area of all bts and clusters in it and being it and hidden behind have the preot look for these negative beingnesses some chronic somatics depart very fast and dont return these are almost miracle in nature other chronic somatics gradually lessen and can disappear in the course of the whole rundown so dont despair if you dont get an instant alleviation of the chronic somatic but just keep on with the rundown and dont specialize in chronic somatics also be very cheered up when you hit an instant disappearance of one both conditions can exist in the same preot on different chronic somatics l ron hubbard lrhdmkjm founder copyright c 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved446hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

the ned for ots rundown you will run into phenomenon where the pre ot has been limiting his attention to masses on or in the body and not putting his attention out on the perimeter the preot in shifting his wavelength of attention down to the wavelength of bts and clusters will end up getting wavelength shift down to theirs attraction of attention by putting attention on them you activate them but this will wind up with the pre ot being pulled down to their wavelength the trick is to put your attention on the outer perimeter and find something inside it not put your attention on the something you try to put your attention on the perimeter and your attention gets pulled into somatic area its bts and clusters pulling your attention into them they are invisible and are trying to get attention they have an impossible problem of trying to get attention but cant get attention only their mass or their creating somatic would get attention its almost as if pictures are trick to get attention this factor of trying to get attention is why thetan goes into mass this is an explanation for life and why thetan picks up body the reason why acknowledgement works is because an acknowledgement is attention this is attraction of attention you try to put your attention on point it is pulled back to bt or cluster its contest of trying to put your attention on the actual body and their magnetic pull of attention onto themselves there is also factor of negative attention they dont want attention on them and knock you unconscious if you put attention on them447a way to handle is to move such bts and cluster back to the first time they wanted attention and they blow putting attention out to perimeter have the preot put his attention outward to the perimeter or look toward the outer perimeter and the preot will find something inside the perimeter and you have the preot blow it off you will by doing this encounter black mass and you can start quite mass commotion have the preot look further than the perimeter of the body and he will find masses out there pushing in on the body handle these masses with the what are you ack who are you technique and they blow practically all somatics respond this way the bt or cluster out there is keeping bone or the body in state of distortion bts or clusters can turn on kind of fluid which is painful when it touches the body its not that they are in an incident that has that somatic they exude this fluid and when it hits the body its painful if you lift your attention beam and put it out theyll tend to follow your attention beam and sometimes come halfway out if the preots body is up against solid object the bts and clusters can get stuck in the object suck as chair the idea is to have the preot look out to the perimeter or past the perimeter and contact masses out there that are pushing in on the body blow these off with the what are you ack who are you technique it is really remarkable how well this works

fumes etc the item is handled by finding and blowing off bts and clusters who are being the item b resisting the item449the item will then cease to read step two the body part the body part affected by the item eg for the item dust the body part was lungs for poison or bad food the body part could be stomach on this step you handle bts being the body part ie being lungs this includes the negative of bts being body part such as lungs and bts and clusters stuck in and on the body part or area of the body or affecting the body part or area when all such bts and clusters are handled the body part will longer read step three illness the next action is to handle illnesses of the body partie bts and clusters being sick lungs or being condition of an illness or disease or the body part illness of body part will cease to read step four cures for illness you will now find bts and clusters being cures for illnesses of the body part handle all such bts and clusters by blowing them off cures for illness will then cease to read step five protest of cures for the illness you will now find bts and clusters protesting cures for the illness blow all these off and protest of cures for the illness will cease to read step six body part you will find that the original body part will now be reading again you handle all bts and clusters on or in or being the body part until theyre all handled and the body part just fns step seven item now the original item from step one will be reading again and so you blow off all bts and clusters on the item this includes bts and clusters with engrams on the item bts and clusters who have been run on the item when they didnt have that item ie wrong item for them and bts and clusters who copied it you may even encounter bts who went clear and thought they had engrams on it when they didnt step eight illness on it there are periods of time when the person had the physical condition sometimes years of illness which due to mutual shared experience of the illness made cluster this is the period of the illness or physical condition as clustermaking incident these are bts and clusters who were not actually connected with the item or illness themselves but were made into cluster and added on due to the period of illness which they experienced the above are the full steps and sequence for handling physical condition or450illness if not done fully or omitted the condition will recur so all steps must be fully done in that sequence on each step of this sequence the bts and clusters are handled with the various techniques given for blowing them the valence technique is the most usual and effective method the item for step one is found by asking the preot for what caused or produced the condition it will most likely be the first item given by the preot be alert for getting into listing or getting an outlist if so the most likely error is that it was the first item on the list and this item was invalidated by going past it or by overlisting past it or the item was found and audited previously but not fully handled resulting in the item being suppressed or invalidated the steps are repeated here in short form for auditor use 1the item

person to another eg bt went from preots grandfather to prepts mother to preot so the preot now has bts who were pts to mother and grandfather and the preot was in contact with these bts when they were on mother and earlier in the preots life when the bts were on grandfather this transfer of bts to successive family members causes genetic misidentification it convinces bts that they are genetic there are also bts who went pts to person that they were pts to in an earlier life or lives they run into the same person in this lifetime and go into restim when person gets sick there is usually pts terminal to be found at the bottom of it but the ptsness may be that of bt or cluster which then hits the pc now if you went on listing this bt or cluster you would find one for sure but it is not the pts terminal for all of the bts in the custer so when you finish you will have indicated the wrong pts terminal and will have hung the remainder of the cluster with wrong item which they will then dramatize so dont list bt or cluster by l n what you do is ask them who or what they are pts to at which time you will probably get blow of some of them then you indicate to those that didnt blow that it is wrong item for the rest of them you will either get the cluster blown with these two steps or the rest of them will blow by other ned for ots processes when running ned for ots you will sometimes encounter the phenomenon of preots attention fixed on or drawn to remote point and the preot can blow off the bt or cluster in that remote location that is drawing his attention if the remote point is person the preot is pts to you could expect an amazing change of the remote person where he or she now tries to restore communication with the preot or ends the conflict or problem this is the phenomenon of the sp now making things right with the pts person being handled and is the same ep as is encountered on the new vitality rundown and on ptsproblems handling when it is done

would be impossible to indicate all the fns anyway especially later in the rundown whats more important is indicating where the charge is sometimes steering the preot by meter read to where the bt is located in the body or sorting out whether its single bt cluster cumulative cluster etc the auditor should inform the preot of what is reading and use the meter reads to help preot identify and find

1auditor completes handling bts who went clear and were audited on engrams auditor can then check did went clear and then audited on engrams act as wrong item for other bts to whom it did not apply and if reading indicates this was wrong item to the others example 2auditor completes handling bts audited past erasure then auditor can check did audited past erasure act as wrong item to other bts and if reading indicate if discomfort or lack of gis seems to indicate trouble has occurred be sure to check if it has acted as wrong item however you can also use the repair list ned for ots series 24 this pheonmenon of other bts taking on wrong item by copying what is run on other bts tends to happen on any category or button being run it happens to far greater degree if an overrun occurs ie one goes on trying to handle the same category or button after it has been handled and starts in on new area of the body or new category using the same category or button that has just been handled

for ots series 16 the phenomenon of partially blown bts causing exterior visio is described and the handling is given in addition to sometimes causing an apparency of exterior perception partially blown bts can cause physical reaction of discomfort not having fully blown they react back against the body with energy or mass the reason why they only partially blow is because they are still mixed up in mass with untouched unaudited bts that stick them by having the preot reach out in front of the partially blown bts with question who are you the uncleared bt or bts get handled this may have to be repeated as the group of bts may blow further out and hang up again simply keep putting the question who are you out in front of the bts each time they hang up until they blow apart and clear fully and completely it is interesting that the mass sometimes flies apart like sparks way out there it is at that moment the preot experiences feeling of relaxation l ron hubbard founder lrhdmkjm copyright

checksheet acs auditors acs cses ned for ots series 46 c n f i d n t i l bts with misunderstood words i have discovered that bts can have misunderstood words too the bodys ear might hear one thing and the bt might hear something else entirely direct this results in misu sounds and oral words the bts dont know what the person is saying nor do they know what is being said to the person due to these misus and the person gets caught in the middle of this flow channel experiencing the reaction to the bts misu the usual reaction of the bts is just to withdraw bts can get misus from reading matter foreign languages and i have found bts that dont speak english where it really goes wild is in auditing where the bt has misu on the auditing command or question they would then answer the auditing question wrong to themselves causing case hang up right there there is also basic consideration that the dead would not understand anything anyway this phenomenon of bts misus explains why some try to communicate with pictures since this can cause case to hang fire in auditing you need to know about this and to check for misu in the auditing command or question remembering that it could be bts misu and not necessarily the preots misu so auditors and cses are alerted to this as possible reason for case to hang fire the remedy is to repair the situation by checking for misus in the commands or auditing questions and handling bts hung up in these as rundown you would take these up by categories and fully handle them as follows but this as rundown comes later on in ned for ots 1clear with the preot the idea of communicating with bts by concept not with words the preot may have to learn this trick of communicating conceptually clear the words concept idea thought spoken words written words picture then clear theidea of communicating conceptually you may have to do little drill with the person by getting himher to think simple thought such as its nice day without verbalizing it or thinking in words or pictures you could have the person think the thought conceptually then think it with words then conceptually then with words468or even think the thought while saying different words or gobbledygook dont overdo this it is just to get the preot to point where he can communicate to bt conceptually 2assess through these categories until you get read bt with misu in auditing commands in auditing questions in spoken words in reading matter in entertainment in study in english in foreign languages symbol sound 3have the preot locate where the bt is in relationship to the body 4blow the bt by usual ned for ots techniques what who remembering that the pre ot must ask these questions and receive the answers to them conceptually so as to avoid misu words in this communication 5check for any other bt within this category and handle as above until there are more bts with misus in this category 6continue down the assessment in 2 above until you get read and handle as above and so on 7when you have completed the categories given above make final check for any other bt with misu and handle before leaving this rundown this discovery shows the importance of clearing words used in auditing questions and commands and the importance of clearing misu words in general and of course the fact that these misus may be bts misus rather than the persons own misus will dispel any mystery about why one can run into misu word phenomena when one knows the word himself but dont let this make you any less alert for words the preot may have misunderstood in auditing questions or commands and be sure to clear these these bts with misus are easily handled by use of the trick of communicating with them conceptually rather than with words l ron hubbard founder

warning all hcobs and material on listing errors apply to this procedure step one of the nots valence technique what are you is listing question it is asked to find the valence the bt or cluster is stuck in obsessively being thereby shifting the bt or cluster out of that valence sometimes bt or cluster will answer at first with wrong item or items then there wont be any valence shift nor will there be any blow finding the correct item the valence the bt or cluster is obsessively being will shift the bt or cluster out of that valence and remaining steps of acknowledging the item and asking who are you will produce the cognition im and it will blow the correct item in answer to the question what are you will read if there is read on the first item one has to list from the bt or cluster to get reading item it is often 6 or 10 item list but could be shorter including the first item on the list the following examples are given to show what such list could look like the items in these examples and the size of reads shown are not for reference but are purely by way of illustration470example 1 what are you leaf tree tree trunk branch twig broken limb lf fn the item example 2 what are you sword an arena crowd wild animal lion dust blood dying man gladiator f fn the item example 3 what are you brain lfbd fn the item example 4 what are you there is answer from the bt or cluster the technique used here is to run hello and okay see hcob 17 sep 78 issue i nots series 7 page 4 on the bt or cluster when it is answering up then proceed as above in other examples note bts or clusters occasionally blow on hello and okay after getting the item always acknowledge it sometimes it is necessary to acknowledge the item in order to get an fn sometimes the acknowledgement broadens the fn but the acknowledgement step must not be omitted relay of commands and answers the auditor has to indoctrinate the preot to relay the auditing question to the bt or cluster and to relay the answer from the bt or cluster to the auditor otherwise the auditor wouldnt know what item the bt gave in answer towhat are you nor would the auditor know whether it was reading item the auditor is responsible for the communication in the session and for control of the session471valence listing technique steps 1 where is the bt or cluster the auditor has the preot locate where the bt or cluster is by position in relation to the body the auditor notes the area named by the preot and whether it reads do not let the preot go looking for additional new areas until the reading area is fully handled 2 what are you the auditor has the preot ask the bt or cluster the question and relay the answers to the auditor the auditor writes these down and notes any read if the first item does not read the auditor has the preot continue to ask the question and relay the items to the auditor until there is reading item and must not go past it 3acknowledgement the preot acknowledges it 4 who are you the preot asks the bt who are you it cognites im and blows but if there is blow or if there are bts at once suspect that wrong item was found and correct it to the right item complete the steps to blow warning there is danger here of finding wrong item underlisting or overlisting wrong items and list errors recoil heavily on case bts and clusters in their lowered awareness are very susceptible to suggestion and tend to copy obsessively thus it is very essential that one does not leave any bt or cluster with wrong item or outlist auditors and cses are alerted to watch for any sudden decline of the case when this listing action has been done and to at once suspect and handle any outlistwrong item despite the danger of listing errors it will be necessary to use this technique of listing for the item at some point on any case being audited on ned for ots since bts and clusters often begin by giving wrong items in answer to the question what are you however good auditor can be trained to l n successfully and get the right item the indicators of wrong item see laws of l n are very obvious both to the auditor and cs and bring about dramatic case resurgence when spotted and corrected handling wrong item immediately when the preots gis go out or bis appear in the session the auditor must check fora wrong iteman outlist and handle find where the bt or cluster with the wrong item or outlist is by position in relation to the body and find and correct the wrong item outlist on that bt or cluster after locating and indicating the wrong item or list bpcalwaysfollow through and find the right item and continue the steps of the valence technique until the bt or cluster blows there may be more than one bt or cluster with wrong item or outlist so it is essential to locate the bt or cluster by position in relation to the body after handling the bt or cluster to blow check your original question wrong item list error again to ensure there are more bts or clusters with wrong item dont go on trying to repair wrong items when the questionwrong itemceases to read or fns or you will start messing up bts and clusters who did not have that wrong with them472if difficulty is encountered in repairing list error it could be sitting on an earlier outlist or wrong item on that bt or cluster an l4bra can be used to repair wrong item or outlist on bt or cluster but if so the list must be used method 3 and care used to find the bt or cluster by position and to handle each bt or cluster encountered to blow possible errors errors that could possibly be made and could be anticipated on this technique are athe auditor missing the read on the first item and causing overlisting blisting past the first reading item overlisting cleaving bt or cluster with wrong item dleaving bt or cluster not blown or only partially blown egoing past an fn on listing bypassing the item fleaving the list incomplete gjumping from one bt or cluster to another without completing the first one started hoverworking the questionwrong itemand trying to repair other bts who didnt have that wrong with them remember that all items are wrong to some degree as the only really right item isme these possible errors could even be assessed if need be ok to audit or cs it is called to attention that the march 66 hco pls on high crime policy apply to this issue and its references which must be high crimed by any auditor or cs before using them flub cram retread system the materials of l n are covered on class iv so there is excuse for an auditor to flub l n nor to be ignorant of the laws of l n the flub cram retread system means that on the first auditor flub he goes to cramming on the materials flubbed one more flub on these materials and he goes to retread it is system put in at flag to ensure that there were failures on fccis with new internes auditing in the hgc it is proven workable system it is imperative mandatory that the flub cram retread system be used on this listing technique on ned for ots and cs cramming officer nor techqual executive may get reasonable about this nor allow any persuasion or pressure to undermine or counter this system despite the liability to the pc if flubbed actions such as l n l n repair and dating locating are actually easy to do correctly produce spectacular results when done right and are sometimes necessary auditing techniques so dont get reasonable about demanding that these actions be done correctly their success depends on the auditors trs metering misunderstoods and thorough grasp of the materials473it is therefore made comm ev offence not to use the flub cram retread system on this nots listing technique and it is also comm ev able to decry or counter this system should an auditor flub again after retread he or she goes to full retrain from the bottom up per cs series 84 most auditors are keen to audit well and learn their materials and produce miracles as matter of course if they do not then their mus false data must be cleaned up and the materials thoroughly restudied so that they will get the expected excellent results from standard application of the tech another factor on flubby auditors is that sometimes an auditor or cs will dramatize the same outtech on pcs that exists on hisher own case therefore the attention of the cs or senior cs is called to this point and the case of flubbing techqual person should be checked for outtech and if there is any get it corrected in addition to the cramming or retread action lest this paragraph be misconstrued it does not change policy in any way andcase on postisnotan extenuating circumstance in any justice action nor may it be used as an excuse for any failure to know and apply the tech besides to pleadcaseas an excuse would be beneath contempt for any professional auditor cs supervisor etc then in addition to cleaning up any outtech found on that persons case handle the auditor and cs who flubbed and didnt handle it too if despite the above handlings the same person persists in repeating the same errors then you are up against case situation described in hcob 8 mar 62 the badauditor and hcob 15 mar 62 suppressors and such person must be removed from techqual lines for the sake of others this label should not be assigned lightly and the supervisors of such student and their seniors must be named as interested parties to the comm ev which would look into wiac pl outnesses graduating an overt product failure to use study tech and student corrective actions summary very often especially early on the nots program bts and clusters will blow on inspection or on finding where the bt or cluster is or before the steps of the valence technique have been done one must mot seek to carry on auditing bt after it has blown as this would result in other bts and clusters copying and misidentifying themselves with the blown bt many bts blow very easily sometimes after handling one bt or cluster you will get series of easy rapid blows or even repetitive or automatic blow these points are covered in earlier ned for ots issues and are not changed by anything in this issue this refinement in the valence technique will enable you to handle and blow bts and clusters with more accuracy and rapidity and there are some bts that wouldnt have blown otherwise that this listing step will handle l ron hubbard

hcob gives an additional step to the nots valence technique and further clarification of each of the steps of this technique the new step consists of acknowledging the answer doing so can guarantee blow lot of the time there is nothing there to acknowledge because it has already blown most of the time this isnt needed but when used it does prevent hangup when the bt hasnt gone so its actual value is the fact that it can guarantee blow by the way you can call one back and acknowledge it but dont get into that this is mentioned simply because it is possible to call them back the full steps of the valence technique 0identifying what you are going to handle although this is strictly speaking not part of the valence technique one has to start475off by finding bt or cluster that you are going to blow with the nots valence technique this zero step then consists of whatever action one is on such as rudiments nots program step repair list or whatever that uncovers reading charge that one identifies as bt or cluster having found reading charge one has to identify what that charge is coming from ie bt or cluster and less commonly bt that thinks its cluster or cluster that thinks its bt this step varies depending on what program step or category you are working on eg on program step 17 mass mistaken for the mass of the body you ask the pre ot to look over the body and tell if there is any mass or any massy body part or area or any area of the body that is solid when you get reading area of mass you then need to identify what this is ie is it bt is it cluster on step 18 bts being body parts you have the preot look over the various parts of the body until you get reading body part or you call off various parts ie head face neck inside outside etc until you get read in this instance you have the position or area of the body where the bt or cluster is but still need to identify it by asking bt cluster but note that in this instance as in the paragraph above you have also found where the bt or cluster is in relation to the body but if you are flying ruds or handling preparesd list to start with all you have is reading question you then findwhosecharge it is per hcob 20 dec 79 auditing somebody under constant and continuous pt stress and hcob 22 dec 79 flying ruds at ot iii and above by asking is it yours bts clusters or is it also __________s this action identifies what you have found and are now going to handle this is really preliminary step to the valence technique in which you are finding something to run and b identifying what you have found you are establishing whether it is bt cluster maybe several bts or even more than one cluster in the case of plural the preot would need to be told to limit his attention to one of these so you can handle one at time having found charge and identified what it is you now can move into the valence technique to blow that bt or cluster unless it has already blown by this point which is quite often so many blow by inspection especially if the preot is running cleanly and rapidly 1where is the bt or cluster the auditor has the preot locate where the bt or cluster is by position in relation to the body the auditor notes the area named by the preot and whether it reads when the preot names the correct place it will read do not let the preot go on looking for additional new areas until the reading area is fully handled as noted above under step 0 you may have already located where the bt is in which case you wouldnt then ask the preot to find where t is the location of bt or cluster is not always in the body they can also be on the body outside the body even at some distance from the body steps 0 and 1 are not rote these steps are done to then enable the preot to limit476his attention span to the specific bt or cluster while asking the auditing question otherwise you could jump from bt to bt restimulating other areas than that being worked on 2what are you note that any and all listing done follows the hcob 1 aug 68 the laws of listing and nulling these have not changed just because they are being used in different process an auditor who does not know these should not attempt this step and should master this hcob before attemtping this step the auditor has the preot ask the bt or cluster the question and relay the answer to the auditor who writes the answer down and notes whether it read only if the first item does not read do you list further items very often the first answer reads and that is the item if the first item did not read youve now got to ask him for another answer and you have got to make sure that it comes from that exact spot or area you have got to make sure that he isnt shifting his attention all over his left side or youd get the whole bank in that area alive you could say now from that same spot is there another answer another another and this is done only to the first reading item you might have to verify it is that answer from the same spot this is why you establish where the bt or cluster is located in step 1 as you can then ensure that the preot limits his attention to and directs the auditing question to that exact spot eg put your attention on the top of your left ear and ask what are you the auditor indicates the first reading item dont forget that the preot cant see the meter and the auditor must say what read and must not let the preot overlist you indicate the item by saying pc wording of the first reading item is the item dont get sloppy and say thats the item as how does he know what you mean by that if catfish was the item say catfish is the item normally but not always you will get an fn on finding and indicating the item but if you do not get an fn here you will on the next step warning on this step remember that you may have already received the answer in step 0 or step 1 bts and clusters may not be aware of the fact that they are living beings and may not release any charge at all on bt or cluster but when you ask where they are you may have gotten an answer to what they are being simply by asking for body locations this is not common but not uncommon either you asked if the bt was on his foot and you got big read in this what step you might have trouble getting reading item and might miss the fact that you already had the reading item for his what step in foot the bt was being foot and you discovered it by accident without recognizing it so if you have any trouble with the what step one of the first things to check is whether or not what already read on asking for the where on step 0 or step 1 if you suspect this put the named body part that read on the list and check it out as part of the list you wont have to do this often but you better know about it 3acknowledgement the auditor has the preot acknowledge the item this is very important see477nots series 7 even if you got an fn on the previous step you still acknowledge and you will broaden the fn and if you didnt get an fn previously you will on acknowledging the item and youll quite often get blow on this step 4who are you now we have to remember that it is the same spot again and we ask who are you and we dont feed them the answer they sometimes comm lag dont get impatient with the comm lag sometimes its few seconds comm lag and then you get the answer you may have to repeat the question the answer will normally lfbd and if that lfbd isnt very marked you make sure you do the next step of acknowledging the answer in any event you could still acknowledge but if the lfbd was pronouned the probability is that hes gone now there is special condition you can run into on the who are you question if the bt answers with significance or identity answer this is covered in nots series 7 but if this continues suspect that you may have gotten wrong item on the what are you question or that the preot has used too broad an attention span or let his attention wander to other areas and he is getting answers from other bts or clusters 5acknowledgement the auditor has the preot acknowledge the bts meanswer this action can guarantee blow now if this acknowledgement produces another read then we know it guaranteed blow sometimes you get another lfbd on the acknowledgement step and sometimes you get broadening of the fn and that completes the steps of the nots valence technique cautions sometimes quite often in fact this shortcircuits you ask what are you and the guy says and blows and sometimes you are patiently trying to go through all these steps and you get series of blows blow or series of blows can occur at any time during nots you dont then continue the steps of this technique as that bt or cluster has gone sometimes series of blows or an automatic blow will go into persistent fn or floating tone arm and in either instance you would end off the session also you can get repetitive blows if case is running pretty clean and you can get blows without bds there isnt much left on the charge and it isnt registering on the meter to amount to anything there is also the case of partial blow and the description and handling for this is given in nots series 45 hcob 10 feb 79 partially blown bts on hello and ok you sometimes get blow the bt or cluster doesnt answer up and you run hellos and oks repetitively to get it into comm rarely it will suddenly478blow and it would then be senseless to go on trying to run hello and ok or anything else as that one has gone some auditors have been known to ask pc if it blew during the valence technique steps even nag the preot did it blow has it gone still around this could be due to the auditors unfamiliarity with his meter and not recognizing blow when he sees it occur on the meter or possibly some may have confused another technique date locate with this technique you of course always date to blow and locate to blow and the auditor could get the idea that he should carry over datelocate technique into the valence technique it is very poor practice to ask the preot if it blew during nots valence technique you could cause the bt or cluster to submerge or be suppressed or you could invalidate blow that did occur this doesnt mean that you cant ever ask if it blew you could ask if it is still around and read would confirm that it is but this type of question is asking for missingness its longer there theres large number of pcs that never see the blow and it isnt something to see because its missingness this type of question can be difficult for the preot to answer as there is now nothing there for him to perceive as it has gone if the meter bdd and fned on the step it would be idiocy to then ask if it blew of course it did but if your meter didnt tell you it blew you could be in quandary and have to solve that problem but you wouldnt interrupt the valence technique to ask if it blew and you wouldnt get into nagging the preot you just follow on through your steps and particularly if you had the preot ack the answer then you got your blow alright so this concern about whether the bt blew is misplaced these points are stated so that the auditor will understand what he is doing why he is doing it and what manifestation he can expect to occur because these manifestations will occur this technique is very positive series of steps and they go in that sequence if these steps are done as given you will get the result and if departed from or if there is an error you can definitely expect to get that manifestation too ie too broad an attention span and you will get restim it is necessary that the auditor and cs understand these points as this is not technique that can be done rotely or robotically ot iii techniques sometimes you will need to use ot iii techniques especially when you run into cluster and it is effective just like it always was you sometimes get into situation where you have an inert mass you run some hellos and oks and it actually becomes less inert but it is still cluster that condition can exist but it usually isnt untied with hello ok its cluster and it reads on cluster then its your assessment for mutual incident accident illness impact injury etc you do the assessment of what is this thing you get your mutual incident sometimes the cluster will explode apart or break up on the assessment alone you found what was holding it together then you wouldnt try to datelocate it youd have the preot pick off individuals and run them on the valence technique but if there was disintegration of the cluster on finding the mutual incident youd carry right on and datelocate inc ii and inc is or nots valence technique479now theres variation on mutual incidents you can get mutual incident that is current contemporary like he went pts or something had big arc break or something but it isnt as strenuous as clustermaking incident its sort of lock it isnt mutual incident like an impact injury illness accident shock etc but guy can run into recent heavy upset or general charge of some kind heavy stress and you get the reaction described in hcob 20 dec 79 nots series 48 under routine there you had general total restim it is actually mutual incident as it happened to all of them its near pt though and they all copy it and when you hit it you get sudden bd and relief but you are not going to blow any bts to amount to anything as it isnt cluster making incident so you have to be able to differentiate between these two types of mutual incidents the recent this life lock and the heavy impact injury explosion type of mutual incident that forms cluster the cluster will resolve with the ot iii mutual incident datelocate inc ii and inc is routine and thats why you start off on the nots course with restudy and clear up any mus on the ot iii materials i wouldnt do much date locating on nots and usually the cluster will break up into individuals on finding the mutual incident pinning them together very often you can blow cluster with the nots valence technique but you still have the assessment for what is holding the cluster together and it is very useful the one that gives the most trouble is the cluster impacted with cluster impacted with cluster cumulative cluster you also have the handling for that in hcob 25 oct 69r cluster formation cumulative but some of these clusters can be pretty horrifying in character i dont think this would give any trouble in nots though and i think by the time hes gotten through ot iii handled all the individuals and available bts and clusters hes got that he may have blown these by then regarding the insane the probability is that cluster is really dominated by one thetan who has contaged the rest of the cluster with some wild ideas evil intentions thats when you run into the rser on nots and you may get the intention come off if so note it in the worksheets i wouldnt do more with it than that youre taking the cluster down to basic mutual incident and blowing it so then it is gone anyway but you may have to get off the evil intention if it doesnt just come flying off the cluster could be held together by mutual idea or evil intention received during an implant or heavy engram in one instance an rsing cluster was listed for its evil intention which successfully blew the cluster apart and this could be done but usually wont have to be resorted to more commonly when handling cluster an rsing cluster you can run into the phenomenon of evil intentions coming off voluntarily and you will see list starting up in the worksheets this is called to your attention so that you will recognize it if it occurs and take the list to its bd fn item that can happen and an auditor should be able to recognize when pc is listing and handle it as list xdn actually applies the bulk of rock slammers are probably clusters and probably its one main bt in the cluster affecting the rest by wishing off his evil intention on them copies handling copies can be necessary especially when youve taken apart cluster or when you dont get clean blow and suspect that some other bt is copying what you just ran or handled but checking for copies can be easily overworked and as bts are very suggestible you could by nagging the preot on the subject of copies start some bt or bts copying you certainly dont ask for copies after every bt you blow or as routine step in the valence technique some auditors have tended to do this probably by480carrying datelocating technique over into the valence technique in any case you only handle copies when indicated and not as rote every time question somatics the original research on somatics was done in the late 50s in washington and i found how somatic comes about its based on the fact that one being by himself couldnt have somatic you have to have two beings to have somatic cluster can have somatic you wouldnt ask question for bt with somatic that would be wrong question and is based on false datum and is an outtech question you could have two or more bts smashed together somehow producing somatic but you would have to take up each of these bts individually to blow them but usually about the only time you will run into somatic in nots is when there has been an error wrong item or something of that sort it may be that somatic in nots is always an indicator of an error it seems to be so and the wise auditor on nots should be alerted to the probability of an error of some kind if the preot does turn on somatic you can easily and quickly check for an error in what you have just been running in the session or use nots repair list to locate and handle the bpc understanding it is very essential that nots auditors and cses understand the nots materials and dont try to insist on rote set of questions or steps as nots doesnt run well as rote or robotic rundown there are very exact steps and manifestations and sequences and you will get these everytime anytime there have been flubbed cases on nots these have traced to mus on the part of the auditor andor cs the nots course checksheet was specificially designed to prevent this with supervisor meter checks for mu words frequently throughout the checksheet but there was an instance of student who skipped the mu word check by the supervisor which is sure route to catastrophe any trouble on nots has traced back to failure to clear words misunderstood in either the ot iii materials or in the nots materials this gives the solution to any auditor or cs troubles with nots clear the mu words and restudy the materials so that you do understand and can apply them it will certainly make your life as an auditor or cs much easier and will enable you to get the rave results that nots is known for routinely sociological impact have you considered the sociological impact that you are having by auditing nots you are turning free beings loose in torrents this is bound to have an effect on society especially when these start picking up bodies and turn up to join the team at their local org you are not just auditing one pc at this level you are churning out cleared beings in volume and we will start seeing the results sooner or later on society in general maybe you

cses and which are for use on cases being audited on nots the ot iii handlings of drugs can also be used on nots cases as you know from nots data bts can be being anything they can be being particular drug or being drug picture or incident or even an acid trip for example the way you would handle nots case on drugs is similar in that you would first of all get the person through the purification rundown case already started on nots can be put onto the purification rd without having been completed on nots in fact you may not be able to complete some cases without it you do not have to take the case to rest point just ensure that the case is not left incomplete or messed up on specific action or category before starting the purification rd then do not attempt to combine nots auditing with the purification rd until it is completed do not attempt to run objective processes on case during nots the caution of not asking for drugs or drug incidents generally also applies to nots auditing as such question would result in total restim what you can do is to add drugs and bt being drug bt affected by drugs bt being drug trip bt being drug picture into prepared assessment or list you can check for read on drugs on specific bt or cluster and then handle that482bt or cluster to blow all of the data published on the subject of drugs and their effect in preventing case gain applies to bts and clusters cases most commonly drugs have shown up on nots cases as either clustermaking incidents or on individual bts being the drug or affected by the drug or copying other bt or cluster pictures of drugs several cases who were stalled on nots or who were making minimal gain on nots have been resolved by handling drugs as described in this issue case histories the following case histories reported by fso cses of case handlings done on nots preots on drugs are limited to this issue as they contain nots techniques and data these are additional case histories to those given in hcob 29 jan 80 the ot drug rundown those cases were also piloted by nots auditors and cses but do not contain confidential nots data case 1 institutional case who had sodium pentathol as an anaethetic just prior to going nuts and then being put in an institution running nots techniques on this drug bts stuck in this drug bts being this drug bts affected by this drug turned the case sane case 2 lsd some 200 times had so far refused any standard sweat out program case gain totally hung fire on his attempts to get the perception he had when he took lsd from gf 40 expanded drugs read heavily and his first gains from nots were acheived in handling clustermaking incidents from lsd trips btsclusters stuck in lsd being lsd etc this was run for approximately one intensive with preot interest it didnt crack the case but some headway was made the next action for this case is to get him onto and through the purification rd then the full nots ot drug rd case 3 lsd 220 to 250 times and alcohol and other heavy street drugs he was at point where he could hardly walk or articulate many clustermaking incidents on drugs lsd alcohol were handled through the rundown many were revivd in past locations and some stuck there ie physically he cognited and bdd on disturbing pocket of acid held down by bt bts clusters restimulated by that were handled then btsclusters stuck in drug trips and483copies of drug trips he started recovering physically articulation handled and walking improved on nots series 34 handling of illness alcohol was the item his speech went back to normal after this preot felt tremendous lots of charge blown on btsclusters stuck in hospital drug acth result of less numb more sensation later nots series 43 handling was done on alcohol plus datelocate of cumulative cluster on drugs his responsibility increased and he was off on persistent win for almost 2 weeks experiencing automaticcontinuous blow phenomena in life lots of stuckness on the case was tied up in drugs and alcohol case is currently doing very well on the purification rd although the purification rd would normally precede such drug handling in nots this case was unable to walk or to talk due to paralysis and was considered incurable by the medicos ___________ there are also number of preots who have had nots series 12 handlings on drug rds and some on drugs ___________ nots ot drug rd pgm the nots ot drug rd program is the same program as the ot drug rd hcob 29 jan 80 the ot drug rundown it begins with the purification rd it has the same steps 1 5 but the method of handling is by nots valence technique rather than inc ii inc i assessment for mutal incident is the same but individuals from broken up cluster would be handled with nots valence technique the categories of bt or cluster being reading drug bt or cluster affected by reading drug bt being drug trip bt being drug picture bt or cluster being misemotion bt or cluster being negative item should also be checked for on each reading drug taken up and these categories may be assessed as part of prepared list and should be so assessed at the end of step 5 step 6 is different and would consist of nots series 24 repair list assessed and handled to clean up any loose ends and polish off the case before returning to the nots advance program administration and delivery the ot drug rd may not be audited on pre0ts who have had any nots auditing484these may only be run on the nots ot drug rd although the nots ot drug rd is done by nots auditor and nots cs these must be specially trained on the nots ot drug rd and only interested graduated nots auditors and cses may be so trained these issues are not added to the acs courses nor given to green nots auditors or cses the nots ot drug rundown is not mixed in with the nots advance program nor is it to be bit and pieced with nots nor given as blur along with nots it is its own special rd and must be delivered as its own rd and as its own package this does not mean that you cannot use the item drugs in an assessment for mutual incident during nots nor that you couldnt handle bt hung up in drug during nots but if drugs or drug items are coming up during nots then the case is on the wrong program and should be shifted over to the purification rd followed by the nots ot drug rd then after these are done you would resume the nots advance program as well as not mixing the hours on the nots ot drug rd with nots hours there is an important technical reason for only handling one subject at time and completing each action and program before starting another ref cs series 38 cs series 47 nots series 30 one would not interrupt preot who is running well on nots with good ta action and who is getting rapid blows but would flatten the action before making change to the purification rd and the nots ot drug rd these rundowns can be done at any point during the nots advance program but ideally they would be entered after the past auditing repair steps or after step 14 after step 15 or at any point thereafter if drugs are heavily charged and getting in the way then you would have choice but to shift programs to handle ideally the nots ot drug rd should be delivered by specialist team of nots auditors and cs operating as unit who then feed completed cases back to regular and interning nots auditors the nots ot drug rundown should help you with cases who hung fire

of the nots procedures or rundown this issue must be thoroughly word cleared and star rated along with the referenced issues by nots auditors and cses to qualify them to use the nots whatwho l n step the right item on the what l n step in nots series 47 and 49 it is stated that you take the first reading item regardless of its read in experience i have found this not always to be true one can get some small falls on several items before the real item is hit sometimes it requires an ack to get an fn but the real item always fns emeter note if one were to use other than an operational mark vi one could be mislead by the meter i have noticed that what is small fall sf on an operational mark vi is fall f on another meter this is not good as the auditor seeing fall f could think he has the item when it is really small fall the exaggerated read makes one think wrong items have read when these only gave small fall also the mark v tends to just fn and gives on the problem of trying to read through an fn the mark v is not sensitive enough thus it is essential that an operational mark vi is used the sizes of reads referred to here are at the correct sensitivity setting of one third dial drop on can squeeze per em5r487the sensitivity must not be higher than this during the whatwho l n steps the statements in nots series 47 and 49 under step 3 acknowledgement are correct and the only change here is in the statement that you take the first reading item plus clarification of size of read the right what l n step reads are lot of small falls preceding the right item the real item always fns even if it sometimes requires an ack to get it to fn the who step early in the nots rundown and sometimes later in the rundown the being blows easily often before all the valence technique steps have been done frequently blowing on inspection there is the phenomenon described in earlier nots issues of the cyclic aspect of handling more difficulttoblow bts and clusters followed by series of easyrapid blows later in the rundown after the more available and easiertoblow bts and clusters have gone those remaining tend to be in worse shape as beings you are then more frequently going to encounter the following phenomenon the being seldom gets much of read and seldom blow on the first right answer to the who question it gives an answer the right answer in many cases and theres real read what one does then is ack encouragingly and asks it to repeat the answer thus encouraged bd fn and blow on the repeated answer occurs pinpointing attention it is essential that the nots preot limits hisher attention to the btcluster being addressed you can get mishmash if their attention goes onto something else i have developed tr 8q hcob 22 apr 80 which is an exercise in pinpointing attention as well as asking question requiring nots preot to do tr 8q will remedy this repair lists for l n there are two repair lists for l n errors that are shorter than the l4bra and both of these can be used in nots they are hcob 23 sep 68 violation of the laws of listing and nulling and hcob 29 sep 68 list correction tech vol xi pages 44 45 and either of these may be used resorting to the longer l4bra when necessary the usual thing to do though would be to recognize what was wrong from the reads noted in wss or lack of fn on the what item and handle accordingly and as given in earlier nots issues fesing fesers and cses must know the materials given in nots series 47 49 and this issue and must inspect worksheets to see whether correct or wrong items have been found and whether the bt or cluster was blown cses must do this on every session and fesers when they are looking for errors on case any previous instances of failure to get the right item or failure to handle being to blow can then be taken up in subsequent sessions and properly handled as described in this issue if the btcluster is still around it will read when the preots attention is directed to that position area and oriented to the item given in that session remember that it now may be suppressed or invalidated and that the being probably has wrong item and an incomplete list if the error can be found and corrected immediately do so such as simply completing the list to correct item and completing the steps on that being to blow or do one of the l n repair assessments to find what is wrong and then correct it and handle the being to blow488auditor and cs qualifications the requirements for an auditor or cs to use this nots l n technique as given in nots series 47 and 49 are very important and it is high crime to violate these only auditors and cses who can l n successfully may be permitted to use this technique and then only after they have completed the stated requirements in nots 47 49 the referenced materials and this issue until then they may only use the other nots techniques but not the l n step programming the whatwho l n step note that in nots series 47 page 3 under warning it is stated it will be necessary to use this technique of listing for the item at some point on any case being audited on ned for ots preots being started on nots should not be put onto this technique at the beginning of the nots advance program nor until the preot is well advanced through the program the other nots techniques are fully adequate and very successful and most of the nots 26r program can be done before resorting to the nots l n technique only shift to the l n procedure when the preot is well advanced through the program and encounters the phenomenon described in nots 47 page 1 early in the nots program the case is fat with charge that will slough off easily and with the use of nots techniques other than the listing technique given in nots series 47 on case that has been prematurely started on the l n step prefer to use the earlier nots techniques and do not overwork the l n step until the case is ready for it this doesnt mean that one would stop the l n technique altogether on such case when the case is ready for the nots whatwho l n step and provided the auditor and cs are qualified to run it then the case is indoctrinated on the procedure and begun per nots 47 49 and this issue if all the nots auditors and cses are not fully qualified then the preot could be reassigned when ready for the l n step in general most cases will follow the steps as laid out on nots 26r and 27 as this is the researchdevelopmental sequence of nots and most cases will follow the same sequence and pattern and phenomena nots trainees should also follow this same sequence and only train on the later techniques after they have had experience and wins on auditing the earlier nots program steps with the earlier techniques those are very easy to do very rewarding and will

proceeds to ask auditing questions495the worst repercussions of all have stemmed from offline case actions done as some sort of squirrelly 2wc which wasnt valid part of the cramming action anyway when subjective questions are asked one invariably is into case action definition of subjective consultation with the preclears own universe with his mock ups and with his own thoughts and considerations book the creation of human ability p 167 recall think remember or return on the time track processes are subjective hcob 2 nov 57ra subjective actions especially when metered lead into the persons case if misdone particularly if mismetered these can ball the case up ots when correctly handled with the corrrect tech appropriate to their case level handle very quickly and easily so it is important to know what to do and what not to do the solution to this is in having specialized lists for ots and forbidding the use of non ot actions on ots and forbidding nonots from seeking to audit or cram ots repair of ots messed up in cramming the most frequent cause of bpc encountered is misownership b mismetering false reads missed reads and missed fns c invalidation of state of case there are two types of action which are most likely to lead into an ots case and cause bpc iasking subjective questions iiasking earlier similar which sends the preot down the track or down different tracks there are ways to detect and isolate what happened in misdone cramming the person crammed has any bis about the cramming action the person continues to goof in the same area or subject the person reg tags on the cramming or within three days after the cramming action the person gets sick misemotional on the subject of the cram or turns on somatics within three days after the cramming action the person is introverted on the subject of the cram the person comes to next session after the cram with ta or needle behavior worsened from what it was prior to the cram such as ta used to be in normal range and now is high or low or sens setting for 13rd dial drop on can squeeze is now higher due to tighter needle an unusual needle patern has now appeared etc496a sharp cs can usually spot misdone cram from the worksheets of the cramming action and must insist that these are legible and accurate ref hcob cs series 98 auditing folders omissions in completeness when encountering any of the above the cs should make up prepared assessment to cover points of possible error in the cramming action here is sample assessment which can be used or added to 1 r factor im going to assess list of possible errors which may have occurred in the cramming action to locate any bpc 2 assess was there any misownership of charge were significances or reads misowned was there any mismetering was false read taken up was there any cleaned clean was read missed was an fn missed was there any invalidation of state of case were subjective questions asked were earlier similars asked for when these did not exist were there any outruds was there help the above is sample assessment which contains the most common items you are likely to find on misdone cramming actions especially on ots and the assessment above is designed for use on cases who are ot iii or above only as it contains misownership but similar prepared assessment could be made up for lower level case 3handle reads on the above assessment in accordance with hcob 4 july 79 han dling correction lists on ots and hcob 22 dec 79 flying ruds at ot iii and above this action alone may completely handle all the bpc sometimes very rapidly and spectacularly 4if not fully handled with the above assess and handle the appropriate correction list for the action that was messed up ie wccl word clearing correction list for messed up

on nots nots repair list497actions that can be done there are actions that are ok to do in cramming and will not get into the persons case these relate to his post or study and are objective definition of objective of or having to do with material object as distinguished from mental concept idea or belief dictionary means here and now objects in pt as opposed to subjective hcob 2 nov 57ra questions or actions by the cramming officer which are objective and pertain to the persons post the materials which cover his post the materials he is studying clearing words misunderstood hatting actions and post or product debugs provided subjective questions are not asked on ots are all ok the most usual and successful cramming action is simply to take the materials or text that covers the subject of the cramming order and word clear and cram those materials this is always safe and ok to do the only other caution is not to give verbal data nor to evaluate or invalidate or throw the persons ruds out while doing the cram word clearing methods 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 are ok to do on ots but not method one which asks for earlier similar finding and clearing crashing misunderstood wrods is ok demonstrating meanings or words and terms and principles either with demo kit or on clay table are ok starrate checkouts on materials are ok product debug tech is ok to do on ots provided the subjective questions on the assessments are omitted all of the actions given in this section can and should be used in cramming and these have liability ots when handled correctly in cramming or in

of incidents this can be complex with 3 or 4 bts and chains crossed it is very dicey to run engrams on bts as although they may have one mutual one each one has an earlier chain for it that is different than that of the others in the cluster so you limit the action to the mutual incident they have in common scn grades oiv can be run on bt but this would not be usual as the bts were dealing

grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 october 1969 ot viii secret why thetans mock up this question has been the most plaguing one in dianetics and scientology this question has been the most plaguing one in history of clearing the only way thetan ever gets into trouble the only way he can get trapped or become part of cluster is by mocking up and making pictures of bad experiences and why record all bad experiences this too is not good sense one can explain it by saying that thetans become bored and have yearning for event or excitement or that thetans mock up pictures as an aberrated form of havingness other ways can be invented to explain why thetans compulsively mock up bad pictures but these do not factually lead to total solution to the compulsion the real reason stems from basic characteristic of thetans and that is thetan never totally gives up there is seemingly streak of resistance or resentment that makes thetan wish to persist in the same place or location if he cannot he will do so covertly the definition of power is the ability to hold position in space all power comes from the ability to occupy point in an electrical generator the base that separates two terminals must be firm or there will be exchange of energy or power generated the effort to weaken thetan is to make him relinquish his point in space covertly or overtly thetan seeks to assert his position in space if he cannot do so overtly he does so covertly or mentally when thetan is moved unwillingly from point or position he even then refuses to give up that point and begins mocks it up mentally he also mocks up the events of his departure as part of the action of mocking up the point he is leaving this unwittingly gives him picture an engram now let us see if this theory holds true in practice ajust ahead of any engram there must be an effort to retain position and there must be point or location thetan mocked up this is true you can blow an engram without running it by spotting its first point in space and time in secondary where did you first hear of the loss is vital question bin contact assist getting person to touch again the point where he was hurt with what was hurt will blow the engram cgetting person to locate areas locations that are not safe produce blows of engrams without running them518dexact and accurate dating sometimes blows an engram those times when it does not it should blow when the location is exactly spotted eimplants and traps were done mainly to keep thetans out of an area the thetan resenting and resisting mocks up the place anyway and so implants himself thetan too easily substitutes mental mock up for point in the real universe one could also say that thetan by mocking up warns himself against certain points in space or areas in the physical universe anxiety is solely not thetan able to be certain places and not thetan able to be where one is either making people leave is the most unpopular action unless one also frees them to be anywhere transferring people is degrading thing to do to them jail denies thetan all spaces except where he has been placed note that thetans are made very miserable in jail jailing is sure way to make confirmed criminals and also to make them crazy as well any thetan stuck in an engram is asserting the effort to be at and hold the point where he was hit at the beginning of that engram an engram therefore is refusal to leave place at which force was exerted to drive one away reversely one can refuse to be held at place where one does not wish to be but this is negation of place notis of it and its time power of choice over where one is and where one is not is thus key to engrams finally thetan mocks up because he covertly refuses to abandon location under duress and notises the place where he does not wish to be but must using these facts one can blow engrams without running them some sample questions what point location is unsafe what location could you have held absolutely where did you first get an intimation of danger what place would you rather not be in what effort would it take to hold that location working with this you will see door open to higher level than dianetic r3r but realize that it is only for high level thetan lrh rs l ron hubbard copyright c 1969 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved519520521new ot 8522523new ot viii study and procedure debrief 1991 from recall this is record of the full ot viii procedure of the church of scientology given on the free winds ship as delivered in 1991 security there is very tight with detectors at the doors so that original data can be removed this debrief is something the independent fieldfree zone scientology has been waiting many years to see it is not the original nor is it perfect record but it is accurate and will get the result if followed by competent solo auditor who is flat on all earlier levels with all overts off the wording of the processes are exact to the best of my recall and the procedures are exact for sure any differences are extremely minor if at all i spent several weeks reconstruct ing all this from memory needless to say i have an excellent memory as result of the rundown i am breaking security as i disagree that this should only be released to an elite in scientology i do however ask it not be released to psyches or squirrels or anyone who will break the independent security network and allow it to get back to the church of scientology it would be best if they do not find out that we have it please treat this data responsibly it is the key to the only truth possible the whole secret involves what truly is the relationship of the supreme being to each individual thetan to simply say its is oversimplified to tears but has some truth to it the real key is the perception and ability to have full certainty and therefore perception on all confusions and distortions of mest and form and life units as well as the ability to perceive exact identity and its full relationship to its true source and history from its origin as the theta body the true 8th dynamic in order to truly view this as present time beingness one has to clean up once and for all his own confusions regarding these points the key is being flat on all earlier levels and being honest with self as to the truth on each step of the rundown in doing this procedure one has to acknowledge the lie of time and persistance and the lie of the illusion that mest is solid and unchangable another key given is the fact that being can exist independent of time and present time and can choose any point on the track as his present time the pt body can confuse this as attention to some degree is always hung up on the pt body this fixes the thetan into one present time and one time stream when in fact there are many as you will discover do not attempt this rundown if you are incomplete on any earlier level incomplete on or in need of sec checks involved in any out ethics pts or involved in any pressing pt situations that call your attention back to this present time if you are in need of review on any point above get it before starting the rundown or it will miss and be

materials have note been liberated from this institution what is presented here are reconstructions of those materials by people who have trained and delivered them before leaving that organisation in the absense of the original materials the following are presented on an as is basis and are used at your own discretion warranty is conferred or implied if the original materials should become available at future date revision of this volume will done to include them531the l rundowns532533introduction the ls were developed as result of research into the levels above ot viii the success of the ls is startling these rundowns can handle things that are handled nowhere else the breakthrough which exists here technically is so strong that it actually cuts through the normal protective mechanisms of the mind it came actually from the ot grades it answers the question why does an ot restrain himself and cease to behave as an ot each rundown is designed to terminatedly handle specific area of persons case the ls are not grades in themselves but incredible boosters the basic tech comes from research into increasing ot powers theyre special class of rundown they increase persons power and effectiveness part of the discovery was that this tech could be used lower down on the bridge to get people up it faster very much faster the ls address the basics of thetans case directly they undercut the reactive mind and handle those factors which suppress the capacity to actually do be and have they remove those things that can make person less himself and far less powerful and causative as thetan these rundowns are designed to find and erase the basic counter intentions along ones dynamics they stabilize case the ls require an expert to run them the auditors trs have to be perfect and there is room for flubs so dont audit these rundowns on pc or preot until your auditing is flawless setup in all the l rundowns l10 l11 and l12 the pc or preot is fully set up first with cs 53 and gf40 expanded if needed method 6 the l type of assessment is method 6 method 6 is addressed directly to the thetan not to the bank the auditor looks directly at the pc and says the question or item that bypasses bank protective mecha nisms question is asked as question going up in the end as in regular assessment trs however on most of the l rundowns we are assessing in declarative manner declarative is when one goes down in pitch rather than up at the end going through list of possible valences we would declare each one directly to the pc with full intention we are not asking we are looking for reaction on that item earlier m6 was done in an accusative manner that was later revised to be declarative manner534purpose of the ls the ls are intended to handle outvalence and evil purpose cases we are handling main areas of resistiveness that are stopping the person from expanding on l10 we handle the main valences that make him restrain his havingness on l11 we handle evil purposes that keep him from acting on l12 we stabilize his certainty of being himself the 3 ls roughly divide into have l10 do l11 and be l12 our main targets are past identities and evil purposes we will gradually make the person realize that they are not him and thereby free him from them the ls are tailored to the individual every pc might not need all the steps some pcs need extra steps particularly l10 doesnt have fixed program but contains number of different possible ways of getting items535l 10536hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco

designed originally to handle longterm outofvalence or sup pressed preclears it is essentially based on the observation that ptsness is problem and that ptsness comes about through an exchange of valence an individual goes pts to someone who is problem to hlm to the point that the valence of that individual seems to overwhelm the persons own beingness there is an effect created here known as the dumbbell phenomenon dumbbell is an exercise device with two large weighted ends on handle one could perceive the valence of the pts his own valence and that of his suppressor the valence he tends to go into as opposite ends of dumbbell one can perceive pc flick into his own valence when the antagonistic valence is blown this could be described as the dumbbell suddenly reversing it must be remembered that it is not the actual valence of the suppressor that the person goes into but the valence the pts perceives whether this is what the suppressor is normally like or is like now the fact remains that the pts was overwhelmed by flow from that person at some point oddly enough the pts who is outofvalence will perceive his own personality traits as being those of the one with whom he has swapped valences the other end of the dumbbell young girl who is essentially being cooperative and accommodating is over whelmed by her nasty irascible argumentative stepmother she assumes the character istics which seemed to win over her and becomes fractious irascible and argumentative if you were to ask her who was the most accommodating cooperative person she ever knew she might easily answer my stepmother after moments reflection she might then realize wait my stepmother wasnt accommodating at all she was the most irascible person i ever met this would be an example of the dumbbell of ownvalence versus perceivedvalence now swinging around to correct perception from the pcs own valence the access to this central point on the case is through using gradient of 2 way communications rudiments and r3ra585twoway communication techniques the opening 2wc technique used was simply to thoroughly clear the definition of problem including beingnesscounter beingness as described in the tech dictionary with this whole concept clearly understood 2wc quad on problems was used to locate hot terminals tell about people who have caused you problems in life tell about people whom you have caused problems in life tell about people who have caused others problems in life tell about times you caused yourself problems in life each would be twcd to cog fn vgis and careful note would be made of terminals who read and with what read these terminals would be culled between sessions and put on hot terminals list in the front cover of the folder quad ruds would be run on hot terminals found and these ruds would uncover hot incidents these would be noted with their reads on separate sheet as hot incidents these engrams or secondary engrams would then be run r3ra as narratives twoway comming traits second type of twc was done in pairs and was based on characteristics or personality traits dramatized by the individual these were done as dichotomies with the negative side of the dichotomy being 2wcd first for example one has pc who is constantly showing characteristics of being hopeless apathetic or lethargic typical pair of 2wcs might go tell about people youve known who were lethargic tell about people youve known who were very active followed by this pair tell about people youve known who were hopeless and apathetic tell about people who were optimistic and confident the point is that the twoway comms pick up the personality trait the pc is dramatizing and two way comms for people who have had that trait it can be any characteristic general doingnesses could also be included as these are traits of valence in some degree eg helped others vs did others in or had high sense of ethics versus had negative ethics level the idea here is to use aspects of beingness as lead to hot terminals cull the hot terminals and do ruds on them and the pc will drop into hot incidents these are then run and the result of doing this with intelligence and accuracy is swing back into own valence586other twoway comms since you are dealing with the perceived valence of the person versus the perceived valence of hisher suppressor you can also do twcs of this sort in order to find material that leads you into the hot incidents tell some things about yourself you dont like tell some things about yourself you like best note these are two separate twcs not alternate commands similar twcs can be designed which follow the basic principle of taking person ality traits and using them to lead you to hot terminals who might be the basic valence mass at the other end of the dumbbell end phenomena the rundown has two major types of cognitions and both of them should occur before the rundown is declared complete the first is realization that the person is himself some statement that adds up to im will occur if the rundown is done correctly the second will be an awareness that the person is here aware of the present environment or im here these two cognitions are natural results of undoing the dumbbell phenomena notes on programming as this is major action you should have the persons ruds in and he should not be in the middle of other major actions note too that in order to apply these principles intelligently you have to understand the anatomy of valencecounter valence or the problem aspect to suppression long series of problems with mother may be enough to restimulate valence shift even though mother did not beat the pc or knock himher unconscious but the constant locks can restimulate earlier engramic masses which will contain overwhelm these get picked up and run on the earlier similar chains that come up in the actions described when the hot incidents which keep the pc pinned into the dumbbell are lifted and erased the dumbbell will snap around and the pc will be looking at the world through his her own viewpoint again for change this brings about the im here im cognitions which signal the end phenomena of the rundown having occurred there has been pilot for administering this rundown on clears or above as far as i know the rundown was researched by lrh in 1975 prior to dianetics forbidden on clears and ots it is paralleled in some respects by step 15 of the ned for ots rd it has had spectacular results on many cases there have been some cases it did not have spectacular results on for various reasons usually these were cases being audited after clear in error or cases with other bypassed charge not repaired such as list errors or pt overts or other our ruds or were xdn type cases and were not effect as much as they were contrasurvival cause the nvrd might not resolve this aspect of case cs series 22 cases587588589bright think rd590591hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 december 1978 cses techqual class iv grad auditors revivification revivification is the bringing back to life of an engram in which preclear is stuck the engram or some portion thereof is being acted out in present time by the preclear it is called revivification because the engram is suddenly more real to the preclear than present time has ever been he relives that moment briefly he does not merely recall or remember it this is not the same thing as the returning to an incident or engram that is employed in dianetic auditing return is the method of retaining the body and the awareness of the subject in present time while he is told to go back to certain incident revivification is the reliving of an incident or portion of it as if it were happening now this phenomenon can

recalling locks but these can trigger into full play an engram in which he may be stuck and the pc may go into revivification of it he will actually be answering and acting from the point or points down the track where he has been stuck should this happen the auditor simply continues to run the process and get the pc through it as the pc revivifies he blows through these stuck points on his track and comes out of them newly and is now truly in present time as revivification is apt to occur on the end of endless int repair auditors must understand and be able to recognize the phenomena

ned for ots research i discovered that beings do not just reviv in time they also reviv in location you can have guy totally revivd in time hes stuck down the track in an incident which is pt for him anything which he views is viewed from this point in time it is when he is being can also be in reviv in place or location that is where he is everything he views is viewed from that location that viewpoint in space theyre buttered all over the universe bt can think of himself as up there looking down at himself totally wrong viewpoint hes in reviv and everything he does is from stuck viewpoint so hes operating with stuck spacial point of view say the guy is revivd in flanders everything he does is from the viewpoint in flanders even tries to look at himself now from flanders hes operating in pt from some place down the track thought disassociation thought disassociation follows point of view pattern to you from an altered point of view so you get disassociated thought say hes in reviv of location in radar station in space you ask him where are the books he looks at radar screen and says theyre going away i know case who had an accident she thought she left the body and went to between lives implant and returned to the body but there has been between lives implant in that place for eons what happened is she was revivd in between lives implant she had the accident and went exterior she thought she went to this between lives implant because thats the location she was revivd in this is matter of old fixed viewpoints in spacial locations you can often cure case with the process where would you be safe he might go through heavy reviv on the process and he might do bunk going back to his last point of view locationthats why dl works you blow that point on locate step its when and where they are as theyre not in pt593that is where he is safe thats thought disassociation and thats small pictures because hes in the picture looking at the picture these are the mechanics of the bright think rundown disassociation processwhich can be run on anybody running it is not part of ned for ots as it is separate rd objective dubin this is different phenomenon from thought disassociation and spacial reviv he looks at that wall and because its not safe to look at the wall he makes picture of the wall and brings the picture back to him and looks at the picture of the wall hes so far south he cant confront anything thats in front of him you tell him to look at the window he sort of reaches out to the window with beam or something makes picture of it and pulls the picture back up to him looks at it and tells you the window has bars on it this case requires objectives until its safe to look at something and perceive it l ron hubbard founder lrhdmkjm copyright c 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved594hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 1 october 1978 reissued 11 october 1978 cses techqual class iv grad auditors the bright think rundown process to handle disassociation apparently during the last decade new factor has entered into the culture that was previously only rare possibly due to lowered educational standards or the declining nature of the culture itself but most probably due to one of the common drugs or medicines or even food deficiencies percentage which was only one or two has jumped up to eighty or ninety this factor is visible in decline in the ability to tell differences similarities and identities in trying to train person or get him to live more survival type life the establishment officer is encountering this factor there is similar instance of this when drugs first moved into the scene before the mid60s drugs were never much of factor in processing and such cases were considered rare and then only as result of medical treatments suddenly i has on my hands case that did not behave like case the ta went out the roof unexpectedly with apparent cause and the case wouldnt ep i went into sort out on what was different on this case from other cases it was marijuana once we had run out the marijuana the case behaved like normal case i was suddenly looking at rising percentage of such cases which to date through the kindness of psychology and psychiatry had risen to majority of cases in society so here we go again some new factor apparently has entered into the society and has risen in percent which is so high that it will get in the road of anyone trying to get the show on the road the factor can be called disassociation we have here marvellous new process the bright think rundown powerfully simple it requires and auditor who is wellsteeled against the temptation to q and and who is able to run process through whatever it turns on it was originally designed as remedy for theetie weetie cases but has proven enormously successful as well with cases who disassociate595this is the person who associates not and b but and not apples and bananas but apples and typewriters you make statement and he bends it over to something that has nothing to do with the price of fish he is very hard to direct because alteris enters into it in fact an alteris could be manifestation of being disassociated things which are different he conceives to be identical things which are similar he conceives to be widely different things which are identical he conceives to be only similar this case will mess up or complicate just about any order or communication by bringing in carloads of data which have absolutley nothing to do with it this is because he misidentifies and cannot evaluate differences in time location form composition or importance he is lost in his own figurefigure and facsimilies sometimes universes away the new discovery is that he is back on the time track in locations very remote from where he is it is not that he is stuck on the track where he is but is stuck on the track elsewhere often eons ago this is the reason datelocate works it has to be in that order you have to date it and then locate it because the location is never in now the auditor who runs it and the cs who css it have to have full command of the subject of revivication revivication is the bringing back to life of engram in which preclear is stuck the engram or some portion thereof is being acted out in present time by the preclear it is called revivication because the engram is suddenly more real to the preclear than present time has ever been he relive that moment briefly he does not merely recall or remember it this means that the person moves into back point of time totally he gives certain manifestations when he does this these can be various they always are visible to the auditor the trick in processing is to keep running the process until the pc comes out of it just as though nothing had happened as the process is run expect the pc to answer from points down the track where he has been stuck these arethe points he operates from while apparently in pt expect engrams to appear with revivication occuring as they are contacted and blown as the pc relives these incidents he will come out of them newly and this time truly in present time and with new viewpoint anaten somatics abrupt shifts of tone level heat agitated physical motion are all quite likely to occur as these points are run off as the pc is actually revivifying at each heavy point you just keep running the process with good trs and metering the auditor must ensure the pc is fully sessionable before starting the rundown and once started must get the pc through the phenomena which occur as the pc revivifies and blows through the stuck points on his track the pcs answers will signify to the auditor precisely what is occurring it is vital not to q and with these symptoms as they come up596the cs here is your cs for the bright think rundown run where would you be safe repetitively to fn cog vgis and pc in pt of course the end phenomena of the process is realisation by the pc that hes really in present time this ep is normally expressed with some variation of the statement im here this ep must not be caoxed by the auditor asking are you here yet and the pc must not be fed the cognition as the process is run the pc will spot places that are nearby and then places that are far away the spots hed spot are near then far then near then far sometimes few near and then few far and then few near if the pc does not do this then you know he is not doing the process you will find up to 20 of your pcs give simply glib answers and experience change this pc is answering the question in some particular and outrageous way if you give him d of p interview on exacly how he was answering the question you will find he was using some oddball system disassociated from the process the fourth american acc tapes discuss this the way to handle this pc is objectives as he is too far out of it to handle concept and is basically operating off system before you can spot places in the universe you have to have universe right the main errors an auditor can make are failure to carry on the process when something peculiar happens and failure to notice true ep has been reached on the failed case the 20 noted above when objectives have honestly been completed you can then run the process with great benefits but be sure the pc is up to answering the question you will get some remarkable changes some major wins l ron hubbard founder lrhdmkjm copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved597598599super power600601introduction to super power super power rundown series 0 the following is list of materials which should make up checksheet for students learning to apply the super power rundown materials this background material means it is vital to understand the full theory of the basics of restoring infinite powers to being scientology 8 scientology 0 the book of basics the why is god policy letter the organization series policy letters the phoenix lectures ethics and justice policy letters602the condition below confusion super power rundown series 1 the first action of beingness is to assume viewpoint before one can know he is below confusion he usually has to realize that he is in condition of nocondition power is the ability to hold position in space the first action of creating space is to assume point from which to view that space when viewpoint has been knocked around down through the time track by forces he believes have affected him he tends to lose his ability to maintain position in space being can assume the viewpoint of the first dynamic and attempt to take on all the other dynamics which eventually overwhelms him to get being rehabilitated into the position of being able to operate at cause on all the dynamics it is first necessary to get him into condition of being therefore the first action one takes in running the super power processes is to have the person find viewpoint the first command is find viewpoint this is run to fn cog vgis then one runs the other flows find anothers viewpoint find viewpoint that others are creating for others find viewpoint that you have created for yourself being can be so socked into the mest universe that viewpoints have become solid objects viewpoints are points from which one views universes solid objects are made up of matter energy space and time space is created by viewpoint viewpoint can think the opposite many times you will find person who is inverted on the dynamics to such an extent that he feel that mest has created him rather than the other way around this process will get the being into position of being able to handle the condition below confusion and set him up for the next steps of the super power rundown6038th dynamic processes super power rundown series 2 this is an unlimited process usually you will find the person to be inverted on the dynamics god is not an object when one labels god with an identity one immediately degrades the 8th dynamic into mest terms the 8th dynamic cannot be defined in terms of mest it can only be defined in terms of infinity which the number 8 symbolizes when running this process start with the 8th dynamic then run through the first up through the seventh and then stop the purpose is to get the person to assume various viewpoints on all the dynamics at one level and then bring the person back to the 8th dynamic viewpoint this process puts responsibility back into the person and sets him up for repair of all earlier actions which brought about dwindling spiral away from the 8th dynamic viewpoint this process is run even if the person goes exterior or has big win the only time you would end off the process is on floating tone arm because obviously you cannot get any more reads on the meter while running this process if any upsets overts missed withholds occur one simply cleans them up on running ots one deals with any body thetans clusters entities and so forth as they show up remember to audit the person in front of you which means if someone else shows up you must audit them out set them free before you can set the person in front of you in the body free here are the commands in order 1assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 2get the idea of another assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 3get the idea of others assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 4get the idea of you causing yourself to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 5get the idea of your second dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 6get the idea of another second dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 7get the idea of other second dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 8get the idea of you causing all second dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 9get the idea of your third dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 10get the idea of another third dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 11get the idea of other third dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic60412get the idea of you causing all third dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 13get the idea of your fourth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 14get the idea of another fourth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 15get the idea of other fourth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 16get the idea of you causing all fourth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 17get the idea of your fifth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 18get the idea of another fifth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 19get the idea of other fifth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 20get the idea of you causing all fifth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 21get the idea of your sixth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 22get the idea of another sixth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 23get the idea of other sixth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 24get the idea of you causing all sixth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 25get the idea of your seventh dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 26get the idea of another seventh dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 27get the idea of other seventh dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 28get the idea of you causing all seventh dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 29get the idea of your eighth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 30get the idea of another eighth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 31get the idea of other eighth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 32get the idea of you causing all eighth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic at this point the person should be in very good shape enough so that his earlier injustices on the track can be easily accessible from the various viewpoints of the dynamics the next step is to do the ethics repair list as per super power rundown series 3605ethics repair list super power rundown series 3 the purpose of the ethics repair list is to return full power to being by proofing him up against injustices counter postulates failed purposes counter purposes and evil intentions across the dynamics these questions are asked in an unlimited way in other words it applies to the whole track and whatever the person comes up with you simply two way comm it earlier similar to ep this repair list is actually designed to set the person up to be able to do the actual super power process it cleans up the whole track on the subjects of ethics and justice do not take up unreading questions this list of questions is assessed like regular repair list except then when you get read you stop and handle the question and its charge then repeat the same question to ensure further reads or charge and then carry on with assessing the list the list does not have to be fning through the whole list handle protest or false reads accordingly 1have you had wrong intention 2has another had wrong intention 3have others had

anything611the eighth dynamic viewpoint super power rundown series 4 after the person has completed the condition below confusion by finding view points the eighth dynamic processes and the ethics repair list one then has the person go back to the 8th dynamic process with the following commands 1get the idea of your 8th dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 2get the idea of another 8th dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 3get the idea of other 8th dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic 4get the idea of you causing all 8th dynamics to assume the viewpoint of all 8th dynamics this now expands the persons viewpoint immensely and sets the person up for the final processes on the super power rundown remember to run each flow to fn cog vgis only end the session in the event of floating ta and for other reason612the actual super power process super power rundown series 5 the final step of the super power rundown is to give back to the person his full potential power as being all prior steps on the super power rundown have been designed to get person into state wherein he is set up to regain his ability to handle infinite power these processes are run just like any other process with full fn cog vgis as the ep if the person goes exterior continue to run the processes if there is dial wide fn continue to run the process the only time you would end off the process or the session is if the person has persistent floating ta at some point during the running of this series of processes the person will reach state wherein they are speechless they will laugh with wild abandon their ta will be floating they will probably also be exterior and will be unable to communicate in words what they are experiencing this is the end result of the super power rundown it is rare for this to occur prior to the running of the last flow of this series of processes but if it occurs then acknowledge the win one thing the auditor must not do is interrupt the person while in the middle of this major win or during the laughter otherwise it will invalidate the win the auditor simply maintains his trs and lets the person have his win do not end the session until the laughter stops as this will also tend to invalidate the person and his win the laughter can go on for some time perhaps up to an hour be sure and just be there with the person during this win and not end the session until the laughter has subsided the following is the last series of processes one runs on the super power rundown 1get the idea that you have infinite power 2get the idea that another has infinite power 3get the idea that others have infinite power 4get the idea that you can cause yourself to have infinite power 5get the idea that you have been given infinite power 6get the idea that another has been given infinite power 7get the idea that others have been given infinite power 8get the idea that you have caused yourself to be given infinite power 9get the idea that you can give another infinite power 10get the idea that another can give you infinite power 11get the idea that others can give others infinite power 12get the idea that you can cause yourself infinite power 13get the idea that you are infinite 14get the idea that another is infinite 15get the idea that others are infinite 16get the idea that you can cause yourself to be infinity make sure to run only the reading process and check for interest do not run any process on the person in which he is not interested
