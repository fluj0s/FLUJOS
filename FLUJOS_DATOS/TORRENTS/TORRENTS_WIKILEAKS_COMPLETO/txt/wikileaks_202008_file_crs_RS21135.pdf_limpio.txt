weborder code rs21135 updated august 12 2004 the enron collapse an overview of financial issues mark jickling coordinator specialist in public finance government and finance division summary the sudden and unexpected collapse of enr on corp was the first in series of major corporate accounting scandals that has shaken confidence in corporate governance and the stock market only months befo re enrons bankruptcy filing in december 2001 the firm was widely regarded as one of th most innovative fastest growing and best managed businesses in the united states with the swift collapse shareholders including thousands of enron workers who held company stock in their 401k retirement accounts lost tens of billions of dollars it now appears that enron was in terrible financial shape as early as 2000 burdened with debt and moneylosing businesses but manipulated its accounting st atements to hide these problems why didnt the watchdogs bark this report br iefly examines the accounting system that failed to provide clear picture of the fi rms true condition th independent auditors and board members who were unwilling to challenge enrons management the wall street stock analysts who failed to warn i nvestors of trouble ahead the rules governing employer stock in company pension plans and the unregulated energy derivatives trading that was the core of enrons bus iness this report also summarizes the sarbanesoxley act pl 107204 the major response by the 107th congress to enrons fall and related legislative and regulatory actions during the 108th congress it will be updated as events warrant other contributors to this report include william d jackson bob lyke patrick purcell and gary shorter enron what went wrong enron corp the first nationwide natural gas pipeline network shifted its business focus during the 1990s from the regulated tran sportation of natural gas to trading in unregulated energy markets until late 2001 nearly all observers including wall street professionals regarded this transformation as an outstandi ng success enrons reported annual revenues grew from under 10 billion in the early 1990s to 139 billion in 2001 placing it fifth on the fortune 500 enron tinued to transform its business but as it diversified out of its core ergy operations it ran into seri ous trouble like many otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135crs2 firms enron saw an unlimited future in the internet during the late 1990s it invested heavily in online marketers and servi ce providers constructed fiber optic communications network and attempted to create market for trading broadband communications capacity enron entered thes markets near the peak of the boom and paid high prices taking on heavy debt load to finance its purchases when the dot com crash came in 2000 revenue from these inves tments dried up but th debt remained enron also recorded significant losses in certain foreign operations the firm made major investments in public utilities in indi south america and the uk hoping to profit in newlyderegulated markets in these three cases local politicians acted to shield consumers from the sharp price increases that enron anticipated by contrast enrons energy trading businesses appear to have made money although that trading was probably less extensive and profitable than the company claimed in its financial reports energy trading however did not generate sufficient cash to allow enron to withstand major losses in its dot com and foreign portfolios once the internet bubble burst enrons prospects were dire it is not unusual for businesses to fail after making bad or illtimed investments what turned the enron case into major fi nancial scanda l was the companys response to its problems rather than disclose its true condition to public investors as the law requires enron falsified its accounts it assigned business sses and nearworthless assets to unconsolidated partnerships and special purpose entities in other words the firms public accounting statemen ts pretended that losses were occurring not to enron but to the socalled raptor entities which were ostensibly independent firms that had agreed to absorb enrons losses but were in fact accounting contrivances created and entirely controlled by enrons management in addition enr on appears to have disguised bank loans as energy derivatives trades to conceal the extent of its indebtedness when these accounting fictions which we re sustained for nearly 18 months came to light and corrected accounting statem ents were issued ove r 80 of the profits reported since 2000 vanished and enron quickly collapsed the sudden collapse of such large corporation and the accompanying sses of jobs investor wealth and market confidence suggested that there were serious flaws in the us system of securities regulation which is based on th full and accurate disclosure of all financia l information that market participants need to make informed investment decisions the suggestion was amply confirmed by the succession of major corporate accounting scandals that followed enron raised fundamental i ssues about corporate fraud accounting transparency and investor protection veral aspects of these issues are briefly sketched below with reference to crs products that provide more detail auditing and accounting issues federal securities law requi res that the accounting statements of publicly traded corporations be certified by an independent auditor enron s auditor arthur andersen not only turned blind eye to improper acc ounting practices but was actively involved in devising complex financia l structures and transacti ons that facilitated deceptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135crs3 an auditors certification i ndicates that the financial statements under review have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in enrons case the question is not only whet her gaap were violate d but whether current accounting standards permit corporations to pl ay numbers games and whether investors are exposed to excessive risk by financial statements that lack clarity and consistency accounting standards for corporations are set by the financial accounting standards board fasb nongovernmental entity thoug h there are also securities and exchange commission sec requirements the sec has statutory authority to set accounting standards for firms that sell securities to the public some descri be fasbs standards setting process as cumbersome and too susceptible to business andor political pressures in response to the auditing and accountin g problems at enron and other major corporations scandals congress enacted th sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204 containing perhaps the most farreaching am endments to the securities laws since the 1930s very briefly the law does the following creates public company accounting oversight board to regulate independent auditors of publicly traded companies private sector entity operating under the oversight of the sec raises standards of auditor independence by prohibiting auditors from providing certain consulting services to their audit clients and requiring preapproval by the clients board of directors for other nonaudit services requires top corporate management and audit committees to assume more direct responsibility for the accur acy of financial statements enhances disclosure requi rements for certain transactions such as stock sales by corporate insiders transactions with unconsolidated subsidiaries and other significant events that may require realtime disclosure directs the sec to adopt rules to prev ent conflicts of in terest that affect the objectivity of stock analysts authorizes 776 million for the sec in fy2003 versus 469 million in the administrations budget request and requires the sec to review corporate financial repor ts more frequently and establishes andor increases criminal penalties for variety of offenses

these plans in the 107th congress the house passed legisl ation hr 3762 that would have required account information to be provided mo re often to plan pa rticipants improved access to investment planning advice allowe d plan participants to diversify their portfolios by selling company stock contributed by employers after three years and barred executives from selling company stock while plan

wake of enron and ot her scandals corporate board s of directors were subject to critical scrutiny boards whose chief duty is to represent shareholders interests utterly failed to prevent or detect management fraud seve ral provisions of sarbanes oxley were designed to boost the power of independent directors and the audit committee of the board to exercise effective oversig ht of management nd the accounting process under sarbanesoxley the boards audit committee must have majority of independent directors not affiliated with management or the corporati on and is responsible for hiring firing overseeing and paying the firms outside auditor the audit committee must include at least one director w ho is financial expert that is able to evaluate significant accounting issues andor disagreements between manageme nt and auditors in 2003 the new york stock exchange nd the nasdaq adopted rules requiring listed corporations to have majority of independent directors not affiliated with management or the corporati on on their boards in 2004 the sec is considering rule that would facilitate the nomination of directors by shareholders securities analyst issues securities analysts employed by investment banks provide research and make buy sell or hold recommendations these recommendations are widely circulated and are relied upon by many public investors analyst support was crucial to enron because it required constant infusions of funds from the financial markets on november 29 2001 after enrons stock had fallen 99 from its high and after rating agencies had downgraded its debt to junk bondstatus only two of 11 major firm analysts rated its stock sell was analyst objectivity towards enron and other firms compromised by pressure to avoi d alienating investment banking clients httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135crs5 the sarbanesoxley act directs the sec to establish rules addressing analysts conflicts of interest thes were issued in 2003 in december 2002 10 major investment banks reached settlement with state and fe deral securities regula tors under which they agreed to reforms to make their analysts independent of their ba nking operations and to pay fines totaling about 1 billion see also crs report rl31348 enron and stock analyst objectivity by gary shorter banking issues one part of the fallout from enrons mise involves its relations with banks prominent banking companies notably citigr oup and jp morgan chase were involved in both the investment banking securities and the commercial banking lending and deposit businesses with enron in 2003 the sec fined the two banks 120 and 135 million respectively for their ro in enrons accounting frauds several aspects of enrons relations with its bankers ve raised several questions 1 do financial holding companies firm s that encompass both investment and commercial banking operations face conflict of interest between their duty to avoid excessive risk on loans from their bank sides ve rsus their opportunity to glean profits from deals on their investment banking side 2 were the bankers enticed or pressured to provide funding for enron and recommend its securities and derivativ to other parties 3 did the dynegy rescue plan proposed ju st before enrons collapse and involving further investments by jp morgan chase and citigroup represent protective selfdealing 4 what is the proper accounting for banks offbalancesheet items including derivative positions and lines of credit such as they provided to enron 5 did the enron situation represent warning that glba may need finetuning in the way it mixes the different business practices of wall street and commercial banking see also crs report rs21188 enrons banking relationships and congressional repeal of statutes separating bank lending from investment banking by william d jackson energy derivatives issues part of enrons core energy business invol ved dealing in deriva tive contracts based on the prices of oil gas electricity and othe r variables for example enron sold long term contracts to buy or sell energy at fixe d prices these contracts allow the buyers to avoid or hedge the risks that increases r drops in energy prices posed to their businesses since the markets in which enron traded are largely unregulated with reporting requirements little info rmation is available about th extent or profitability of enrons derivatives activities beyond what is contained in the companys own financial statements while trading in derivatives is an extremely highrisk activity evidence has yet emerged that indicates that speculative losses were factor in enrons collapse since the enron failure several energy derivatives dealers have admitted to making wash trades which lack economic substan ce but give the appearance of greater market volume than actually exists and facilitate d eceptive accounting if the fictitious trades arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21135crs6 reported as real revenue in 2002 energy rivatives trading diminished to fraction of preenron levels as major tr aders and their customers and shareholders reevaluate the risks and utility of unregulated energy trading several major dealers have withdrawn from the market entirely internal enron memoranda released in may 2002 suggest that enron and other market participants engaged in variety of manipulative trading practices during the california electricity crisis for example enron was able to buy electricity at fixed price in california and sell it elsewhere at the higher market price exacerbating electricity shortages within california the evidence to date does not indicate that energy derivatives as opposed to phy sical spotmarket trades pl ayed major role in these manipulative strategies numerous firms and individuals have been charged with civil and criminal violations related to the manipulation of energy prices in california and elsewhere even if derivatives trading was not major cause enrons failure raises the issue of supervision of unregulated deri vatives markets would it be useful if regulators had more information about the portfolios and risk ex posures of major dealers in derivatives although enrons bankruptcy appears to have had little impact on energy supplies and prices similar dealer failure in the future might damage the dealers trading partners and its lenders and could conceivabl set off widespread disrupti ons in financial andor real commodity markets legislation proposed but not enacted in the 107th congress hr 3914 hr 4038 s 1951 and s 2724 would have among othe r things given the cftc more authority to pursue fraud including wash transactions in the otc market and to require disclosure of certain trade data by dealers in th 108th congress the senate twice rejected legislation
