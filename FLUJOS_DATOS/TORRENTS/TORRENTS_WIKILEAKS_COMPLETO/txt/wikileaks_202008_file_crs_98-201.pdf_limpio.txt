for the us departm ent of agriculture usda and related agencies and an additional 59 billion in emergency supplemental spending for farm economic and disaste r assistance usda appropriations were folded into the omnibus bill after the president vetoed the conference agreement hr 4101 on fy1999 funding for usda an d related agencies on october 7 because the emergency spending provisions in the bill did not include an increas in loan rates price guarantees for farmers pl 105277 does not provide for an increase in loan rates but the 59 in emergency assistance provided is 17 billion above the amount provided in the vetoed bill usda spending at glance the us department of agriculture usda carries out its widely varie d responsibili ties through approximately 30 separate internal agencies staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of th agriculture budget function hence spending for usda is not synonymous wit h spending for farmers usda net outlays after adjustment for offsett ing receipts for the most recently completed fiscal year fy1997 were 525 billion by far the largest outlay within the department 359 billion 6 7 of total outlays in fy1997

committee although they have mandatory status the food and nutrition programs ar funded by an annual appropriation base d on projected spending needs supplemental appropriations generally are made if and when these estimates fall short of required spending an annual ap propriation is also made to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for losses it incurs in financi ng the commodity support programs and the various other programs it finances historically the farm commodity suppor t programs were larger portion of the usda budget than they are currently spending vels among these programs were erratic and unpredictable making total usda spending highly variable some of this unpredictability was lessened by th enactment of the 1996 farm bill which fixes the level of spending on direct payments to program crop pro ducers and longer ties these payments to market conditions the other 25 of the usda budget is for discretionary programs which ar determined by funding in annual ppropriations acts among the major discretionary programs w ithin usda that are funded by the annual agriculture appropriations act are its rural development programs research and education programs

for usda and related agencies were ultimatel included in the omnibus consolidated and emergency appropriatio ns act 1999 pl 105277 hr 4328 which was approved by the house on 102098 by 3339 5 vote by

4328 was signed into law on october 21 1998 the measure contain s 559 billion in regular fy1999 appropriations for usda and related agencies and 59 billion in emergency funding to help farmers recover from natural disasters and low crop prices the house and senate earlier had approved separa conference agreement for fy1999 usda appropriations hr 4101 on october 2 and october 6 1998 respectively however the president vetoed the measure on october 7 because the emergency spending provisions in the bill did not include senate democrati c leadershipsupported increase in loan rates price guarantees for farmers the vetoedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98201crs4 measure included 559 billion in new budget authority and 4 2 billion in emergency assistance republican leader ship opposed any increase in loan rates but instead agreed to an increase in the amount of em ergency farm assistance provided from 42 billion in the vetoed bill hr 4101 to 59 billio n in pl 105277 budget emergency was declared for this amount which by definition requires budgetary offsets for th new spending see emergency supplemental farm assistance below for details the 559 billion in regular nonemergency fy199 9 appropriations for usda and related agencies in pl 105277 is about equa l to the housepassed level of hr 4101 13 billion below the senatepassed level s 2159 and nearly 3 billio n below the administration request of this amount 4225 billion is for mandator programs and 1369 billion for discretionary spending with only few exceptions the 559 billion provided to usda and relate d agencies in pl 105277 is nearly identical to amounts provided in the vetoe d conferen ce agreement on hr 4101 the major differences are that pl 10527 7 provides 233 million more for the presidents food safety initiative spread ou t among fda and several usda agencies and 15 million more for rura l empowerment zones and enterprise communities programs within usdas rura l development programs total nonemergency budget authority in pl 105277 for usda and related agencies is significantly higher than the 4955 billion appropriated in fy1998 which is mainly attributable to change in the formula for determining how much is required to reimburse the commodity credit corporation for its net realized losses see far m commodity programs below for details significant portion of the 11 billion difference betwe the total amounts provided in hr 4101 and s 2159 is in the amount prov ided for food stamps the house based its projections on more recent economic forecasts that show lower average participation and benefits tha n previously were projected the following is review of the major us da and related agencies provisions of pl 105277 the house and senatepassed bills hr 4101 and s 2159 and the administration request for fy1999 funding see table 3 at the end of this report for programbyprogram comparis on of pl 105277 with the house and senate bills the fy1999 request and actual fy1998 appropriations emergency supplemental farm disaster and economic assistance several regions of the country have been experiencing low farm commodit prices pr imarily for wheat corn soybeans and cotton andor natural disasters this year particularly in the northern plains and the south this has had the effect f significantly reducing farm income pl 105277 provides 5893 billion i n supplemental assistance primarily to mitigate the effects of low crop prices an d natural disasters conferees included language which declares budget emergency for this expenditure which by definition means that budgetary offsets will b required for this new spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98201crs5 the amount provided for farm assistance in pl 105 277 is similar to proposal announced by house republi can leadership on september 17 except that it contains an additional 17 billion more than what was originally proposed included in th final total of 59 billion in emergency farm assistance provided by pl 105277 are 3057 billion in market loss payments to compensa grain cotton and dairy farmers for loss of 1998 income caused by regional economic dislocation unilateral trade sanctions and the failure of the government to pursue trad opportunities aggressively of this amount 2857 billion are for grain an d cotton farmers who were eligible for 1998 production flexibility contrac t payment and 200 million is reserved for dairy farmers among contrac t holders the 2857 billion is expected to be distributed in approximately the following proportions corn contract holders 13 billion wheat 75 0 million upland cotton 332 million rice 242 million and other fee d grains 212 million these additional payments are about 50 higher tha n the 56 billion in contract payments farmers are scheduled to receive i n fy1999 the secretary of agriculture will have to determine how the 200 million in dairy payments will be distribute d among dairy producers since milk is not contract commodity 15 billion in disaster payments to farmers who have incurred significan t losses to any crop in 1998 due to natural disasters an additional 875 million in direct disaster payments to producers who have experienc ed multiple years of natural disasters and crop diseases particularly those in the northern plains and upper midwest 200 million in costshare assistance for livestock growers who lost to natural disaster significant amount of feed grown on the farm disaster payments will be made to producer regardless of whether the farmer had an active crop insurance policy however if farmer waived crop insuranc coverage in 1998 he would be required to obta in crop insurance in the next two crop years as condition for receiving disaster pa yment because the federal government pays the entire premium for the farmer f or the basic level of crop insurance coverage this mandatory requirement to obtain insurance is estimated to cost the government an additional 66 million which is factored into the 59 billion supplementa l appropriation conditions of eligibility for the disaster payments were left to th discretion of the secretary of agriculture other emergency farm assistance provisions in pl 10 5277 include 50 million in disaster assistance to help western alaska fishermen recover from poor salmo n returns 40 million in additional salaries and expenses for the farm service agency fsa the usda agency that administers farm commodity disaster and loa n programs and 31 million in budget authority to support 540 million in additional direct and guaranteed fsa farm operating loans and 3 million in dairy disaste r assistance provision not included in the conference agreement but strongly supporte d by the administration and senate democratic leadership during the debate was ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98201crs6 in addition to t he farm commodity programs the ccc also serves as funding mechanism1 for several usda export subsidy programs including the export enhancement program export credit guarantees and the market assis tance program and for an array of conservation programs including the conservation re serve program the wetlands reserve program and the environ mental qualities incentive program see agricultural trade and food aid an d conservation below for more details on these programs temporary increase in the loan rate price guarantees for certain farm commodities one attempt to raise the loan rates for grains and cotton was defeated during senate floor action on s 2159 another attempt was defeated when the senate tabled similar amendment to the interior appropriations bill s 2237 the presiden t vetoed the conference agreement on fy1999 agriculture appropriations because its emergency provisions did not include an increase in the loan rates senate democrats supporte d an increase saying it was needed to adequately address farm financia l problems republican leadership opposed proposed oneyear increase in loan rates because of its estimated cost 5 billion and because it believed that it woul d fundamentally undermine the policy changes made by the omnibus 1996 farm law for more details on the implementation of the emergency provisions see crs report 98952 the emergency agricultural provisions in the fy1999 omnibu s appropriations act farm commodity programs outlays for the farm commodity programs and certain farm export programs and conservation programs are funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc is revolving financing mechanism within usda through which it supports m ore than dozen specified commodities including grains cotton milk sugar peanuts and tobacco the formulas that determine payments under thes programs are made by longterm farm legisl ation and benefits have to be provided to any participating producer in past years outlays of the ccc have been highly variable and tended t fluctuate based on crop market conditions the federal agricul ture improvement and reform act of 1996 pl 104127 the 1996 farm bill replaced the program f making direct payments to participating producers when market prices fall below target level with predetermined and declining market transition payments to eligible producers over 7year period consequently ccc outlays have been mor predictable since 1996 than they were in previous years the administration estimated earlier this year that total ccc outlays for fy1999 would be 90 billion for all cccfunded programs of which 55 billion would be for direct market transition payments to farmers all estimates exclude the 5 61 billion in emergency fy1999 ccc spending provided by pl 105277 the 9 0 billion estimate is down from an estimated 93 billion in fy1998 outlays of whic h 58 billion was in market transition payments because these programs are funded through the ccc they do not require annual appropriations instead the cc c borrows funds from the treasury to fund its operations however because cc c outstanding borrowing cannot exceed 30 billion the annual appropriations bil lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98201crs7 usually contains funding for reimbur sement of ccc net realized losses so that the ccc can repay its debt to the treasur and not exhaust its borrowing authority this reimbursement is also categorized as mandator expense and is not included toward the discretionary spending allocation given to the appropriations subcommittees the 8439 billion requested by the administration and provided as regula r nonemergency appropriation in pl 105277 for the fy1999 reimbursement to the ccc is up significantly 77 billion from the 7835 million that wa s appropriated in fy1998 much of the difference can be explained by change i n methodology used by usda for determining how much to request for net realize d losses rat her than change in farm policy in brief the methodology used before last year based the reimbursement request on an estimate of losses in the previou s fiscal year while the new methodology bases the request on actual losses from th second previous fiscal year the 7835 million requested in fy1998 was unusually low because it was transition year for switching to the new methodology although the farm commodity programs do t require an annual appropriation per opponents of these programs have in the past offered floor amendments t agriculture appropriations bills in an attempt to effect changes in farm commodit policy separate amendments which would have affected the peanut and sugar price support programs and cro p insurance for tobacco farmers were offered and defeated on the house floor when hr 4101 was debated in june an adopted senat amendment to s 2159 would have required tobacco growers to be assessed for the cost of usda to administer its tobacco price s upport programs and related activities but was deleted in conference civil rights provisions pl 105277 contains provisions somewhat similar to what was in the housepassed appropriations bill hr 4101 with respect t waiving the statute of limitations for certain allegations of discrimination agains t usda the department has been under close scrutiny in recent years for it s treatment of minorities for both its personnel actions and in its administration of its farmer programs pl 105 277 waives the statute of limitations on civil rights cases for eligible complaints made during the period januar 1 1981 through december 31 1996 eligible complaints include d in the conference agreement are those pertaining to cases involving potential discrimination within usdas farm commodity far m credit rural housing loan and disaster assistance programs only conferees on pl 105277 modified the civil rights provision in the vetoed bill hr 4101 to include housing loan programs and to extend the statute of limitation back to 1981 instead of 1983 as in the vetoed bill pl 105277 also requires the secretary of agriculture to conduct an i nvestigation issue written determination and propose resolution within 180 days milk marketing order reform pl 105277 contains houseadopte d provision that requires usda to issue its final rule for federal milk marketing order reform between february 1 and april 4 1999 and extend the deadline fo r implementation from april 4 1999 to october 1 1999 comparable provision was in the senatepassed bill federal m ilk marketing orders regulate the farm price of milk in much of the co untry usda is in the process of consolidating the number of marketing orders as required by the 1996 farm bill and reforming dairy pricinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98201crs8 policy which has been the center of controversy among dairy production regions processors and consumers the conference provision to extend the deadline is supported by northeast and southeast dairy producer groups who support the c urrent milk pricing system and are concerned that usda might implement reforms that reduce minimum farm mil k prices while congress is in recess later this year opponents of the provision mainly upper midwest milk producers contend that the provision appl ies pressure on usda to recommend the status quo or else be faced with legislative action against decision in favor of any reforms that would reduce minimum milk prices th requirement that usda release its final rule between february 1 and april 4 1999 ensures that the rule will be released at time when congress is in session and ca n react to the ruling an obey amendment to hr 4101 would have removed thi s provision from the bill but was defeated on the house floor on june 23 by voice vote the extension of the implementation deadline to october 1 1999 effectivel extends the life of the northeast dairy comp act to october 1 as well the northeast compact establishes higher minimum price for the farm price of beverage milk in new england an d under current law expires at the same time as implementation of order reform proposed petri amendment to hr 4101 would have kept the sunset date for the northeast dairy compact at april 4 1999 but t he amendment was not allowed to be considered on the house floor the chairman of the rules committee raised point of order against the amendment on the floor stating that it was in violation of the rule h res 482 which prohibited th consideration of any amendments to hr 4101 that change existing law for more on federal dairy policy reform see crs issue brief 97011 dair policy issues crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas ris k management agency rma it offers basically free catastrophic insurance t producers who grow an insurable crop any producer who opts for this coverage has the opportunity to purch ase additional insurance coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insuranc companies that are reinsured by usda there are basically four sources of federal expenditures for the crop insurance program usda absorbs large percentage of the program l osses compensates the reinsured companies for portion of their delivery expenses subsidizes the premium paid by participating producers and pays the salaries and expen ses of its administering agency within usda the program losses and premium subsidy are mandator expenditures funded through usdas federal crop insurance fund the salaries and expenses of the rma agency are discretionary expense subject to annua l appropriations the funding source for the federal reimbursement to the private insuranc companies has been the subject of controversy in recent years and was recentl addressed by leg islation pl 105185 s 1150 the agriculture research bill priorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98201crs9 to enactment of pl 105185 onehalf of the reimbursement was funded as mandator account and the other half was funded through discretionary funds beginning in fy1999 pl 105185 autho rizes all of the reimbursement to be funded through the c rop insurance fund as mandatory account thus precluding the need for specific annual appropriation crop insurance supporters had feared that if the expense had remained discretionary it would be come target for cuts which they say would lessen private sector participation in the program since pl 105185 created new mandatory spending of 1 billion over 5 years for this reimbursement comparable offset had to be made as required by budge t law to par tially offset the cost of this new mandatory expenditure pl 10518 5 made statu tory changes to the federal crop insurance program which achieve 530 million in savings over 5 years this includes increasing the fee charged farmers for catastrophic coverage 205 million in 5year savings and reducing th reimbursement rate to the private insurance companies from 27 of collecte d premiums to 245 188 million in savings the bala nce of 485 million comes out of administrative cost savings in the food stamp program provision in the fy1999 omnibus appropr iations act pl 105277 overturns the increase in the fee charged farmers for catastrophic coverage so that farmers w ill pay more than 50 per crop per county for catastrophic coverage instead of 10 of the governmentpai d premium for coverage as is customary the administrat ion requests such sums as may be necessary for the fe deral crop insurance fund which it estimates to be 1504 billion fo r fy1999 this estimate exclu des any emergency supplemental benefits provided the emergency package described in th above section pl 105277 concurs with this estimate the administration also requested 66 million for the salaries and expenses of the rma for fy1999 pl 105277 freezes this account at the fy1998 level of 64 million for more on the mechanics of t he crop insurance program see crs report 97 572 managing farm risk in new policy era agricultural credit usda serves as lender of last res ort for family farmers unable to obtain credit from commercial nder through its farm service agency fsa usda provides direct farm loans and also

makin g loan is directly related to any interest rate subsidy provided by the government as we ll as projection of anticipated loan losses caused by farmer nonrepayment of the loans the administration requ ested an appropriation of 1057 million to fund nearly 30 billion in total farm loans for fy1999 hr 4101 as passed by the house i n june recommended somewha t smaller appropriation 914 million in

provide 440 million in additiona l direct and guaranteed operatin g loans the supplemental appropriation was made to remedy the backlog of applications for operating loans which occurred because of shortage of fy1998 funds pl 105277 also adopted many of the credit provisions in the senate bill which modify farmer eligibility for future fsa farm loa ns when the farmer has been forgiven outstanding debt under current law farmer borrower cannot receive subsequent direct or guaranteed fsa farm loan if the borrower has been forgiven debt on delinquent loan one adop ted provision would
