dianetic auditing lecture given on 21 july 1966 thank you thank you thank you very much thats nice welcome well now today were getting down to business were getting down to business and this is the 21st of july 1966 saint hill special briefing course lecture on dianetic auditing i go away and right away everybody forgets how to audit the processes today are so fast theyre so rapid that an auditor cannot be trained thats it i mean ifs as simple as that i recognized this some time ago and back in april wrote bulletin which covered this which has actually not been put into action yet and which is being put into action right now and i think went into action at 2200 pm thats it rons back all right the main thing about this is that if auditors cant audit why then auditing gets done now thats very very horribly true and then nobody will make it up the line at all and its also factually true that our first clears are uniformly good auditors but today i turned pc over to an auditor and he didnt know enough to flatten the process pc went unconscious so he changed the process huhoo thats awful thats awful dont do things like that so the guy goes unconscious all right get your question answered so pc says he cant answer the question just sit there till he does if pc has more answers and so forth the process probably went free needle and you didnt notice it probably is already squared away but dont just change process because pc went unconscious do you see these are the little truisms of auditing man to man and man to girl i make plea follow the fundamentals get your auditing question answered its plea dont change processes because the pc goes out like light dont panic dont be psychiatrist now if goofs like that can occur its because one doesnt have enough drill but drill just on the trs is not adequate to produce the whole of auditing phenomena for the auditor and so he doesnt get used to handling them and heits like greased ball in his hands you know like lets see it said in the bulletin that the next thing i huhhahandyeah and i hope thats right and the pc goes releaseand so he says he gets more practice with that well i can assure you dianetic auditing carried on this way is not likely to release anybody very rapidly and if it does it only releases him on chain if you get any releases in this theyre subzero releasesway down now i have made releases with dianetic auditing and so on and they were the first clears its not too hard to do but of course they were simply keyedout clears which today we call releases those people remained stable or didnt remain stable or something of the sort but it completely changed their lives the trouble i had in those days was the person felt so goodand there was training of course pre50they just walked away i kept tabs on them for some years from time to time but somebody stole my book and i dont have any idea what happened to them but i can tell you that these people were in much better shape they really werent up to grade 0 release but they were certainly in much better shape something had happened so theres value in this type of auditing but i wish to make you another plea is dont go out and use it in practice its practice auditing dont practice with it on people because all sorts of disastrous things will occur if you become an expert dianetic auditor then were all in trouble because we will start curing everything you know and knocking out psychosis and neurosis and doing all those poor doctors out of their jobs and you dont want to do any doctors out of their jobs but i say this in all sincerity this leads you in to the fact that you can heal and that is not your profession youre trying to clear people and these processes will heal people even badly run theyll cure migraine headaches and arthritis and lumbosis and medicosis and all kinds of wild illnesses but it doesnt necessarily follow that its uniform in other words you dont get one for one for one you see for the excellent reason that the whole reactive mind is the reason for very severe illnesses its the whole mind and you can key out parts of it and make somebody quite well you see you can key out some very specific illness like that and have it go away but itdont be too surprised if it comes back so therefore cure is ais not well used its illadvised as word the way to make somebody well is to make thetan clear and just never never depart from that and youll be fine but you do need practiceim notdont use you broadly but you as an instructor you as scientologist and the new student all need some process which doesnt produce an instantaneous result and then you get so that you can handle arc breaks and you can handle comm cycle and you can do this and you can do that and you get practice you can sit there and grind away by the hour dont you see you can use meter you can fool around with this and that and so on you could go on project like cleaning up all the engrams of the last three lives well youre not likely to release anybody doing this but its awfully interestinggreat interest to the auditor great interest to the pc you might change some things you might improve somebody were not interested in that particularly but its quite rewarding quite rewarding for the pc but were only interested in the auditor in this particular case you see now the auditor will get so that he knows that pc who is being critical has got withhold and he knows enough to get his question answered and he knows enough not to overrun i mean the pc completely runs out of answers well you should recognize that the pc has done so and it isnt just dodge hes not very imaginative pc you say where did you put the cat and the fellow says in the living room now theres point in now saying where did you put the cat because there arent any more answers to it and sometimes you get into this squirrel cage and you must recognize these things but the way to learn how to audit is to get your hands dirty and the dirtiest you can get your hands is going down the reactive bank on the time track now there arent any bugs in dianetic auditing there arent any bugs in it theyve all been ironed out even visiothere is way to turn on somebodys visio so he can see the picture there is way to do this all you do is get the duration of the incident and if you get the exact duration of the incident the boy will have visio in it its the most remarkable thing you ever saw so youd have to know how to get the duration of an incident you know if he was being hit on the head with sledgehammer you have to know if he was hit on the head for one minute or five minutes or one day you see all right if you get the correct time on your meter and so on this fellow its all blackthis case is black five hes never seen pictures or anything like thatif you get the exact point where hes parked on the track with your meter and then you get the exact duration of the incident bang he has visio startles him most to pieces thats what used to chop us down in running engrams and so forth well now one has to go into this from the most basic and elementary possible ways the most fundamental fundamentals have to be gone into to teach somebody something about dianetic auditing now there is book on the subject dianetics modern science of mental health but to give you this practice material i have condensed dianetics modern science of mental health into hco bulletin 3 april 1966 which is one two three four five pages long you get brighter as you get older you know in the process and i wish to point out that hcob 3 april 1966 is far simpler and better method of running secondaries and engrams than dianetics modern science of mental health so if youre reading this and read dianetics modern science of mental health realize that this bulletin written sixteen years later takes precedence you got it now theres lot of dope in dianetics modern science of mental health but it runs engrams quite differently it runs them by repeater technique it runs them by phrases it does all kinds of things and so on whereas this doesnt run them by repeater technique and run phrases now the main danger that you run into then is not really reading what it says in this bulletin and actually trying to run dianetics secondaries and engrams the way it is described in dianetics modern science of mental health you see you let some of the old dianetic technique get into this bulletin and you will have to that degree just this much trouble now dianetic session today would look like repetitive auditing session with this single exception that it takes longer for the pc to answer the question if you tell him to go through it and tell everything that has happened and so on that is an auditing command but it may take him five minutes to answer it and ithe only danger is is i dont want you to pick up the idea that your pc ought to gab gab gab on grade 0 processes and so forth any more than it takes him to answer the question we dont want the pc continuously itsaing well now he isnt continually itsaing hes told youyou tell him to go through it and say what happened and when you tell him this why he then goes through it and says what happened when that finishes oft why you give him final acknowledgment sometimes he gets scared or lonesome and you have to give him an uh huh to encourage him but this is sort of halfacknowledgment if you give him too many of those hell start talking to you obsessively because he feels that hes got more to say and youve already acknowledged him so get your halfacknowledgments really halt you knowuhhuh you know uh huh dont say good you know now if you really want to start him talking just do that to him time or two then hell feel that youre stopping him from talking and so he will then talk more and more and more these continuously talking pcs where the auditor never has chance to get question in edgewise have either been trained in the field of psychoanalysis or the auditor is overacknowledging and the pc is trying to get past that acknowledgment so anyway youve got lot to learn about auditing and its about auditing that you are learning while youre running dianetic auditing but to use dianetic auditing at all you have to know something about dianetic auditing that brings us back to subject called the human mind now there was fellow one time called sigmund freud and sigmund freud started out on an adventure in hypnotism with fellow by the name of breuer to explore the entirety of the human mind and he explored it down to light lock at three years of age and figured out he had done the whole works thats something like looking at mountain telling everybody you have found the entire mountain because you now are holding pebble see little pebble came off the top of the mountain or the tip of blade of grass growing on the top of the mountain then youd say thats the whole mountain you see but he had this occasional experience that after he had let somebody chatter for while he would find some kind of childhood experience of some kind or anotherand maybe that was his own case he was running who knowsand he wouldhe would take some charge off of this and all of sudden the person would feel little bit better and then he would be told now if you are very very careful for the next thirty years you will not be neurotic anymore that was psychoanalysis1894 he released the libido theory saying that all life is based on sex now that is maybe an unkind statement with regard to the libido theorylibido for lovebut nevertheless that was it lateryear psychoanalysts had an awful lot of trouble trying to explain away this and say that what freud really meant was that life was based on social things as well as sex but freud didnt say that he said it was based on love now this guy freud in spite of all of that was sharpie and he did discover that there was possibly some coordination between mental reaction or mental experience and psychosomatic illnesses or illnessesphysical illnesses stemming from the mind he discovered that there was this relationship only he didnt have any proof for it and how medicine has gone on believing it ever since has got staggered because he couldnt do it one for one so of course therefore it was not really proved but medicine today believes there is such thing called psychosomatic illness you understand they think there are physical illnesses that stem from the mind well now how they know this i dont know because you see theyve never proven it because they cant take somebodys lumbosis and get away with it by doing something with the mind you follow but we can so its quite factual that physical illness can result from mental aberration now were not much interested in the vagaries of neurosis and psychosis and all that sort of thing let somebody else worry about these or use more basic processes or if you got psychotic put him someplace where its nice and quiet and where he gets something to eat and nobody disturbs him for long time and where he feels safe and let him look at motionless object that has some mass as the common thing for him to do and you will find out that he generally will come out of it as far as neurosis is concerned neurosis isthe difference between neurosis and psychosis is that psychosis the guy is just generally the effect of everything and in neurosis why hes more or less singly the effect of things itshes deranged being on some subject now all of this is very easy to say today and its very easy to coven if you want to know more about it readread some things abouton psychoanalysis and so forth good practice for you to do so nobody is trying to make psychoanalyst out of you but it mightyou might be curious about it you wont find very much there and knowing dianetics you will read far more into what you are reading than was ever there they didnt know what was there now lets get into this subject called the mind the mind is record literal record of experience plotted against time from the earliest moment of aberration until now plus additional ideas the fellow got about it plus other things he may have mocked up or created on top of it in mental mass plus some machines plus some valences joe doakes is monster joe doakes beats him up therefore joe doakes is the winning valence and after that he can keep valence called joe doakes got the idea now its just those pluses but all of those plusesyou can audit almost any of those things the least profitable is to audit the machines its very often lot of fun to audit machine when i say machine i mean it has wheels and smokestacks and so forth and every once in while thetan has got machine parked out there this isnt very uniform but you have to comment on it you have to comment on it now valences are interesting because they make circuits and these circuits will talk to the being he can talk to them and they talk to him oh he has ball and very very disturbing this idea of circuit this gave the arab his psychotherapy and the arab psychotherapy was to chase out the demons and what he was really talking about were these valences now the auditor can actually talk to the pc and get the pc to talk to the demon or the valence and have the valence talk to the pctalk to the auditor it gets that complex what it is an endowed life object now when we say record or when we say mass and so forth we are speaking of mental mass thetan is quite capable of mocking up mass he actually is quite capable of mocking up matter energy space and time hes quite capable of doing this only he mocks it up in veryin his aberrated wog condition he mocks it up in very thinvery thin indeed its proportionate weight would be terribly slight compared to the real objects which he is mocking up picture of he mocks up picture of car his picture of the car would probably be onehundredbillionth of gram would be the total weight connected with it and the car weighs two tons you see but nevertheless he can mock up full picture of car in his aberrated condition when he gets better and when hes longer sick or human and so forth why of course he can mock up can but thats beside the point were getting off into more advanced therapies now now heres the score with regard to the mind then for auditing purposes it has these valences and thats what you are working with when you do whats called search and discovery or an sd youre not working with mental image pictures youre working with valences youre trying to find the valence that is raising the devil with him every once in while you miss because he is the valence that is raising the devil with him sometimes if you wanted to really do profound sd that went the whole track youd say who are you youd possibly even get suppressive but thatd be very very fundamental sd the psychiatrist and the psychoanalyst more and more began to try to address what the person was creating and they began to consider that everything there was there it was what the person was creating i said theres the things the guy mocks up in his mind you see well so they addressed the things that the person had himself created and they are not very aberrative theyre the lightest of aberrations so the fellow says i think the room is full of martians and their immediate therapy is youre just imagining it you possibly through accounts of hospitals and that sort of thing know that that is the standard response well thats because theyre addressing the illusion or the unactual they think the unactual or the illusion is what is wrong with the person actually what is wrong with the person is that he is producing illusion and you want to find out why he is producing illusion then you have to get down to the cause of the production of illusion not oh well youre just imagining it mr jones mr jones is crazy he thinks hes prime minister see he thinks hes napoleon and so forth illusion so the psychiatrist attacks illusion and hes trying to get rid of that and that is something that you neglect entirely youre only interested in experience he would have gotten much further had he actually attacked experience now sometimes person gets delusory after theyve had an experience this is perfectly true but youll find out that that is minor problem because as the person confronts the experience he will lose the illusion and get the actual experience illusion is surface manifestation which disappears when experience is consulted so what you are doing is auditingwith dianetic auditingyoure auditing experience now dont get all clouded up about is it illusory or isnt it illusory or wahwah you know this or that or the other thing just skip that now youve got processes advanced processes that handle valences those are by assessment and theyre summed up today in search and discovery if you want to change somebodys personality graph like that why audit few valences because the personality graph is actually picture of valence on any human being he himself is not really enough there to have personality hes very subdued so we take that out of dianetic auditing we take machines out of dianetic auditing theyre fun but they dont do anything you think im just joking probably about these machines or you think itd be some little object someplace like that but actuallyactually every now and then you will run into one thats got great big red flywheels and brassa body you see and little whistles and things and its something that produces predictions for him or something like that it shuffles them out to him you know its crazy man these people arent insane their perception has to be much better than the average in order to perceive that they have these things so were going to neglect that and then were going to neglect illusion now thatyou must remember you must neglect illusion in dianetic auditing thats very very important because illusion is simply the product of the actual and if you attack illusion you prevent him from reaching the actual now the actual is so bizarre from viewpoint of human being it is so strange so weirdthe actual isthat of course people are all too prone to call the actual and the illusion both illusion or hallucination see there are people around who work on the basis of making somebody hallucinate you know theres wholethe whole play dedicated to it called gaslight you know they work on thisguy works on this girl and works on this girlby changing the actual physical universe makes her think shes crazy you see till where did you put the staircase paula and anything that happens he does it and then he blames it on her and she cant remember doing it so she thinks shes gone mad so therefore she thinks shes having illusions you see or hallucinations so people work on this all the time for instance the newspapers would like you to believe what they print you only have to read stuff about yourself in the newspapers to know doggone well there isnt line of truth anywhere in the paper but somewhere in the human world there was probably some event that had an actuality on which the news story is based you see there probably was something you get down to more solid objects like trains run off bridges its easy for them to write something like that because its at their tone level you see disaster and everybody messed up and well sell lots of papers sobut its remarkable how much illusion theyll even write about train wreck there was train wreck but what appears in the paper is very often quite different as i say you only have to read about yourself in the press few times to then wonder about the story to the right of that story and to the left of that story you wondered if senator snodgrass was even in washington at the time he made the speech you see its spooky its spooky what river of lies so that is the social illusion what normally laughingly is called news this is based on old womens gossip there used to be gossips occasionally who were put in stocks because they said nothing but vicious things about everybody and stirred up trouble for everybody and ran all around doing this sort of thing and they just made nothing but trouble and told nothing but lies and so forth well the modern gossip is the newspaper and if those characteristics were in one human being that human being would be driven from the community why everybody buys newspapers i dont know im tired of them myself but im just giving you an example the newspaper is the illusion of the event well very often person will get an illusion you can expect pc running things to get an illusion of the event the event was too much for him to confront so he dreams up what it was now itsif youre really running real engramillusion will often come off of it the fellow will start changing his mind about it well for heavens sakes dont fix him with the illusion till he reaches the actual dont stand around saying well the last time we ran thatlast time we ran that you went off the bridge now apparentlynow apparently you werent in the car at all and yourself dont be baffled because the fellow couldnt confront the experience so he partially confronted and partially dreamed it up see the part he couldnt confront he dreamed up now as he audits this his confront gets better and he sees what it is now pc quite often will get himself confused because he says the mental image picture is absolute and that is what i see the first time i run it through and therefore i am very upset because the second time through the woman has red hat on and she wasnt wearing hat the first time through so what is this this then isnt real experience well its not for you to evaluate for him just put him through it again and he will say oh ii guess i never could confront her you know or something like this you get the idea so actual experience is at the root of all illusion and you are not in the business of evaluating the content of secondaries and engrams that is not the business you are in the business you are in is the alleviation of the incidentmental image picture of the incident itself all right so what happens in life thetan is busy little bee and he will make picture of events as they occur and then he clutches these pictures to his thetanish bosom and wonders why hes so sick this is not very bright but he does it now he has great loss all secondaries depend upon loss we say secondary and the reason ifs secondary is because it depends for its charge on an engram which contains pain and unconsciousness its secondary it does not contain pain and unconsciousness it contains emotion any emotion or misemotion may be contained in secondary but of course pleasure and so forth does not make secondary and it also doesnt make an incident it doesnt make an aberrative incident because he was so happy person however can have win which is so magnitudinous and so unexpected that it hangs him up forever hes always going back to this big win you know very often old men will sit around and go over their wins with one another and it was always amazing to as little boy listening to former road agentswhich is to say robbers and who were now very respectablecattle rustlers exsheriffs not much difference to choose between them because actually they swapped their hats almost at random you seetalking about the horses they had stolen and the cattle rustlers they hadnt shot and all of this sort of thing it was interesting to that their stories never wore out and while i would find their stories of interest sitting around as little tad i would very soon become very familiar with all of them and they would still tell them and one of them would be talking and the other one would simply not be listening at all but be waiting to talk in his turn and it was interesting to that those incidents never wore out they never desensitized at all they just were good forever like an unperishable phonograph record and that is true about pleasure moments and so forth is the thetan just goes on with them forever all right so were talking then when we talk about secondary about misemotiongrief fear well youdactually its the old tone scale we got the old tone scale from the fact that as you run secondary if you run classic secondary it will come up from below apathy into apathy and move right on up the tone scale in its tones and it will finally wind up at boredom and thats the wrong place to stop because theres enthusiasm just above that and at that point he doesnt care about it again but that is secondary its misemotion the tone scale was plotted from the behavior of secondaries under auditing but to have secondarya moment of loss which is aberrativean individual must have had an experience containing pain and unconsciousness and that is an engram an engram is an experiencemental picture of an event of pain and unconsciousness person had to hurt and he had to have gone unconscious to greater or lesser degreeand sometimes they just go unconscious during the center moment of the hurt but theres always little unconsciousness connected with great painand the mental image picture of that event is the engram now the word engram itself comes from trace on cellis what it means and at the time i was first working with this i was thinking in terms of cellular memory i didnt know where these things came fromit was way back whenand so i chose word which was preferably different than other terms being used and that was the first consideration second consideration was that we could define it and say what it did mean anytime an individual was hurt like faithful little idiot he made complete record of the event complete record of the event was manufactured at that moment youd be surprised how complete it is do you know that you could take somebody through tonsillectomy with stopwatch you can even have doctor there who knows the speed and action connected with tonsillectomy and have him criticize the quality of the surgeon doing the tonsillectomy you can move the person right through the tonsillectomy by calling off the time in the tonsillectomyone minute deep two minutes three minutes four minutes five minutes you know you can get the event and so on you can put the time in it thetan is fantastically accurate in terms of time time is something which thetan has good solid grip on he has very very solid grip being does not make errors reactively about time analytically he gets confused about time but right down deep right down deep he never makes an error about time he knows reactively exactly when it happened and for how long but he now is incapable of confronting the fact so he makes quote errors while hes wide awake you ask some girl how old she is youll understand what i mean she sometimes looks very vague very often the person cant tell the date well thats because he doesnt particularly want to confront dates but if you went at it with meter you would pick up the exact date it is recorded but is unconfrontable so he records what he cant confront and that is where he gets engrams and secondaries i find that very amusing though why would he record it if he cant confront it if he cant confront it why didnt he just skip it but the truth of the matter is he didnt see were only dealing with what is not what should be you know so we have time track let us saywell we have consecutive series of events beginning with the first aberration of the being on through to the present and the wonder of the emeter is is that as person is more capable of confronting the emeter will reach just below to what he slightly cant confront and will give you read on it the meter sees deeper than he does thats very interesting but the emeter doesnt saysee all the way down youll run right straight across events that wont register on the meter but then the pc is improved by auditing he comes up and then all of sudden youll find the emeter is registering on those events that it didnt register on before thats because theyre closer to being confronted so the emeter will register on anything that is close to being confronted and it reads deeper than the thetan can confront which is quite amusing its like life is at this level you seefour feet off the floorand then we have the emeter able to sound foot deep see the being himself can only see this strata four feet off the floor but the emeter can see three feet from the floor see it can see one foot deep but that doesnt mean there isnt event between three feet and the floor see theres tons of event in there but as the being becomes more familiar with his own mind and his own past and as he becomes more able then this depth increases but of course the fourfoot level is now very very easy for him to confront the threefoot level where the emeter was seeing before is now confrontable by the being himself and the meter is now confronting to two feet and eventually the being can confront as much as the meter can confront but at that time unfortunately for auditing the individual is clear now therefore the function of the emeter is not seesall endall seer of some kind or another with swamitype turban and big glass diamond its just something with little bit better telescopic sights it can see bit deeper than the being himself dont feel completely reassured because there is meter read that everything on that subject is gone everything that is in restimulation that will have any effect upon the thetan is gone do you see so therefore you can easily unflatten things which you have flat in other words youve gotten something down to point where it longer registers on the meter and you say good thats flat now we go over it again just to make sure and now we get things reading in it again i want to caution you about this in auditing engrams because you can flatten them and you can unflatten them just as easy as scat so you want to get it down to where you arent getting tone arm action you more or less got it now the mind then that is being approached by dianetic auditing is the mind of event and the things which are aberrative in that mind are the engrams and the secondaries they are very often visible through their locks or tiny surface manifestations guy is hit on the head with hammer that makes an engram theres physical pain and unconsciousness in it few days later he walks into hardware store he doesnt like to be there he cant tell you why because he cant confront the incident of being hit in the head with hammer but there are hammers in that hardware store he doesnt even see what is restimulating the engram he just is uncomfortable and he will take picture of the hardware store as an uncomfortable place so you chase guy down the time track and he has picture of hardware store well now you couldnt possibly guess why he has picture of hardware store he might have been hit with blowhurt with blowlamp he might have gone bankrupt making secondary we dont know why hes got this little picture of hardware store because theres pain and unconsciousness in connection with hardware store but with meter and with getting him to look it over and think it over and look around on the incident and so on we could pick up what it was the lock on now the lock is in view and the incident is out of sight now what person knows about is not aberrative this inive had more people walk in and say oh i know exactly what it is my second husbandand he beat all the time with club and ive been in terrible shape ever since and they go on and on and on and on and on well we point out this interesting fact they know about that and they haveyoure the thousand and first person they have told about that and it hasnt blown yet which is to say hasnt disappeared hasnt erased so obviously that isnt whats wrong now itd be your job as the auditor to discover what was wrong now maybe in actual practice that would be an exercise in finding valences like you know listing and assessing lists for individuals or things they have known but were talking about it from dianetic approach this is the processing we want to work slowly we dont want any speed out of this process we would go on down the line now to find out what was this all about and this is her second husband and according to her her first husband was knight in shining armor thats illusion you know that you could say to almost anybody whouhwho was you notice this fellow is terribly silent see and always silent never has anything to say so you say to him who is the most talkative person you ever knew oh my uncle bill oh he just talked all the time what did he look like oh he was tall fellow and he had green hair and so on and so on he just talked continuously and hes the most talkative fellow you ever you say whats the matter thats funny i cant ever remember him saying word hes in uncle bills valence dont you see resenting everybody being talkative but hes actually transferred valences so his valence at the time has now transferred to uncle bills valence you get swap you ought to try this sometime just for fun you notice something about person and ask him who was the reverse and watch him get all confused and mixed up you notice this girl is very sad shes very sad mopingtype person whos the happiest gayest most enthusiastic person you ever knew you want to ask her this see bessie ann well tell about bessie ann about halfway through the dissertation you know bessie ann was the most sour sourpuss i ever ran into in my life they themselves had loses in being enthusiastic in trying to cheer up bessie ann you get the idea thats valence problem which youre not interested in but this comes into auditing because in engrams they sometimes swap valences and if you want real tough engram you will find somebody has been the scaffold the headsman the ax the block his wife little boy in the crowd an egg hen youve got this incident and the game in running this thing is to find out what was he and if you run it long enough why youll generally find out that he was the guy being beheaded or he was the executioner and youllyoull run into valences just to that degree now if an individual is looking at himself in the picture he is out of valence you can actually briskly tell him to get into valence or just run it he eventually will now there is danger in running dianetic engrams in that you run too late on chain now incidents of similar nature strung out in time are called chains now lets take the automobileaccident chainthe autoaccident chain now this is fascinating thing but the individual will tell you hes been in one automobile accident when you start checking it over hes been in three you have to have the earliest incident on the chain before you really start grinding away but you can get too enthusiastic about this and you can work too hard to find the earliest incident on the chain because unfortunately even though the psychiatrist doesnt like us to say this and even though the church is quite insulted occasionally when we mention that their converts have lived before this life this is one of the first phenomena you run into in dianetic auditing and you run into it in everybody now thislifetime address to the situation is recommended because the number of automobile accidents the fellow has been in may be nearly infinite he might have been in dozens hundreds thousands inmaybe hes stuck in an incident in spaceopera society where awhere flying car hits him you see and that last truck accident and so on is simply hung up on it but you cant always insist that he stay in this lifetime because its very hard for him to do so hell skid but the danger that im telling you about is not danger of him going into former lifetime but the danger is trying to erase something that is getting more solid it isthe reason for that it is too late on the chain theres two mistakes can be made here you can continue to grind grind grind and its just getting tougher and tougher and harder to do or you can hit it too lightly and go back too quickly and then go back too quickly again and then back too quickly again without taking enough charge off and the guy will become abecome just ball hell get all messed up lets say we have fifteen automobile accidents and we can only find the fifteenth so we take light pass through it but we get all the charge of it off and then we go to the fourteenth we think that is the earliest one now see thats what it registers on the meter and its bad thing for you to always be using earliest one and so forth because you quite commonly have lot of earliest ones earlier than the one youre running you see so its better auditing terminology to say earlierthe earlier incident so you get the fourteenth you dont know its the fourteenth by this see you dont know its the fourteenth yet you think its number one and you go through it but it also behaves in peculiar fashion and if you started to grind it too hard why youd be in bad way so you find the thirteenth and heres where you would enthusiastically make mistake you just note that theres thirteenth note theres twelfth note theres an eleventh tenth ninth and all of sudden buthuththuth ffft what you did is you tried to shoot him down with the same perception as the emeter theres not enough charge off you should have gone through those incidents you should have gotten enough charge off of them so that he could go through them and go down earlier on them do you follow so an auditor can make this error and its very serious error i give it to you very very very severely here as aas great error to try to follow down chain without running what youre finding on the chain just out of your impatience or the pcs curiosity or something like that you got fourteen automobile accidents you better run him through fourteen automobile accidents until you get the first one now maybe in the last two or three at the bottom hell suddenly jump to the first one you run that and the whole chain blows but you can ball him up man do you see the area has got too much unconfrontable stuff in it but the more of these he goes through why the more he can confront and the deeper he can go and the more charge see the more material he has confronted the more he is able to confront it and you finally get him down to where he can confront basic on the chain now sometimes pc will fool you and he himself will get so anxious that he skips five six seven incidents just in an anxiety to get to that bottom one you see and the next thing you know hes glug hes gone into the glue now pc gets very confused if you do this the right way to do this is to erase the auditing you dont go back and do what you should have done you just erase the auditing treat the session as an incident and erase it as lock and everything goes back together again rather neatly and that is something we have almost forgotten how to do in scientology guy has rough session right away we want to get him over to review and get his arc breaks off and fool about with it and do this and that you dont have to do that run the session as an incident you remember the beginning of this session all right go to the beginning of this session all right rapidly pass through to the end of the session and tell the incident and tell what happened do that two or three times pssth thats it you can erase anything if youre good but oddly enough if you took him through the session two or three times it might gum him up because hes had some earlier rougher sessions now that you should have gone back to on chain and youve got another chain on your hands so you might say you can always go through something once but if its chain watch it so the whole of dianetic auditing is the tracing of experience there are thousands of things i could tell you about this there are tons of phenomena we probably know more phenomena about dianetic auditing than any other single activity and the funny part of it is all you really need to knowwell im giving you data in this lecture which is highly explicit and which is very useful to you but its all containedpretty well contained in hcob 3 april 1966 now if you had this lecture too of course now theres power in this stuff and you can become drug addict on dianetic auditing very easily because it is very very very interesting stuff its the root material of life i probably from time to time will remember little bits and pieces and give you some more i just thought of one just now thats handy thing to know if you get some lifetime in restimulation run the engram of the death and itll disappear the life will desensitize you get the guy stuck in lifetime as sewer cleaner in paris or something like that and its such degraded life when he at first was telling you he was joan of arc during that period he isnt necessarily wrong about this dont you see but he actually was jumping to an earlier life and getting it beautifully confused so that he wouldnt have to face the degradation of that life its the lives that almost make it are the bad onesyou know the lives that almost make itor the lives which are just so degraded the guy cant imagine himself as that kind of being and thatll upset him it isnt really the successful lives people will run julius caesar with the greatest of case but they wouldnt like to run cassius people who run julius caesar were probably something horrible during his lifetime you see theyre just like the guy flying around in the incident and he is the headsman hes the headmans ax hes the block hes the executioner hes himself hes the executed person now you have lot of fun running stuff like this you can find out lot about track pcs have an awful lot of cognitions and you may hit some lower levels of release but itd be release by chain youre not going to get release from the whole experiential track thats not possible but you might get free needle on automobile accidents and if you do pull out man but then dont stop running engrams find some other type of engram there isi can assure you that youre not going to get total bank release because those total releases are up there at 0 1 2 3 4 5 you see and theyre all above this youre going to get negative releases releases on the negative lines the minus scale which you have on your first gradation chart and which should have been repeated on the next one and shouldwill be repeated again because theyre quite final do you know that you can assessapparently assess the minus levels and sometimes produce release just by assessing themwhere the guy is stuck atbut dont keep on assessing after you see free needle but herehere is practice auditingpractice auditing now somebody will tell you that its very very bad to fool about with the mindvery bad to fool about with the mind but in actual fact any dianetic auditing is better than dianetic auditing you see that remark was true about dianetics weve moved up into such powerhouse auditing today in scientology and so forth that you can perhaps knock guy around with auditing but not with dianetic auditing the guy will struggle out of session and so forth now we used to tell people to come up to present time and in view of the fact thatll also put him at the beginning of track theres particular reason to tell him that so the thing for you to do if your pc is very groggy after dianetic session why just get him to look around the room get him to name two or three objects in the room and it actually will orient him in pt now try for light secondaries when you first go into this sort of thing well thatsfar as thats concerned try for what will really be light locks try for little bit more in the way of secondaries actually if you just kept auditing secondaries youd eventually fall into engrams because its very funny the engram lying there and the secondary is visual i mean he canhe can run the secondary but the engram is too much for him to confront so we cant run that but the reason for the secondary is the engram you say why is the fellow sad at the departure of his wife the fellow is sad at the departure of his wife if he is way over exaggeratedly sad and she wasnt very good cook you cant see how this is going to ruin his next hundred years dont you see but hes all set to have this ruin his next hundred years why is that well its setting on an engram it may be sitting on an engram and maybe he was wife in the life before and got shot see something like that theres pain and unconsciousness associated with similar contextual incident now he gets this terrible grief heavy grief type incident and he doesnt know what to make out of this this has great value by the way auditing of secondaries theres lot of tricks associated with this it takes long time to audit these things sometimes but theres lot of gimmickry associated with dianetic auditing that you dont really have to particularly know you sort of fall into it you start developing it you start recognizing it and so forth because its very obvious but i could take ten or fifteen years off the appearance of any widow by simply running her husbands death its fantastic you wouldnt believe the change that would occur there are certain things that you can do that produce remarkable and fantastic changes in being there are certain things that you can alleviate but i give you this warning if you start using dianetic auditing to cure up somebodys lumbosishes got lumbosis so youre going to run the engram that causes lumbosis and that is now going to cure his lumbosisforget it every so often you will cure his lumbosis every so often youll have win thats the wrong way to go about it because youre validating down statistic youre giving him this attention because hes got lumbosis and he tends to deteriorate as being you want to use this just as you use any other kind of auditing you should use it just to improve the beingjust improve the being youre auditing thetan you are not auditing lumbosis now youre not medical doctorsthank godnot psychiatrists heaven forbid you are people who can make beings totally recover you have the technology of total recovery of being and that doesnt mean body and that is so fundamental truth that as long as you use any auditing just to make the being better there you are all youre trying to do is improve the guys confront thats all this guy wants to be audited because hes got medicosisdeadly illness and he wants you to cure his medicosis i dont think id take that pc on i really dont think id audit him id much rather audit his sister who wants to dance better because this guy is down the line in sort of cavein dont you see hes going to be rough hes going to be this that and the other thing he justmmmmentirely different emotional frame now hed be very anxious and hes already told you he had hidden standard hes sayingwhen he says cure my medicosishes saying in essence that if you can have an effect upon my medicosis why then i will believe in scientology and you say isnt that sweet of you theres an ant over there and you know i just dont care whether he believes about scientology or not in fact i dont think itll change any part of human history whether that ant believes in scientology or not now if you know somebody who thinks he can be better ill happily audit him but im afraid i would be that nasty ive had enough hidden standards man because let tell you his medicosis probably wont alleviate until hes about grade v and hes asking to do it with two seconds at grade 0 but hes so stuck on hidden standard that he wouldnt even care that his communication was better hes just all wrapped up in problems like mad and so on well theres ways to handle this person theres ways and means to handle this person but not as practice case in dianetic auditing this is fun why get serious about it now you yourself as an auditor should know how to run an engram you should know how to run secondary because you yourself in your early career very often burn your finger cut your hand and you can run it out its very remarkable you can make burns go down and you can do all sorts of magical things with yourself i wouldnt advise you to do it for some little kid just because hes burned id give him touch assist or something like that but its very interesting anybody ought to have this experience but dont burn yourself just so that you can have the experience to watch blistered finger go down as you steadily steadily steadily on run the incident out of having burned it its quite interesting every once in while in auditing somebody with these youll get an awful winand the lastlast thing i want to question you aboutone thing i want to warn you about very very muchis please dont get stuck in those wins theres value to this auditing there is greater value to this auditing than man ever before had this solves the problems that sigmund freud was trying to solve it solves them with spectacularity man and compared to scientology its nothing dont go getting stuck in win have wins by all means but dont get stuck in them and suddenly say you know rons really got something there you can cure people with this hey woof look at that guy had withered arm i ran three engrams his arm grew the normal size good god this is for you go out and collect whole bunch of withered arms and thats it the danger of dianetic auditing is it wins the road out is the road you have up through the grades and it took all this knowledge of dianetic auditing it took all the material it took all the odd observations it took all those years of work to carve that very thin and now rather ordinarylooking path that works too fast up through the grades dianetic auditing was very useful with which to learn the fundamentals about the mind and thats what i want you to use it for you will all of sudden be rather interested to learn about these recorded incidents and you will become very familiar with this thing called the human mind as you use this in auditing and you yourself will get very interesting insight into such things as history customs and habits of bygone races you have lots of fun you get practice in handling pcs and you might make some minusgrade releases you wont even make grade 0 dont expect to but this isthis is great traininggreat training if you were to go out and hang up shingle with this youd get enough wins youd get probably 50 60 percent wins so what youre rewarding down statistic the guy got sick so were auditing him thats probably whats wrong with him in the first place he wants attention and if you go bog yourself down at this stage of development of scientology with handling all the sick and the insane of this planet you will never get anyplace there are all kinds of people who arent now somewhere up the line in century or millennia or something like that somewhere up the line the registrars are going to run out of auditors and pcs by that time everybody will either be very adept or very disinterested but wait for such time as when an organization to function must have such pcs thenthen get into it then get into it youre not strong enough stable enough or anything else to suddenly take on all the woes of the world simultaneously i can confront them but thats reason i have to audit them you could just bog yourself down right there ive seen more auditors ruin their careers by making career out of one psychotic think of all the able people that could have been made more able while one psychotic was giving an auditor total failure because the reason he was totally psychotic was probably his environment and he wasnt even removed from his environment to audit him and he gets up two feet and gets knocked back three i remember one girl in new york city thatthey kept auditing her and auditing her auditing hen and theyd get her up to anger and shed blow the household or something like this shed get out of there and theyd promptly blame the auditor because the girl was now angry and go back and put her into apathy and get the auditor to audit her again and he would audit her upor she would audit her up to point where this girl was in anger and then the family would blow up because the person now couldnt be lived with and so theyd knock the person back into apathy again and this went on and on and on and what an awful waste of time do you see so dianetic auditing is not for the psychotic the neurotic or the sick in spite of the fact that it probably could handle the psychotic the neurotic and the sick it is done in this wise for your practice youll haveyoull be able to arc break people and have other people come along and help the arc break out and you will learn all the things you arent supposed to do and your comm cycle will get smooth youll become very familiar with the mind and that is why it is being given to you at this particular time i have never seen anything really more interesting in the realm of human endeavor and activities than dianetic auditing it is the champion of all time tremendous amount of fun it does fantastic things so there it is and i hope youll have some fun with it thank you
