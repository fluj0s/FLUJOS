generally prohibited under several federal and state statutes crimin alizing acts such as assault battery and murder the applicability and scope of these statutes were the subject of widelyreported memorandum s by the department of defense and department of justice in 2002 in late 2004 the depar tment of justice released memorandum superseding its earlier memo and m odifying some of its conclusions assuming for the purposes of discussion th at us body had to review harsh interrogation method to determine whethe r it constituted torture under either cat or applicable us law it might examine international jurisprudence as to whether certain interrogation methods constituted torture although these decisions are not binding precedent for the united states they may inform

1988 s treaty doc 10020 reprinted in 13857 us cong serial set at 3 1990 hereinafter state dept summary emphasis added 5 id at 4 presumably police brutality of extreme severity could rise to the level of torture 6 cat at art 162any act by which severe pain or suffe ring whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on person for ch purposes as obtaining from him or third person information or confession punishing him for an act he or third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating or coercing him or third person or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflic ted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of public official or other person acting in an official capacity it does not include pain or suffering arising only from inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions importantly this definition specifies th at both physical and mental suffering can constitute torture and that for such suffering to constitute torture it must be purposefully inflicted further acts of torture covered under the convention must be committed by someone acting under the colo r of law thus for example if private individual causes intense suffering to another absent the instigation consent or acquiescence of public official such action does not constitute torture for purposes of cat the conventions definition of tor ture does not include all acts of mistreatment causing mental or physical suffe ring but only those of severe nature according to the state departments sectionbysection analysis of cat included in president reagans transmittal of the conve ntion to the senate for its advice and consent the conventions definition of tort ure was intended to be interpreted in relatively limited fashion corresponding to the common understanding of torture as an extreme practice which is universally condemned4 for example the state department suggested that rough treatme nt falling into the category of police brutality while deplorable does not amount to torture for purposes of the convention which is usually reserved fo r extreme deliberate and unusually cruel practices such as sustained systematic beating application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain5 this understanding of torture as vere form of mistr eatment is further made clear by cat article 16 which obligates convention pa rties to prevent in any territory under their juri sdiction other acts of crue l inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to acts of torture6 thereby indicating that not all forms of inhuman treatment constitute torture in general convention pa rties are obligated to ta ke effective legislative administrative judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32438crs3 7 cat at art 21 8 for more detailed overview of cat article 3 and us

for believing that he would be in dang er of being subjected to torture8 cat requirements concerning the criminalization of torture central objective of cat was to crimin alize all instances of torture cat article 4 requires states to ensure that all acts of torture are criminal offenses subject to appropriate penalties given their grave nature state parties are also required to apply similar criminal pe nalties to attempts to commit and co mplicity or pa rticipation in torture9 accordingly it appears that even though cat requires states to take effective measures to preven t torture only within their territorial jurisdiction this does not mean that states are therefore permitted to engage in torture in territories not under their jurisdiction although state mig ht not be required to take proactive measures to prevent acts of torture beyond its territorial jurisd iction it nevertheless has an obligation to criminalize such extraterritorial acts and impose appropriate penalties cat article 5 establishes minimum jurisdictional measures that each state party must take with respect to offenses described in cat ar ticle 4 pursuant to cat article 5 state party must establish jurisdiction over cat article 4 offenses when 1 the offenses are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board ship or aircraft regi stered in that state 2 the alleged offender is national of that state 3 the victim was national of that state if that state considers it appropriate and 4 the alleged offender is present in an territory under its jurisdiction and the state does not extradite him in acco rdance with cat article 8 which makes torture an extraditable offense cats prohibition of torture is ab solute exceptional circumstances whatsoever whether state of war or threat or war internal political instability or any other public emergency may be i nvoked as justification of torture10 according to the state department this blanket prohibition was viewed by the drafters of cat as necessary if the conve ntion is to have significant effect as public emergencies are commonly invoked as source of extraordinary powers or as justification for limiting fundame ntal rights and freedoms11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32438crs4 12 id at 1314 13 id at 15 the state department noted fo r instance that the european commission on human rights once concluded that the refusal of german authorities to give formal recognition to an individuals sex change might constitute degrading treatment 14 cat at arts 1718 15 id at art 191 according the united na tions

of torture cat article 14 provides that signatory states must ensure that their legal systems provide victims of torture or their dependents in cases where the victim has died as result of torture with the ability to obtain civil redress in the form of fair and adequate compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible according to the state depa rtment article 14 wa s adopted with an express reference to this treaty obligation extending only to the victim of an act of torture committed in any territory under signatory states jurisdiction but this limiting clause was deleted by mistake12 cat requirements prohibiting cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat article 16 requires signatory states to take preventative measures to prevent cruel inhuman or degrading trea tment or punishment within any territory under their jurisdiction when such acts ar committed under the color of law cat does not define these terms and the state department suggested that the requirements of article 16 concerning degrading treatment or punishment potentially include treatment that would probably not be prohibited by the us constitution13 unlike in the case of torture however cat does not expressly require states to criminalize acts of cr uel inhuman or grading treatment or punishment that occur within or out side their territorial jurisdiction cat

or negligence involving blameworthy inadvertence59 two memorandums produced by the partment of defense and the department of justice in 2002 discussed the distinction between general and specific intent with respect to 2340a and suggested that knowledge alone that particular result is certain to occur does not constitute specific intent60 however both memorandums made clear that this is th

earlier memo and modifying some of its conclusions63 the 2004 doj memo stated that in light of the presidents directive that the united stat not engage in torture it would not be appropriate to rely on parsing the specific in tent element of the statute to approve as lawful conduct that might otherwise amount to torture64 nevertheless the 2004 doj memo alleged that it was unlikely th at person who acted in good faith and only after reasonable investigation establishing that his conduct would not inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering would possess the specific intent required to violate the federal torture statute65 the 2004 doj memo also distinguished intent to commit an offense from the motive behind committing an offense stating that defendants motive to protect national s ecurity for example is not relevant to the question whether he has acted with the requisite specific intent under the statute66 although 2340a provides the united states with wide jurisdictional grant to prosecute acts of torture it does not appear that this authority has ever been used legal search by crs did not reveal any cases in which the doj has relied on 2340a to

congress did not adopt impleme nting legislation with respect to cat article 16 which re quires each cat party to prohibit cruel inhuman and degrading tr eatment or punishment in any territory under its jurisdiction there has recently been deba over whether congre sss failure to pass legislation implementing cat article 16 was due to an oversight or whether congress believed that the united states ag reed to bind itself to cat article 16 only to the extent that it was already requi red to refrain from cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or puni shment under the us constitution and any existing statutes covering such offenses as previously mentioned the senate made its advice and consent to cat ratification contingent upon the reservation that the cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment prohibited by cat 16 covered only those forms of treatment or punishment prohibited under the us constitution given this understanding us obligations under article 16 can be interpreted in one of two ways one way is to interpret the united states as having agreed to bind itself to cat article 16 only to the extent that cr uel inhuman or grading treatment is

jurisdiction and 2 does not impose any new obligations upon th us beyond those already required under the us constitution it has also argued that the constitution does not cover noncitizens held

the constitution71 noncitizens arguably only receive cons titutional protections after they have effected entry into the united states72 under this interpretation cat article 16 as agreed to by the united stat would not necessarily prohibit the us from subjecting certain nonus citizen s to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment at locations outside us terr itorial boundaries where the us nonetheless assert s territorial jurisdiction eg on the premises of us missions in foreign states the doj has taken this position in arguing that cat article 16 as agreed to by the united

degrading treatment or punishment in an territory under its jurisdicti on if such treatment would be deemed unconstitutional if it occurred in the united states this view holds that the purpose of the

circumstances involving national security pursuant to his constitutional authority as commander in chief78 however similar signing statement was made when the president signed the mc even though it

controversy regarding the application of cat by the united states towards pers ons captured in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere in the context of the war on terror and how that application relates to the standards owed under the 1949 geneva conve ntions concerning the protections of civilians and prisoners of war during armed conflicts the rule of lex specialis provides that when two different legal standards may be applied to the same subjectmatter the more specific standard controls85 accordingly the geneva conventions which proscribe specific rule s for the treatment of detainees during armed conflicts establish the primary legal duties owed by the united states toward battlefield detainees rather than cat which is more general in scope there is some debate whether the rule of lex specialis means that the laws of war are the singular international standard governing the treatment of persons during armed conflict or whether human rights treaties such as cat may impose complementary duties86 the current position of the us executive branch appears to be that cat does not apply to armed conflicts in 2006 hearing before the committee against torture representatives of the us state department argued that cat did not apply to detainee operations in afghanistan iraq and guantÃ¡namo which were controlled by th laws of armed conflict87 in support of this position the us argued that cats negotiating hist ory revealed an understanding by the negotiating parties that the treaty was intended to cover domestic obligations owed by parties and was not meant to overlap with different treaties governing the standards owed in armed conflicts88 the committee against torture disagreed with this view and recommended that the united states should recognize and ensure that the convention applies at all times whether in peace war or armed conflict in any territory under its jurisdiction89 regardless of whether cat itself applies during armed conflicts certain legislation enacted by the united states to implement cat re quirements does as mentioned previously the federal torture statute criminalizes torture anywhere outside the united states without regard to whether

periods of some hours in stress position descri bed by those who underwent it as being spreadeagled against the wall with their fingers put high above the head against the wall the legs spread apart and the feet back causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers hooding putting black or navy coloured bag over the detaineesheads and at least initially

circumstances permit state parties to engage in torture108 accordingly the committee recommended that israel immedi ately cease its use of the interrogation tactics desc ribed above109 the committee is an advisory body and its rulings are not binding however in 1999 the israeli supreme court sitting as the israeli high court of justice concluded that the interrogation techniques evaluated by the committee were contrary to israeli law and prohibited their usage except in cases when special permission was granted permitting their usage against detainees believed to possess information about an imminent attack110 in doing so however the high court did not expressly determine whether such actions constituted torture according to the state department israel is reported to have used such techniques at least 90 times since the israeli high courts ruling111 for its part the state partment reported in 2000 that israeli security forces abused and in some cases tortured palestinians suspected of security offenses112 more recently the state department has described israels interrogation tactics as degrading treatme nt but noted that human rights groups claim that torture is being employed113
