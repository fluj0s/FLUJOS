encouragement from the hoover administra tion congress adopted the davisbacon act now 40 usc 31413148 the act as amended requires that workers employed on public buildings and public work s of the federal gove rnment and of the district of columbia must be paid at least the locally prevailing wage as determined by the secretary of labor initially the act applied to construction in excess of 5000 but in 1935 the act was amended to re nder its terms applicable to projects of 2000 and above with the passage of time the act was added to ries of individual public works statutes perhaps more than fift depending upon ones count as each of these statutes came up for renewed fundi ng the davisbacon provision became subject of dispute and by the 1960s such disputes becam both numerous and contentious some have suggested that the act having long outlived its depression era origins should be repeale d others have argued that th act is as important today as it was in the 1930s and that it should be applied more gene rally and routinely through the past decades application of davisbacon to the clean water act state revolving funds has posed serious problem and with other concerns has

of those found under davisbacon to be prevailing in the locality for construction work 2 robert bacon had engaged in banking in ne w york prior to his election to the house of representatives in 1922 james davis had served as secretary of labor in the cabinets of presidents harding coolidge and hoover prior to his election to the senate in 1930the davisbacon act issues and legislation during the 110th congress the davisbacon act of 1931 as amende d requires that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to wo rkers employed under federal construction contracts1 it also affects manpower utilization on such projects for example the employment of helpers or unskilled and semiskilled general utility workers with respect to the implementation of the act congress has assigned wide administrative responsibility to the secretary of labor but legislative oversight has been more or less continuous at least since the 1950s through the years davisbacon provisions have been written into numerous program statutes application of the act to these and to new legislative programs has continued to spark congressional interest some urge that the prevailing wage statute is as important now as in the 1930s others contend that the requirement should be set aside in order to stretch construction dollars by permitting payment of less than prevailing rates frequently davisbacon or the prevailing rate question has been contested within the context of program statutes in which wages were not the central focus of debate but that were nonetheless of cons iderable importance to employers to workers and to the communities in which they operate this report is essentially tracking document it traces the most recent interests by congress in the davisbacon act and ggests the concerns that have been and are being voiced with respect to the act introducing the davisbacon act in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration congress enacted prevailing wage legislation for federal c ontract construction the legislation was cosponsored by representative robert b acon and senator james davis thus the davisbacon act2 the act was significantly amended in 1935 and its scope broadened in 1964 the definition of prev ailing wage was expanded to include ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs2 3 for quick historical overview of the act see crs report 94408 the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy by william g whittaker 4 some employers it was alleged had paid the prevailing wage to their workers but then demanded rebates or kickbacks to end this practice congress passed the copeland anti kickback act in 1934 pl 73324 reports filed under the copeland act put employers on record though not part of the davisbacon act it operates in tandem with that statute and in policy terms is usually part of the davisbacon debate 5 there does not appear to be any systematic analysis of the gap if any between the floor provided by the davisbacon act and the wages actually paid to construction workers on covered projectsfringe benefits component otherwise th act remains essentially in its 1935 form3 although there have been intermittent effort s to repeal the davisbacon act and the related copeland antikickback act 19344 such initiatives have been consistently rejected by congress the structure and cont ext of davisbacon the davisbacon act requires that fe deral and some fe derally assisted construction contracts specify the minimum wage rates to be paid to the various categories of laborers workin g under those contracts minimum wages are defined as those rates of pay found by the secretary of labor to be prevailing b in the locality of the project c for similar crafts and skills d on comparable construction work the concept of locality is usually but not nece ssarily always county or metropolitan area normally construction work is divided into four categories residential nonresidential buildings highway and heavy construction the act does not require that collectively bargained union wages be paid unless such wages happen to be prevailing in the locality where the work takes place further the prevailing rate for davisbacon purposes represents floor it is not necessarily the rate that construction firm may have to pay in order to recruit and to retain qualified workers5 typically the department of labor dol conducts two types of wage rate determinations general ar ea determinations and wher necessary specific project determinations dol sometimes collects data through direct survey process more often it works from data provi ded by contractors trade unions and other interested parties it may use both methods jointly the act requires that the advertised specifications for every construction contract in excess of 2000 to which the ited states or the district of columbia is party must specify the wage that the secretary of labor determines to be prevailing in the locality for the various classes of laborers and mechanics employed on the covered work speak ing generally dol does not recognize unskilled or semiskilled helpers as class of workers for wage rate determination purposes rather it evaluates workers by craft thus employers may be discouraged from employing helpers on da visbacon projects turning to more skilled craftspersons instead dol does however recognize apprentices andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs3 6 with the fitzgerald act in 1937 29 usc 50 ff the federal government assumed an oversight role with respect to apprentice trai ning workers enrolled in programs recognized by the dol or by cooperating state progra ms receive specified training which when complete results in credential certifying the competence of the graduate journeyman the credential is portable ie recognized th roughout the country such programs are usually funded jointly by the employer and the apprentice through temporarily reduced wage and often by contribution from the trade union in the craft 7 the davisbacon act applies only to federal contract construction other enactments apply to government purchases of goods and servic the walshhealey public contracts act

or repair of public buildings and public works including pain ting and decorating where the contract is in excess of 2000 further davisb acon provisions have been written into numerous federal program statutes some states have enacted little davisbacon acts these state statutes however normally differ from each other and from the federal davisbacon act7 the purpose of the act in the 1920s the federal government undertook major program of public works as the nation moved into depr ession after 1929 this program had important implications for the areas where the work was to be performed given the depth of the economic downturn and the scope of unemployment any opportunity for work was attractive both to workers and to struggling firms federal construction contr acts were normally awarded to the lowest responsible bidder but treatment of workers and paym ent of fair wages were not taken into account as result certain itinerant cont ractors employing workers imported from lowwage parts of the country were able or believed to be able to underbid local contractors in this way it was alleged flybynight operators would win contracts based upon the payment of substandard wa ges to workers desperate for employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs4 8 during the late 1920s and early 1930s the contracting community appears to have been concerned with quality controls ethical

in the state monthly labor review august 1961 pp 839845 the prevailing wage requirement does not preclude award of contracts to outside contractors rather the philosophy of the act is to ensure that local labor standards will not be undercut 10 proclamations and executive orders herbert hoover march 4 1929 to march 4 1933 washington gpo 1974 vol ii pp 10661067 11 these reform initiatives are

sometimes lacking appropr iate skills and then pr oduce an inferior quality of construction thus the positive rehabilita tive economic impact of public building and public works projects for the various localities was reduced to the disadvantage both of local contractors and local workers alike8 the original davisbacon act it would seem was as much protection for fa ir contractors as for workers it was viewed as model for private sector em ployers with respect to labor standards in drafting the davisbacon act cong ress was not searching for the cheapest available labor for federal construction work rather it prescribed payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage in order in part to protect fair local contractors and workers engaged in local markets from contractors and lowwage crews from outside the area of construction work however supporters of davisbacon have contended that there is ssential conflict between the purposes of the statute and securing bargain for the public agency consumer the taxpayer9 continuing process in 1931 the davisbacon legislation was regarded as an emergency measure that sparked little controversy from the h earings and debates of that period it seems clear that congress anticipated none of th administrative problems that would ensue but almost immediately restructuring of the act commenced in early 1932 president hoover moved to strengthen administration of the statute through executive order 577810 although congress proceeded with oversight and ultimately adopt ed reforms its reform initiative was vetoed by the president11 the copeland antikickback act 1934 helped ensure that rates would be paid without improper deductions in 1935 congress adopted major changes to the statute reducing the coverage th reshold from contracts of at least 5000 to those in excess of 2000 b extending coverage from public buildings to include construction alterati on andor repair including pa inting and decorating of public buildings or public works and c requiring that the locally prevailing wage rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs5 12 reduction of the coverage threshold appears to have been motivated by at least two considerations first contracts for painting and decora ting were often too small to come under the 5000 figure second it appears that some contractors artfully divided work into small parcels in order to avoid davisbacon coverage reducing the threshold to 2000 was viewed as means through which to extend coveragebe predetermined prior to solicitation of bids and that they be written into bid solicitations12 the debate over davisbacon by the 1950s congress had begun to dd davisbacon provisions to various program statutes in which federal funding made the work possible but such extensions of coverage which would i nvolve new and different types of contract work and new body of contractors seem to have sparked increased uneasiness with the act through the years arguments for and ag ainst davisbacon have become largely fixed as have counter argume nts of defenders and critics in the evolving debate few contentions about the act have gone r are likely to go unchallenged on both sides there are assertions that dvocates tend to accept without question current policy debate has focused upon whether to attempt to strengthen or diminish the davisbacon impact or to repeal the statute outright outlined below are some of the arguments advanced by critics and by defenders of davisbacon expressed in summary as each side in the ongoing debate might state them in policy terms the division of opinion seems to be in some measure philosophical reflecting basic attitudes toward labormanagement relations rather than division along partisan political lines perspectives of davisbacon critics some critics of davisbacon argue that the act is inflationary that it unnecessarily raises the cost of construction that it is difficult to administer and that it hampers competition especially advo cates assert with respect to small businesses that may be unfamiliar with federal contracting procedures and lack the staff to deal with the requirements such pr ocedures impose they contend that the act impedes efficient manpower utilization limiting the use of hel pers or general utility workers some argue were davisbacon restrictions absent that contractors would be able to restructure the work to be performed dividing tasks into less complex assignments in order to make practical the employment of workers who may be less skilled and who are also less expensive to employ the result they argue would be increased efficiency nd they suggest this would likely open more employment opportunities to lowskilled wo rkers allowing them to gain work experience and onthejob training while at the same time reducing the costs of public constructionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs6 13 the davisbacon prevailing rate is floor not necessarily the rate that employers will actually have to pay dol suggests that uni on rates are used only where they are found to be prevailing in locality 14 conversely some argue that in the fully pr ivate sector there is significant amount of quality construction work that is perfo rmed without davisbacon protection 15 both critics and supporters of davisbacon have tended to make arguments that involve women and minorities or small business people perhaps less because they would be directly impacted than that th ey have become sympathetic participantsbesides critics note the davisb acon act 1931 1935 was adopted before there were federal minimum wage standards with the general minimum wage floor established under the fair bor standards act 1938 they suggest the davisbacon act is longer needed that is super minimum wage for federal construction work is both unnecessary and inequitable they assert that labor costs for federal construction could be reduced with savings for the taxpayer if actual local market wages were paid rather than administratively determined locally prevailing wages which some argue ma often be union rates13 in addition they urge simplification of the copeland acts reporting requirements perspectives of davisbacon supporters supporters of davisbac on often contend that the act prevents cutthroat competition from flybynight firms that would undercut local wages and working conditions and compete unfairly with local contractors they suggest that the act helps stabilize the local construction i ndustry an advantage to workers and employers alike the act they suggest may tend to assure the contracting agency of higher quality work since employers required to pay at least the locally prevailing wage are likely to hire more competent and productive workers resulting in better workmanship less waste reduced need fo r supervision and fe wer mistakes requiring corrective action14 this may lead to fewer cost overruns and more timely completion of public constr uction and in the longter m lower rehabilitation and repair needs thus some argue the davisbacon act could actually save the taxpayer money on public construction supporters of the act also argue that davisbacon deters contractors from fragmenting construction tasks in order to utilize lowwage and lowskill helpers or pickup crews some argue that wit hout davisbacon and in the absence of collective bargaining agreement contract ors would probably be unlikely to provide training beyond the necessary and narrow requirements of the job and would not likely enter into formal program such as those monitored by dols bureau of apprenticeship and training reducing or eliminating apprenticeship programs in the construction industry might work to th disadvantage of those younger workers who are creating careers for themselves in the building trades in addition some assert that if helpers are substituted for skilled craft workers it would likely be those same apprentices ones young and lack ing experience in the crafts who could expect to be laid off or forced into lowe rwage jobs that did not train them in all around skills needed by journeymen in their chosen fields15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs7 16 see also crs report 94908 davisbacon the act and the literature by william g whittakerwhat do we really know about the impact of the davisbacon act perhaps the most frequently asked questi on concerning the davisbacon act is how much money could be sa ved if davisbacon were repealed or modified to narrow its scope the short answer is probably one really knows conversely does davisbac on save money for the fe deral government in its purchases of construction for example employment of more highly skilled workers on davisbacon projects here agai n response may also be uncertain davisbacon literature is ex tensive and diverse much of it in the form of public materials ie agency reports and analyses journalists have taken continuing interest in the act resulting in substantial popular literature serious academic studies may be fewer it is extremely di fficult for an independent scholar to review the administration of the act to assess its impact first there is the scope of the task vast numbers of pr ojects scattered throughout th united states administered by different agencies nd invol ving hundreds of contractors and subcontractors working under dissimilar circumstances and in diverse labor markets second there is the problem of the availability of doc umentation since the contractors involved are of the private sector how much usef ul information has been preserved third access presents problem assuming th at the data and documents have been preserved and could be made available securing such documentation and access to administrative personnel may be problematic both from the private sector contractors workers and unions nd from the various public agencies if one assumes that documentation exists access is allowed that all of the parties are cooperative and that the means financial nd other are available for such an undertaking there remains fourth and perhaps most difficult complication the analyst would be comparing something that did happen with something that in fact for whatever reasons did not happen payroll records labormanagement relationships availability of skilled workers quality of supervision internal agency memoranda etc all relate to an actual pr oject and not to what might have happened under other circumstances in the absence of davisbacon require ment would the contract have gone to the same contractor if so or if not w ould the contract have been managed in the same way did the act have any imp act upon the wages actually paid or upon workforce utilization without davisb acon would different workers have been employed the work of governmental researcher may be further complicated by political or public po licy considerations16 for all of these reasons there appear to be significant gaps in our knowledge of the act and of its administration despite oversight by congress extensive study by public and private agencies and the work of individual scholars further few studieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs8 17 distinction needs to be made between labor costs and project costs higher labor costs could result in lower project costs if more efficient and more skilled workers are employed but as practical matter to what extent are actual project costs governed by the requirements of the davisbacon act might they reflect the manner of federal agency oversight and monitoring of the progress of the work is federal construction work supervised as closely as that of the private sector what might be the impact of other federal requirements style of constructionarch itecture especially for ceremonial buildings is cost impacted by various set asides for sheltered contractors small and minority business and the like for an example of the problems

which applies the act broadly to treatment construction was retained it requires that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on treatment works for which grants are made

requirement for the construction of treatment works the committee continues its longstanding practice of ensuring the application of davisbacon where federal funds are provided for construction it added for the cl ean water srfs the most significant source of revenue in the state revolving funds is the federal capitalization grant as congress has done in 63 sepa rate instances for federa llyfunded construction the davisbacon act should apply to the reaut horization of the clean water srfs the committee went on to discuss the diffe rent reasons for support of the davis bacon act to attract more experienced and better trained workers workers who are often more productive than workers w ith less training and experience that davisbacon work results often in the co mpletion of construction projects ahead of schedule reducing the overall cost of the project and offsetting any increased costs due to higher hourly wage rates23 conversely representative john mica toge ther with several others expressed opposition to the davisbacon provisions re presentative mica stated that the bill represents an important step forward for clean water but it also takes significant step backwards by mandating and expandi ng upon the past application of davis bacon act prevailing wage requirements in the srf pr ogram davisbacon he stated would add to the cost of public construction and ve disproportionate impact on small rural and disadvantaged communities which can least afford to pay the higher cost of projects he stated that the act was discriminatory in that few small and minorityowned firms can afford to pay the higher wages that the davisbacon act requires as result he observed they are rarely awarded davisbacon contracts and many of them stop applying for those contracts he concluded there is precedent here fo r applying the davisbacon act to state funds24 the bill considered in the house on march 9 the water quality financing act of 2007 was calle d up for debate in the house davisbacon was major part of the bate that followed in discussion of the rule hres 229 representative pete sessions raised the issue of davisbacon coverage he stated the democrat

would apply these same provisions davisbacon regulations to all nonfederal funds such as loan re payments state bond revenues interest and statematching funds sessions objected to this depression era

davisbacon provisions he stated is difficult and cumbersome task28 speaking against the bakerking amendment was the chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure james oberstar who noted the difference between union wage and prevailing wage this davis bacon provision is prevailing wage not union wage oberstar added it is the prevailing local wage29 although the clean wate r act

dont know how the majority defines the words significantly expand but by my count this bill contains at least seven separate instances in which the davisbacon wage mandates are imposed simply put this bill furthers the majoritys aggressive application of davis bacon wage mandates davis bacon wages can inflate project costs by as much as 15 percent costs that get passed on to taxpayers they also force private companies to do hundreds of millions of dollars of excessive administrative work each year squandering resources that would be better spent creating jobs and spurring innovation and

wage homeland security price stated has interpreted the application of davisbac on far too narrowly has applied the act only to stafford act85 grant programs and to virtually other dhs programs price continued our belief is simply that there is good reason for denying prevailing wage protection to jobs involved in these activitie s he noted the presidential emergency option that would apply in

his figures were low average he stated that the statute is not effective that it cannot keep up with change in the wage scale and according to the inspector general of dol that nearly 100 percent of the davisbacon data cannot be relied upon94 kings comments triggered response from representative david scott who stated the gentleman from iowa very cl everly used the words union scale this is not union scale this is prevailing wage scale scott continued now this amendment is very timely here we are in the throes of recession one of the most damaging economic crises that this nation has faced in the last quarter of century and we have the gentleman from iowa wanting to put on an amendment that would diametrically affe ct the living wages of the people who need the help the most now by preventing workers on hope vi projects from earning living wage is certainly not the right way to go scott closed with the affirmation the davisbacon prevailing wage helps attract the necessary skilled workforce to build housing in the most efficient and cost effective manner this he said of the king proposal is bad amendment95 meanwhile thanking scott for his comments representative george miller explained further this is about prevailing wages it is not about union wage miller added the fact of the matter is the majority in this house understands how important this provision is to working peopl in this country and to the communities in which these projects are being built in statement for the record miller summarized the king amendment uses taxpayer money to worsen the cycle of poverty in the poorest neighborhoods in the country it uses taxpayer money to buy shoddy work that just increases the costs ter on its difficult to tell who the amendment is trying to hurt the most the poor neighborhoods the workers or the taxpayers he concluded this amendment is outra geous and should be roundly defeated by the house96 not so remarked representative king he found millers remarks offensive to to say that my 28 years of mee ting payroll my 1400some consecutive weeks of making payroll of providing health insurance and retirement benefits and year around work for

continued however pursuant to current federal law and longstanding policy of the department of labor indian health servic and bureau of indian affairs when indian tribes and tribal organizations construct or renovate federallyfunded indian health facilities using their own employees davisbacon prevailing wage rates do not apply finally the report notes the intention of the committee is to maintain the status quo of current law and policy pursuant to th davisbacon act and the indian self determination and education assistance act in this regard100 the indian health care bill was multifaceted with the davisbacon provision being only one small part of the measure the dorgan bill s 1200 shortly after the pallone bill was introduced senator byron dorgan introduced companion bill also entitled the indian health care improvement act amendments the bill was referred to the committee on indian affairs of which dorgan was chair he noted that simila r legislation had been under consideration through the past several congre sses eight years is too long to wait he stated observing that he intends to move aggressively to s eek approval of this legislation101 provisions of the dorgan bill like the pallone bill the dorgan bill contained davisbacon provi sion subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 united states code commonly known as the d avisbacon act but with several caveats under which the davisbacon act w ould not apply in strictly orthodox manner first the construction or renovatio n may be performed by contractor pursuant to contract with an indian tribe or tribal organization with funds supplied through contract or compact authorized by the indian selfdetermination and education assistance act 25 usc 450 et q or other statutory authority second or it may be subject to prevailing wage rates for similar construction or renovation in the loca lity as determined by the indian tribes or tribal organizations to be served by the construction or renovationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs27 102 see s 1200 the indian health care improvement act as introduced on april 14 2007 pp 160161 103 it may not be clear just what the impact of the devolution of enforcement policy to the several hundred tribes or tribal organizati ons would be since these entities would be it seems largely independent and could it w ould appear operate under their own rules 104 bureau of national affairs daily labor report january 23 2008 p a9 for the omb document see httpwwwwhitehousegovomb legislativesap1102saps1200spdf as proposed part of the enforcement policy and procedures would be shifted from the secretary of labor to indian tribes or tribal organizations somewhat unclear definition since there could be several hundred such organizations with different standards for implementing the davisbacon actthird this subsection shall not appl to construction or renovation carried out by an indian tribe or trival organization with its own employees102 thus the dorgan bill would do three things first it reaffirms the existing davisbacon provision but changes the old citation 40 usc 276a to 276a5 to recodified citation subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 second it provides that jurisdiction over davisbacon rates formerly the exclusive preserve of the secretary of labor can be transferred to indian tribes or tribal organizations third it provides rather standard exception from the act that allows work performed by the employees of an indian tribe or trib organization inhouse staff to be unprotected in terms of davisbacon standards103 some policy implications initially it appears the administration may not have taken the new proposals seriously the pallone bill contained straightforward reiteration of davisbacon coverage the dorgan bill more complex proposal to allow indians or tribal organizations an opportunity to share in determining wage rates for davisbacon purposes if ther was opposition to the proposals it was not immediately apparent then under date of january 22 2008 th office of management and budget omb released statement critical of the expansion of davisbacon and suggesting if this provision is included in the final bill presented to the president his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill omb did not explain in what manner davisbacon would be expa nded because davisbacon was already part of the statute further under th dorgan proposal the department of labor could find its duties diminished in scope primarily because of the new tribal primacy with respect to the establishment of davisbacon rates104 on february 14 2006 colloquy occurred between senators edward kennedy lisa murkowski and dorgan the colloquy opened with senator kennedy mr kennedy i understand that in the managers amendment section 303b of the bill has been modified so that the language is now identical to current law is that correcthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs28 105 congressional record february 14 2008 pp s1040s1041 106 congressi onal record february 26 2008 p s1155 however the language was changed so that davisbacon doesnt appear references to transfer of

complete work on indian health care overhaul bill cq today february 25 2008 pp 10 and 12 mr dorgan yes the intent of the provision in the managers amendment to the bill is to maintain current law generally when indian health facilities are constructed or renovated davisbacon prevailing wage rates apply however pursuant to current federal law and long standing policy of the department of labor indian health service and bureau of indian affairs when indian tribes and tribal organizations construct or renovate federally funded indian health facilities using their own employees davisbacon prevailing wage rates do not apply our intention in the managers amendment is to maintain the status quo of current law and policy in these regards mr kennedy so this language does not change the construction or application of existing statutes mr dorgan correct it does not change current law it is our intent that the prevailing wage provisions in both the indian health care improvement act and the indian selfdetermination and education assistance act will continue to apply when federal funds are used for the construction and renovation of indian health facilities except where such work is carried out by tribal or tribal organization employees105 senator murkowski joined in the dialogue expressing the same sentiment that is that nothing in the statute had been changed merely recodified on february 26 2008 the indian health care bill was approved by the senate 83 yeas to 10 nays with the davis bacon provision remaining in the measure106 back to the house on february 28

have shown that where prevailing wages are not required contractors compete on the basis of labor costs frequently resulting in poor construction quality as well as substantial cost and time overruns due to cheaper workers lower levels of skill productivity and training where prevailing wages are paid higher rates of productivity safety and building quality more than offset the cost of higher wages the report continued davis bacon requirements help save federal state and local revenue further studies have found that repeal of local prevailing wage laws results in lower incomes loss of sales tax revenues and general loss of economic activity it concluded these are precisely the types of effects the committee intends to avoid by providing federal assistance to local communities

minimum new sy stem of wagerate calculation under the bureau of labor statistics within the department of labor in some cities the wage determinations are more than 75 percent above market wages in other cities they are just onet hird of market wages in some states davisbacon rates are actually below the minimum wage these wage determinations simply do not reflect prevailing market wages and

amendment strikes the requirements for the davisbacon act within the appropriations of this bill he continued by noting his experience with davisbacon both as recipient of davisbacon wages and as contractor through many years and noted the paperwork requirements under the act im maybe the only one in congress who has real handson experience of dealing with the additional costs that are involved with the federal wage scale thats davisbacon he explained that proj ects covered by davisbacon from his experience add anywhere from 8 percent increase in the cost of the projects up to 35 percent increase in the cost of the proj ects but he rounded the numbers off at 20 percent additional costs mr king stated that he supported fr ee market economy of labor being able to collectively

wage in practice its only prevailing wage by statute actually it is union scale representative king suggested some places its the davisbacon wage actually below the prevailing wage other pl aces it distorts that prevailing wage dramatically why he asked should we limit our resources by imposing such draconian topdown federal ma nagement tool that not only costs lot more money but it makes it lot lot harder to manage your projects129 the issue debated representative olver then rose to fend use of davisbacon requirements after noting that the act had been dopted by republican congress and republican administration about 75 year s ago representative olver affirmed without davisbacon the transporta tion construction industry which is responsible for building our highways and transit systems might suffer from lowbid firms that aim to undercut local wages and perform construction on the cheap davisbacon encourages higher quality of workmanship and we should not do away with the law for transportation c onstruction where we need the highest quality and the longest lasting workmanship with that mr olver urged rej ection of the king amendment130 in response representative king stated that he had worked on union shop and merit shop jobs both as an employer and as an employee he added i dont think we can apply high quality strictly to union and he continued in fact merit shop employees do fantastic job with the work that theyre doing and they take pride in it but it may not have been th wage rate that most disturbed mr king my greatest frustration with davisbacon wage scale is not the wage itself its that it takes away my ability to manage project and my ability to provide incentives for employees to make decisions themselves on the ground i have to manage them more when theyre under davisbacon wage scaleit distorts the work we do it distorts the skills and the complement of the skills and it raises the cost of everything that we do in the construction

are in desperate need for altern ative energy options we should not increase the price of making cellulosic ethanol and yet he stated in the ag bill there was clause that says if you are building an

wages and pr otected wages long before tafthartley before the wagner act this was put on the books in 1931 76 years ago then representative scott added davisbacon was put on the books by republican administration president hoover because at that time it was needed to have wage stabilization mr scott suggested that davisbacon was the cornerstone of the wage protection structure in this c ountry and noted davisbacon prevents underbidding of any contractor coming in on government contract low bidding and attempting to bring in contract and hire workers below the prevailing wage then looking to the precise amendm ent he stated that it was dealt with in the agriculture committee and soundly defeated at that time representative scott then went on to central issue in the ag bill we have dedicated 4 billion for loan guarantees to set up ethanol plants now mr chairman these are highly s ophisticated operations clearly we need the best talent the best skills he went on to discuss the

be wrong and quite honestly unamerican135 mr kingston reclaimed his time but was then joined by representative king of iowa prevailing wage by definition union scale in practice there is other way to analyze this union scale is what gets produced king stated when the department of labor produces the proposed prevailing wage mr king went on to the logistics of the new energy there was over billion dollars invested in renewable energy in my district last year there will be over billion dollars invested this year we are number one in biodiesel production in am erica of the 435 districts king affirmed there is way that any other district in the country has hope of catching up with the fifth congressional distri ct of iowa if you are going to impose davisbacon wage scales on this136 representative sam farr rose to challenge the critics of davisbacon mr farr noted that california has done more fo r cutting energy costs by doing energy conservation and renewable ergy and he stated very one of those facilities was built under davisbacon law he stated that the amendment was an effort to get at labor try to cut wages go to the lowest cost and representative farr added this is the wrong way to do it it is mean amendment and it should be defeated137 there may have been some measure of irony here if this was about free enterprise kingston responde d this clause would not be in

and manpower utilization through the past halfcentury the questi on of helpers has emerged as davis bacon issue sometimes in legislativ format on other occasions as an administrative matter it will likely continue to be raised as davisbacon remains matter before congress both as to the defi nition of helper and with respect to the use of helpers on davi sbacon covered projects dol efforts to change the helper requirement the davisbacon act makes mention of helpers nor does it refer to trainees apprentices or other skill groups rather it refers to various classes of laborers and mechanics and then leaves up to the secretary of labor the determination of just what those various classes might be and how they might be distinguished one from the other140 under davisbacon before bids are solicited the minimum locally prevailing wage rate is determined for each category of worker to be used on the project where helper category is not reco gnized in the locality of th projected construction craft or laborer rates have to be paid potentially but not necessarily increasing the labor cost of construction labor proponents maintain th at recognition of helper category could defeat the purposes of the act that is allowing contractors to fragment tasks so that lowskilled lowwage helpers could be employed some argue that such policy could result in downward wage spiral and that employment of helpers would undercut apprenticeship programs with generally deleterious impact upon skills transfer through the years helpers have been employed on davisbacon construction where their use was common in the area and where they are clearly distinguished from laborers or craft workers however their use appears to have been infrequent during the late 1970s the carter administr

regulations proposed by the former administration were withdraw n and their substance reconsidered new regulations proposed by the reagan administration may 1982 redefined the concept of helper and potentially expa nded their use change applauded by industry and objected to by the building trades unions142 litigation followed in order to circumvent objecti ons raised by the courts dol redrafted the helper regulations in january 1989 during the bu sh administration the courts acquiesced in dols judgment and cleared the regulations for implementation but at that juncture congress objected refusing to appropriate funds fo r implementation and enforcement of the new regulations this restraint continued into the middle 1990s by which time the agency was free to act then another impediment was raised dol under the clinton admin istration d eclined to move forward with the regulation in june 1996 the associated builders nd contractors brought suit to require dol to enforce its helper regulations confronted with impending litigation assistant secretary of labor bernard anderson affirmed that the helper regulation approved but not enforced was simply nonadministratable anderson explained that the distinction between he lpers and other workers was insufficiently clear that dol had intention of implementing the regulation in its current form143 in august 1996 dol noted that during the 14 years that had passed since theregulation was first published additional information has become available which warrants review of the suspended rule 144 the regulation remained in abeyance through the next several months dol reassessed the data and in december 1996 it announced that the helper regula tion would remain suspended for the immediate future145 in july 1997 the us district court for the district of columbia ruled that the department was within its rights to issue an indefinite suspension of the helper regulation146 then in april 1999 dol issued new proposed rule that would essentially reaffirm the status quo prior to the carter administration initiatives of the late 1970s two decades earlier147 thus the use of helpers would be limited by area practice

could be expected the late clinton administration late in the 105th congress 1998 representative charlie norwood introduced gislation that would have created special category of workers ie helpe rs for davisbacon purposes action however was taken on the proposal in the 106th congress 1999 mr norwood introduced new helper legislation on july 21 1999 the subcommittee on oversight and investigations committee on education and the workforce conducted hearing on the impact of the helper rules for j ob opportunities the subcommittee however took further action the norwood bill was not reported during the same period representative anne northup raised the helper issue during consideration of appr opriations for the departme nts of labor health and human services and education at repr esentative northups request language was added during markup that w ould have denied funding t implement administer or enforce the helper rule pr oposed by the clinton administration however as the legislation progressed thr ough the legislative proce ss the provision was dropped what impact its inclusion would have had ma not have been entirely clear since in essence the bill would have codified existing practice as the 106th congress was drawing to close dol again took up the matter issuing new final regulation governing the use of helpers it was dated november 14 2000 nd was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register just hours prior to the end of the clinton administration the regulation provided that helpers were to be recogn ized as distinct classification only where the following conditions occur i the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of any other classification on the wage determination ii the use of such helpers is an blished prevailing practice in the area and iii the helper is not employed as tr ainee in an informal training program the work of helper was not to be perfo rmed by any other cl assification of worker in the wage determination148 the george w bush administration another bill dealing with the issue was introduced during the 107th congress but was not adopted in the 108th congress may 2003 the helper issue was raised again by representative marsha blackburn with representatives norwood and king of iowa the proposal again the helpers job opportunity act manda ted that helpers of labor ers and mechanics shall be considered to be separate classification but the prospects were better thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34526crs40 149 see hr 2283 of the 108th congresswith

september 27 2005 the 109th congress represen tative blackburn with mr norwood as cosponsor reintroduced the helpers job opportunity act hr 3907 again the bill died in the committee on education and the workforce the final regulation dating from the c linton administration has gone into effect and thus far the bush administra tion has not revisited the issue however this may not be the end of the process on the one hand the department of labor at its own discretion could reevaluate the helper ques tion and issue new proposed rule or conversely congress could ttempt to resolve the issue through new legislation of cour it may be that th matter has been resolved and that nothing further remains to be accomplished
