us military residence in saudi arabia in 1996 the fbi in conjunction with yemeni lawenf orcement officials is leading an investigation to determine who is responsible for the attack at least six suspects are in custody in yemen evidence developed to date suggests that it may have been carried out by islamic militants with possible connections to the terrorist network led by usama bin ladin 4 in addition to the fbiled investigation secretary of defense william cohen has formed special panel headed by retired general william w crouch former vice chief of staff of the army and retired admiral harold w gehman jr former commanderin chief of us joint forces command the panel in report released january 9 2001 avoided assigning blame but found significant shortcom ings in security throughout the region and recommend improvements in training and intelligence designed to thwart terrorist attacks navy investigation the results of which were released by the commander of the atlantic fleet on january 19 2001 concluded that many of the procedures in the ships security plan had not been followed but that even if they had been followed the incident could not have been prevented consequently single individual should be disciplined for the incident ie blame must be distributed at number of administrative levels members and staff have also held classified meetings on the attack with administration officials issues for congress the attack on the cole raises potential issues for congress concerning 1 procedures used by the cole and other us forces overseas to protect against terrorist attacks 2 intelligence collection analysis and dissemination as it relates to potential terrorist attacks and 3 us antiterrorism policy and how the us should respond to this attack these issues are discussed below forceprotection procedures before it arrived at aden for its brief refueling stop the cole like all visiting us ships was required to file forceprotection plan for the visit this plan was approved by higher us military authorities and was implemented during the ships visit in accordance with the plan the cole at the time of the attack was operating under threat condition bravo which is heightened state of readiness against potential terrorist attack the lowest condition of heightened readiness is alpha bravo is higher charlie is higher still and delta is the highest this threat condition includes steps that are specifically intended to provide protection against attack by small boats members of the house and senate armed services committees and other observers have raised several issues concerning the forceprotection procedures being used by the cole and by other us military forces and bases in the region including the following what were the elements of the coles forceprotection plan and how were these elements determinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20721crs3 5 defense department officials testified that the refueling stop was necessary operationally because the cole was making 3300mile transit from the mediterranean where it previously refueled to the persian gulf defense department officials argue that it would be impractical to have enough tankers so that one could always be assigned to combat ships engaged in solitary transits since the end of the cold war though the navy has become more comfortable with the idea of breaking forwarddeplo yed battle groups into small subformations including solitary ships to take better advantage of the modular flexibility of naval forces for responding to specific needs overseas the policy issue might thus be as follows are the refuelingre lated risks created by possibly morefrequent solitary transits combined with the 50percent fuel policy properly balanced against the benefits of moving ships in this manner and preserving their projected tactical mobility upon arrival at the intended area of operationdid the cole effectively implement all the elements of this plan if not why not if so does this indicate that the plan was not adequate for defending against this type of attack was the forceprotection plan including the use of threat condition bravo appropriate in light of the terrorist threat information that was available to military officials in the days leading up to the ships visit was the ships threat conditi on consistent with the very high threat condition being maintained at that time by the us embassy in yemen what changes if any should be made in forceprotection policies for ships and other us military forces and bases overseas particularly in the middle east and persian gulf region given the need for navy ships to periodically refuel and receive other services from local sources as well as the potential difficulty of identifying hostile craft in oftencrowded harbors how much can be done to reduce the risk of future attacks like this one what can be done to protect against more sophisticated terrorist tactics for attacking ships such as using midget or personal submarines scuba divers with limpet mines or commanddetonated harbor mines should the navy reduce its use of ports for refueling stops and instead rely more on atsea tanker refuelings how many additional tankers at what cost might be needed to implement such change and how would this affect the navys ability to use such stops to contribute to us engagement with other countries in addition to these issues members of the house and senate armed services committees at the hearings also raised an underlying question on whethe r the coles refueling stop was necessary from an operational as opposed to politicaldiplomatic point of view5 intelligence collection analysis and dissemination members of the armed services and intelligence committees as well as other observers have raised several questions relating to the role of intelligence collection analysis and dissemination in the cole attack and in preventing other terrorist attacks against the united states in some cases these questions have been spurred by press reports about the existence of information and analyses from the us intelligence community that some argue might have helped prevent the attack had it been given greater conside ration or beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20721crs4 6 see for example scarborough rowan pentagon analyst resigns over ignored warnings washington times october 26

october 26 2000 32 gertz bill nsas warning arrived too late to save the cole washington times october 25 2000 a1disseminated more quickly6 the details of these claims are currently under investigation by the executive branch and committees in congress questions include the following does the united states have sufficient intelligence collection capacity particularly in the form of human intelligence as opposed to intelligence gathering by satellites or other technical means for learning about potential terrorist attacks particularly in the middle east or persian gulf does the attack on the cole represent us intelligence failure or does it instead reflect the significant challenges of learning about all such attacks soon enough to head them off in the days and weeks prior to the attack on the cole was all the available intelligence information about potential terrorist attacks in the middle east and persian gulf given proper weight in us assessments of the terrorist threat in that region were reports providing information and analyses of potential terrorist attacks in the region disseminated on timely basis to us military and civilian officials in the region who have responsibility for providing advice or making decisions about ship refueling stops or other military operations was there adequate coordination prior to the attack on the cole between the defense department including the national security agency the state department and the us central command the regional us military command for the middle east and persian gulf in sharing and using available intelligence information and analyses on potential terrorist attacks what actions if any should be taken to improve us intelligence collection and analysis particularly as it relates to potential terrorist attacks on us assets in the middle east and persian gulf or elsewhere us antiterrorism policy and potential response beyond these more specific issues the attack on the cole poses several additional potential issues relating to us antiterrorism policy in general some of these issues highlight dilemmas and concerns inherent in policies designed to prevent or mitigate terrorist acts these issues include the following why was yemen chosen for refueling us navy ships began making refueling stops in aden in january 1999 since then navy ships have stopped there 27 times to refuel twice to make port visits and once to take on supplies members of the armed services committees and other observers have asked why the us central command decided in 1998 to begin using yemen for refueling stops rather than continuinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20721crs5 7 opening remarks of general tommy r franks command in chief us central command before the united states senate armed services committee 25 october 2000 this statement is posted on the web page of the senate armed services committee under the hearing in questionto use nearby djibouti on the horn of africa which us navy ships had used for refueling for several years and why central command continued to use yemen this year for refuelings when an april 2000 state department report on worldwide terrorism characterized yemen as haven for terrorists but did not mention djibouti members and others have asked whether the risk of terrorist attack against us ship in yemen was properly balanced against the politicaldiplomatic goals of improving relations with yemen and encouraging its development toward stable prowestern democratic country that does not support terrorism and cooperates with us efforts to contain iraq in response general tommy r franks the current commanderinchief of us central command stated the following regarding the process that led his predecessor general anthony c zinni to the decision to use yemen for refueling stops the decision to go into aden for refueling was based on operational as well as geo strategic factors and included an assessment of the terrorist and conventional threats in the region as you know the horn of africa was in great turmoil in 1998 we had continuing instabil ity in somalia the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania an ongoing war between ethiopia and eritrea and an internal war in sudanas of december 1998 14 of the 20 countries in the uscentcom aor us central command area of responsibility were characterized as high threat countries djibouti which had been the navy refueling stop in the southern red sea for over decade began to deteriorate as useful port because of the eritreaethiopia war this war caused increased forceprotection concerns for our ships as well as congestion in the port resulting in operational delays the judgment at this time was that uscentcom needed to look for more refueling options and aden yemen was seen as viable alternative at the time the refueling contract was signed the addition brought the number of ports available in the uscentcom aor to 13 selection of which of these ports to use for specific refueling operation involves careful evaluation of the threat and operational requirements the terrorism threat is endemic in the aor and uscentcom takes extensive measures to protect our forces the threat situation was monitored regularly in yemen and throughout the aor the intelligence community and uscentcom consider this aor high threat environment and our assessments of the regional threat and the threat in yemen were consistent in their evaluation we had conducted number of threat assessments in the port and throughout the area however leading up to the attack on uss cole on 12 october we received specific threat information for yemen or for the port of aden that would cause us to change our assessment had such warning been received action would have been taken by the operating forces in response to the warning7 anticipating new modes of terrorist attack truck bombs have been used to attack us targets for at least 17 years did us intelligence and counterterrorism agencies anticipate or consider sufficiently plausible the possible use of the maritime equivalent of truck bomb against us navy ship in harbor if not what changes if any should be made to improve the ability of us intelligence and counterterrorism agencies to identify and give sufficient prominence to modes of terrorist attack that havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20721crs6 8 for discussion of the bombing response and its policy implications see crs report 98733 terrorism us response to bombings in kenya and tanzania new policy direction by raphael perl washington 1998 september 1 1998 6 pnot been previously used should us officials reach out more to nongovernmental organizations and individuals for help in this regard protectin g against threats posed by persons with legitimate access what is the best way to defend against terrorist attacks by persons with legitimate access to us installations or forces the cole was refueled by private yemeni ship supply company that had advance information on the ships itinerary although it now appears that the attack may have been carried out by persons with connection to this firm the attack still raises questions about the security implications of relying on private foreign companies to refuel us navy ships what steps can be taken to reduce the risk posed by relying on such firms should for example the state departments antiterrorism assistance program ata be enhanced so that it can better assist foreign governments when needed in personnel screening and security procedures the role of the fbi in overseas counterterrorism investigations some observers have asked whether or under what circumstances it is appropriate for the fbi traditionally domestic us lawenforcement agency to take facto lead role in overseas investigations of terrorist attacks although the fbis investigative skills are critical to such investigations some observers argue that other skills outside the fbis area of specialization including having an indepth understanding of foreign countries and cultures and the diplomatic ability to ensure host nation cooperation are equally important components of such investigations clearly small nations may feel overwhelmed by large numbers of fbi agents and the political sensitivities of their insistence on questioning local witnessessusp ects conferees on the fy2001 foreign operations appropriations bill hr 4811 made 4 million for counterterrorism training in yemen contingent on fbi certification that yemen is fully cooperating in the cole investigation insuring coordination of any retaliatory response an important challenge facing us counterterrorism officials is to ensure that us actions for militaryeconomic retaliation for terrorist attacks are adequately planned the need for maintaining secrecy in planning military actions can discourage interage ncy coordination which in turn can create potential for making planning mistake some observers argue that the us cruise missile attack on what some believe was legitimate pharmaceutical factory in sudan in response to the 1998 embassy bombings in east africa was mistake caused in part by lack of interagency coordination that deprived decisionmakers of important data which might have influenced the targetselection process8 if it is determined that the attack was linked to bin ladin major issue is how the us responds and prevents further attacks from network that is believed responsible for several antius attacks since 1992 the us retaliatory attack on afghanistan in august 1998 response to the east africa embassy bombings did little to damage bin ladins network or his ability to plan attacks
