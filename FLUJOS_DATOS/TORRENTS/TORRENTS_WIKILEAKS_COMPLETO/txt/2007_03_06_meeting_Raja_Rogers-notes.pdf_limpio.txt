at one session we could keep it to 16 hours pretty much raja rogers at lancaster we just designed an ad for new age magazine for these courses ill see if we can borrow that for our domain maybe turn it into mailer jane that means the courses are for nonmeditators raja rogers yes jane do they bring in their own notions and affect the meditators jeff the 30 people we taught were meditators so cant say we didnt advertise to nonmeditators raja rogers at the raj had some experience you just steer them back on to the path and keep going maharishi really appreciated muktananda i was on the first 1 yr roundi ng course about 9 mos into that it was summer in seelisburg we were in hotel weggis there were only over 20 people on course one day maharishi said to invite all the spiritual leaders we could we sent invitations muktananda came we pulled up in our buses in front of seelisburg capital as we got out of buses the buses with muktananda and the devotees also arrived maharishi walked out of the hotel greeted muktananda and went in together 200 people muktananda people started chanting om namah shivah chant plus entire guru gita at one pt muktananda stands up and points to one of maharishis top people and they leave the room together only suppos ed to do om namah chant for 34 minutes when bell rang to end it maharishi said keep going one person said they could see their whole body turning to light during that lecture someone in the movement asked if we should chant maharishi said wed do that later muktananda lets his consciousness to go into the chant to enliven the chant muktananda people asked if they should learn meditation then maharishi said its best to stick with your teaching your guru if not then its like trying to cross the river with one foot in 2 different boats eventually you fall in muktananda said its like 2 farmers its dry season and both need to dig well one digs for an hour and then tries another location and then another the other man keeps digging the well in one place one has well and one has lots of holes have had many muktananda people coming thru the raj muktananda and maharishi really respected and appreciated each other like maharishi was shiva muktananda does shaktipat touches people on forehead feels like what we feel when hoppi ng maharishi was the silence muktananda was the dyna mism moving things when muktananda was passing away maharishi sent triguna who had worked with muktananda before to be with him jane thank you for restoring balance to all of us week after week with these wonde rful meetings jeff murphy business lexington is published twice month and has weekly publication for univ of ky students w weekly article was written featured on front cover meditate on this health and enlightenment one of the flying saint paintings russian saint with the staff in hand is featured on the cover 5 different pictures in the article about the peace palace it mentions tm and the 16 hour courses very positive straightforward article raja rogers send copy and we can show it on the global family chat great news elaine how does the vaidya recommend veda herbs if he is not to prescribe but rather is suppos ed to point to mapi catalog and give people choice of ma herb or mapi herbal produc t raja rogers the ideal scenario is that the person fills out paper with hisher area of concern and health information we tell them that the vaidya is doing the traditional ayurveda pulse assessment he will look and see if the doshas are in or out of balance then the vaidya writes down herbs he should point to the mapi catalog and say that the person can take for example mens rasayana or ma 631 the person can choos mohan doss is aware of this i will talk with him to review if doctor is with him it is better better that the vaidya not say oh your liver is hot but rather your vata is out of balance alcine has anyone taught selfpulse reading course jeff murphy yes you need to work with people because they may not feel anything at the beginning the teacher should be quite competent in taking hisher own pulse carol received initial permission from everyone incl superintendent but when gave statement of intent to sign principal decided to put all 2000 kids into the project not just one grade as originally intended so they said they need to look at all again if project is going to be that big there is another project on the line too so hope fully they will both happen at the same time raja rogers raja kingsley has school project going he recommends that directors talk with lynn kaplan if they have questions jane chris busch at david lynch foundation said to not start program too late in the school year we are just about at the cutoff point because it is not enough time for the students to get strong in meditation before they go home for the summer however teachers and parents can learn raja rogers talk to lynn and i will call chris busch when do they get out of school in fl jane dr dillbeck said that international said that we should not hurry raja rogers yes we should be patient but if we can do the project that would be good charlie will be arriving at the raj for few days and then continue his journey to oregon we should all have good wish and good thought for our friend charlie jai guru dev
