addressed in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30875congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs weborder code rl30875 stepup vs carryover

carryover basis for capital gains implications for estate tax repeal summary current income tax law provides for stepup in the basis of an inherited asset to its fair market value at the time of the decedents death when the heir sells the asset the capital gain for income tax purposes is measured by the difference between the heirs selling price and the steppedup basis of the asset the basis is longer the assets cost at the time when the decedent acquired it that would be known as carryover basis as result there is income tax liability on the appreciation in the assets value during the decedents period of ownership lifetime for the decedent as well as the heir if the federal estate tax were repealed but the stepup in basis of assets at death continued the appreciation in value of capital assets during decedents lifetime could avoid both the estate tax and the income tax if the estate tax were repealed but inherited assets received carryover rather than steppedup basis capital gains tax would be due on this appreciation in value when the assets were sold by the heirs as shown by numerical examples estates that are subject to substantial estate tax liability under current law would face much lower overall tax liability under an exchange of the estate tax for capital gains tax on inherited assets however for estates which are not subject to estate tax liability under current law repealing the estate tax in exchange for carryover basis could mean an increase in income tax liability on capital gains relative to current law for heirs unless stepup in basis was preserved for some amount of decedents assets the estates of most decedents do not face an estate tax liability under current law primarily because assets of married decedents often pass to the surviving spouse under the unlimited marital deduction andor because the remaining assets are less than the estate tax exclusion amount of 675000 in 2001 rising to 1 million by 2006 most bills to repeal the estate tax would retain the current unlimited stepup in basis however few bills would institute carryover basis for inherited assets in exchange for repealing the estate tax hr 8 as passed by 106th congress but vetoed by president clinton in august 2000 would have replaced the stepup in basis with carryover basis when the estate tax was fully repealed with limited amount of assets entitled to receive the stepup in basis hr 8 dunn and tanner was reintroduced in the 107th congress substanti ally amended by the ways and means committee and passed by the house on april 4 2001 the new bill retains the previous stepup exceptions of 13 million for transfers to any beneficiaries plus 3 million to surviving spouse for nonresident alien decedent the stepup is limited to 60000 rather than 13 million hr 8 107th also makes the exclus ion of 250000 per person for the capital gain on the sale of principal residence available to the heir s 275 kyl would repeal the estate tax retain stepup in basis for 28 million in assets and provide carryover basis for assets in excess of that limit there are many questions about how either carryover or stepup in basis of inherited assets could

value of capital assets during decedents period of ownership lifetime could avoid both the estate tax and the income tax on capital gains for the decedent as well as the heir several basic policy questions arise if the estate tax is repealed should the appreciation in the value of assets during decedents lifetime be subject to tax if the appreciated value is to be taxed when should it be at the time of the persons death or only when the assets are sold by heirs what are the overall tax implications of trading off repeal of the estate tax for repeal of the stepup in basis are the tradeoffs different for large taxable estates than for smaller nontaxable estates what are the administrative concerns about administering either stepup or carryover basis in the absence of an estate tax current tax law regarding basis and capital gains under current tax law assets transferred at death receive stepup in basis while assets transferred as gift inter vivos while the giver is alive retain carryover basis the basis affects the capital gains tax due when the heir or gift recipient sells the asset this section provides an explanation of these two cases and some simple numerical examples which are summarized in table 1 this part of the report does not address the estate and gift taxes that may also be due on the transfer of assets either at death or during the givers lifetime for estates large enough to be liable for estate and gift taxes capital gains tax and stepup in basis for inherited assets the capital gains tax is part of the income tax not the estate tax in the context of the estate tax capital gains taxes are the concern of heirs who want to sell or liquidate assets they inherit capital gains tax only becomes due when an asset is sold by an heir or as tax practitioners say when the gains are realized income tax is owed as long as an heir continues to hold an inherited asset or passes it along to future generations the capital gains tax is levied on the profit or net gain on the sale measured by the difference between the sales proceeds and the cost or basis of the assethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30875crs2 1certain deductions are permitted from the gross estate in determining the taxable estate such as the marital deduction charitable deduction deduction of expenses for the funeral and the administration of the estate and payment of debts of the decedent 2not all assets are appreciable and therefore candidates for stepup in basis for example bank accounts or savings bonds are not subject to capital gain or loss 3the stepup in basis also applies to assets transferred to surviving spouse under the unlimited marital deduction 4the value of an estates assets may be established either as of the decedents date of death or the alternate valuation date six months later if the value of the gross estate and the estate tax due would be lower as of the later date 5although stepup is commonly interpreted to mean an increase in the value of an asset it technically refers to moving up the point in time or date at which the value of an asset is established in fact for an asset that has decreased in value since the decedent purchased it such as an automobile or stocks or real estate after decline the market the steppedup basis can be lower than the original cost as consequence of the stepup in basis rule the loss in value during the decedents period of ownership cannot be claimed as capital loss when an inherited asset is soldin contrast the estate tax is calculated starting with the gross current market value of assets owned at the time of persons death1 this typically includes some if not substantial unrealized capital gains on appreciable assets2 one defense of the estate tax is that it serves as backup to the income tax by taxing the unrealized capital gains that accrued during the decedents period of ownership lifetime and that will not be subject to the income tax even when realized by the heirs for the following reason in what can be considered as partial tradeoff for the estate tax the income tax law permits socalled stepup in the basis of inherited assets3 for the heir or recipient that means the basis becomes the fair market value of the asset at the time of the decedents death4 when the heir sells the asset the capital gain for income tax purposes is measured by the difference between the heirs selling price and the steppedup basis of the asset this is in contrast to using the decedents basis generally the cost of the asset when originally purchased by the decedent which would be known as the carryover basis as result any gain in the assets value during the decedents lifetime is permanently forgiven from the income tax on capital gains5 numerical example of capital gains tax liability on an inherited asset with stepup in basis assume that man purchased stock in 1980 for 100 when he died in 1999 the market value of the stock was 1000 this 1000 value becomes the steppedup basis of the stock assume that his who inherited the stock sold it in 2000 for 1100 also suppose that the man and his both faced capital gains tax rate of 20 if the man had sold the stock for 1000 just before he died in 1999 he would have owed capital gains tax of 180 the 180 is equal to 20 tax on the 900 in capital gains during his period of ownership 1000 100 900 see sale by original owner before death in the first column of table 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30875crs3 6if the had sold the stock for 1000 capital gains tax would have been due 1000 1000 0instead when the sold the stock after his fathers death for 1100 he owed capital gains tax of 20 the 20 is equal to 20 tax on the sons 100 in capital gains subsequent to the time of the fathers death 1100 1000 1006 see inherited asset in the middle column of table 1 the 180 in capital gains tax that would have been owed on the increase in value from 100 to 1000 during the fathers period of ownership is forgiven these capital gains tax rules

carryover basis for gifted assets in contrast to an asset transferred at death an asset transferred to another person by gift during the givers lifetime inter vivos retains carryover basis under carryover basis the basis of the former owner is transferred to the new owner as with inherited assets the capital gains tax liability is deferred until the recipient sells the gifted asset unlike the case of inherited assets however at the time of sale thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30875crs4 7this example assumes that the value of the asset increased during both the givers and recipients periods of ownership 8if the did not have proof of the fathers original purchase costs the basis of the gifted asset would be set at 0 and the would owe capital gains tax of 220 or 20 of the entire 1100 in sales proceeds 9the 500 value of the stock at the time of the gift trans fer is not relevant to this tax calculation 10this report does not discuss the gift tax which becomes due on current basis not at death once the cumulative total of persons taxable gifts exceeds the lifetime exclusion amount for the unified estate and gift tax like the estate tax the gift tax is based on the full current value of the asset transferred and not just the gain in value during the donors period of ownership nor the basis gifts of up to 10000 per donor per recipient per year do not count against the lifetime exclusion amount and are thereby exempt from the gift taxrecipient owes capital gains tax on the increase in value during the givers period of ownership as well as during the recipients period of ownership7 numerical example of capital gains tax liability on gifted asset with carryover basis assume the father who purchased stock for 100 in 1980 instead gave that stock to his as gift in 1990 assume that the market value of the stock had risen to 500 in 1990 nevertheless the father would not owe any capital gains tax upon making the gift suppose again that the sold the stock in 2000 for 1100 if the had records to prove that his father purchased the stock for 100 the 100 would be the sons carryover basis8 the would owe capital gains tax of 200 20 percent of 1100 100 1000 the 200 is equivalent to the 180 in tax forgiven in the preceding inheritance example on the 900 increase in the stocks value from the time of the fathers purchase until the time of his death plus the 20 tax due on the 100 increase in value since the time of the fathers death9 the same capital gains tax rules would apply if the had sold the gifted stock while his father was still alive10 see gifted asset in the last column of table 1 discussion of policy issues taxing unrealized appreciation common criticism of the estate tax is that many of the assets in an estate have already been taxed at least once under the income tax portion of the estate is likely to reflect for exam ple invested savings from wages dividends interest business profits realized capital gains and other forms of income on which the decedent paid income taxes an exception to this criticism however are the unrealized gains in the value of appreciated assets held at the time of death unrealized gains have not been subject to income tax if the federal estate tax were repealed but the stepup in basis of assets at death continued the appreciation in value of capital assets during decedents lifetime could avoid both the estate tax and the income tax httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30875crs5 11us congressional budget office budget options washington february 2001 available on the internet at httpwwwcbogov rev28a p 421 and rev28b p 422 12cbo budget options february 2001 rev28a p 421taxation at death or when assets are sold another criticism of the estate tax is that the tax liability is triggered by the death of the assetholder rather than by the sale or liquidation of assets hence the name death tax the estate may be forced to sell assets in order to raise the cash needed to pay the tax this issue is particularly important to estates dominated by single large indivisible and illiquid asset such as familyowned business or farm piece of real estate or art masterpiece the complaint is that the family may have to part with its major asset possibly at substantial discount in order to raise the cash needed to pay the estate tax it should be noted that section 6166 of the internal revenue code currently gives estates dominated by closely held business interests effectively 15 years to pay the estate tax due on those interests alternatively some individuals purchase insurance during their lifetime to pay the estate tax due upon their death alternative approaches to taxing unrealized capital gains there are two main approaches to taxing unrealized capital gains that accrue during decedents lifetime in the absence of an estate tax one is the approach followed in canada of taxing the unrealized capital gains calculated at the time of persons death as part of the decedents final income tax like the current us estate tax this tax liability is triggered by person s death however canadian income tax law provides that the tax on the deemed disposition of property at death can be paid in installments over 10year period the other approach to taxing the gains unrealized by the decedent is to give the heir carryover basis for the inherited asset instead of stepup in basis any capital gains tax liability is thus deferred until the time that the asset is sold by the heir it is due as part of the heirs income tax this second approach is the one generally followed in the bills described in the final section of this report these two possibilities are among the options to increase revenues included by the congressional budget office cbo in its compendium of budget options issued in february 200111 cbo provides the joint committee on taxations estimates of additional revenues from both of these options shown in table 2 below unlike the legislative proposals described in the last section of this report these estimates assume that the estate tax is still in place and that there is partial stepup in basis exception to the new carryover basis rules revenue estimates are provided for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006 for the five years 20022006 and for the 10 years 20022011 including accrued capital gains in the last income tax return of decedents is projected to generate approximately 116 billion per year in fy2003 when first fully phased in then dropping gradually to 101 billion in 2006 the fiveyear revenue gain is estimated at 434 billion and the 10year revenue gain at 864 billion12 enacting carryover basis for capital gains held until death is estimated to generate revenues of 12 billion in 2003 rising gradually each year to 47 billion in

capit gains tax liability under current law with an altern ative system that would repeal the estate tax and instead tax the capital gains unrealized by the decedent separate estimates are made for an estate of 10 million that would be subject to estate tax under current law estate an estate above the exclusion amount and an estate of 1 million thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30875crs7 14in the year 2006 under current law the applicable exclusion amount under the estate and gift tax is scheduled to reach 1 million using an example from 2006 thus simplifies the numerical comparison between large estate of 10 million and smaller estate of 1 million 15because unrealized appreciation in the value of assets is not subject to taxat ion information is collected about it on federal estate tax returns and hence data are available from the internal revenue service some estimates have been made in an academic study based on data from the 1998 survey of consumer finances poterba and weisbenner estimated that for all estates in the aggregate unrealized capital gains represented about 36 of the total value of estates measured according to their definition of insuranceaugmented net worth for estates with insuranceaugmented net worth of 10 million or more unrealized capital gains represented about 56 of the total value of the estates for estates in the range of 500000 to 1 million the figure was 340 for estates in the range of 1 million to 5 million it was 346 see poterba james m and scott weisbenner the distributional burden of taxing estates and unrealized capital gains at the

estate b an estate below the exclusion amount as illustrated by the numerical examples in the text and summarized in table 3 estates like estate currently subject to the estate tax would face much lower overall tax liability under an exchange of the estate tax for capital gains tax on inherited assets however for estates like estate b that are currently exempt from the estate tax because of the 1 million exclusion andor by using the unlimited marital deduction or other deductions repealing the estate tax in exchange for full carryover basis could mean an increase in tax liability relative to current law because of the potential new capital gains tax liability for heirs the examples presented in this section assume full carryover basis on all assets transferred at death this helps illustrate the concern being raised on behalf of smaller estates in relation to proposals that would repeal both the estate tax and all stepup in basis acknowledging this concern the bills described in the final section of this report would preserve stepup in basis for some amount of assets passed along by each decedent the capital gains tax liability estimated in these examples is equal to what would be due if capital gains tax were collected upon the death of the decedent ie tax due with certainty not dependent upon sale of the assets this is equivalent to the potential tax due on the appreciation in value of the assets during the decedents period of ownership if and when the heirs sold the assets and realize d that capital gain numerical example of trading off the estate tax for

represented 8 million instead of 5 million of the 10 million estate capital gains tax of 20 would equal 16 million 18the estates of most decedents do not face an estate tax liability under current law primarily because assets of married decedents often pass to the surviving spouse with stepup in basis under the unlimited marital deduction andor because the remaining assets are less than the estate tax exclusion amount of 675000 in 2001 rising to 1 million by 2006 19see explanation in footnote 15million17 in table 3 see the last two rows first two columns corresponding to estate your choice of tax system might differ depending on the specific terms of your inheritance if you were entitled to receive fixed percentage of the estate remaining after taxes you would likely prefer the capital gains tax regime however if you were designated to receive particular asset such as certain piece of real estate you might be concerned with the capital gains tax that would be due on the sale of your particular asset but not the estate taxes that would alternatively be paid by the estate as whole as group however heirs of large estate would seem better off choosing the capital gains tax with carryover basis instead of the estate tax numerical example of why estates not liable for estate tax under current law could be worse off under estate tax repeal with full carryover basis proposals to accompany the repeal of the estate tax with full repeal of the stepup in basis and to fully replace it with carryover basis face the criticism that smaller estates could be worse off than under current law that is because under current law estates with taxable assets less than or equal to the applicable exclusion amount 675000 in 2001 and 1 million in 2006 and thereafter are not only free from the estate tax but the heirs are also free from capital gains taxes on the appreci ation in value during the decedents lifetime when they sell the inherited assets18 estates smaller than the exclusion amou nt would not receive any estate tax saving if the estate tax were repealed however if the stepup in basis were fully repealed the heirs would owe capital gains tax of 100000 on the 500000 appreciation in value during the decedents lifetime19 in table 3 see the last two rows and last two columns corresponding to estate b the possibility of capital gains tax liability for the heirs is why the bills listed in the final section of this report include limited stepup provisions these stepup allowances are intended to provide heirs protection from capital gains taxation that is equivalent to the protection provided under current law for estates up to certain size ie estates with unrealized capital gains of up to the amount specified in the bills

decedentadministrative concerns in establishing basis previous effort to institute carryover basis was enacted by the tax reform act of 197620 its implementation was postponed by three years by the revenue act of 197821 and repealed before it ever took effect by the crude oil windfall profit tax act of 19802223 leading up to the repeal practitioners pointed out the difficulties in trying to determine the historical cost basis of an inherited asset repealing the estate tax would remove the current incentive to hold down the valuation of assets at the time of death in order to reduce estate tax liability instituting capital gains tax in place of the estate tax would instead create incentives to overstate the carryover basis of assets so as to reduce the eventual calculation of capital gains furthermore permitting some assets to receive stepup in basis while others retain carryover basis would introduce still more complexities into the administration of the tax system24 bills to restrict the stepup in basis in exchange for repealing the estate tax in the internal revenue code the stepup in basis is not part of the estate tax law but rather is found in the portion of the code that defines the basis of assets for income tax purposes25 it would thus require additional legislative language beyond repealing the estate tax to replace the stepup in basis with carryover basis for inherited assets such provision was included in hr 8 which passed in the second session of the 106th congress but was vetoed by president clinton on august 31 2000 the legislative language

the estate tax elimination act of 2000 hr 8 passed the 106th congress but was vetoed by president clinton title i of hr 8 would have repealed the stepup in basis at the time when the estate tax was

basis would have continued to apply to 13 million in transfers from decedent to any beneficiaries an additional 3 million of transfers from decedent to his or her surviving spouse also would have received step up in basis26 property in excess of these amounts would have carryover basis that is the cost basis to the heir would be the cost at which the decedent acquired the asset hr 8 provided that the executor would elect which assets received stepup in basis and which carryover basis hr 8 contained several other provisions not described here27 the stepup exceptions in hr 8 are way to hold taxpayers harmless relative to the amount of estate that is free from tax under current law under current law in 2006 and thereafter decedent will be able to transfer 1 million in assets to heirs free
