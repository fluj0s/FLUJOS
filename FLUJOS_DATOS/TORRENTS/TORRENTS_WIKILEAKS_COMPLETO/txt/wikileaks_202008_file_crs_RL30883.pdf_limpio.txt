that by 2005 africa could effectively absorb about 46 billion in the struggle against the pandemic and that about 3 billion would have to be provided by donors donor contributions were estimate d at several hundred million do llars in 2001 and whether they will be providing 3 billion annua lly by 2005 remains to be seen nonetheless hivaids assistance from the united states and other donors has been increasing us bilateral spending on african aids programs is expected to rise from 238 million in fy2001 to 292 million in fy2002 the united states has pledged 500 million to the global fund to fi ght aids tuberculosis and malaria which announced its first grants in april 2002 about 52 of the 378 million to be initially disbursed will go to africa the scale of future increases in us spending is unclear but several bills that woul d boost the us contribution are currently before congress the focus in the struggle against aids in africa to date has been on prevention only an estimated 25000 to 30000 african ai ds patients are currently receiving treatment with the antiretroviral drugs that have sharply reduced the aids death toll in developed countries aids experts fa vor continued scaling up of prevention measures including media campaigns schoolbased programs and condom distribution at the same time there is strong support for expanding the availability of antiretrovirals to prevent mother to child transmission of hiv during birth beyond prevention many advocates want to enhance homebased care for aids patients and their families and sharply expand programs to care for africas burgeoning population of orphans many also believe that an tiretroviral treatment must be made much more widely available both on mo ral grounds and because it can stem the loss of adults in their most productive years in addition to governments nongovern mental organizations foundations and the private sector are expa nding their involvement in the campaign against aids in africa

to th aids disease an estimated 23 million died of aids in 2001 and 34 million were newly infected2 subsaharan africa has about 10 of the worl ds population but about 70 of the worldwide total of hivinfected people live in the region th hiv infection rate among adults exceeds 10 in 16 countries r eaching 25 in south africa and 38 in botswana life expectancy is plunging in these countries and the soci and economic consequences of widespread illness and death are expected to be severe botswanas president festus mogae told the june 2001 united nations general asse mbly special session on hivaids ungass that we ar threatened with extinction3 to date progress in curbing the hivaids pandemic has been very limited and uganda and senegal are the only countries cited by experts as clearcut success stories in the fight against the disease uganda has sharply reduced hiv prevalence among adults through an intensive ai ds prevention campaign and senegal has evidently avoided major aids epidemic through safe sex edu cation in the schools the promotion of condom us and other measures4 in both cases outspoken and frank leadership from the highest levels of government is credited with much of the success in the struggle against aids5 unaids the joint united nations program on hivaids also reports some evidence that young people in zambia and south africa are modifying their beha

life for people infected and affected by hivaids reduced hivaids stigma and discrimination and reduced impact of the epidemic especially on children and other groups during his speech at abuja nigeri in april 2001 secretary general annan laid out broadly similar set of objectives for scaling up but specifically mentioned expanded access to treatment as goal according to the secretary general scaling up should aim at 1 preventing the further spread of th epidemic particularly by giving young people the knowledge and power to protect themselves 2 preventing mother to child trans mission of hiv which annan called the cruellest most unjust infections of all 3 putting care and treatment including treatment with advanced aids medications within everyones reach 4 delivering scientific breakthroughs by giving higher priority to finding cure and vaccine 5 protecting those made most vulnerabl by the disease particularly orphans who are growing up malnourished unde reducated marginalized and at risk of being infected themselves11 aids experts generally argue that these objectives can be achieved by substantial expansion in programs aimed at preventing the spread of hiv and in programs that provide care nd treatment to those affect ed by the pandemic these approaches are discussed in greater detail below cost overview in december 2001 peter piot executive director of the joint united nations program on hivaids unaids told an international aids conference in burkina faso that assistance to fight hivaids in africa should be in creased manyfold and that the region required 46 billion per year to confront the pandemic this estimate reflected detailed work done by bernhard sc hwartlander of the world health organization and unaids with others and published in

drug costs some reports estimate lower costs 16for an indepth analysis see macroeconomics and health in june 200112 the schwartlander article looke d at feasible and necessary increases in prevention programs on count ry by country basis and concluded that by 2005 africa could effectively ab sorb about 156 billion in increased expenditures on prevention with respect to care and treatment including treatment with antiretroviral drugs the article found that 307 billi on per year could be used effectively in africa by 2005 yielding to tal cost for prevention care and treatment of 463 billion antiretroviral therapy large part of the cost of enhanced treatment and care in the schwartlander estimates is accounted for by antiretroviral arv treatment the drug therapy that has done so much to reduce aidsrelated illn ess and death in the united states and other developed countries acco rding to the relief organization medecins sans frontieres msf or doctors without borders arv treatment also known as highly active antiretroviral therapy haart is currently available to only 25000 to 30000 aids patients in subsaharan africa13 and some of this treatment is probably ineffective because many patients can afford the antiretrovirals only sporadically14 an estimated 4 million africans are in the advanced stages of the disease and mostlikely to benefit from antiretroviral ther apy schwartlander estimates that 22 million people could be treated by 2005 at an estimated cost of 450 per patient for antiretroviral drugs 15 this degree of coverage would cost nearly 1 billion per year costs in 2005 and beyond schwartlander estimates that of the total of 463 billion per year needed for scaled up response including preventi on care and treatment by 2005 3 billion would need to be provided by donors he sees the remainder coming from increased spending in the health sector by african countries themselves resources available from the world bankinternational moneta ry fund highly indebted poor country initiative hipc and the private sector beyond 2005 experts see the cost of scaled up response increasing16 this is because africas capacity to absorb in creased resources for dealing with aids is currently quite limited for example under current practice antiretrovirals for preventing mother to child transmission mtct of hiv are only administered to pregnant women who have been tested for hiv and are delivering in health facility this number is believed to be only frac tion of the total number of african womenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30883crs5 17ibid 445 18usaid leading

fewer than half of all births in africa are attended by health professionals17 scaling up however will strengthen africas health infrastructure and make it possible to offer hiv testing and delivery

met by 2005 whether donors will contribute these sums remains to be seen many regard scaling up as both moral and security imperative in view of the massive loss of life economic difficulties and political instability that could result if the african pandemic is not curbed harvard economis t jeffrey sachs wrote in february 10 2001 oped article that the amount required for scaling up is tiny compared with the great annual wealth of the welloff na tions adding that to turn our back on africa over this small sum would constitute one of the greatest moral failings in our history24 on march 25 2002 twenty eight us religious leaders urged major increase in aids spending worldwide writing that aids has become the worst infectious disease crisis to confront th world since the bubonic plague of the 14th century halved the population of europe within five years25 others may contend however that th african hivaids pandemic does not affect the core economic and security inte rests of the united states and other donors sufficiently to justify expenditures at the levels suggested by scalingup proposals particularly those including arv therapy there may also be skeptics who will question whether expanded resources for co mbating aids can be spent effectively or achieve results in view of the diffi cult political economic and social conditions prevailing in many african countries mo reover some may maintain that the need to fund aids programs in the former s oviet union and asia where epidemics are worsening will limit the capacity of donors to increase funding for hivaids programs in africa scaling up strategies most hivaids experts see three dimensions to the effort to curb the spread of hivaids in africa as in other regi ons and to reduce the aids death toll prevention care and treatment to date the focus in africa has been on preventing the spread of the hiv virus and some argue that prevention is still the most cost effective means of dealing with the

essential to keeping alive parents teachers health work ers and others playing vital social and economic roles and to prot ecting and educating childre n orphaned by aids or made vulnerable when their parents fall ill if these needs are not met many argue widespread social disruption and economic devastation will result28 finally many believe that since arv treatment reduces the viral load in aids patients it likely reduces the risk that these patients will pass the disease on to others this hypothesis is not yet proven however29 schwartlander maintains that in subsaharan africa where so many are infected by hiv and ill with aids 66 of hivaids resources should be devoted to care and treatment30 prevention an effective vaccine against hiv would be the ideal preventive measure for stopping the african aids pandemic lthough one potential vaccine is showing some promise in human tests experts believe that broadly effective aids vaccine will not be available for gene ral use for at least decade31 many who are concerned about the african pandemic favor increas ed spending on vaccine development emphasizing vaccines that work against th varieties of hiv found in africa the international

mass media campaigns aids education in sc hools making condoms widely available treatment of sexually transmitted infec tions that increase susceptibility to hiv infection the screening of blood used fo r transfusions and peer counseling among sex workers37 there is also growing support for scaling up the mtct prevention of hiv by providing arvs to pregnant mothers it is estimated that in 2000 approximately 486000 african babies were born infected through mother to child transmission38 but treatment of mothers with antiretrovi rals could reduce mtct by onethird to onehalf39 in july 2000 the german pharm aceutical manufacturer boehringer ingelheim announced that it would offer the arv nevirapine free of charge for five years in developing countries for the prev ention of mtct however as

from governments but also by private organizations formally chartered as nongovernmental organiza tion headquartered in geneva switzerland the funds governing board consists of re presentatives of seven donor nations and seven developing countries as well as one each from southern nongovernmental organization ngo northern ngo foundation and the private sector the fund accepts pr oposals from c

speed funds to organizations that are already at work fighting the pandemic some observers worry that the fund ma be too lean as an organization to effectively monitor the projects it supports64 these observers f ear that contributions to the fund may dry up if number of its pr ojects fail and it comes to be seen as an organization that wastes resources suppor ters of the funds approach note that each ccm as part of the application process is required to develop comprehensive monitoring plans making use as much as possible of existing incountry monitoring capabilities moreover the work of the f und is closely integrated with the work of other donors and international agencies that have longestablished presence in the countries where grants are being made these donors and agencies are themselves monitoring the performance of hivaids programs and projects as well as the performance of the health sector generally in african countries thus many believe that parallel global fund
