solomon susansolomonnoaagov xflowed peck et i recall meeting david deeming at meeting years ago 10 he worked in boreholes then ive seen his name on several of the skeptic websites kevins idea is possibility i wouldnt post on the website ukweatherworld the person who sent you this is likely far worse this is david holland he is uk citizen who send countless letters to his mp in the uk writes in energy environment about the biased ipcc and has also been hassling john mitchell about his role as review editor for ch 6 you might want to talk to john about how hes responding he has been making requests under our foi about the letters review editors sent when signing off im sure susan is aware of this hes also made requests for similar letters re wg2 and maybe 3 keith has been in contact with john about this ive also seen the quote about getting rid of the mwp it would seem to go back many years maybe even to around the tar ive idea where it came from i didnt say it ive written piece for rms popular journal weather on the mwp and lia from uk perspective it is due out in june i can send if you want im away all next week with mike paleoenso meeting in tahiti you cant turn those sorts of meetings down cheers phil at 2315 26032008 kevin trenberth wrote hi jon there is lot to be said for ignoring such thing but i understand the frustration an alternative approach is to write blog on this topic of the medieval warm period and post it at neutral site and then refer enquiries to that link you would have choice of directly confronting the statements or making more general statement presumably that such thing is real but was more regional and not as warm as most recent times this approach would not then acknowledge that particular person except indirectly possible neutral site might be blogsnaturecomclimatefeedback i posted number of blogs there last year but not this year i can send you the contact person if you are interested and you can make the case that they should post the blog good luck kevin hi phil kevin mike susan and ben im looking for some ipccrelated advice so thanks in advance the email below recently came in and i googled we have to get rid of the warm medieval period and overpeck and indeed there is person david deeming that attributes the quote to an email from he apparently did mention the quote but i dont think in senate hearing his news often with attribution to appears to be getting widespread coverage on the internet it is upsetting i have memory of emailing w him nor any record of doing so i need to do an exhaustive search i guess nor any memory of him period i assume it is possible that i emailed w him long ago and that hes taking the quote out of context since know i would never have said what hes saying i would have at least in the context he is implying any idea what my reaction should be i usually ignore this kind of misinformation but i can imagine that it could take on life of its own and that i might want to deal with it now rather than later i could as the person below suggests make quick statement on web site that the attribution to is false but i suspect that this deeming guy could then produce fake email i would then say its fake or just ignore or something else i googled deeming and from the first page of hits got the sense that hes not your average university professor to put it lightly again thanks for any advice id really like this to not blow up into something that creates grief for the ipcc or the community it is bogus best peck xsieve cmu sieve 23 replyto david holland dhollandtheietorg from david holland dhollandtheietorg to jtouarizonaedu subject ukweatherworld date mon 24 mar 2008 083910 0000 dear dr overpeck i recall david deeming giving evidence to senate hearing to the effect that he had received an email including remark to the effect we have to get rid of the warm medieval period i have now seen several comment web pages attribute the email to your some serious and well moderated pages like ukweatherworld would welcome post from you if the attribution is untrue and would i feel sure remove it if you were to ask them to i am sure that many other blogs would report your denial is there any reason you have not issued denial david holland jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences
