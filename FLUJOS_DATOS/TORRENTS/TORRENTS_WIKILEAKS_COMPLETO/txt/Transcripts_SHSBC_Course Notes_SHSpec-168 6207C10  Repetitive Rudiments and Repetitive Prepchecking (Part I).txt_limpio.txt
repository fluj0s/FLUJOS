6207c10 shspec168 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking part i see hcob 2jul62 repetitive rudiments and hcob 3ju162 repetitive prepchecking relating to this tape and the next we are back to basics today in auditing the forerunners of practically everything done today can be found in dmsmh and dianetics the original thesis see p 270 above suddenly also we are back to repetitive processes which auditors have always had success with except for the question of whether the process is flat in the 17th acc lrh had just lectured on comm lags the next day he asked how you could tell whether the process was flat one could answer the difficulty is solved with this method of using repetitive questions they are flat at precise point ones troubles can come only from not reading the meter or not believing it either will bring about an upset pc model session repetitive per hcob 4jul62 bulletin changes significant change is havingness or the room rudiment being dropped from beginning rudiments although retained in end ruds see also hcob 23jun62 model session revised has all ruds except havingness as auditing questions to be handled repetitively you would think that slugging the pc with this many processes in one session would be catastrophic it is if done poorly if you overrun by one question the pc is in the soup likewise if you ask one question too few you get missed withholds so either never ask for ow or do it right you cant avoid the fact of missing withholds matter what you try you can miss withhold just by walking in the room so you cant just not ask questions and if you ask question you must ask exactly the right number of questions some cases one in twelve even think you should know everything they are thinking in these cases any question you ask shows that you didnt know so you miss the withhold see hcob 12jul62 motivatorish cases this is the theetieweetie case the way someone got in that state was too much pretended knowingness on the part of others plus overts against questions if this type of person exists or if many people get into this state and they do and if man keeps being active while being secretive which he will then it is inevitable that you will miss withholds an people so you must learn to run ow and repetitive processes perfectly not just fairly well it is rather easy to do repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking perfectly the only problem is that with some cases you have to add to another to the done question otherwise the pc will give motivatorish answers which spins him in and the question will never clear auditing is as successful as it is predictable to the pc auditors get spoiled by howling success following an unusual solution this includes lrh such success can hang an auditor up and get him stuck in the win the more we learn about the mind the fewer unusual solutions we need and the more textbook the solutions become this is measure of an auditors understanding of what he is doing if he wins with an unusual solution it wont give consistent wins as time goes by he may get so many loses that he ultimately stops auditing the closer we get to clearing the fewer unusual solutions we look for to clear everybody you have to know how everybodys mind works weve got that at this point we only need to modify the tech to make the result easier for all auditors to get two things monitor our tech 1 the results 2 the ease with which auditors can be trained up to where they can obtain the results the ease of application of the processes the problems are these pc is built like universe there is pride postulate on top of which mass accumulated human being is determined to be such merely by having human body doll has the same kind of bank as human the pcs bank is not native to the corporeal self he is packing around as an identification card incidentally doll bodies rot drunk by inhaling alcohol vapors actually drinking would wreck the machinery we dramatize this nowadays with the brandy snifter any mass accumulated to the pc accumulates on his prime postulate the prime postulate is the basic purpose or goal of person there can be secondary prime postulate in any lifetime it is the alteration of the prime postulate that occurs in the course of trying to put it into effect that causes mass to accumulate from the shift of attention and direction that inhibits the persons ability to asis change of attention is change and energy is change there is lot to be understood about how mass evolves out of alterisness if something goes from point to point b with change point must be point b by introducing space you introduce via space is via that causes and necessitates change in or of anything occurring within it that is one of the first things that happens in the course of building universe once you have time shift of attention causes motionlessness in time accumulation dissipation interchanges of masses dislocations in space etc after awhile we get an individual who obsessively changes there are two things wrong with human personality 1 too much constancy 2 too much inconstancy auditors do these two things they resist change even when it is sensible and they obsessively introduce change when it is not required constancy without understanding without reason is simply characteristic of mest so is change one should understand why one is being constant before being constant one should also understand what he is undertaking before he introduces alteration unlike life oddly enough auditing does not necessarily bring about its own track and its own mass because it is short track and it is singularly deprived of duress it is not something to worry about unless done in knuckleheaded fashion which puts person beyond help that would be crime you could audit someone badly enough it would probably take auditing him on the wrong goal to kill him perhaps but it would take some doing in prepchecking we had problem there is problem of alteration and problem of too great constancy one of the problems is that an inconstancy of approach by the auditor causes more trouble than an unusual solution heals buttons can be wonderful in the right circumstances but if the auditor is inventing them intuiting what is needed they can improve the pcs case but they lower his confidence because he cant predict what the auditor will say next the pc keeps coming out of session with his attention on the auditor this violates the definition of insessionness if you have constancy that works the four midruds that takes lot of edge off the case there could be more but what you are trying to do with model session is to make the pc auditable and to cause him to continue to be auditable the virtue of model session lies not in its processing value but in its predictability value and in the fact that it takes the edge off the things most likely to distract the pc hidden in any case is basic purpose prime postulate and earlier prime postulates it is amazing that we even have processes like model session and prepchecking that do something for the case over the top of those goals it is incredible that these processes make the pc feel better all the auditor wants them to do is to smooth out the needle so that he can find the pcs goal the conflict of goals is the senior aberration on the case any alteration of goal adds mass to it and the bank it is amazing that you can handle handle case phenomena with other processes assists etc but you cant solve the case permanently without recourse to goals it is difficult and sometimes impossible to help someone who has overts against that which is trying to help him you have to set the pc up by getting them off dont get spoiled by having good luck with one pc most require setup the other problem is metering you can ruin an emeters effectiveness on gradient by not quite really cleaning ruds as you hit them by neglecting instant reads an inexperienced auditor who overlooks the tiny reads that occur on ruds questions can easily and shortly get the pc into barely readable meter which only reads on the greatest of greats the auditor misses withholds from there on out that is the problem ending cycle too soon on ruds because of missing reads the other problem is being too careful and cleaning ruds that are already clean model session run strictly by the book is still not muzzled session the auditor still must maintain 2wc with the pc and can make sure the pc is content the rud is clean too many auditors withdraw from the session leaving model session to do the job and the pc wondering whether we are alive at all an advantage of repetitive rudiments is that only one skill is needed for repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking one of the problems is teaching number of technologies or procedures it is better to have one done superlatively than ten done indifferently repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking tend to get the pc talking to you cheerfully and happily blowing things and feeling better if they dont you are probably doing something unusual with them
