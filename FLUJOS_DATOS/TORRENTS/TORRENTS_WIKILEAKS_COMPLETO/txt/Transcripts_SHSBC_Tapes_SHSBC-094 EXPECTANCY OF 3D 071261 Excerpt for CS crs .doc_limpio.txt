expectancy of 3d lecture given on 7 december 1961 excerpt for cs course is there heater on there all right how are you today audience fine still getting in practice for the washington congress now what whats the date seventh audience seventh its the seventh all right and i think you just had sheet handed out here well now youve had an experimental sheet handed to you there have never been any runs on this sheet it is simply handed to you as trick pattern of command structure it has to be tested maybe one or two of you will be run on it but theres nothing very deadly about it but let point out to you here that you have an opportunity to clear with the pc problem situation difficulty confusion mest trouble whatever it is and what he considers the solution is solve made okay cured finished ended thatsthated or whatever he considers the thing is you see and then youve got thirty command which is fifteen bracket thirty commands with fifteen brackets which is pretty good because it covers just about everything and so on now youll find that some pcs will hang up little bit if you dont have others in the run and so forth this is very comprehensive coverage of this particular thing and i would say offhand that if you could run it with confusion it probably would run faster than with problem on quite few people but this gives you an opportunity to clear it all up this is let point out to you this is change there isnt any change here this just gives you this is all possible elements that you could run on 3d commands with all all effective brackets theres even you and you in there theres bracket in there tell problem you have had with you thats for those people amongst us who have valences all right well thats just its just tricky command sheet i handed it out to you more or less for your curiosity more than anything else and yet we will run it and probably do something with it but possibly itll be refined before it is generally issued i thought you might like to be on the upper end of the assembly line for moment okay audience thank you well ive practiced enough for the washington congress so ill sit down this is 7 dec still nautical month and we have the saint hill special briefing course and we have some people who that look wonderful and some people who look horrible im going to make to you just few random comments today i havent really very much to talk to you about youre all doing perfectly theres possible improvement that could be made either on your cases or your auditing you will recognize that except in few instances few instances your auditing could be improved and in few instances your cases could be improved you see but on the whole youre all perfect except you all right youre not getting sitting in the way down in the bull pit you might say with pc youre not getting broad view of the working of 3d and i might tell you something about this youre getting onepc view of it and your coffeeshop comments and thats thats little different so what are the expectancies of the thing and id better give you some idea of the expectancies of what would happen with pc on 3d and ill just take one through from start okay all right these are broad expectancies and these expectancies have been routinely borne out when these are not borne out there is its nothing its the assessment is wrong or something is goofy when you dont run into the phenomena which im going to list to you here why something is wrong all right this person staggers in see and hits both sides of the door and sits down to get audited and we put him on the emeter and we say well what were what did you have to eat for breakfast and he says what breakfast and you say this morning he says what what this morning that sort of thing well he is not in position to be audited with an assessment on 3d you wouldnt assess that person you ask this person various questions about life in general and the person seems to have tremendous amount of worry in present time ive already told you that present time an elephant stepping on your toe here and now even your little toe is far more important to you than an elephant who squashed your whole body few million years ago you you recognize this see peanut which you are not able to procure right now is far more important than an empire which you failed to secure several trillenia ago let point this out to you the havingness the further it goes back on the track why the more unlikely it seems and the importances of case must be concentrated to some degree at least over this lifetime and cant be concentrated in the last three minutes of life now if you find case that the rudiments are very hard to keep in on youre finding person whose life is constant problem unless you can do something for this it isnt likely you will ever get his attention off this constant immediacy onto what might have caused the immediacy hes not so much interested in what caused him to go broke hes interested in the fact that he hasnt got sou well that he hasnt got sou is whats worrying him and that the causes of his decline and going broke are the least possible interest to him the fact of the matter is hes broke and this is all he can concentrate on you see there he sits mental bankrupt and he hasnt any any margin on which to operate at all in other words his mind cannot play even easily over this lifetime you see he sits there and he says well when i go home this is going to happen and when i come back this is going to happen and then then ill go and so on i wonder what im going to do andandyou know its terrible and isnt life horrible right here and now well you try to get him split instant off of now and of course he has to at least have the idea of going then somewhat before you can get an assessment even though the assessment is in right here and now you understand that he he doesnt however appreciate that the assessment is in here and now he would much more easily have you take the elephant off of his little toe than to remove the empire off of his back you see because hes not very aware of this empire thats off on his back but he sure is aware of that elephant thats stepping on his toe you see hes very aware of that so this person is not in an assessable state because his concentration is well on the auditor is this fellow going to do in isnt he going to do in i dont know i was audited by somebody out in california one time and thats enough for anybody uh god isnt that terrible and is he going to fix up or isnt he or or is he really or is he just in it for the money or is there anything to scientology we dont know there is anything and uhyuhrruhrrr automaticity automaticity automaticity automaticity and hes saying well i dont know whether ill go home or not or whether ive got any money and car fare or whether i should take the bus or whether i should take the car i wonder if i should buy car and uh nahnahna and so on should i eat breakfast should i have steak for dinner or shouldnt i its very expensive i shouldnt have steak for dinner because i might have better have beans for dinner uh so forth i wonder what theyll think if i do have beans for dinner i wonder what bean and that thats just somebody with the rudiments out see well the process of getting rudiments in can be begun at that point and if you regard it more than just getting the rudiments in youll see what were talking about because it may take seventyfive hours to get the rudiments in all right from that point of natter natter present time elephant on my toe dont know what im going to do from that point for the next seventyfive hours he gradually gets back to point where he can look at this lifetime where he can sit in the auditing room where he can look at the auditor and keep his mouth shut while youre reading list to him now in other words youre youre into condition here where the individual can be fairly relaxed in session and therefore you can get the information that you want for an assessment so that is the usual condition of person as he moves into the perimeter of auditing in other words he doesnt know and its this way and then gradually over period of time particularly if you are doing something very effective like sec checking problems intensive racking around one way or the other curing up his bad memory anything you can think of that makes him easier gets the rudiments in gets some of his overts off gets him into communication with the auditor during that whole period of time you should be getting more and more responsive meter now if you read it always that the meter action should be loosening up you are going to make mistake because meter action can get get looser and tighter and so forth somewhat disassociated from the response of the pcs mind on the meter theres difference there the pc comes in feeling very relaxed and physically and feels very relaxed physically and actually does get fairly decent dial drop see feels pretty good well actually it doesnt really not follow and it doesnt really follow that his mental response to your questions is better it doesnt immediately follow the response of the meter to the question is not necessarily independent of this other but it is itself it is itself how much is the person reacting now ill lets give you an idea i might just have been auditing this person and i straightened them up and they feel fairly comfortable and theyve got dial drop on the can squeeze you see and the following morning an hpa student from central organization fumbles with the meter and asks him few questions and so on hell get dial drop he wont get any response you get the difference here hell hell still get the dial drop but he says this is different than what happened to yesterday and hes of course got present time problem he he says i dont know and i im not sure and what is this all about and hes thinking about this and the meter response to the auditor is the factor there which doesnt necessarily coordinate with the drop of the can squeeze do you follow that in other words your meter might be responding if somebody were making it respond or if the pc accepted who was making it respond now your job in the first seventyfive hours is getting the pc to accept the meter responding see he he accepts your communication he feels that its better its its all right to be audited by you now this is hard bridge for an auditor to cover during that particular period and its something that you should put your mind to this this is something that you should know as as an auditor yes you can goof up yes you can make mistakes but your auditing even the worst auditor in this unit at the present moment perhaps with one or two exceptions is better than most of the auditors in practically all the auditors in 1954 see theres theres heres difference of auditing here we cant go out on the basis entirely that it is quality of auditing let us assume that the auditor does halfway interested technically correct job on the pc all right now lets just take auditor who is doing halfway interested technically correct more or less job on the pc you see hes not doing perfect job hes not doing an imperfect job all right we have him in rotation audit fifteen pcs taken from different strata this is the same auditor and then without allowing those pcs without allowing auditor to do any advertising without allowing him to tell them how he is good auditor or any propagandizing at all we take these pcs and without permitting them to talk together we get each ones opinion of this auditor were going to get fifteen different qualities going to get fifteen different opinions of the same auditor and if these people are unaudited people by and large youre going to get fifteen bank expressions to something that had nothing to do with the auditor auditor was wearing yellow dress all right very good pc number one likes yellow so its good auditor pc number two doesnt like yellow so it must be bad auditor and itll be something as oddball as that during the first seventyfive hours you should actually not take to heart any opinion the pc has of your auditing you should not take it to heart at all because it has nothing to do with observation nothing to do with it at all its just his various reactivities reacting and ive noticed you as auditors worrying far too much about what the pc thought of you in the early stages of your auditing of the pc well the reason youre worried about it is because your rudiments arent in well your rudiments wouldnt be in it wouldnt matter what you did or if you had changed the color of your hair and wore funny nose youd have the same opinion exactly on the part of the pc of your auditing and if the pc well let give you better example did any of you ever have your parents get acquainted with you you see well this had very little to do with you but had great deal to do with your parents ability to observe they didnt observe very deeply and so they didnt know you very well thats about the way that adds up the pcs ability to observe during that first seventyfive hours of getting straightened up is negligible his powers of obnosis stink he could go down the street and you ask him im not talking now about strange offcolor neurotic personality i am talking about homo sap average issue school tie and the lot see and we have him walk down street one block and then ask him at the end of the block what have we just seen and you would be amazed you have either seen nothing or you have seen something else or the people you have passed have been entirely different people his obnosis the power of observing the obvious the ability to observe the obvious it just is not present so you actually should not feel bad or be influenced by this preclears opinion of you at all up until the time youve got 3d levels about threequarters of the way run because you see he cant observe this this is something you should keep in mind its quite important because ive seen pc who was sort of bad off curse and swear at one of the finest smoothest auditing jobs ive ever seen and ive seen pc who was apparently in fairly good condition and so forth totally satisfied with one of the lousiest auditing jobs i was ever punished to witness theres just the pc had nothing to do with this so what you do you see is you be satisfied with yourself you see am i turning in representative auditing job is my interest in the case adequate and is my technical accuracy as i work with this case is that adequate am i turning in representative auditing job is my technical skill there and thats it now if you have that confidence youll never get rocked otherwise you will continue to get rocked always because your job could be utterly perfect and you would still get your eyes clawed out by some pcs and your job could be horrible and you would still be kissed on both cheeks by other pcs you see oh my auditors wonderful auditor she gives such good advice between the auditing commands could get pretty wild couldnt it so its actually up to you to hold and maintain standard of auditing you have to know what is what does session look like and what should it look like and then just hold that standard thats all as best you can hold the standard just turn in good job of work on the thing one that you wont be ashamed of and one that you dont think id be ashamed of and youll youll have it made you see that is what counts it is your belief in your auditing job now that belief of course can be enormously influenced by the pc providing you are not sure whether or not youre turning in technically perfect auditing job as soon as you become sure of that pc in the world could shake you its only when you are doubtful about what you can do doubtful about your skill and doubtful about your technical accuracy that you can be shaken now you just go ahead and hold standard thats very easy to do and so on because the first long run here is not going to be done before reliable judge the pc he is not reliable judge in the first place hes hes even further introverted during session than he would normally be so he is frankly less capable of observing because youre trying to make him observe himself so his observation of you of course is very poor so dont pay any attention to that do you hear on this might practically save your bacon some day maybe if id told some auditor this earlier why maybe wed had few auditors who wouldnt feel so bad about some of their failures or something like this if somebody had ever told that i know i wouldnt feel so bad about some of mine so this is the way it goes because that first seventy five hours may if your technical accuracy is good and if youre doing the things and using the tools the way you should remember those tools are well put together dont dont think those tools arent youre going to see little change in beginning and end rudiments adapted to security checking or adapted to 3d you see youre going to see little variation between those two model sessions but the bulk and body of model session is unaltered these things are not altered your security checks theyre very set your problems intensive thats very well set the packaged processes which you have theyre very well set these things are not variables and you are not dealing with variables i could give you table and i will try to compile you table of what to do in almost any with any type of pc very simple table using exactly the tools you know how to use but those first seventyfive hours well you just do them now we get up to point where the pc has needle response i dont say that it takes seventyfive hours and i dont say that you graduated from saint hill and really knowing your stuff will not be able to get enough altitude over some pc who is sitting there kind of wideeyed and overwhumped anyhow and you say give your terminal bang you got it you see i mean crash the meter goes you get tremendous meter reads you see because you got altitude dont count on other auditors you train having the same altitude and dont make the mistake that i continue to make please profit by my mistake i make this mistake continually i can sit pc down i know my business i have altitude with the pc even when i dont have altitude with the pc and know my business i can get command value over the pc very rapidly i can really make meter read can really make it read all right so then i expect you to do the same thing thats not proper proper thing for to do but over the years over the years i have finally learned this fact one that i dont know what process will do until it is done out of my sight see i dont know what process will do and the other one is is that i have every reason to expect comparablelevel auditing from everybody who audits oh you thought i was going to say the reverse didnt you you can audit like that because i found out i audit the same way you audit except i just know what im doing and you dont know what youre doing and that unconfidence that you sometimes display at those crucial points on the thing is your only fault now all youve got to do is get that confidence and youve got it made im not saying then that pc raw meat could not be assessed on 3d youve got tremendous altitude with this pc and you sort of overwhump him and you hold him like frozen halibut insession and he responds and he hasnt any choice im not saying you cannot do this at the same time im not advising you to do it not that you couldnt get it not that it wouldnt be fine not that the pc wouldnt get tremendous gains not for those reasons but because youre not going to get that even run of it the bulk of the pcs which you sit down across from will not be in any shape to audit and youll be wasting your time on class ii skills when you should be assessing thats all so that you you should have enough nerve either yourself to set up somebody you care about great deal as pc to set them up perfectly for assessment and get the rudiments in or turn them over to somebody to be set up one way or the other so that you can assess them thats what you ought to be doing with it all right now what happens at this point of assessment well youve got needle response now dont expect the needle response to stay constantly good youve got these rudiments in sort of on the basis of mounting couple of toothpicks on the side of the empire state building you see and theres high wind and toothpicks are frail and theyre liable to fall off at any minute dont expect because you have invested seventyfive hours that they will stay in all youve done is guarantee that you can get them in thats all youve guaranteed with all of this actually the pc will feel better hell live better life hell think things are wonderful youve actually done something to change his way of existence hell think this is fine hell have more confidence in you these are all factors hell think these are gains you under your future experience will learn these arent gains at all they dont amount to hill of beans but they amount to something to the pc theyre more than the pc could get anywhere else from anybody else all right and youve just brought him up to point where you could get the rudiments in thats thats about all you could say you brought him up to point where at the beginning of session you have some guarantee that you can get the rudiments in and that they will stay in probably maybe throughout the session see probably i guess mmhm maybe you see but its more positive than that now you couldnt have gotten the rudiments in on him seventyfive hours before see so thats the single gain that you can expect to have made that you can get the rudiments in on the pc after the pc has been well prepared it isnt now that the rudiments will stay in on the pc they wont but they will be much much better much easier to keep in you wont find yourself coming into session and having to take up two hours of the session with present time problem see you can get the rudiment in as rudiment youve got him to position now where you can call he tells you he has present time problem and then you say well whats the prior confusion to it sec check it little bit and it blows and you can get on with the session do you understand but every session every few sessions you may find yourself confronted with some upheaval in his life which requires that you spend whole session putting him in some kind of shape every now and then even though hes been prepared youve just given yourself the fact that ordinarily you could get the rudiments in thats all youve done after all that period of time all right now we dont care whether the pc feels much better whether he thinks scientology is wonderful or whether he thinks its now horrible we care nothing about his opinion we just hope that he is in bit better communication with the auditor that is all we hope for this pc is going to keep telling you constantly well you know my left eye still twitches hmhmhmhmhmhm my left eye still twitches hmhmhmhmhm you know when you ran that problems intensive it didnt do my left eye bit of good hmhmhmhmhm you can kind of touch the head of the arm so that itll play the next groove1 but thats about all you can do about it because i can tell you frankly his left eye twitching is buried in the middle in some kind of wild goals problem situation that you couldnt have got to with an oilwell rig you see so just pat them on the back and say thats fine and they come in and they tell you it is so wonderful so wonderful i feel so free i feel so marvelous you know my chest longer hurts all these years my chest has been hurting and my chest doesnt hurt very much and i achmmmmm its marvelous what youve done for im so happy about the whole thing you say thank you thank you very much and get on with the game because you know very well his chest is going to turn on in full before it turns off again see you frankly havent you you havent done more than key few things out all right thats fine but if you expect to do anything horrendous for him you see in five hours of security checking and so forth disabuse yourself of the idea youre not whether hes happier or unhappier we couldnt care less its just whether or not we have to do that five hours of security checking while were assessing or do that five hours of security checking before we start assessing and its always smarter to do it before we start assessing thats thats all there is to that 1 this refers to the old record players which sometimes when the record was damaged sprung always back into the same groove instead of going forward
