procurement costs congresss decisions on this issue could affect future navy capabilities navy funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base aside from reducing planned ship procur ement rates options for responding to rising navy ship procurement costs include the following increasing annual navy sh ipprocurement funding changing the way navy ships are funded in the budget making greater use of multiyear procurement myp in navy ship procurement changing the acquisition strategy for building certain navy ships taking steps to reduce the amount of shipyard fixed overhead costs that are incorporated into the procurement costs of navy ships improving the operating efficiency of yards building navy ships building ships without some of thei r planned equipment or with less expensive substitute equipment and building ships in foreign shipyards where construction costs may belower to due lower wages and mate rial prices or other factors for additional comments relating to

following section of the repor t provides background information on notional options for lowercost attack subm arines aircraft carriers larger surface combatants and smaller surface combatants the section that follows discusses issues that congress may consider in assessing the merits the potential advantages and disadvantages of shiftin g to lowercost designs th final section of the report reviews recent legislative activity relating to rising navy ship procurement costs background recent reports proposing lowercost designs lowercost designs for attack submarin aircraft carriers larger surface combatants and smaller surface combatants have been proposed in recent reports on the future of the navy by the cbo2 dods office of force transformation oft3 and an independent policyre search organization called the center for strategic and budgetary assessments csba4 several of the lowercos t ship designs discussed below are taken from these reports basic approaches for arriving at lowercost designs options for lowercost navy ship desi gns can be generated by starting with currently planned navy ship designs nd making one or more of the following changes reducing ship size for given type of ship procurement cost tends to be broadly pr oportional to ship size reducing ship size can thus reduce procurement cost the navy can be viewed as using this strategy for the littoral combat ship lcs which is to be considerably smaller than existing major navy surface combatants but the strategy can be applied more widelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs3 shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion this is strategy that can be considered for the navys submarines and aircraft carriers whose current designs are nuclearpowered equipping navy ship with conventional ie fossilfuel propulsion plant rather than nuc lear propul sion plant can reduce the ships procurement cost by several hundred million dollars shifting from hull built to m ilitary survivability standards to hull built to commercials hip survivability standards hull built to military survivability standards has more armoring and internal compartmentalization than hull built to commercialship standards making it more expensive to build than commerciallike hull the navy is considering building ships for its planned maritime prepositioning force fut ure or mpff squadron with commerciallike hulls but the strategy can be applied more widely using common hull design for multiple ship classes using common hull design for multiple ship classes avoids the cost of designing new hull for each new class of ship and permits ship classes sharing common hull to benefit from imp roved production economies of scale regarding their hu lls the navy plans to use the hull design for its planned ddg 1000 formerly ddx destroyer as the hull for its planned cgx cruiser but the strategy can be applied more widely the oft re port proposes building four large surface ships an aircraft carrier missileandrocket ship an amphibious assault ship and sma llcraft mother ship using common merchantlike hull the csba report proposes using hull design for the navys lpd17 class amphibious ship for building other kinds of ships most of the lowercost ship options pres ented below use one or more of these four approaches information on the estimated procurement costs of the lowercost designs is presented when available lowercost ship designs using these approaches will in most cases be individually less capable than the currently planned ship designs from which they are derived and this is one of the assessment factors that is discussed in the final section of the report options for lowercost ships for each category of ship below the discussion describes the current design and then outlines potential lowercost options the discussions are descriptive only the potential advantages and disadvantages of shifting to the lowercost designs are discussed in the final section of the

seapower feb 2005 pp 22 2425aip submarines could be procured in tandem with virginiaclass boats one possibility for example would be to procure one virginiaclass boat plus one or more aip submarines each year the oft report recommended substituting four aip submarines for one virginiaclass submarine in each carrier strike group suggesting that four aip submarines might be procured for the sa cost 24 billion to 30 billion in the fy2006fy2011 fydp as one virginiaclass s ubmarine this suggests an average unit procurement cost for an aip submarine of roughly 600 million to 750 million each although aip submarines being built by other countries might cost this much to procure us navy aip submarine might be built to higher capability standards and consequently cost more to procure possibly reducing the equalcost ratio of substitution to three to one or possibly something closer two to one if so then the annual cost of procuring one virginiaclass ssn plus one two or perhaps three aip submarines could be equal to or less than that of procuring two virginiaclass boats per year reducedcost tango bravo ssn the virginia class was designed in the early to mid1990s using technologies that were available at the time new technologies that have emerged since that time may now permit th design of new ssn that is equivalent in capability to the virginia class design but substantially less expensive to procure the navy and darpa are now pursuing the development of these technologies under program called tango bravo name derived from the initial letters of the term technology barriers as described by the navy tango bravo w ill execute technology demonstration program to enable design options for reducedsize submarine with equivalent capability as the virginia class design implicit in this focus is the goal to reduce platform infrastructure and ultimately the cost of future design and production additionally reduced platform infrastructure provides the opportunity for greater payload volume the intent of this collaborative effort is to overcome selected technology barriers that are judged to have significant im pact on submarine platform infrastructure cost specifically darpa and the navy will jointly formulate technical objectives for critical technology demonstrations in shaftless propulsion b external weapons c conformal alternativ to the existing spherical array d technologies that eliminate or substantially simplify existing submarine systems and automation to reduce crew workload for standard tasks10 some navy and industry offi cials believed in 2004 that if these technologies are developed it might be possible to design new submarine equivalent in capability to the virginia class but with procurement cost of perhaps 75 of the virginiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs6 11 for more on cvn77 and cvn78 see crs report rs20643 navy cvn21 aircraft carrier program background and issues for congress by ronald orourkeclass such submarine could more easily be procured within available resources at rate of two per year consequently as an alternative to th option of procuring aip submarines another option would be to start design work now on new tango bravo ssn the idea of designing submarine with capability equivalent to that of virginiaclass and procurement cost that is less than that of the virginia class has been discussed by navy and industry officials under th is option virginiacla ss procurement could continue at one per year until the tango bravo submarine was ready for procurement at which point virginiacla ss procurement would end and procurement of the tango bravo submarine would begin if design work on tango bravo subm arine is begun now and pursued in concerted manner the first tango

carriers or any othe r aircraft carrier now in operation the oft report recommended subs tituting eight of these 13500ton carriers for each of the navys current large carriers so that the number of manned ai rcraft based at sea would remain about the same additional potential options studies of aircraft carrier acquisition options over the years have discusse d many other potential designs including the following large conventionally powered carrier such ship which might use the same hull design as cvn78 might displace about 100000 tons it would be broadly similar to the kitty hawk cv

mediumsized carriers of 40000 to 70000 t ons might operate either vstol or ctol aircraft though ships at the higher end of this size range might be able to operate ctol aircraft more easily or

1993 and 1999 procurement of nuclearpowered cr uisers was halted after fy1975 due largely to desire to constrain the procurement costs of future cruisers in deciding in the late 1970s on the design for the new cruiser that would carry the aegis defense system two nuclearpowered design options were rejected in favor of the option of placing the aegis system onto the smaller conventionally power ed hull developed for the spruance dd963 class destroyer the resulting design became the ticonderoga cg47 class aegis cruiser the first aegis cruiser was procured in fy1978 although nuclear power was abandoned for navy cruisers it was retained for the na vys large aircraft carriers because adding nuclear power increases total ship procuremen t cost in percentage terms less for large carrier than for cruiser and because the m obility advantages of nuclear power for surface ship see the discussion on mobility in the next section of the report were viewed as important for carriers in light of their combat capabilities and limited numbers some observers believe that if oil prices are deemed likely to remain high the option of nuclear powered surface combatants might bear revisitinga total

unit procurement cost of about 800 million 6000ton ffgx might be too small to be equipped with the ags in which case it could not provide the additional naval gunfire capability that would be provided by the ddg1000 6000ton ffgx might however be capable of performing the nongunfire missions that would be performed by both the ddg1000 and the lcs 6000ton ffgx would coul d be viewed as replacement in

surface combatant option recommended in the oft report is large missileandrocket ship based on the same 57000ton commerciallike hull design that the repor t recommended using as the basis for

in fy2005 and another three were procured in fy2006 the pr oposed fy2007 budget requests funding for another two the navy wants the procurement cost of each lcs sea frame ie the basic version of the ship without any modul ar weapons systems to be more than 220 million figures from the fy2006fy2011 fydp suggest that when the cost of the mission modules is added in the lcs program might have an average ship procurement cost of about 387 million and that program of 55 might therefore have total acquisition ie research nd development plus procurement cost of about 221 billion28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs14 1000ton surface combatant rather than procuring the lcs the oft report recommended procuring 1000ton surface combatant like the lcs this ship would have maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots and standard interf aces for accepting various modular missi on packages and would selfdeploy to the theater of operations the ship would be supported in theater by one or more larger types of ships that were also recommended by oft 100ton surface combatant as an alternative to the 1000ton surface combatant the oft report recommended procuring 100ton surface combatant with maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting various modular mission packages these ships woul d be transported to the theater by mother ship based on the same 57000t on commerciallike hull used for ofts proposed mediumsized airc raft carrier the 100ton surface combatants would be supported in theater by the mother ship nd possibly another larger ship that was recommended by oft issues for congress the potential lowercost ship designs ou tlined above can be assessed in terms of cost capability technical risk homeporting arrangements and potential impact on the shipbuilding industrial base cost although the potential ship designs outlined in the previous section would have lower unit procurement costs than currently planned designs complete assessment of the cost implications of these options would take into account development and design cost procurement cost lifecycle operation and support co st and end oflife disposal costs each of these are discussed below development and design cost developing and designing large complex navy ship can cost billions of dollars consequently if currently planned ship has already been developed and design ed stopping that program in favor of new lowercost design could incur subs tantial additional velopment and design costs and consequently might save money over the long run ie reach the financial breakeven point compared to continuing w ith the current design only if the lower cost design is procured in large enough total numbers so that the cumulative procurement savings were greater than the additional upfront development and design costs the earlier in the development and design process that an existing ship acquisition program is stopped the earlier in the future it might be that lowercost alternative design might reach the breakeve n point in addition if lowercost ship could use many of the same technologies intended for the moreexpensive ship or technologies already developed for other sh ips then the cost to develop the new design could be reduce d perhaps substantially procurement cost through process common to many manufacturing activities called moving down the learning cu rve the number of shipyard labor hours required to build ship design decreases as shipyard builds more ships to thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs15 29 for more on learningcurve effects in navy shipbuilding see crs report 96785 navy major shipbuilding programs and shipbuild ers issues and options for c ongress by ronald orourke pp 59 95110 out of print available from the authordesign and shipyard workers become increasingly familiar with the design29 consequently if some number of ships have already been built to currently planned design the difference in cost between that design and the first units of lowercost alternative design might be less than if the currently planned design had not yet entered production and the break even point for the lowercos t design will be further into the production run than if the curren tly planned design had not yet entered production on the other hand if the lowerc ost design can be procured at greater annual rate than the currently planned design eg two sh ips per year for the lower cost design vs one ship per year for the currently planned design then the lower cost design could benefit from greater sp reading of the shipyards annual fixed overhead costs and also move down the lear ning curve more quickly and achieve the costreducing benefits of the learning curve more fully than the currently planned design lifecycle operation and support cost navy ships are expensive to operate and support and can remain in service for many years 20 or more years for small combatant 30 or more years for an attack submarine or larger surface combatant and up to 50 years for an aircraft carrier c onsequently although ship procurement costs are often more visi ble in the budget than ship costs ships lifecycle cost can contribut as much as or even more than its procurement cost to total longterm navy expenditures personnel and main tenance costs reducing ships lifecycle cost can sometimes involve including design features that increase its procurement cost personnel costs are major component of ship costs and reducing crew size can involve fitting the ship with t echnology for automating functions that were previously performed by people including damage control which is function that traditionally has contributed to need for larger crews if the cost of added technology is greater than the avoided ex pense of building extra crewrelated spaces into the ship then adding the technology will increase the ships procurement cost maintenance costs are another major component of ship costs and reducing maintenance costs might require building certain parts of the ship with moredurable but moreexpensive materials or increasin g the size and thus construction cost of certain spaces on the ship so as to provide room for easier access during maintenance in light of these considerations it is possible for an alternative ship design to have lower procurement cost in part because it incorporates features that give it higher lifecycle cost if so then procuring this ship rather than the currently planned design might not re duce total navy expenditures over the long run as much as might be expected by looking only at ship procurement costs fuel costs the lifecycle cost of conventionally powered ship includes the cost of all the fuel the ship uses over its life that is not the case for nuclearpowered ships because the procurement cost of nuclearpowered shiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs16 30 source for cost figures telephone discu ssion with naval nuclear propulsion office may 21 2004 the 158million figure is for 33year core for virginiaclass submarine while the 300 million figure is for 25year core for the aircraft carrier cvn78 both figures are in constant fy2005 dollars 31 telephone consultation with the office of the navy nuclear propulsi on program apr 28 2005 the office stated that the total cost to inactivate dismantle and dispose of retired nuclearpowered submarine is currently about 64 million and that work related to the reactor compartment accounts for roughly half of this total the office stated that the currently estimated cost to inactivate the nuc learpowered carrier enterprise cvn65 in 2013 is about 11 billion in thenyear dollars which equates to about 830 m illion in continuedincludes the cost of the nuclear fuel core that is loaded into the ships reactor at the time the ship is built in the case of nuclearpowered attack submarine that fuel core in 2004 cost about 158 million and is desi gned to power the ship for its entire 33year expected life while in the case of nuclearpowered carrier the core in 2004 cost about 300 million and is designed to pow er the ship for onehalf of its 50year expected life30 consequently although nuclearpower ed submarine or carrier is more expensive to procure than an otherwise equal conventionally powered submarine or carrier the nuclearpowered submarine will incur fuelrelated costs over its lifetime while the conventi onally powered carrier will incur fuelrelated costs during the first half of its lifetime this difference in accounting for fuel co sts means that when procurement and lifecycle costs are added together the difference in cost between nuclear powered submarine and conventionally submarine will be smaller than the difference in procurement cost alone the same can true in comparing nuclear powered carrier to conventionallypowered carrier if the cost of the nuclear powered carriers second core is less than the cost of the conventionally powered carriers fuel over its entire life the hi gher the price of oil during conventionally powered carriers life the more likely this is to be the case more general consideration arising out of this discussion is that other things held equal the higher that oil costs are expected to be in coming decades the more costeffective nuclear power might be comp ared to conventional power for powering given type of ship in theory if the co st of oil is high enough the total ownership cost ie the sum of procurement cost lif ecycle cost and endoflife disposal cost discussed below of nuclear power ed ship could be less than that of an otherwiseequal conven tionally powered ship endoflife disposal cost other things held equa l nuclearpowered ships have higher endoflife disposal costs th an conventionally powered ships because of the need to defuel cut out and seal up the reactor compartment and transport it to the permanent navy reactorplant storage area at the hanford nuclear reservation in washington state for nuclearpowered s ubmarine this work might cost about 30 million to 35 million while for nuclearpower ed carrier which has much larger nuclear propulsion plant it might cost roughly 570 million31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs17 31 continued fy2005 dollars and that work related to th reactor compartment accounts for about 570 million of this 830million figure 32 the navys 100000ton carriers for example are about 11 times as large as the navys 9000ton ddg51 class destroyers and both type s of ships have maximum sustained speed of more than 30 knots in term s of shaft horsepower however the carriers propulsion plant is less than three times as powerful as the ddg51class propulsion plant about 280000 shaft horsepower vs about 100000 shaft horsepower respectively 33 david perin are big decks still the answer us naval institute proceedings june 2001 pp 3033capability as mentioned earlier lowercost ship designs in most cases will be individually less capable than their highercost counterpa rts one exception to this might be the reducedcost tango bravo ssn which might be equal in capability to the virginia class design due to its use of the more advanced technologies being pursued under the navydarpa tango bravo program aspects of capability that may be c onsidered include ship payload ship detectability and survivability ship mobility and the value of ship numbers in naval operations payload as the size of navy combat ship decreases its total payload the weight and volume of the ships sens ors weapon launchers weapons related computers and displays aircraft and fuel tends to decrease indeed due to certain factors relating to ship design as ship size decreases payload can often decrease more quickly making the smaller ship not just less capable than the larger ship but proportionately less capable one factor contributing to this effect relates to propulsion as ship size increases the am ount of horsepower needed to move ton of the ships weight through the water at certain speed tends to decrease as result as ship size increases the size of the propulsion plant increases less than proportionately leaving proportiona tely more room for payload32 consequently for example as the size of an aircraft carrier is reduced the total weight of the aircraft that can be embarked on the carrier can decline even more quickly 40000ton lharbased medium sized carrier for example is about 40 as large as 100000 ton carrier but its potential air wing of about two dozen aircraft might have total we ight equivalent to less than 40 of the 75 aircraft on the 100000ton carrier moreover if mediumsized carriers air wing is transf erred to larger carrier the larger carrier may be able to use that air wing to generate more sorties ie flights per day because of its larger f light deck and greater fuel and ordnance capacities according to one study for example carrier capable of embarking 75 aircraft can with 55aircra ft air wing generate 40 mo re strike sorties per day than mediumsized carrier that is si zed for that same 55aircraft air wing33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs18 34 the oft report makes the second argumentreducing ship size can in addition to reducing total payloa d make it difficult or impossible for ship to be equipped with certain desired systems carrier smaller than certain size for example would not be able to operate ctol aircraft while surface combatant smaller than certain size could not be equipped with certain large radars sonars miss ilelaunching tubes or guns principal implication of payload decreasing more rapidly than ship size is that the total cost to put certain collection of combatrelated equipment to sea can go up as the size of the ships used to put the equipment to sea goes down if total fleet payload is held constant in other words then reducing unit procurement costs by shifting to smaller ships can lead to fleet design with higher total procurement cost in addition if crew size nd fuel consumption does not go down proportionately with ship size then similar effect coul d occur with regard to total fleet operation and support costs the oft report counters some of thes points by arguing that using new technologies would permit the payload fraction of its recommended 1000 and 100 ton surface combatants to be greater than what would have been possible in the past another counterargument is that improvements in precisionguidance technology for weapons is permitting weapon size to be reduced becau smaller warhead that lands precisely on target can do the same am ount of damage to the target as larger warhead that lands less precisely as re sult it could be argu ed payload related to weapons and weapon launchers can be reduced without reducing the ships capability any improvements in technolog that would permit reduction in the weight and volume of sensors eg radars or sonars could lead to similar argument relating to the sensor tion of ships payload detectability nd survivability supporters of larger ships could argue that with careful design and c onstruction large ship can be made more susceptible to detection by enemy sensor s eg radars sonars or in frared sensors than much smaller ship they could also argue that other things held equal larger ships and ships built to military survivability standards are better able to withstand hit from weapon of given size than smaller sh ip or ship built with an equalsized commerciallike hull larger ship or ship built to military survivability standards they could argue might be able to conti nue operations to some degree after being hit or would at least would not be sunk whereas smaller ship or ship built with commerciallike hull is more likely to be sunk or rendered co mpletely operable supporters of smaller ships or ships built with commercia llike hulls could argue that making larger ships less detectable adds to their cost and that fleet composed of large number of small ship s could by presenting the enemy with large number of targets overwhelm the enemys targettracking capabilities34 they could also argue that even large ships built to military survivability standards can be sunk or put out of operation and that fl eet consisting of relatively small number of such ships concentrates too large fraction of the fleets total capability and replacement value in each individual platform they could argue that the most important measure of survivability is not individualship survivability but overallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs19 fleet survivability and that fleet consisting of larger number of smaller ships can have superior overall fleet survivability they could also argue that us leaders might be averse to using expensive highly capable navy ships in certain highthreat situations because they would not want to risk one or more of them being heavily damaged or sunk in which case the effectiv utility of these ships would be reduced mobility nuclear power since nuclear propulsion plan ts do not require access to the atmosphere to generate pow er equipping submarine with nuclear propulsion plant produces fundamental change in ship m obility and consequently in the kinds of operations for which the submarine may be suitable some obs ervers particularly supporters of nuclearpowered submarines have stated that without nuclear power ships referred to as submarines are simply submersibles ships that occasionally and for limited periods of time operate below the surface nd that it is the addition of nuclear power that creates true s ubmarine ship whose primary operating environment is below the surface as mentioned earlier an aip system such as fuelcell or closedcycle diesel engine extends the stationary or lowspeed submerged endurance of nonnuclearpowered submarine conven tional dieselelectri c submarine has stationary or lowspeed submerged enduran ce of few days while an aipequipped submarine may have stationary or low speed submerged endurance of up to two or three weeks an aip system does not however significantly increase the highspeed submerged endurance of nonnuclearpower ed submarine nonnuclearpowered submarine whether equipped with conve ntional dieselelect ric propulsion system or an aip system has highspeed subm erged endurance of perhaps 1 to 3 hours performance limited by the electrical storage capacity of the submarines batteries which are exhausted quickly at high speed in contrast nuclearpowered submarin submerged endurance at any speed tends to be limited by the amount of food th at it can carry in practice this means that nuclearpowered submarine can remain submerged for weeks or months at time operating at high speeds whenever needed as consequence of their very limite d highspeed submerged endurance non nuclearpowered submarines even those equipped with aip systems are not well suited for submarine missions that require long completely stealthy transits from home port to the theater of operation submerged periods in the theater of operation lasting more than two or three weeks or submerged periods in the theater of operation lasting more than few hours or days that involve m oving the submarine at something more than low speedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs20 35 the strategy of transporting the aip submarines to the theater using transport ships is not mentioned in the report but was explaine d at feb 18 2005 meeting between crs and analysts who contributed to the oft reportwith regard to the first of the three points above the oft report proposes transporting the aip submarines into the overseas theater of operations aboard transport ship35 in doing so the oft report accepts that the presence of certain number of us aip submarines in the theater of operations will become known to others potential forcemultiplying attribute of having an ssn in carrier strike group in contrast is that the ssn can be detached from the strike group and redirected to different theater to perform some other mission without alerting others to this fact opposing forces in the strike groups theater of operations could not be sure that the ssn was not in thei r own area and could therefore continue to devote resources to detecting and countering it this would per mit the ssn to achieve milita ry effects in two theaters of operation at the same time the strike groups theater of operations and the other theater to which it is sent with regard to the second and third poi nts above the effectiveness of an aip submarine would depend on what kinds of operations the submarine might need to perform on daytoday basis or in conflic t situations while operating as part of forwarddeployed carrier strike group for aircraft carriers the effects of adding nuclear power are less dramatic than they are for submarines but still significant nuclearpowered carriers can make highspeed transits over long distances to respond to urgent crises without need for stopping or slowing down to refuel along th way they do not need to be refueled upon arriving at the area of operations permitting them to commence combat operations immediately upon arrival and ce they do not need large fuel tanks to store fossil fuel for their own propulsion plan t they can devote more of their internal volume to the storage of airc raft fuel and ammunition whic h permits them to sustain combat operations for longer periods of time before they need to be resupplied maximum speed proponents of higherspeed ships like the lcs the 13500ton carrier recommended in the oft report or the 1000 or 100ton surface combatants recommended in the oft report argue that the higher maximum speeds of these ships increases their capability by enabling them to shift locations more rapidly and making them more difficult for the enemy to track and target skeptics could argue that the advantages of ship speeds much higher than about 30 knots are unproven or overrated ship numbers in naval operations advocates of fleet with larger number of ships which is something that might be facilitated by shifting to lower cost ship designs argue that ship ca nnot be in two places at the same time and consequently that fleet with larger number of ships woul d be better able to maintain daytoday presence in multiple locations around the world or be better able to respond to simultaneous crises or conflicts in multiple locations fleet consisting of larger number of lesscapable ships they could argue might offer more flexibility for responding to situati ons with an appropria amount of navalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs21 36 the oft report makes this point from budgetary perspective as well arguing that fleet consisting of lowercost ships can be adjusted in size more smoothly to adapt to changes in available funding levels 37 for more on networkcentric warfare see crs report rl32411 network centric warfare background and oversi ght issues for congress by clay wilson and crs report rs20557 navy networkcentric warfare concept key programs and issues for congress by ronald orourke 38 for additional discussion of this point see crs report rs21338 navy ship deployments ne w approaches background and issues for congress by ronald orourkecapability as opposed to being forced to deploy naval force with more capability than needed at high daily cost36 advocates of fleet with larger number of ships could also argue that under the theory of networkcentric warfare the capability of the force grows as func tion of the number of nodes eg ships aircraft unmanned vehicles and distributed sensors th at make up the network and that increasing the number of ship node s will consequently increase the total capability of the force37 advocates who make this last argument in some cases might argue that in light of networking and other advanced technologies us military forces in general should shift to less concentrated and more highly distributed force designs defenders of fleet consisting of sm aller number of moreexpensive ships could argue that being able to deploy sh ips to greater number of locations around the world might be of limited value if those ships are lesscapable designs that are not capable of performing required missions th ey could also argue that the navy has taken steps in recent years to increase the fraction of the fleet that is deployed or ready to be deployed at any given time mitigating the effects of having relatively limited total number of ships in the fleet38 they could argue that current ship designs already provide adequate flexibility for creating naval formations with appropriate amounts of capability for responding to various situations they could also argue that when numbers of aircraft unmanned vehicles nd distributed sensors are taken into account fleet consisting of smaller number of moreexpensive ships would still have an ad equate number of nodes for gaging in networkcentric warfare technical risk of the lowercost options outlined earlier those that might pose some technical risk for the navy include the aipe quipped nonnuclearpowered submarine b ecause nonnuclearpowered submarine has not b een designed and built for the us navy since the 1950s the tango bravo nuclear powered submarine because of the need to mature the tango bra vo technologies the 13500ton highspeed carrier because of its fairly large sescatamaran hull design and perhaps the 1000 and 100ton surface combatants because of the new t echnologies that are intended to increase their payload fractionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs22 homeporting arrangements smaller ships might offer wider ra nge of homeporting possibilities because some ports might not have large enough be rthing spaces or deep enough waters to accommodate ships of more than certain size homeporting nuclearpowered carrier or submarine can be more complex undertaking than homeporting conventiona lly powered ship due to requirements that are unique to nuclearpowered ships such as having access in the home port to nuclearcertified maintenance shop in addition gaining permission to forward homeport navy ship in foreign country can be politically more difficult if the ship in question is nuclearpowered and there are substantial antinuclear sentiments in the intended host country impact on shipbuilding industrial base lowercost ship designs could affect the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of navy shipbuild ing work or the distribution of that work among various shipyards total volume of work the total volume of navy shipbuilding work is to large degree function of the total am ount of funding available for navy ship procurement consequently the effect th at shifting to lowercost designs might have on the total volume of shipbuilding work would depend to large degree on whether the shift somehow affects the total amount of funding available for navy ship procurement at least three scenarios are possible one possibility is that shifting to lowercost designs does not substantially affect the total am ount of funding available for navy ship procurement in which case the total volume of navy shipbuilding work might not change substantially second possibility is that the shift to lowercost designs is used to reduce the total cost of building the same total number of ships as previously planned in which case the total volume of navy shipbuilding work would be reduced third possibility is that the shift to lowercost designs makes navy ships appear more costeffective compared to competing navy or dod programs in which case the to tal amount of funding available for navy ship procurement might be increased enabling an increase in the total volume

military capabilities may create an overreliance on individual mega systems that are potentially more expensive and timeconsuming to develop than less sophisticated but capable systems thes increases

unrealistic when those ships near completion of construction the committee notes that in several cases it has been informed that ship cost estimates delivered to the co mmittee in prior years either intentionally or unintentionally excluded certain known shipbuilding costs such as escalation and that these cost estimates were known to be inaccurate on the day they were first delivered to the committee the committee recommends that the process for deriving ship cost estimates be revised to ensure that all major known elements of ship cost are routinely incl uded in all ship cost estimates the committee notes that sections 122 123 and 124 of the bill would impose cost limitations on three current ship classes based on the navys latest costs estimates the committee further notes that the imposition of these statutory cost limitations makes the need for high level of confidence in the cost estimates for these ship classes unusually important accordingly the committee directs that the secretary of th navy revalidate the cost estimates for cvn21 for the ships currently programmed in the lha replacement program and for the eight ships of the san antoni class amphibious ship that follow the lead ship the committee further directs that the revalidated costs estimates be submitted for review and approval by the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics finally the committee directs that later than july 1 2006 the secretary of the navy submit report in writing to the congressional defense committees containing the revalidated cost estimates for these ship classes including certifica tion by the secretary that all known and anticipated major elements of cost have been included in the estimate page 71 regarding the ddg1000 program the report also stated the committee does not believe the ddx is affordable the committee understands there is prospect of being able to design and build the two lead ships for the 66 billion budgetedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs26 originally the navy proposed building 32 next generation destroyers reduced that to 24 then finally to 7 in order to make the program affordable in such small numbers the committee struggles to see how the original requirements for the next generation destroyer for example providing naval surface fire support can be met by reducing the requirements for the ddx smaller less expensive destroyer could be procured in greater numbers because of its expense the committee does not believe that ddx will be procured in sufficient numbers to meet the operational need the committee supports the construction of up to two ddxs to demonstrate technologies that could be incorporated into future more affordable major surface combatants pages 6970 regarding section 1014 and other measures intended to improve the efficiency of navy shipbuilding the report states maritime technology the budget request contained funds in pe 78730n for the maritime technology program the committee understands that the purpose of the maritime technology maritech program is to reduce the cost of naval ship construction modification and repair by enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the us shipbuilding and ship repair industries the committee understands that since the late 1970s the navy has consider ed capital for facility investments to be an allowable cost on contracts that are not firm fixed price the committee is also aware that in the past three ye ars the navy and industry have agreed to specific recapitalization contract incentives in the virginia class submarine and the cvn21 programs these incentive clauses have allowed the navy and the contractors to identify improvements in sequencing and build processes to lower construction costs the committee encour ages the expansion of these efforts to all ship procurements including the lewis and clark take class program the committee includes provision section 1014 that creates shipbuilding industrial base improvemen t program through which the secretary of the navy shall award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards to improve their productivity and cost effec tiveness these authorities will allow the navy to work to an even greater ex tent with shipbuilders to identify and finance process changes equipment inve stments and facilities improvements to lower the cost of navy ship procuremen t the committee expects that these authorities will allow the navy to achieve savings in the construction of the t ake class ships in addition to other ship classes and improve the competitiveness of us shipyards consequently the committee recommends providing funds for the shipbuilding i ndustrial base improvement program and for the enhancement of the us shipbu ilding and ship repair industrial base the committee recommends 1200 million in pe 78730n for the maritime technology program national shipbuilding research program the budget request contained funds in pe 78730n for the national shipbuilding research programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs27 the committee understands that the national shi pbuilding research program nsrp provides unique collaborativ environment where shipbuilders and government agencies examine processes tooling and management techniques to improve the efficiency of the united states shipbuilding industry the committee understands that nsrp operates on 5050 cost share between government and industry all results are shared with all members and conservative estimate for nsrps return on investment is five to one the committee recommends 200 million in pe 78730n for the national shipbuilding research program shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants the budget request contained funds in pe 78730n for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants the committee understands the national security importance of sustaining viable and efficient shipbuilding and ship repair industries in the united states accordingly the committee recommends pr oviding grants to us shipyards to facilitate the development of innovativ design and production technologies and processes for naval vessel construction and the development of modernized shipbuilding infrastructure the committee recommends 500 million in pe 78730n for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees the budget request contained funds in pe 78730n for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees the committee understands the national security importance of sustaining viable and efficient shipbuilding and ship repair industries in the united states accordingly the committee recommends providing loan guarantees to us shipyards to facilitate the acquisition of technologies processes and infrastructure to enhance the effici ency and competitiveness of the us shipbuilding and ship repair industries the committee recommends 500 million in pe 78730n for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees pages 192193 senate section 121 of s 2766 would au thorize 4year incremental funding and economic order quantity eoq purchas of longlead components for cvn21 class aircraft carriers s ection 123 would increase previously legislated cost limit on cvn77 to 6057 million regarding section 121 on procurement of aircraft carriers the senate armed services committee in its report s rept 109254 of may 9 2006 on s 2766 stated in reviewing the budget request for fiscal year 2006 the committee received testimony from the navy and industry that the low rate of shipbuilding was driving higher costs which in turn fu rther reduced shipbuild ing rates creatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs28 downward spiral the committee belie ves that stable ship requirements increased funding in the shipbuildin g budget and increased flexibility for funding large capital ships are critical elements of any strategy to reverse this trend elsewhere in this report the committee has expressed concern with cost growth on the cvn77 program and has urged the navy and the shipbuilder to identify opportunities to improve afford ability of future aircraft carriers procurement delays excess inflation and material escalation have been reported as significant contributors to cvn77 cost growth the shipbuilder has proposed to achieve significant cvn21 class program savings through stable procurement plan and through procurem ent of economic order quantity material for cvn79 and cvn80 in conjunction with cvn78 procurement in view of the potential for significant program savings the committee recommends an increase of 500 million in scn for cvn21 class advance procurement and directs the secretary of the navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the cvn21 class the secretary is to submit report to the congressional defense committees with the fiscal year 2008 budget request outlining the advance procurement requirements to potentially optimize economic order quantity savings and escalation avoidance to include offsetting factors for the firs t three vessels of the cvn21 class of the amount authorized to be appropriated for advance procurement for cvn79 and cvn80 none of the funds are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the s ecretarys report page 67 regarding section 123 on the cost limit for cvn77 the report states the procurement cost increase to 6057 billion which equals the governments maximum contractual liab ility is attributed to extraordinary escalation impacts increased labor hours and overhead rates and costs related to schedule delays the fiscal ye ar 2007 budget request included 3484 million for cvn77 cost growth with the balanc of additional funding to be included in future budget requests the committee is aware that the navy has taken series of management actions to cont ain cost on cvn77 including deferral of upgrades that are not required for safe system operation or certification minimization of contract change orders implementation of joint navyshipbuilder lean sixsigma program and schedule revision to enable more efficient completion of cvn77 the committee is concerned however that despite these management actions the navy is projecting cvn77 cost to grow to the contract ceiling in excess of 30 percent above the baseline cost cap the committee notes that the secretarys report to congress on the longrange plan for construction of naval vessels establishes cost estimates for future ship construction which target improved performance based on series of management actions similar to ong oing efforts to control cvn77 cost visibility into cost perform ance while completing cvn77 is necessary in order to assess the effectiveness of these management actions and will assist in determining further actions necessary to improve affordability of the future force improved visibility into completion cost performance will also afford greater opportunity to deliver cvn77 below the contract ceiling accordingly the secretary of the navy is directed to s ubmit quarterly report to the congressional defense committees beginning december 1 2006 providing the following information regarding the cvn77 ship construction contracthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs29 1 contract target cost 2 program managers estimate at completion 3 contractors estimate at completion 4 contract ceiling price 5 end of period actual costs and 6 percent progress page 69 regarding the littoral combat ship lcs program the report states the construction of lead lcs vessels at two shipyards inherently adds cost risk which will persist until these ships near completion in 2007 and 2008 the emphasis on cost control would dict ate that the navy pursue competition commonality and the results of learning curves to the extent practical in the procurement of this 55 ship class the committee views lcs as an important component of the navys strategy for conducting the global war on terror and has supported the navys approach to rapidly field this capability the design and construction of lcs in parallel with development of the mission modules requires heightened management of program risk to ensure affordable full mission capability of the lcs program however the committee is concerned that the affordability appeal of the lcs program is being overtaken by apparent cost growth and that the rapid ramp up in lcs procurement will compound the issue the stated emphasis on affordability is obscured by the absence of clear acquisition strategy to guide strategic program decisions additionally it is unclear that the navy has assessed the added cost for training maintenance configuration mana gement planning and engineering and supply support for the two flight 0 ship cla sses further by virtue of budgeting the costs for procuring the flight 0 lcs vessels in three different appropriations total costs for the programs start are difficult to discern in view of these concerns the committee directs the secretary of the navy to submit report on the lcs program later than december 1 2006 to the congressional defense committees the report shall outline the navys acquis ition strategy for the program including the competition pla n the flight strategy and the cost containment strategy for the program c ontain clear representation of all rd and procurement costs for the total program and assess the added life cycle costs associated with operation and support fo

researchto implementation transition rate the comm ittee believes that continuation of the nsrpase provides vital contribution towards achieving the overarching objective of improving the affordability of naval warship construction and maintaining healthy innovative shi pbuilding industrial base the committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs30 recommends an increase of 100 million in pe 78730n to support nsrpase efforts including 1 establishing comprehensive national program for development and training of skilled shipbuildin g production and engineering workforce 2 establishing concept for na tional supply chain that will enable leveraging buying power across product lines in an effort to reduce the high cost of material in ship construction 3 exploring secondary and

2006 on hr 5631 stated that the committee believes that the viability of the navys long range shipbuilding plan will remain tied to the services ability to control costs in ship design and construction navy leadership agrees that cost control is essential but the navy has produced plan or initiatives to meet the cost targets assumed in the long range shipbuilding plan furthermore the recent history of ongoing shipbuilding programs indicates the trend in cost growth may be getting worse and not better the committee encourages the navy to set firm cost targets in its future shipbuilding programs to develop specifi c initiatives addressing cost control and to sign contracts that reduce th likelihood of cost growth page 139 the report recommended reducing by 1414 million the navys request for fy2007 procurement funding to cover cost gr owth on ships procured in prior years the report stated the committee remains concerned over the lack of cost control in navy shipbuilding programs in last years report the committee noted the rising cost growth in ongoing ship construction c ontracts and required the navy to submit plan on resolving these issues that report was submitted two months late and was little more than summary of cost ove rruns in shipbuilding over the past two decades the committee is concerned about the gap between the navys public statements about the need for firm cost controls and the programmatic and contractual actions needed to accomplish that objective navy briefings this year document litany of programs including the cvn77 aircraft carrier and certain attack submarines of the virginia class th at continue to defy attempts to control costs the navy estimates an overrun of 867900000 over the next 3 years alone in the cvn77 production effort these funds cannot be obligated without congressional legislation to raise the current cost cap on the program cap that was put in place several years ago to control costs the fiscal year 2007 budget requests 136000000 for further cost gr owth in the uss texas ssn 775 and cost performance on the uss north carolina ssn777 is seriously below navy expectations in fact current cost performance on the virginia class jeopardizes the ability of the navy to meet the performance goals of the multiyear contract signed in 2004 as well as cost targets needed to increase the submarine production rate in future years the committee is unwilling to provide increased appropriations for cost overruns in the absence of compelling justification or realistic and detailed plan for cost control the committee recommendation provides 436449000 for completion of prior year shipbuilding programs reduction of 141400000 from the request the reduction should be allocated against the following programs cvn77 30000000 ssn777 48000000 ssn776 10000000 ssn775 10000000 and the lpd17 class 43400000 page 140httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs33 39 crs report rl32776 navy ship procurement alternative funding approaches background and options for congress by ronald orourke hereafter cited as crs report rl32776 40 these requirements are set forth in 10 usc 2306b the statute governing myp arrangements 41 for further discussion see crs report rl32776 42 see crs report rl32109appendix other options for responding to rising ship costs aside from reducing planned ship procurement rates or shifting or shifting to lower cost ship designs one option for responding to rising navy ship procurement costs would be to increase annual shipprocurement funding the navys proposed fy2007 budget and the fy2007fy2011 shipbuilding plan pr opose increasing annual funding for ship construction to an average of roughly 144 billion per year in constant fy2007 dollars increasing annual shipprocurement funding substantially from curre nt levels however may not be easy in situation of finite defense funding increasing funding for navy ship procurement could require reducing funding for other na vy or dod priorities the navy has worked in recent years to operate more efficiently on daytoday basis so that the resulting savings could be applied to navy procurement programs in practice however savings from these efficiencies have b een offset by rising navy costs in other areas such as personnelrelated costs second option would be to modify th way in which new navy ships are funded in the budget possible changes th at have been suggested include making greater use of incremental funding or st arting to use advance appropriations this option which is examined in crs report rl3277639 might marginally increase the number of ships that could be procured for given total amount of money as discussed in that report however it coul d also pose potentially significant issues relating to congresss power of the purse and congress s responsibility for conducting effective overs ight of dod activities third option would be to make greater use in navy shipprocurement programs of contracting method known as multiyear pr ocurement myp this option like the previous one might marginally increase the num ber of ships that could be procured for given total amount of money not all navy shipprocurement programs however would meet the legal requirements for myp40 and making greater use of myp could reduce dods and congresss flexibility to adjust shipprocurement plans in future years to respond to changing strate gic and budgetary circumstances41 fourth option would be to change th acquisition strategy for building certain navy ships for example the navy timated in 2005 that changing from strategy of dividing ddg1000 destroyers evenly betw een two yards to strategy of having all ddg1000s built by single yard could reduce the cost for building 10 ddg 1000s by total of 3 billion or an average of 300 million per ship42 shifting to singleyard acquisition strategy how ever could cause the second yard tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32914crs34 43 benchmarking which can take place in the absence of active competition is the process of using one yards performance in building ce rtain kind of ship to help measure or judge the performance of another yard in building that kind of ship 44 for further discussion of competition in navy ship acquisition see david h lewis bucks buck rogers us naval institute proceedings may 2005 pp 5458 45 for more on this program see the ns rp ase website at httpwwwnsrporgpermanently exit the business of building th at kind of ship that could leave the navy with single source for building th at kind of ship which could prevent the navy in the future from using competition or benchmarking43 to spur design innovation constrain costs maintain pr oduction quality and sure adherence to scheduled delivery dates another potential change in acquisition st rategy would be to make greater use of competition in navy ship acquisition competition is used today in navy ship acquisition primarily in the early stages of shipacquisition prog rams to determine who will design and build the lead ship in each new class making greater use of competition in navy ship acquisition could involve using competition between shipyards in awarding contracts for building followon ships in each class this step if taken would represent return to navy practices in the 1980s employing competition in the awarding of contracts for building followon ships however requires either an annual proc urement rate for the class of ship in question that is high enough so that the government can contemplate giving ships to one yard or another without endangering th financial health of eith er yard or willingness on the part of the government to have contr act award lead to decision by the losing yard to permanently withdraw from the business of building that kind of ship or navy ships generally in the latter case the navys contractaward decision could leave the navy with single source fo r that kind of ship in the future44 fifth option would be to take steps to reduce the amount of shipyard fixed overhead costs that are incorporated into the procurement costs of navy ships this could be accomplished by eliminating any excess capacity among the yards building navy ships which would eliminate the fixed overhead costs associated with maintaining that capacity or by increasing other kinds of work done by those yards so that this other work could absorb greater portion of the yards fixed overhead costs potential other forms of work in clude construction of ships for other us government agencies such as the co ast guard or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa constr uction of commercial ships overhaul and repair of navy or other us gove rnment ships and overhaul and repair of commercial ships sixth option would be to improve the operating efficiency of yards building navy ships by incorporating more adva nced design and production processes and equipment the national shipbuildin g research program nsrp advanced shipbuilding enterprise ase is one effort aimed at this goal45 may 2005 dod report compares the operating efficiency of the yards that build the navys major ships relative to

recommendations for how to improve the operating efficiency of the us yards46 seventh option would be to build navy ships without some of their planned equipment or with less expensive substitu equipment building ship without some of its planned equipment or with less expensive substitute equipment would likely reduce its capabilities equipment not installed during the original construction process c ould be added back later afte r the ship had entered service this would restore the ships lost capability but add back the cost of this equipment in which case the ships procurement cost instead of being reduced would have been partially deferred into the future installing this equipment on an inservice ship moreover may be more expensive than building it into the ship during its original construction process as consequence this strate gy over the long run could increase the procurement total cost of the sh ip above what it would have been if the ship had been built from the beginning with all its planned equipment an eighth option would be to build navy ships in foreign shipyards where construction costs may be wer to due lower wages and material prices or other factors regarding this option 10 usc 7309 states that vessel to be constructed for any of the armed forces and major component of the hull or superstructure of any such vessel may be constructed in foreign shipyard the provision permits the president to aut horize exceptions when the president determines that it is in the national security interest in such cases the president is to notify congress of the termination and contract may be made until the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the notice is received the provision also exempts inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats in addition to 10 usc 7309 the annual dod appropriations act contains provision in the section entitled shipbuilding and conversion na vy stating that funds for navy shipbuilding are made available for the fis cal year in question provided among other things that none of the funds provided under this heading for the construction or conversion of any naval vesse l to be constructed in sh ipyards
