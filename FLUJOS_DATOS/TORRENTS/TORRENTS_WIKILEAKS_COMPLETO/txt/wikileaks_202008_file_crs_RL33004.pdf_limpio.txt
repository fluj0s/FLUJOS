addressed the issue of whether cash balance pension plans violate federal laws that prohibit age discrimination the relevant age discrimination provisions are found in the employ ee retirement income security act erisa the internal revenue code irc and the age discrimination in employ ment act adea two distinct claims have been made 1 that cash balance plans inherently violate the age discrimination provisions because the rate of be nefit accrual is decreased on account of age and 2 that the conversion of traditional defined benefit plans to cash balance plans violates the adea because of the negative impact on older workers while majority of courts have held that cash balance plans violate the age discrimination provisions some have found that the plans are not discriminatory or have dismissed the claims for procedural reasons in case that has received significant attention cooper v ibm personal pension plan 457 f3d 636 7 th cir 2006 the seventh circuit reversed one of the district courts and found that ibms cash balance plan was nondiscriminatory the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 sets out new standards that cash balance plan must meet in order to comply with the age discrimination provisions these new standards apply only to periods beginning on or after june 29 2005 and leave the age discrimination issue unsettled under prior law this report describes cash balance plans discusses the claims that cash balance plans do and do not violate the preact age discrimination provis ions and provides an overview of pl 109280 as it

pension plan the cash balance plan violates federal laws that prohibit age discrimination the discrimination provisions are found in the employee retirement income security act erisa the internal revenue code irc and the age discrimination in employment act adea1 although employer participation in the private pens ion system is voluntary any offered plan must satisfy the legal requirements the failure to do so may result in civil and criminal liability and the loss of favorable tax treatment for plan contributions and disbursements furthermore erisa and the adea create substantive rights for plan participants that they can seek to have judicially enforced this report briefly describes typical cash balance plan and discusses the claims that such plans violate the federal laws that prohibit age discrimination as existed prior to the pension protection act of 2006 it concludes with discussion of rele vant provisions in the act which was signed into law on august 17 2006 the acts provisions apply only to periods beginning on or after june 29 2005 and leave unsettled the law for earlier periods

categories of pension plans under federal law defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans in defined benefit plan an employee is promised specified future benefit traditionally an annuity beginning at retirement the amount of the annuity is generally determined by formula that factors in the employees years of employment and the average salary of the employees highest salaried years other factors such as age may be included to fund the plan the employer makes contributions to the common pension fund that are actuarially expected to grow through investment to cover the promised benefits the employer bears the risk that the investments will not provide adequate funds and is responsible for any shortfalls if the plan is terminated the benefits are insured up to certain limit by the pension benefit guaranty corporation an employee who terminates employment before retirement will generally receive any vested benefits as an annuity at normal retirement age in defined contribution plan the employee is pr omised that the employer will currently make specified contribution to the employees pension account the contribution is commonly percentage of the employees salary due to the risk of investment the value of the account at the time of retirement is unknown the employee bears the investment risk and the benefits are not insured by the pension benefit guaranty corporation an employee who terminates employment before retirement may generally receive any vested benefits as lumpsum payment at the time of termination in the past several decades plans have been developed that modify the traditional defined benefit plan these plans are referred to as hybrid plans because they are defined benefit plans that conceptualize the benefits in manner similar to defined contribution plans one type of hybrid plan is the cash balance plan 1 erisa was enacted in 1974 pl 93406 and is codified at 29 usc 1001 et seq the internal revenue code is found in title 26 the adea was enacted in 1968 pl 90202 and is codified at 29 usc 621 et seq t

cash balance plans are defined benefit plans that look like defined contribution plans because the employees promised future benefits are stated as the individuals account balance the account is hypothetical ie each employee does not actually have an account and is used to conceptualize the amount of benefits the employee has accrued the account reflects employer contributions that are percentage of annual compensation called pay credits and interest earned on those contributions called interest credits these interest credits typically continue even if the plan participant ceases employment the interest rate may be fixed or tied to an index rate and is specified in the plan the plan may use other factors in its benefit formula such as age and length of service in cash balance plan the employer currently contributes to the general pension fund the employer bears the risk that the funds investments will provide the promised benefits in the event of plan termination the benefits are partially insured by the pension benefit guaranty corporation an employee who terminates employment before retirement may generally receive the current value of any vested benefits as lumpsum payment at the time of termination g18g149g138g151g561g5g152g151g159g142g155g156g146g152g151g156g561 during the past two decades numerous employers ve either converted or considered converting their traditional defined benefit plans to cash balance plans conversion to cash balance plan involves amending the original plan and is not treated as plan termination g3g151g157g146g556g140g158g157g139g138g140g148g561g20g158g149g142g561 conversion is subject to the rules that apply to any plan amendment an important rule is that once benefit is accrued it may only be decreased in limited circumstances and with prior approval by the treasury secretary 2 an amendment may not eliminate or reduce an early retirement subsidy with regard to service that has already been performed3 although plan amendment may not decrease benefits that are already accrued it may reduce future benefit accruals because these benefits have not yet been earned any amendment that significantly reduces the rate of future benefit accrual requires clearly written notice to affected participants 4

plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph relating to benefit accrual if under the plan an employees benefit accrual is ceased or the rate of an employees benefit accrual is reduced because of the attainment of any age adea 4j1 29 usc 623i1 it shall be unlawful for an employer an employment agency labor organization or any combination thereof to establish or maintain an employee pension benefit plan which requires or permits in the case of defined benefit plan the cessation of an employees benefit accrual or the reduction of the rate of an employees benefit accrual because of age two distinct claims have been made that cash balance plans or the conversions to such plans violate the law7 the first claim is that the plans violate the age discrimination provisions because the rate of an employees benefit accrual is reduced on account of age the second claim is that the conversions to the plans violate the adea because older workers are treated unfavorably compared with younger workers the pension protection act of 2006 discussed below has significantly affected these claims by adding new requirements that plans must meet to comply with the above statutes the act applies only to periods beginning on or after june 29 2005 because the majority of cash balance plans existed during periods prior to june 29 2005 the pre act law continues to be relevant to the extent that the legal status of plans during these periods is uncertain the uncertainty is due to two reasons first there is conflicting case law on whether plans violate the preact age discrimination provisions second in 1999 the irs responding to the growing controversy over cash balance plans placed moratorium on approving the plans 8 in january 2007 the irs lifted this moratorium but stated that it would not consider age discrimination issues on plan conversions occurring before june 29 20059 the next sections discuss the basic age discrimination claims and how various courts have dealt with these claims the final section of this report discusses the pension protection act

the provisions applied to employees challenging the plans who were generally younger than normal retirement age and 2 how to interpret the phrase rate of benefit accrual g3g153g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g3g144g142g561g6g146g156g140g155g146g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 in general the employees claiming age discrimination with respect to cash balance plans have been younger than normal retirement age some employers have argued that the age discrimination provisions do not apply to these employees because the legislative history shows that congress only intended for the age discrimination provisions to require benefit accrual for employees who continued working past normal retirement age 10 in response employees have emphasized that the statutes plain language is not limited to employees older than normal retirement age11 the adea applies to everyone who is at least 4012 and erisa gives standing to any plan participant without reference to age13 courts considering these claims have come to various conclusions14 the pension protection act does not address this issue g20g138g157g142g561g152g143g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g561g3g140g140g155g158g138g149g561 the second issue with respect to the age discrimination provisions has been how to determine an employees rate of benefit accrual under ca sh balance plan those claiming discrimination have argued that the phrase is defined with reference to an annuity that begins at normal retirement age age 65 annuity the argument has been based on three ideas cash balance plans are type of defined benefit plan the accru ed benefit of defined benefit plan is defined as being in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age 15 and an accrued benefit that is defined in different form must be converted into such an annuity16 the claim has been that this framework requires the bene fits in cash balance plan conceptualized as an account balance be converted into an age 65 annuity in order to test for age discrimination when the benefits are expressed as an age 65 annuity the cash balance formula appears to violate the preact age discrimination provisions because the rate of benefit accrual decreases as the employees age increases this is because of the interest credit and the effect of compounding interestas an employees age increases the rate of benefit accrual decreases because the contributions made in each subsequent year have less time to earn interest resulting in decreasing impact on the amount of the age 65 annuity 10 see h rep 99727 obra conference report 131 cong rec 18868 july 11 1985 statement by senator grassley 132 cong rec 32963 and 32975 oct 17 1986

there is nothing that requires an age 65 annuity be used to test for age discrimination because the phrase rate of benefit accrual is not defined in the statutes and the term accrued benefit has various usages in erisa and the irc they have argued that instead of using an age 65 annuity the rate should be tested using the amount that is in the employees hypothetical account because that is how benefits are expressed in cash balance plans under this argument the rate of benefit accrual refers to the rate at which the contributions are made to that account 17 when the rate of benefit accrual is expressed in this manner cash balance plans do not inherently violate the age discrimination provisions because the rate at which contributions are made to the account over the employees years of service is generally constant or increases if the plan is weighted for age one case to examine this issue cooper v ibm pers pension plan 18 has received significant attention in 2003 us district court held th at ibms cash balance plan violated erisa 204b1h the court began by noting that although erisa did not explicitly address whether an age 65 annuity should be used to test cash balance plans for age discrimination the term accrued benefit was expressed for defined benefit plans as an age 65 annuity under erisa 32319 the court concluded that because cash balance plan was type of defined benefit plan an age 65 annuity must similarly be used to express its benefits20 the court noted that the terms accrued benefit in erisa 323 and benef it accrual in erisa 204b1h were not identical but discounted its significance by finding the different terms merely reflected correct grammatical usage and pointing out that the term accrued benefit was used in the subsection immediately prior to erisa 204b1h which also dealt with age discrimination21 the court found that when the age 65 annuity was used to determine whether the rate of benefit accrual decreased on account of age the plan violated erisa because of the interest credit component22 this was because the continued crediting of interest made the expected benefit greater for younger employees than for older employees be cause younger employees had more years in which to earn interest although the case dealt only with the ibm plan the courts reasoning indicated that cash balance plans were inherently discriminatory in august 2006 the seventh circuit reversed and remanded the case the court found that the fact that younger employees had more time to accrue interest on their account balances than older employees did not translate into age discrimination in determining that ibms cash balance plan was ageneutral the court found that the terms benefit accrual and accrued benefit were not synonymous and that rate of benefit accrual did not have to be determined based on an age 65 annuity23 the rate of benefit accrual according to the court refers to what the employer 17 this argument treats cash balance plans similar to defined contributions plans which also express the benefits as an individuals account erisa 323b 29 usc 100223b defined contribution plans do not violate the age discrimination provisions so long as allocations to the employees account are not ceased and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employees account is not reduced b ecause of the attainment

the monetary gain between contribution and retirement24 the court also defended ibms plan by comparing the age discrimination provisions for defined benefit and defined contribution plans25 under the age discrimination provision for defined contribution plans continued crediting of interest would be acceptable the court reasoned that because the ibm plan would have unquestionably met the requirements of the age discrimination provision for defined contribution plans and because the structure and function of both age discrimination provisions were similar the continued receipt of interest aspect of ibms cash balance plan should not be considered discriminatory26 the court also rejected the plaintiffs proposition that ibms plan was age discriminatory because employees received more favorable benefits under the prior plan27 the court explained that ibm was free to make this decision provided it did not reduce an employees vested interests28 in november 2006 the plaintiffs filed petition for review with the supreme court 29 but the court denied the petition on january 16 200730 majority of courts including the only other appellate courts to have considered this issue reached similar conclusion to the seventh circuits decision in cooper and have found that rate of benefit accrual is determined based on an employers contributions to plan not difference in an older employees retirement benefit ie an age 65 annuity31 however some district courts in the second circuit have disagreed32 for example in citigroup pension plan 33 the court found that rate of benefit accrual depends on the amount of an employees retirement benefit an age 65 annuity rather than the amount of an employers contributions to an employees hypothetical account the court disagreed with cooper and concluded that using the same methodology for finding age discrimination in defined benefit and defined contribution 24 see id 25 see footnote 16 and supporting text 26 see ibm 457 f3d at

as well as the critical distinctions between the types of pension plans the court went on to state that if congress had intended for the rate of an employees benefit accrual to mean the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employees account it would have copied those terms from the analogous provision for defined contribution plans34 currently in the second circuit appeals are pending in two cases both of which found that cash balance plans are not age discriminatory35 if second circuit court of appeals affirms these decisions critics have suggested that this may be the nail in the coffin for these types of age discrimination claims36 on the other hand if the appellate court finds that these plans are age discriminatory then this split in the circuits may entice the supreme court to take up the issue something it declined to do in the cooper case37

cash balance plans violate the adea under two additional discrimination theories disparate treatment and disparate impact disparate treatment claim requires an employee to show that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee on the basis of age with disparate impact claim an employee must show that the employers actions while neutral on their face actually had disproportionate adverse impact on older workers here the argument is that compared with younger workers older workers fare poorly when plans convert to cash balance plans disparate impact claims arise more often because of the difficulty of proving intentional discrimination by the employer in the adoption of or conversion to cash balance plan although the recently passed pension protection act of 2006 may preclude some future disparate treatment or disparate impact claims some have argued that some claims may still be available 38

employer knows will treat older workers less favorably than younger workers is evidence of intentional discrimination opponents respond that the fact employers may know that older employees will be treated less favorably under the cash balance plan is not evidence of individualized discrimination 39 further opponents note that employers may refute the claim by 34 id at 48 it is important to note that following this decisi on the court has reserved its ruling on remedy in light of the pending appellate court decision in the second circuit see in re citigroup pension plan erisa litig 2007 us

and that there are numerous reasons for an employer to convert to cash balance plan including attractiveness to employees and decreased costs of administering the plan40 g6g146g156g153g138g155g138g157g142g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g5g149g138g146g150g156g561 proponents of the discrimination claims under disp arate impact theory argue that although the conversion to cash balance plan may be facially neutral decision it has disproportionate adverse impact on older workers41 there are two primary claims that may be made the first is that older employees lose the expected benefits of the traditional plan without gaining the benefits from the new cash balance plan the formula under traditional defined benefit plan is weighted towards longerserving employees so that employees accrue significant benefits in their later years of employment thus older employees may have worked for years under the traditional plan with the expectation that they would accrue significant benefits in their final years however because benefits under cash balance plan are accrued at more constant rate over the employees years of service these employees lose the opportunity for the increased accrual at the same time because the older workers are near retirement they are unable to take advantage of the compounding interest feature of the cash balance plan 42 the second argument concerns the issue of wearaway which proponents of the discrimination claims argue disproportionately affects older workers wearaway occurs when the value of the employees accrued benefits under the traditional plan exceeds the starting balance of the hypothetical account which is provided in the terms of the plan conversion43 the employee is guaranteed the benefits that he or she accrued under the old plan the employee will not accrue any additional benefits until he or she earns enough benefits under the cash balance plan so that the value of the hypothetical account exceeds the value of the benefits earned under the traditional plan thus the level of the employees benefits is basically frozen until that point is reached proponents argue that this wearaway hits older employees the hardest because they are more likely to have high starting balances the pension protection act of 2006 contains provision to eliminate wearaway however the provision applies only to plan conversions occurring after june 29 2005 plans converted prior to this date may still be subject to wearaway claims two main arguments have been made against disparate impact claims under the adea both in general and in the context of cash balance plans first opponents have argued that in individual 40 see hazen paper co v biggins 507 us 604 61011 1993 in disparate treatment case liability depends on whether the protected trait under the adea age actually motivated the employers decision whatever the employers decision making process disparate treatment claim cannot cceed unless the employees protected trait actually played role in that process and had determinative influence on the outcome 41 see eg godinez v cbs 81 fed appx 949 9th cir 2003 where employees claimed that cash balance conversion had disparate impact on older employees under the adea the us district court for the central district of california found that the plaintiffs had not provided evidence to show the plans negative impact on older employees or statistical evidence to show that any negative impact was due to the employees age 42 the plaintiff made similar argument in campbell v bankboston 206 f supp 2d 70 d mass 2002 affd campbell v bankboston 327 f3d 1 1st cir 2003 while the court did not consider the plaintiffs adea claim on the merits the court mentioned that disparate impact claim would not be permissible based solely on the fact that older workers would have less time to accrue interest on their retirement acc ounts than younger workers 43 for additional information on wearaway see

specifically by failing to file timely complaint with the equal employ ment opportunity commission eeoc44 second opponents have argued that the claims should be dismissed because under the adea it is not illegal for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age45 in other words the argument is that disparate impact claims cannot be brought under the adea46 this argument was supported by the fact that in cases not dealing with cash balance plans the majority of the federal circuits that considered the issue had not recognized disparate impact claims under the adea47 the argument that disparate impact claims against cash balance plans should be dismissed because such claims are not recognized under the adea has been successful however there has been major change in the law in 2005 the supreme court held that disparate impact claims are allowed under the adea 48 in smith v city of jackson the court found that salary plan that provided proportionately higher raises for employees with less work experience who were typically younger in age than for more experienced employees did not violate the adea although the court found that the adea claim failed in this instance the court made clear that plaintiffs are not barred under the adea from bringing claims under disparate impact theory of liability

payable at normal retirement age hypothetical account balance or the current value of the accumulated percentage of the employees final average compensation also in determining plan participants accrued benefit any subsidized portion of an early retirement benefit or retirement type subsidy is disregarded the act also creates new rules for applicable defined benefit plans which include cash balance plans under the new rules cash balance plan will violate the age discrimination provisions of erisa the irc and the adea unless it meets an interest credit requirement 53 plan satisfies the interest requirement if the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit or equivalent amount for plan year is at rate that is not more than the market rate of return and not less than zero the secretary of the treasury is expected to provide guidance as to the calculation of the market rate as well as permissible methods for crediting interest to participants account eg fixed or variable interest rates 54 the act includes new requirements for plan conversions55 if defined benefit plan is converted into cash balance plan after june 29 2005 the plan will not satisfy the age discrimination provisions unless each participant receives the sum of 1 the preconversion accrued benefit determined under the prior plan formula plus 2 the postconversion accrued benefit determined under the cash balance plan formula newly conver ted plan must also credit participant with the amount of any early retirement benefits or retirementtype subsidies if the participant has met the requirements for the benefit or subsidy under the prior plan the act also makes clear that certain circumstances do not violate the age discrimination provisions under the act plan will be consid ered nondiscriminatory if the plan allows for certain offsets of benefits to the extent the of fsets comply with erisa the irc and the adea 56 plan will also be treated as nondiscriminatory if disparity in plan contributions or benefits exists so long as the disparity is in accordance with the irc finally the act states plan would still comply with the age discrimination standard even if it allowed for preretirement indexing of accrued benefits preretirement indexing provides for adjustments in accrued benefit based on recognized investment index or methodology if plan provides for indexing of accrued benefits an employees benefit amount may be protected from being devalued due to inflation in general the new provisions regarding cash balance plans are effective for periods beginning on or
