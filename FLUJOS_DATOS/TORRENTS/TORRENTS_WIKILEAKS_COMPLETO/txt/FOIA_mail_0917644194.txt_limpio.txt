international competitiveness of european research the commissions draft directive harmonising aspects of copyright will shortly be debated by the council of ministers the esf is calling for changes to be made to the wording of one of the directives key articles which deals with exceptions to the proposed laws to ensure that it doesnt cause legal and financial headaches for europes researchers the foundation supports the commissions objectives of improving the protection of intellectual property as technological developments make it ever easier for pirates to duplicate and distribute copyright material but it warns that this should not be at the expense of europes ability to carry out research reflecting widespread concern in its member organisations the foundation argues that the draft article 5 which deals with exceptions to the proposed laws could result in research being treated differently in different countries across europe as presently written the article sets out an exhaustive list of permissible exceptions to the directive but it leaves to member states the interpretation and implementation of these exceptions the effect of this could be that some researchers might find themselves in worse position than at present regarding their access to and use of published material given the differences in national legislation between member states the esf recognises it may be difficult to draft and agree prescriptive legislation for exceptions the foundation is recommending therefore that clause be added to the directive allowing for the inclusion of all current exceptions set out in national legislation other suggested revisions include the need to ensure that scientific research is interpreted in broad sense with research in the humanities and arts being explicitly included in addition the esf suggests that the current reference to noncommercial research could cause confusion as it would be very difficult to differentiate between commercial and noncommercial research in most academic settings to avoid this it recommends the introduction of public good definition of research which could form an exception to the directive the foundations statement also points out that the directives current reference to the possibility of member states exempting the use of work provided that such use exclusively serves the purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research is ambiguous it could be interpreted that there is such thing as illustration for research and that any exception did not apply to research in general simple rewording of the sentence to read sole purpose of scientific research or for illustration for teaching would clarify the exception the european commissions draft directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society is available online at httpeuropaeuintcommdg15enindexhtm further information johanne martinez information officer european science

january 1999 p23 7 publicsector information the european commission has decided to publish green paper on how the information gathered by government departments and other public bodies can be used to provide the greatest benefit for citizens and businesses in europe lot of information gathered by public bodies for carrying out their duties could be used by the multimedia industry for developing new products and services citizens could make better use of their rights if for example information was readily available on the conditions for working studying or living as pensioner in other member states many people would like to have full information on the tax regulations for crossborder purchases the competitiveness of businesses could be increased if they had quick and easy means of finding out what the regulations and procedures are for exporting to other countries all this information exists but the technical and legal procedures and terms under which the member states make it available are uncoordinated and therefore not very transparent for citizens and business the green paper calls for these matters to be discussed and asks questions about how the situation can be improved further information httpwwecholulegalenaccessaccesshtml 8 results pilot projects on benchmarking results from four pilot projects on benchmarking framework conditions in the fields of professional qualification logistics the impact of new information technologies nits on company organisation and the financing of innovation are reported in the january issue of the newsletter of the european association of development agencies eurada the lessons drawn included companies located in peripheral regions suffer from the poor quality of infrastructures expensive logistical services and weaknesses in the field of transnational cooperation the authorities should support the effective use of nit and the enhancement of nitrelated structures smes lack nit qualifications and skills business angels play lesser role in innovation in europe than in the us probably due to tax and revenuerelated problems even though it remains below the number of such companies operating in the us the number of venture capital companies operating in member states of the eu is rising 750 versus 1800 generally speaking and in comparison with the us and israel europe suffers from deficit in terms of the ability to evaluate technological risks and from lack of initiatives to support faster interaction between universities and companies education policies should be more practical and incompany training should be fully integrated in the programmes of higher education institutions closer links should be promoted between industry and the educational system the skills which new workers lack most upon entry to the labour market are knowledge of english b computer literacy c knowledge about the industrial world and d adaptability further information eurada avenue des arts 127 b1210

debate with the eus different political economic and social players on the orientation of new industrial policy with view to addressing the challenges of globalisation and accelerated technological changes the communication diagnoses european industrys weaknesses and proposes series of measures to promote industrial competitiveness the communication diagnoses the weaknesses of european industry europe does not have strong presence in the services sector european enterprises resort to insufficient externalisation specialisation remains underdeveloped in sectors with high growth highly differentiated products and requiring strong marketing strategy the european audiovisual sector is in an unfavourable competitive position european enterprises form relatively few alliances in advanced technology areas the amounts invested by risk capital funds are insufficiently oriented towards new and high technology industries european enterprises can access financial markets only with difficulty the level of rd spending in terms of eu gdp is still below that of its principal global economic partners the exploitation of research results is not efficient enough the eu suffers from high costs and the complexity of procedures for achieving intellectual property protection in europe european enterprises put very few joint research projects in place to counteract this situation and stimulate european competitiveness the communication emphasises the following proposals among others reinforce intangible investment by adapting the systems of accrediting competencies and by improving the level of and return from research resources especially through better system of intellectual property protection develop human resources by acting on the educational system by encouraging the spirit of enterprise and various forms of social innovation and social cohesion promote the access of european enterprises to the world market by accelerating the exploitation of the competitive advantages of the single market promote fair rules of the game at world level in view of the new round of wto negotiations that is by developing an observation system for public support to research in industrialised countries develop the dialogue between industry and public authorities and forms of selfregulation protection of consumers and users improve financing by eliminating institutional and regulatory barriers to the development of venture capital and improving the tax regime applied to venture capital adaptation of the rules to the context of the information society
