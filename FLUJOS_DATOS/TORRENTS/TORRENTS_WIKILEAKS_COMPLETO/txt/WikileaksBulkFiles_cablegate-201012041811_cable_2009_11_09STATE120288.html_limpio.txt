reasons 14 b and d 1 u this is an action request please see paragraphs 35 summary 2 c irans continued reluctance to cooperate with international efforts to build confidence and transparency in its nuclear program will be of increasing concern to us diplomacy in the weeks ahead of particular note is irans apparent refusal to date to agree to an iaea proposal for iran to exchange significant portion of its stockpiled lowenriched uranium leu for fuel for the tehran research reactor trr and the iaea report of november 16 indicating serious unresolved questions about irans nuclear intentions department requests posts to draw on the attached narrative in explaining and securing support for recent us and p51 efforts to engage iran on its nuclear program particularly in the leadup to the iaea board of governors meeting on november 26 end summary objectives 3 c for all posts except moscow paris beijing london and berlin please draw on narrative beginning in paragraph 7 and hard questions and answers in paragraph 12 to brief host governments on persistent us efforts to engage iran throughout 2009 irans disappointing followup to its commitments with p51 in geneva on october 1 details of the trr proposal and the flexibility the us russia france and the iaea have demonstrated to deal with iranian concerns and key findings and implications of the iaea director generals november 16 report on iran and posts should also begin laying the foundation for possible future action in response to irans non cooperation including at the iaea bog meeting on 26 november and prudent preparation in the event of decision to pursue increased pressure on iran 4 c special request for moscow paris beijing london and berlin please inform host government that we are delivering this message to iaea members consistent with consultations among political directors in the p51 process posts may share the general tenor of our message but do not need to deploy the points themselves with host governments 5 c posts should not leave any part of this message in writing with host governments deadline 6 u posts should report the results of their efforts by november 25 elisa catalano neafo 2026479533 catalanoestatesgovgov and richard nephew isnra 2026477680 nephewrmstatesgovgov are the departments pocs for this activity background 7 sbu since the 1 october 2009 meeting of the p51 political directors and representatives from iran the united states has been working closely with its partners to fulfill the commitments reached in geneva and engage with iran to build international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program in particular we have focused on supporting the iaeas proposal for refueling the tehran research reactor trr facilitating the iaeas inspection of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at qom and pressing for followon meeting between p51 political directors and iranian representatives explicitly on state 00120288 002 of 008 irans nuclear program 8 c the results since october 1 have been disappointing it increasingly appears that iran will decline the iaeas proposal on trr though definitive answer remains outstanding in the leadup to the iaea board of governors bog meeting on november 26 iran may try to blame the apparent failure of the trr agreement on intrusive and inflexible demands by western powers rather than its own reluctance or inability to reach agreement on the iaea proposal which responded to irans request for assistance and was created on the basis of irans own commitments made in geneva although iran granted iaea access to qom iran did not cooperate with all of the iaeas requests for access to information and personnel and there remain serious questions about irans intentions for the facility finally iran so far has refused further meeting with the p51 to discuss its nuclear program the united states is now discussing with its p51 and other partners potential next steps including how to handle these issues at the next meeting of the iaea bog 9 sbu iaea director general dg elbaradei released his latest report on iran on november 16 the report makes clear irans continuing lack of transparency and cooperation with the iaea on its nuclear program including in assessing possible military dimension to its program as expected the uranium enrichment facility at qom also known as the fordow site was central element of the report and the iaea states that irans previous failure to declare the facility is inconsistent with its obligations under its safeguards agreement the iaeas report highlights that revelation of the qom facility raises concerns of additional clandestine nuclear sites in iran and has asked iran to confirm that there are other undeclared nuclear facilities iran has yet to respond to this iaea request iran continues to defy unsc resolutions and iaea bog resolutions calling on it to adopt the additional protocol and to provide the access necessary for the iaea to provide assurance as to the absence of additional undeclared nuclear activities 10 c the p51 dual track policy towards iran includes both engagement and pressure if iran does not engage constructively president obama secretary clinton and others have identified the end of the year as key period for assessing irans responsiveness if iran continues to refuse to take meaningful steps to meet its international obligations the international community must be prepared to take strong collective action on the pressure track key diplomatic messages and policy narrative 11 u posts should draw on the following key messages and policy narrative in briefing host governments key messages we in coordination with our international partners have demonstrated our willingness to engage constructively and respectfully with iran to address longstanding international concerns over its nuclear program our approach has clearly and consistently been based on the p51s dual track strategy iran so far has failed to accept very good and balanced iaea proposal to facilitate the refueling of the tehran research reactor trr which would have fulfilled an iranian request addressed humanitarian need of the iranian people and served as confidence building step to create an opportunity for further progress we look forward to close consultations on how best to persuade iran to engage constructively as we approach the iaeas board of governors meeting on november 26 and beyond policy narrative since president obama took office he has made clear the willingness of the united states to engage with iran and to seek new relationship based on mutual respect he has authorized the united states full participation in diplomatic discussions between the five permanent members of the security council and germany state 00120288 003 of 008 and iran without preconditions the united states has stated its support for irans full right to civilian nuclear program within iaea guidelines provided iran meets it international obligations and carries out its responsibilities within the npt framework as way to build confidence the united states with russia and france has also supported the iaeas proposal to positively respond to irans request for nuclear fuel for the tehran research reactor trr in spite of irans continuing violation of unsc resolutions and noncompliance with iaea requirements on its nuclear program however almost one year into the obama administration iran has not taken practical concrete steps that would begin to create confidence in its nuclear intentions iran continues to enrich uranium despite unsc requirements that it suspend such operations revealed it had been building secret uranium enrichment facility at military base near qom in violation of its safeguards agreement continues to refuse cooperation with the iaea in addressing the full range of iaea questions about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program has not accepted the iaea proposal to refuel the trr and since meeting with representatives of the five permanent members of the security council and germany in geneva on october 1 has refused all subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to discuss its nuclear program irans failure to take advantage of these numerous opportunities raises serious questions about the intentions of its nuclear program that deserve urgent international attention we look to work closely with your government in the runup to iaea board of governors meeting on november 26 and beyond to develop an appropriate international response tehran research reactor the iaea russia france and the united states cooperated closely and flexibly to find way to positively respond to irans request for fuel for the tehran research reactor trr so that it could keep running to meet humanitarian medical needs beyond 2010 the trr refueling proposal offers iran the opportunity to convert its stockpile of low enriched uranium leu into higherenriched fuel with the help of russia and france the proposals elements are simple iran would transfer portion of its leu necessary for fuel production in one batch to iaea custody outside of iran before the end of the year russia would further enrich the leu to meet fuel requirements and france would fabricate the fuel assemblies and return them to iran before irans fuel supplies are depleted before the end of the year in addition the united states expressed commitment to work with the iaea to improve safety and control features at the trr the us france and russia took great risks in supporting the deal especially in light of irans continuing violation of successive unsc resolutions and iaea requirements including its secret construction of uranium enrichment facility near qom and its continuing enrichment operations we did so because the arrangement would begin to build confidence and would give iran and the international community more time to reach comprehensive negotiated solution to irans nuclear program while fulfilling irans humanitarian needs when iran expressed concern about the reliability of the proposal the united states and its partners expressed to the iaea willingness to address irans concerns including through us offer to formally join the deal as signatory state 00120288 004 of 008 readiness of the five permanent members of the security council and germany to guarantee the deal through political statement of support willingness to help secure finance for the movement of the leu and fuel an openness to move the leu to any number of locations outside of iran and willingness to support the iaeas holding material equivalent to the fuel in escrow in third country as guarantee for iran of the fuels ultimate delivery after reaching an agreement in principle in the deal following talks with the e33 in geneva on october 1 and following further technical discussions at the iaea october 1921 iran has so far failed to accept the deal this raises question about irans intentions if iran is enriching uranium to meet its civilian reactor fuel needs why would it not accept an international offer with significant guarantees to provide its leu for fuel to power the trr to meet its humanitarian needs particularly when it does not have the capability to produce the fuel on its own this question is troubling in the context of irans continued enrichment activities in defiance of unsc resolutions its secret construction of an enrichment facility on military base near qom its refusal to cooperate with the iaea in answering questions about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program and its refusal to meet with the five permanent members of the security council p51 together with our p51 partners the united states informed iranian representatives in geneva on october 1 of our willingness to discuss any items of concern to iran both bilaterally and multilaterally in addition to our concerns about irans nuclear program on october 1 irans representatives committed to meet again before the end of the month based on an agenda that included irans nuclear program since that time however the iranian government has refused all invitations to meet if its nuclear program would be on the agenda irans continued refusal to engage on its nuclear program with the p51 deepens our concerns about irans intentions for its nuclear program the iaea director generals report on iran the iaea report makes clear that iran has failed to cooperate fully and transparently with the iaea key aspects of the report include irans new centrifuge facility at qom built in violation of irans unsc obligations and not declared to the iaea as required has been inspected but its purpose and origin remain unknown and iran has not yet cooperated with all of the iaeas requests for access to information and personnel irans failure to provide the iaea with early design information regarding the qom facility has been deemed inconsistent with its obligations under the subsidiary arrangements to its safeguards agreement by the iaea furthermore the relatively small size of the facility at qom is inconsistent with irans assertion that it is to provide fuel for irans civilian reactors raising questions about the planned use of the qom facility the agency noted that irans failure to declare the qom facility also reduces the level of confidence in the absence of other nuclear facilities under construction and gives rise to questions about whether there were any other nuclear facilities in iran that had not been declared to the agency these concerns have been compounded by the continued pace of iranian enrichment and steadfast refusal to abide by the unscs legal requirement that iran suspend all such work instead iran continues to produce low enriched uranium and estimated its stockpile at 1763 kilograms at the end of october notwithstanding reduction in the number of enriching centrifuges by approximately 600 since august 2009 this is roughly similar rate of production as iran has state 00120288 005 of 008 achieved for the past year iran continues to install and test additional centrifuges with more than 1000 new centrifuges added since august 2009 the iaea has discovered previously unknown cache of heavy water in storage at esfahan and has requested iran to explain its origin it is important to note that security council resolutions include ban on supplying iran with heavy water it also asked iran to provide further information describing an analytical laboratory that iran says it plans to install underground at esfahan there has been progress made in addressing issues associated with irans efforts to develop nuclear warhead despite year having passed since the last such conversation and many open questions that surround this work if iran wishes to begin to resolve international concerns it should comply with its international obligations cooperate fully with the iaea grant the access requested such as to individuals and workshops associated with past weaponization efforts and to individuals responsible for managing qom and answer the questions it has been asked iran has created this confidence deficit and it is up to iran to restore the international communitys trust next steps the united states and its partners believe that the troubling questions surrounding irans nuclear program deserve the full and urgent attention of the international community we look forward to working with your government to promote the active involvement of the iaea and the international community in addressing these unresolved questions we will be in touch with you in the days ahead to share ideas on how to approach the issue at the iaea board of governors meeting that will begin on november 26 beyond the board of governors meeting we would also like to intensify our consultations on next appropriate steps in the international community based on the dual track policy engagement and pressure to persuade iran to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with its international obligations hard questions and answers 12 u we have also compiled the following questions and answers to draw from should posts require them on the trr proposal why must iran surrender all of its leu in one batch and why must it be before the end of the year the trr proposal was developed both to supply iran with the fuel required for the continued operation of the reactor and also as measure to build confidence in irans peaceful intentions and its seriousness to negotiate with the e33 by agreeing to the transfer of 1200 kilograms of leu enough to equal the last fuel supply agreement iran signed for the reactor with argentina in the early 1990s we aimed to lessen international concerns that iran was attempting to create stockpile of uranium to contribute to an eventual breakout from the npt this would consequently allow more time for negotiations with the e33 on the broader nuclear file the transfer by the end of the year is needed to ensure that iran receives the fuel required for the reactor before december 2010 when the reactor will run out and be forced to shut down what risk does the leu stored in iran pose to the international community isnt it under full iaea monitoring yes this leu is currently under iaea safeguards state 00120288 006 of 008 however given irans long history of iaea safeguards violations and npt noncompliance the international community cannot trust that iran will not interfere with iaea monitoring or withdraw from iaea safeguards or the npt altogether this project will remove an immediate source of concern and establish some confidence in irans peaceful intent and willingness to comply with its obligations how can iran be sure it will ever receive the fuel assemblies for the trr in the current international environment in which many openly seek to diminish irans nuclear capacity we and our e33 partners have each made political commitments at the highest levels to the fulfillment of this project should iran agree to it iran will receive the fuel required all participants in this project are taking risks iran stands in violation of the npt its iaea safeguards agreement and three chapter vii unsc resolutions this project offers iran an opportunity to establish confidence in its peaceful intentions confidence that has eroded due to irans continued noncompliance can iran simply purchase the fuel from an international supplier as some have advocated in iran the security council resolutions do permit iran to iran can purchase lowenriched fuel from an international supplier if it wishes however we are confident iran would not find willing supplier given the concerns surrounding its nuclear program and its continued defiance of the international community outside of the context of the iaea proposal before iran we would oppose such deal how would the e33 respond if iran announced it had choice but to make its own fuel for the trr under three security council resolutions iran is required to suspend all uranium enrichment related activities we have offered iran way to secure the necessary trr fuel without further violating these obligations enrichment activities to produce its own fuel for the trr would be violation of current unscrs further iran is not currently able to produce the fuel reconfiguration of iranian centrifuges to produce the required enrichment level 1975 would cause serious international concern and could permit iran to produce stockpile of even greater enriched uranium than it has currently irans current enrichment level is 35 this would increase the risk of nearterm iranian breakout from the npt and sprint to producing nuclear weapons on demands to suspend enrichment iran suspended enrichment once before in response to international demands and received benefit why should iran trust the international community now irans suspension of uranium enrichment and other activities in the past was intended to support diplomatic process unfortunately iran terminated that diplomatic process in august 2005 by abandoning suspension however prior to that point irans temporary suspension avoided its being reported to the security council and the sanctions that would have likely come along with that report the requirement of suspension imposed by the unsc in resolution 1737 is intended to restore that diplomatic process and to lead to final resolution of international concerns with irans nuclear program this was codified in unscr 1737 when the unsc stated its intention to suspend implementation of the measures adopted by the unsc if iran returned to negotiations through suspension of its nuclear and related activities trust is in short supply on both sides it is for that reason that we have offered iran several opportunities for reciprocal confidencebuilding steps eg freeze for freeze and the trr proposal what about recent reports indicating the iranian state 00120288 007 of 008 enrichment program has not grown what is the significance of this stagnation iran has slowed or scaled back the enrichment program several times since the project became public in 2002 there are many possible explanations for the stagnation of the iranian enrichment program including technical issues with the centrifuges and general system maintenance regardless of irans lack of progress in its enrichment program it continues to enrich and stockpile leu this activity in violation of three united nations security council resolutions calling for full suspension of its nuclear and enrichment related activities and increases the risk of nearterm iranian breakout from the npt and sprint to producing nuclear weapons israels nuclear program why is there not equal attention to israels nuclear status does it not also destabilize the region the united states has long supported universal adherence to the npt treaty and continues to believe that all states that have not done so should join the treaty and accept the fullscope iaea safeguards on all of their nuclear activities it is extremely difficult however to make this case to nonnpt state when its neighbors are in violation of their own npt obligations and when the international community has not demonstrated the political will necessary to enforce compliance irans failure to comply with its npt and iaea obligations bears out these concerns and undermines attempts to secure universal adherence to the npt it became party to the treaty and proceeded to violate its obligations under it for over twenty years presenting fundamental threat to the entire nonproliferation regime returning regional states to full compliance with their npt obligations would be an important step toward npt adherence by all states in the region an iranian nuclear weapons capability also serves as destabilizing factor in the region possibly triggering proliferation across the gulf in response to mounting threat posed by iran not only does this undermine the entire nuclear nonproliferation regime but risks further instability in the region qom facility how can you say that the qom facility was secret when it was iran that announced its existence and invited iaea inspectors to visit iran was required to declare the existence of this facility to the iaea the moment the decision was made to construct it not several years into its construction this is requirement of irans iaea safeguards agreement contained in code 31 of the subsidiary arrangement to irans safeguards agreement this code was modified after revelations surrounding iraqs nuclear program were made in the early 1990s iran was the last state to agree to the revised code but it did so in march 2003 iran attempted to revert to the early form of the code which requires notification only 180 days prior to the introduction of nuclear to the facility in march 2007 the iaea consistently has rejected that iran has the legal ability to make such change we also believe that iran made the decision to declare the facility not to conform to its legal obligations but because it had become aware that the secrecy of the facility had been compromised iran claims it needs such hardened facility as fordu because for years both the us and israel have threatened to bomb its nuclear sites is it not surprising iran would try to keep its location secret to have an emergency backup facility irans own failure to meet its obligations for transparency and iaea monitoring of sensitive nuclear installations is the cause for the state 00120288 008 of 008 international communitys concerns that surrounding its nuclear program irans decision to construct yet another clandestine site only deepens these concerns p51 why should iran discuss its nuclear program with the selfappointed p51 isnt the iaea the proper place for iran to engage on its nuclear program with the international community we welcome irans engagement with the iaea but despite its rhetoric iran has not engaged with the iaea iran has refused for several years to answer the iaeas questions even before the iaea reported iran to the unsc for its myriad violations of its international obligations the e33 mechanism evolved as means to negotiate solution precisely because iran was refusing to engage with the iaea on the concerns regarding irans nuclear program clinton
