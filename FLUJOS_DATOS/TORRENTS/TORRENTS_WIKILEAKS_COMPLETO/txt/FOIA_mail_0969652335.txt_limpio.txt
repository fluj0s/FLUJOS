regarding our mbh98 and grl99 datasets im pretty sure that scott put those on anonymous ftp for you some months ago so you should already have had access to all the data we used in fact it was only few select series of malcolms that werent made available from the getgo so data has never been an issue for us im happy to hear that it is not an issue for youkeithphil and that you are ready to make your density data available few points of clarification might help here the revised method based on ridge regression is currently in development as far as paleoreconstruction is concerned we have paper to be submitted on application to the instrumental record only we intend to test it on synthetic proxy datasets as described in my previous email before applying it to actual proxy data so your visit unfortunately occurs at time that is too premature for comparison with results from this method rather we were hoping you shared some of the interest along the lines of developmentalmethodological issues comparison between warmseason reconstructions would be fine but you should be aware of the extreme caveats with regard to our seasonal reconstructions as spelled out in detail in our earth interactions article we dont do nearly as well for warmseason or coldseason as for annualmean and we believe this is consistent w the mix of seasonal information contained in the multiproxy dataset obviously things are somewhat different for the more seasonally homogeneous density chronology dataset so to us this comparison might not seem as worthwhile as it would for you all but we can do it if all provisos and caveats are fully recognized and embraced from the start the idea of testing wavelet methods of distinguish contributions on different timescales sounds like it is of interest to all of us and perhaps we can move in that direction during your visit in any case well have more than enough to do talk about investigate and need to necessarily hammer it all out beforehand comments from others scott phil keith welcome mike at 0924 am 92200 0100 tim osborn wrote at 1011 190900 0400 you wrote i will put you up at the red roof inn for the 10 nights will have reservations made for you for the night of the 10th through 19th checking out morning of the 20th that sounds great thanks mike ive talked over various ideas with keith and phil and im ccing this to them as well as to scott and ive now made some slightly firmerclearer suggestions combining your ideas and ours 1 were still keen to spend part of the time on reconstruction method issues since that is one of the specifics that our current funded project needs to address to avoid being too retrospective we could do something that combined both your nature98 and your revised methods compare your summerwarm season reconstructions old new methods with our reconstructions of aprsep temperature from treering densities regionalhemispheric averages and spatial comparisons b in we would be comparing reconstructions based on different palaeodata and different statistical reconstruction methods so better approach would be to use your old new methods with our treering density data set to reconstruct aprsep temperature fields and then compare with our reconstructions this would be good way of comparing methods c we could exchange datamethods to continue comparisons after the end of my visit we would be keen for example to obtain your nature98 grl99 datasets and software to play around with after my return in exchange we can provide you with our treering density data set and the reconstructions that we have produced from it of course such subsequent work would continue to be collaborative keeping each other informedinvolved with the work d if the treering density data provided useful added value to your reconstructions perhaps at the higher frequencies and providing finer spatial detail then we could use an appropriate method perhaps your new revised one to produce new reconstruction using all palaeodata such reconstruction might prove to be an important and wellused product 2 of your two specific suggestions i quite strongly prefer the first the reason is that again our project specifically requires comparison of palaeo and model data and the development of appropriate methods to do this your first suggestion would take us along those lines there are two related strands here the first is to use the model outputs to assess the reliability of the reconstructions ie following the ideas you laid out in your email which is certainly of interest the second is to use the reconstructions to evaluate the model simulations of natural variability weve done some comparisons with the hadcm2 and hadcm3 simulations i shall brings papersresults along what we need to develop further are ways of incorporating the paleo biaseserrors in such comparisons we have begun this but when i visit we might be able to come up with better methods and apply them to hadley centre andor gfdl comparisons your second suggestion while interesting is less appealing at this stage principally because we wont have time to do everything as it happens keith and i have just submitted paper to that wellknown journal dendrochronologia about timescaledependent calibration of treering data i shall bring copy with my feeling is that the quantity of data overlap available for calibration would be strongly limiting factor in most timescaledependent approaches whether they use wavelets or some other filteringtype approach what interests more would be the application of wavelets to the full palaeorecords to facilitate in the definition of timescaledependent coherent patterns pcs rather than just to the calibration period anyway we can talk these ideas over even if theres time to begin any work yet i think that chance to exchange preprints data and discuss ongoing developments of our work and yours will in itself prove to be useful outcome of my visit best
