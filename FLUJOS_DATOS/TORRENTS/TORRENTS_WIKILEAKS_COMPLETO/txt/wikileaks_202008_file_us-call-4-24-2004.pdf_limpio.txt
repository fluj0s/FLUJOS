foreword lessons learned during operation enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom oif revealed that special operations forces face an increased threat posed by asymmetric forces operating throughout the depth of the battlespace the united states special operations command ussocom established and dispatched joint counterambush advisory teams to both war zones and in coordination with the director operational testing and evaluation dote joint survivability jsurv quick reaction test qrt and the center for army lessons learned call collected convoy operations lessons learned and tactics techniques and procedures ttp the result of this effort is the ussocom combat convoy handbook the aim of this handbook is to describe those actions best suited to counter the threats to convoys in the hope of reducing the ussocom casualty rate during combat operations this handbook provides quickreference ttp guide for convoy commanders and their subordinates on how to train for and conduct tactical convoy operations on the asymmetric battlefield the lessons learned collection team consisted of subject matter experts from the following united states special operations command

one of the key issues shaping the global war on terrorism and in particular the ongoing fighting in iraq and afghanistan is the ability of united states us special operations forces sof to adapt to combination of classic maneuver and asymmetric warfare the purpose of this publication is to identify and consolidate operation iraqi freedom oif and operation enduring freedom oef lessons learned and provide the most effective tactics techniques and procedures to the united states armed forces either currently serving in or preparing for future deployment to iraq or afghanistan the iraqi insurgency has evolved by introducing diversified threats that range from vehicleborn improvised explosive devices vbieds to complex ambushes employing improvised explosive devices ieds rocketpropelled grenades rpgs and small arms this new operational environment tests us combat capabilities and tactics in ways we have not encountered or confronted in recent history oif and oef challenge our soldiers and leaders to adjust tactically to meet the threat and explore new protective measures to counter evolving threat tactics the validated tactics techniques and procedures ttp contained and illustrated in this handbook though not doctrine are applicable to variety of circumstances or locations this handbook provides quickreference guide for special operations forces sof training and conducting tactical convoy operations within iraq and afghanistan unless noted the graphic images vehicle interval etc depicted in the diagrams contained in this text are not to scale the following terms are used throughout the ussocom combat convoy handbook handbook and are offered hereto facilitate reader comprehension of the material presented sof combat convoy terms and definitions the following simple command and control terms are used by sof operators over the radio andor verbally within vehicles alert walkerbicycletruck this signal can indicate any potential threat and is given by the individual observer ensure that all vehicles are aware of the same often the signal is followed by left right front etc alert overpasscheckpoint signal from an observer inside vehicle andor from forward vehicle commander to trailing vehicles that there is something ahead that could possibly change the route or require actions on the part of the truck crew when this signal is given it is repeated throughout the truck and is often followed with distance in meters assault through command given by the convoy commander or senior vehicle commander for designated elements to dismount andor maneuver vehicles offensively against threat forces often preceded by contact lr or bailout lr emphasis is conducting rapid swarmlike assault taking the fight to the enemy bail out command given by either the vehicle commander or driver for all occupants to egress from vehicle the command should be followed with left or right indicating the safest or clean side for personnel to consolidate there may also be requirement for personnel to move far from the vehicle to hard cover this must also be indicated for example break contact 9 oclock inside peel 300 meters block the command to block is given when feeder roads etc need to be temporarily barricaded by designated vehicles in the convoy sometimes left or right follow the block command indicating particular side of the road blocking from the rear sometimes called the offset formation blocking from the rear is used to block third party traffic from the rear enabling collective uninterrupted lane change the convoy commander can choose the timelocation to allow thirdparty vehicles to pass on the convoys right side more fire power and drivers blow through command given by lead vehicle commander or convoy commander requiring entire element or vehicle to move through threat or area regardless of circumstances usually applies to intersections improvised explosive device ied detonations or small arms fire saf brakes signal from the driver to the vehicle occupants that he is applying the brakes as well as from forward vehicle commander warning other vehicles of the reduction in speed the driver will state brakes brakes brakes with an urgency relative to how quickly he is applying them note this signal is very important and can prevent unnecessary accidentsinjuries viii for official use onlyfor official use only ixussocom combat convoy handbook bump up command given by designated vehicle commander or convoy commander indicating requirement for designated vehicles to bump up to location to block clear statement indicating that particular lane is clear often preceded by left lane or right lane contact statement indicating that the element or portions of the friendly element are receiving hostile fire saf ied etc this statement is usually followed by left right etc specification dismount command given by the convoy commander indicating that all designated dismounts take up their assigned security positions outside the vehicles implies longer duration halt and the requirement to seek cover as well as search out blind spots man down statement given when team member is injured and cannot continue the mission quickstop signal given by the vehicle commander to quickly dismount for short period of time implies shorter duration halt or walk along than the dismount command re mount or recover command given by the convoy commander for all dismounts to return to their assigned vehicles implies headcount and accountability procedures sometimes preceded with preparatory command of prepare to mount reverse out command or signal for vehicles to back out of present location another version of this command is turn out indicating that designated vehicles perform threepoint turn alternatively as opposed to reversing out status request from the vehicle commanderteam leader requiring all team members to report support request for additional personnel to assist in security or target engagement up reply from each team member to the other team members that they are present have their assigned equipment and are uninjured vehicle down statement indicating that vehicle is
