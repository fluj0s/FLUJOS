congress received through the crs weborder code 97542 updated february 5 2003 the right of undocumented alien children to basic education an overview of plyler v doe larry m eig legislative attorney american law division summary in plyler v doe 457 us 202 1982 the supr eme court held that it was unconstitutional for texas to deny illegal alien children who were residing in the state equal access to its elementary and secondary schools though the vote was close 54 plyler remains good law and conti nues to be cited for the proposition that illegal aliens are not beyond protection under the constitution however while plyler set limits on state power it clearly suggested that constitutional restrictions on the ability of states to discriminate against illegal aliens may be influenced by congress the case fu rther implied that stat have broader power to discriminate when children and basic education rights are not at stake for example cases since plyler have upheld state laws that di scriminate against illegal aliens in providing higher education the majority opinion much of the fivejustice majority opinion in plyler addressed how strong justifi cation texas needed to sustai n its law under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the standard generally applied to state laws that treat different groups of individuals differently the rational basis test is relatively easy one for states to meet by contrast if distinctions among groups disadvantage suspect class or relate to fundamental right the courts require that state show that the distinctions drawn are required by compelling state interests this heightened barrier has been insurm ountable in public services cases in 1971 the supreme court held in graham v richardson 403 us 365 that state distinctions broadly based on alienage were suspect and struck down residency requirements for aliens unde r state welfare laws however the majority in plyler held that the more targeted class of illegal liens cannot be considered suspect class because of the illegality of their presence here following earlier cases the majority also held that education is not fundament right for equal protection purposes fundamental rights being gene rally limited to voting and righ ts based in the constitution itself still the majority was uneasy in applying rational basis test to law that ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97542crs2 viewed as imposing lifetime hardship on discrete class of children not accountable for their disabling status consequently the majority insisted that texas show that substantial state interests underlay its discrimination the majority went on to find that texas had not met this burden the majority began its substantial interest analysis by addressing whether an illegal aliens unlawful presence as such was suffici ent basis for state discrimin ation departing from earlier equal protection cases the majority indicated that congressional po licy could affect how far state may go in singling out illegal aliens for discriminatory treatment nevertheless the majority found that the fe deral governments treatment of illegal aliens had failed to provide clear guidance on where the balance shoul d lie in assessing state authority to deny illegal aliens education regarding texass justification of its law as deterrent to illegal migration and cost saver the majority focused not so much on whether these reasons could ever justify discriminatory trea tment as on the evidence supporting them according to the majority there was insufficient evidence that illegal migrants significantly burdened texass economy that denying education was significant or effective deterrent to entry or that excluding illegal alien children would enhance the quality of education availabl to others the majority felt that under then current immigration practice many illegal children within the state were likely to remain for long time and possibly would adjust to wful status pred iction proved true under 1986 legislation and that cr eating an underclass of illiterates in the state could prove costly in the long run in terms of welfare and crime the minority opinion in the view of the four dissenting justices the issue simply put is whether for purposes of llocating its finite resources state has legitimate reason to differentiate between persons who are lawfully within the state and those who are unlawfully there as is evident in this excerpt the dissenters believed that the appropriate equal pr otection analysis was the rational basis test usually applied when neither fundamental right nor suspect cla ss is involved therefore in the dissenters opinion texass discrimination c ould be sustained if it coul d show that singling illegal aliens out for different trea tment was reasonable means of furthering the states legitimate fiscal ends the dissent further found that it simply is not irrational for state to conclude that it does not have the same responsibility to provide benefits for persons whose very presence in the state and this country is illegal as it does to provide for persons lawfully present the dissent also cited the denial of ma ny federal benefits to illegal aliens as supporting stat authority to discriminate plyler and congress during the 104th congress the house twice approved education restrictions on ille gal alien children these re strictions never became law however the 104th congress did pass major new welf are reform law pl 104193 that directly denied illegal aliens most federal state and local benefits and major new immigration law pl 104208 division c that focused on curtailing illegal migration these and other more recent congressional stands against the continued presence of illegal aliens generally have been upheld by the courts in doing so the courts have at least implicitly recognized the power of congress to influence the legal relationship between noncitizens and the states still the courts have not vent ured beyond the terms of these recent laws to extrapolate an overriding congressional intent to overturn the plyler decision
