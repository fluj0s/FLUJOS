1970s created concerns about the security of the nation s electricity supply and led to enactment of the public utility regulato ry policies act of 1978 fo r the first time utilities were required to purchase power from outside sources or qualifying facilities the purchase price was set at the utilities avoided cost purpa was established in part to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produced electricity and to provide equitable rate s to electric consumers in addition to purpa the fuel us act of 1978 fua helped qualifying facilities qfs become established7 under fua utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel new generating facilities qfs which are by definition not utilities were able to take advantage of thenabundant natural gas as well as new generating technology such as combined cycle plants that use hot gases from combustion turbines to generate additiona l power these technologies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the ectricity generation bus iness and shortened the lead time for constructing new plants fua was repealed in 1987 but by that time qfs and small power pr oducers had gained portion of the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before imple mentation of purp ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power because nonutility gene rators typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge ferc began approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketori ented approach to electricity supply following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further change whether to encourage nonu tility generation and wh ether to permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities the energy policy act of 1992 epact8 removed several re gulatory barriers for entry into electricity generation to increase competition of electricity supply however epact does not permit ferc to mandate that utilities transmit exempt wholesale generator ewg power to re tail consumers commonly called retail wheeling or retail competition an ac tivity that remains under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions purpa began to shift more regulatory responsibilities to the federal government and

the purpa repeal prima rily investorowned utilities ious located in the northeast and in california argued that their state regulators misguided implementation of purpa in the early 1980s had forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they di d not need they argued that given the current environment for costconscious competition purpa was outdated investor owned utility interests str ongly supported the repeal of section 210 of purpa contending that purpas mandatory purchase obligation was anticompetitive and anticonsumer9 opponents of mandatory purchase requi rement repeal independent power producers industrial power customers most segments of the natural gas industry the renewable energy industry and environm ental groups had many reasons to support purpa as it stood mainly their argument was that purpa introduced competition in the electric generating s ector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electricgenerating sector is not yet fully competitive they argued repealing purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry additionally opponents of the purpa repeal argued that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopoly cont rol over the electric industry some state regulators had expressed concern th at repealing section 210 would prevent them from deciding matters currently under their jurisdiction interconnection sec 1254 each state regulatory authority if it has not already done so and each nonregulated utility

that were more than twice removed from the operating subsidiaries it also federally regulated holding companies of investorowned utilities and provided for securities and exchange commission sec regulation of mergers and diversification proposals registered holding companies of subsidiaries were required to have sec approval prior to issuing securities all loans in intercompany financial transactions were regulated by the sec holding company could have been exempt from puhca if its business operations and those of its subsidiaries ccurred within one state or with contiguous state historically electricity service was fined as natural monopoly meaning that the industry has 1 an inhere nt tendency toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technolog ical conditions that limit the number of potential entrants in addition many regula tors have considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evol ved however there has been growing belief that the historic cl assification of electric utilitie s as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating fac ilities primarily coope ratives and publicly owned utilities has provi ded evidence that vertical inte gration has not been necessary for providing efficient elect ric service moreover recen t changes in electric utility regulation and improved tec hnologies have allowed dditional generating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company ac t and the federal power act of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act established regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government regulatory bargain was made between the government and utilities in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility ac tivities including wholesale and retail ratemaking state aut hority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rate s and often over investment and debt at the other end of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many facets of utility operation despite this divers ity the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process the central issues in such cases are the

change in direction concerning generation first improved technologies have reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities prior preference for largescale often nuclear or coalfired powerplants has been supplanted by preference for smallscale production facilitie s that can be brought online more quickly and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediment s second technolog ical advances have lowered the entry barrier to electricity generation and per mitted nonutility entities to build profitable facilities one argument for additional puhca change was made by electric utilities that wanted to further diversify their assets under puhca holding company could acquire securities or utility assets only if the sec found that such purchase would improve the economic efficiency and service of an integrated public utility system it was argued that reform to allow divers ification would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities also argued that diversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources due to the seasonal nature of electric demand utility holding companies that were exempt from sec regulation argued that puhca di scouraged diversification because the sec could have repealed their exempt stat us if exemption would be detrimental to the public interest11 state regulators expressed concerns that increased diversification could lead to abuses including crosssubsidization regulated company subsidizing an unregulated affiliate crosssubsidization was major argument against the creation of exempt wholesale generators ewgs and reemerged as an argument against further puhca change in

utility subsidiaries in this situation opponents feared that utilities w ould not be penalized for failure in terms of reduced access to new capital because they could increase retail rates several
