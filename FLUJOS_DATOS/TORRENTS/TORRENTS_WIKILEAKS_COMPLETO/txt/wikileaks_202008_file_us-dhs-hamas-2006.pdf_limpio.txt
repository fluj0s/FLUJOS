palestinian islamic jihad although safa group entities were raided in 2003 indictments have yet to be filed moreover sympathetic indi viduals and mosques in the us have raised significant amounts of money for hamas for example according to federal prosecutors mohammed almoayad prominent yemeni sheikh raised money for jihadat the farouq mosque in brooklyn moayad who had personal contacts with one of hamas founders then funneled that money to hamas and qaeda during moayads 2005 tria l an informant testified that almoayad claimed to have delivered 35 million to hama s and 20 million to osama bin

unclassified fouo unclassified fouo 7board allegedly raised money for hamas at the islamic cent er of passaic county in new jersey12 in the mid1990s in the years since 911 as the us government has cracked down on charitable front groups13 and terrorist financing at radical mosques operatives have turned to criminal activities to raise funds for hamas testifying before the house financial services committee on september 24 2003 the fbis assistant director of counterterrorism john pistole stated that investigations have uncovered my riad of criminal ac tivities used to generate funds portion of which is then forwarded to ngos associated with hamas some of the suggested criminal activity include but are not limited to drug tra fficking credit card fraud counterfeit products fraudulent documents cigarette ta x fraud and stolen in fant formula for example in january 2002 the dea announced the arrest of more th an 100 people involved in an expansive methamphetamine network the investigation resulted in the arrest of individuals in twelve cities across the united states and cana da along with the seizure of mo re than 179 pounds of finished methamphetamine six clandestine drug laboratories and 45 million in us currency authorities were able to track 10 million back to the middle east some of which allegedly went to hamas in total hamas criminal ac tivities in the us reportedly raise millions of dollars thus by exploiting americas free and op society hamas has reaped considerable rewards from its extensive network in fact at the 1993 philadelphia m eeting the participants were acutely cognizant of the value of this infr astructure the fbi report on the meeting states the participants decided that for fundraisin g purposes the united stat theater was very valuable to them they stated they could not afford to lose it given the effectiveness of the hamas ne twork one theory that many analysts have suggested is that the group woul d never risk damaging such rich pool of resources by launching attacks on american soil for example former fbi official dennis lormel commented being that the united states is such fertile ground fo r fundraising it is less li kely they hamas would do something because if they were to attack in the united states it would draw more attention to their activities in february 2005 senate testimony fbi dir ector robert mueller echoed lormels conclusions noting that it is the fbis assessment at this time that there is limited threat of coordinated terrorist attack in the us from palestinian terrorist organizations such as hamaswe believe that the primar interest of palestinian terrori st groups in the us remains the raising of funds to suppor t their regional goals additionally many palestinians have 12 elmezain founded the islamic center of passaic county and served as its imam 13 according to the fbis assistant dir ector of counterterrorism john pistol the fbi is focused on identifying ngos which seek to replace hlfrds position as the major fi nancier of hamas in the us to date ngos exist which compare with the fundraising capabilities exhib ited by hlfrd open source reporting has identified kindhearts and kinderusa as possible hlfrd replacements unclassified fouo unclassified fouo 8historically viewed the us as the country most likely to pressure israel to cede territory further now that hamas has gained control of th palestinian parliament the group may be even more hesitant to take actions that could damage its international st anding especially since key international officials appear willing to give hamas second chance envoy to the middle east alvaro soto urged let s judge the participants in th government by what they do not by what they have said in the past although hamas has never launched strike on american soil number of critical points bear noting according to an august 2004 fbi affidavit hamas members were among the conspirators who in 1993 plotted to bomb new york city landmarks and tunnels also as documented in open source repor ting the government assesses th at hamas operatives with military training have entered the country and curre ntly have the capacity to carry out terrorist attacks in the us while capability certainly does not imply inte nt two incidents have heightened fears in december 2003 israeli authorities arrested jamal akal canadian citizen who received weapons and explosives training from hamas and was being trained to launch attacks against jewish targets in new york city and canada according to statement by the israeli government akal met ahmed wahabe senior hamas terrorist in the gaza strip after instructing akal to kill senior israeli offici who would be visiting the us wahabe asked akal to attack members of the us and canadian jewish commun ities either by shooting or by bombing their homes andor cars wahabe adde d new york is an easy place to find jews notably akal told israeli officials that he was instructed to blame the attack on qaeda rather than hamas jamal akal then in august 2004 ismail elbarasse mu sa abu marzooks former personal secretary was arrested after authorities witnessed his wife videotaping marylands chesapeake bay bridge from their suv as elbarasse drove the images captured by elbarasses wi fe included closeups of cables and other features that according to an fbi affidavit were integral to the structural integrity of the bridge court records reveal th at search of elbarasses home turned up an anarchist cookbook document iden tified as spreadsheet of trai ned pilots law enforcement only and piece of paper containing the address of the norfolk naval station the affidavit in the elbarasse case tails disturbing operational cooperation between hamas and qaeda qaeda with disproportionate number of leaders from palestinian backgrounds has exhibi ted propensity to use others to collect intelligence or conduct reconnaissance in previous years qaeda commanders and officials stationed in western countries including the united st ates have recruited hamas operatives and volunteers to carry out reconnaissance or serve as couriers with the increased law enforcement pressure on unclassified fouo unclassified fouo 9qaeda since 911 there has been renewed emphasis by qaeda to find confirmed jihadist supporters in the united states by trying to enlist proven members of other groups such as hamas to make up for the vacuum on the field level14 qaedas recent infiltration of the gaza strip perennial hamas stronghold is also significant because it could herald increased cooperation between hamas and qaeda following the israeli disengagement from gaza th israeli ministry of defense and the israeli foreign ministry announced that qaeda operatives had entered the evacuated areas from egypt internet statements from the qaedapalestine frontier jihad brigades which pledged allegiance tothe global jihad provided further evid ence confirming this conclusion then in september 2005 interview hamas spokesman mahmoud azzahar acknowledged the presence of qaeda members in gaza and claimed that hamas operatives in gaza were in telephone contact with qaeda mbers in other countries these developments coincided with an qaeda internet newscast in which the host discussed new hamas video and added may allah help them stay firm on the road to the truth ideological continuity be tween qaeda and hamas has d eep roots especially since according to the us government qaeda cofounder abdullah azzam is spiritual founder of hamas highlighting that continuity15 in an april 2004 audiotape osama bin laden vowed to punish america for israels killing of the old handicapped hamas cofounder sheikh ahmed yassin furthermore in the wake of the iraq war hamas leadership has ma increasingly strident threats against the us for example in february 2003 fox news interview hamas founder ahmed yassin ordered muslims to kill americans wherever they were found if us troops set foot on iraqi soil that same year in an ar ticle titled why shouldn t we attack the united states hamas leader abdel aziz rantisi argu ed that for hamas attacking america was not only moral and national dutybut above all religious one in 2004 rantisi took part in gaza rally supporting the iraqi insurgency amid chants of death to america and the burning of american flags rantisi called on iraqis to pr epare prepare tens of thousands of explosive belts and blow themselves up against the american enemy bomb them in baghdad he added i call on all arab nations to burn the gr ound underneath the feet of the americans in all capitals shortly thereafter hama s political head khaled mishal16 signed statement urging all muslims to join m uqtada alsadrs almahdi army in fighting american troops in iraq and in october 2005 hamas lead er mahmoud alzahar warned that president bushs actions in the 14 in february 2005 senate testimony fbi director robert mueller noted that hamas united states network is theoretically capable of facilitating acts of terrorism in the united states and january 2006 fbi phoenix document stated designated foreign terrorist organi zations ftos such ashamasmaintain presence within arizona while the activities of these groups genera lly include nonoperational activites such as fund raising recruiting and

hamas branch had been formed in kuwait to launch ttacks on us and british forces in the region additionally may 2003 open source reporting cited jordanian security officials who claimed two hamas

palestinian w ho killed three american corrections officers at prison in kosovo in april 2004 may have had ties to hamas open sources also report that hamas has been recruiting palestinians to fight in chechnya by distributing videos and posters glorifying chechen terrorist leader shamil basayev moreover in 2005 hamas launched an urdu website to attract suppor t in india and pakistan thus while qaeda receives the majority of the attention in the war on terror hamas global scope cannot be overlooked for over fift een years hamas has exploited americas freedoms in order to establish an extensive suppor t network composed of organizations such as hlfrd iap and uasr that infrastructure s greatly facilitated mas deadly campaign against israel and will likely continue do so for years to come eager to protect its us network hamas has stated that its not in our policy to target amer icans or american interests however certain factors could change that st rategy for one hamas may facilitate qaeda attacks by carrying out reconnaissance or servi ng as couriers as 2004 fbi affidavit noted with trained operatives reportedly already in the us hamas may so decide to directly target the american enemy angered by the iraq war and us support for israeli aggression hamas top leaders have increasingly warned that the u s is in danger and threatened that god declared war against america hamas has been bolstered by israels 2005 withdrawal from the gaza strip which the group views as the fruits of the islamic resistance in hamas eyes this achievement is the beginning of complete and total liberation of our palestinian land hamas has also gained considerable conf idence in the wake of its convincing 2006 election victory and has intensified its rhetoric unfazed by president bushs january 26 2006 statement that hamas is party with which we will not deal hamas leader mahmoud zahar responded that he could foresee relationship with th bush administration president bush is introducing hysteria into the region heclearly is pushing the christianzionist agenda which is why we cannot deal with him in light of conciliatory gestures by the european union and the

ultimate consequences of hama s election victory are unclear hamas us supporters may become emboldened in their quest to ensure that israe l will disappear as the crusaders and other empires disappear
