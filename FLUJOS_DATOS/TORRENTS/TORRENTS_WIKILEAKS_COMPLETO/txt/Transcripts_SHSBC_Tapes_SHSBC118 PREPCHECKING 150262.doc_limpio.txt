prepchecking lecture given on 15 february 1962 i thought you might be interested at first glance here i thought you might be interested in the auditors report notations on that you saw prepchecking i didnt show you the withhold system you were looking at prepchecking and the numbers are different on prepchecking youve got here zero are you willing to talk to about your difficulties which is just good solid prepcheck question which is rudiments question this is mostly what youll be doing with rudiments anyway i mean pardon prepchecking is just getting in rudiments so they are zeroed in hundred percent hence the number zero its an artillery term i might as well just give you lecture on this okay this is 15 feb ad 12 saint hill special briefing course and were concerned here mainly with prepchecking weve got some people that are going theyll be having wrastle around with this and im sorry for that but you can make it all right did you learn anything from the demonstration audience yes yes yeah did you notice that the questions were being given actually that appear on the withhold system fairly repetitively pardon one after the other in sequence and not repetitively but occasionally repetitive why was that why did i repeat one of the when all whos why did i repeat when all whos at what moment did i repeat those yes female voice you ran an extra incident that keyed in yeah the basic reason is the pc still looked puzzled its as elementary as that you get how elementary it is you say who should have known about this and the pc says well joe you know joe should have known about this and see all right well anybody else should have known about it or who didnt find out about it or anybody fail to find out about it any variation of the question but youre just looking at the pc for little surge well that will only go so far sometimes the pc doesnt surge sometimes the pc doesnt say oh well yeah well i shouldnt have known about it you know or something like that he doesnt have little cognition just leave it it comes under the heading of fishing for cognition you want him to find out something see so remember that pulling withholds is totally and hundred percent you dont mind my talking about your session do you fred male voice you remember that fishing cognition audience yes remember the old tr fishing cognition well thats actually what you are doing there and ill tell you something your pc can go out of session if you were not auditing the pc but auditing system you see pcd tend to go out of session because they interest of course wouldnt be on the pc now the system merely exists to get withholds thats the first thing you should recognize in prepchecking the system exists in order to clarify difficulties and prepchecking in general although it has whole ramification of stuff is compared to the rudiments and is plotted immediately and exactly against the rudiments and youll get whole bunch of little questions which are prepcheck questions which are zero1 zero2 zero3 zero4 zero5 do you see the numbering on this the rudiment that youre writing down here im not going to say anything about your withholds you can start breathing just talking about the system the zero of course is the rudiment question that is the zero which youre trying to clear up but to clean up this zero you have to have zero1 zero2 zero3 theyre little zero1 zero2 zero3 do you see those huh and this little will simply be for this rudiment theyre different for every rudiment you have different panoply of and parade of questions you see this rudiment happens to be the dynamics are you willing to talk to about your difficulties now if you want to put that together if you want to put that together you just take all the parts of the dynamics you see you take self sex children all of this sort of thing well what was very peculiar here is all i was trying to clear of the first of these the pcs withhold came up on the second dynamic not the self see and we had second dynamic withhold occurring here but remember i started out to clear self because i had other choice at the beginning of this session we didnt know anything except the pc knew it was withhold session and was very happy about it and said to get the biggest present life withhold i have and run it out see all right he said that so naturally hes going to give it to but what i want to have done in the thing is lets clear the auditor and i wanted to show you the most fruitful rudiment in action lets clear the auditor that we almost skimp in auditing and yet it is the most important one yes its important to get peoples havingness together yes its important to do this but theres nothing else in auditing clears the auditor but the rudiment see other rudiments clear other things but there are processes we have today that clears the auditor see are you withholding anything from you could say in the session yes that tends to clear the auditor bit is there something you i should have found out about you yes this tends to clear the auditor bit but actually theres this whole huge area that weve got to raise up to the highest possible pitch weve got to get the highest possible relaxation on the part of the pc for the auditor there is the weakest part of your auditing you see and its not the weakest part of your auditing personally see but in auditing pcs that shows up as the weakest point is the pc hasnt much confidence in the auditor and youve got to build that confidence up now if that confidence is built up the pc will stay in session come hell or high water the pc will actually get mad as hell at you and still be insession do you see the difference instead of being mad as hell at you and out of session you know the pc youve just because why this particular prepchecking activity is peculiarly liable to the pc going out of session why well youre asking him for very intimate activities it drives him out very easily but theres more important one than that its just before he stubs his toe on one of these kingpin withholds its missed withhold its been missed withhold for several seconds at the least see even while its missed withhold for just the period he said hmm well uhhmm well uhhmm just at that moment its missed withhold you havent got it yet have you and if he doesnt articulate it right at that second he starts getting angry with you he gets little upset with you and so on well its worse than that he starts running into it about five minutes before and he doesnt know about it yet and the only person he can locate thats badgering him you see hes being badgered hes something like bull with banderill√©ros being shoved into him see and he doesnt quite know whats whats kicking him so he looks around to find the most likely target and of course its the auditor so he tends to be little bit nervy on the subject of the auditor at that moment and you will see this time and time again and please please in sec in all this prepchecking please recognize what it is its the pc is just coming up right on the edge of it now if pc isnt tremendously well insession zzhhhh see so therefore it becomes very important to get the auditor clean as wolfs tooth just as early as you can in prepchecking now your rudiments arent run 2 3 4 in order there are some rudiments that its more important to run than others and this first one the first one the most important one is are you willing to talk to about your difficulties thats your first rudiment and thats the most important one so therefore you take that up if you were doing an hgc pc what you would do would be to clear up are you willing to talk to about your difficulties as your kingpin zero question and then move over on to the last one present time problem and you do problems intensive and thats what fits under there just your standard problems intensive complete with form just as youve been taught to do it you see thats the old 22 december problems intensive hcob dont look at blankly you know of it and you just do that whole thing from beginning to end i dont care how much data you get on the pc before you get up to that i think its the section but when you get to that section you get those selfdetermined changes in life and you go down there and you find out then what those selfdetermined changes are you assess the self determined changes you get the one that is the hottest one and then you ask him what problem immediately preceded that change and itll spit out if youve assessed it well the pc it itll just sort of appear magically he doesnt have to grope for it if he gropes for it youve goofed you havent got the selfdetermined change you assessed wrong the pc didnt give you all something crazy went on here that was just simply lousy auditing it has to be that crazy it has to be that bad for this phenomenon not to occur you find the selfdetermined change when you decided to go rowing as profession on the thames oh yeah thats good and that falls like mad and you say what problem immediately preceded that in your life and hes hardly ever thought of it before but it should just appear in front of him like magic lantern is turned on you know and he suddenly looks at it and he says how to drown my wife and it surprises him almost as much as the surprising things that come out of it i mean thats the way it ought to pop but if hes at all in session that is the way it will pop if hes worried about session and hes not any confidence in the auditor it wont pop that way see all right now you just handle it just the way you handle it thats all you just go down the line and list all of the people of the immediate prior confusion actually you locate the immediate prior confusion to it let put this straight way to get the prior confusion to that problem and listen it wasnt five years before it was anything from five minutes to five days or something like that its closer its much closer hell give you an earlier one before he gives you the actual confusion dont just take the first confusion he gives you well hell give you confusion well immediately prior how to drown my wife well it was my childhood my mother beating and so forth every day and my mother and my wife must have looked like my mother or something i read in textbook and so therefore my this this must have been it and the immediate prior confusion to wanting to drown my wife well that thats it weve got the immediate prior confusion when i was three only hes forty when this problem came up and youd be surprised thats your main your main error in spotting prior confusions see well you just walk that up and lets just spot lets just spot the minutes hours and days and weeks immediately before that selfdetermined change for that problem you just spot that you can take it on the meter and youll find it god almighty he found her in bed with another man and he completely occluded it you know itd be something wild in here see much more likely however this turns out to be complete dub or something of the sort and its an entirely different situation as we turn out in prepchecking all right you take that zone that prior confusion and list the people who were present in that you get list of the dramatis personae in that area and then it was you assess that list and youll get the hot one and you take that hot one and your it get it you get zero1 that runs something like this and the zero1 would be well lets see what well what difficulty what about your difficulties with fred thats perfectly good valid question what about your difficulties with fred see and he says well what about them nothing about them and so forth now you have at this point youve got your your zero of course is the rudiment present time problem well that is narrowed down to getting this fellows problems straightened up so thats still your zero then you get zero1 which is your problems intensive result and that becomes what about those difficulties with fred you got the idea hmmm thats your zero1 and then you get of course you get 11 because hes going to give you withhold and now youre going to run the withhold system so your whole withhold system runs off of 11 until you can finally clear about what about those difficulties with fred you see that is really your master question is what about those difficulties with fred that is your real 1 that youre trying to clear but in order to try in prepchecking in trying to clear what about those difficulties with fred he gives you withhold you even chitterchatter what about those difficulties with fred and you see that its reading and he says well i dont know well are you withholding something about fred give him prompt see and i was withholding i guess that ive hated him for years ive withheld it and so forth you see and you say okay what about hating fred see now that is your 11 and you just clean up this what about hating fred and you just clean it up with the withhold system see sounds very sloppy but it isnt sloppy at all because your next line of course is when did you first start hating fred or when was that if he starts giving you hotter withholds dont you see and so on now frankly that can go to 12 see youre sinking one stage at time here off of this thing what this is is german schema what about hating fred is awfully broad maybe too broad you see well certainly what about those difficulties with fred is broad enough god thats thats the thames estuarywide you see and then you get into this little tributary what about hating fred and thats your 11 see but we find now he has innumerable withholds from fred and what about hating fred well so forth well you kind of have to steer him now thats what i mean about steering the pcs attention and what about hating fred well i hated him for this motivator moti well what did you done to him you see what did you do to him at that particular time or something like this anything you can steer him into you dont put that down because thats just spat nah its something or other hes just going to give you tons of these things see and you will eventually get out of it and finally youll clean up what about hating fred but i said you didnt put it down if its what about hating fred and then he gives you one that is worth calling new what see as soon as youve got new what is well actually all my life i have tried to undermine his reputation and that is the withhold that is real withhold see now youve got your 12 and you carry on from there and you clean 12 which is about his attacks on freds reputation see that all cleans up each one of these you see is done by the withhold system but as if you run down to the second 1 and the third 1 you see you have to clean it up before you clean up the second 1 before you clean up the first 1 youve got the idea so i dont care how deep you go into the well now you could keep this far too accurately thats one of the things you should know you can keep it far far far too accurately god you could fill notebooks for one session see these things are simply indicators weve got to know where we go back to thats all weve got to know here weve got to know where we go back to if weve cleaned up ruining freds reputation and that fred didnt know it and nobody knew it and we went over the 234 were going to get incident after incident what about ruining freds reputation you see if thats your 12 thats well youve written that down what about ruining freds reputation and he says oh uh well uh i uh actually planted letter in the mails it was forged letter something like this you know this is very hot see well you dont go on with what about that forged letter you see and get 13 because this is just whole cluster this is going to this is big mess across the boards you see you must remember that withhold is mess see now you are applying very neat precise system to something that is totally gummy see youre putting on nice pair of boots to weed and wade through the darkest of mud so you start to get too neat and try to follow down every trend and everything the pc says and everything the utter the pc utters and make subnumbered what out of it and so on youll just run out of auditor report paper in the first ten minutes of the session and you also will have gotten lost lost your whole orientation on the case which is simply get this withhold good and slicked up you see and well knowing you could be mining very arid ground at any time you see it doesnt amount to anything nothing much is happening so the thing for you to do is to keep your orientation to keep your orientation on what are you really trying to clean up and any time you hit central thing that you really want to clean up you make subnumbered 1 but if youve got that cleaned up now theres more kick at all on having put this in the mails you see and this forged letter and so on youve gone the 234 234 234 on this you see well lets come back up to ruining freds reputation and now we go at 234 234 or something on this and we get off bunch of other stuff now just as likely as not were all of sudden liable to run into his planting evidence in freds desk at school oh well weve got brand new incident havent we so weve got new sub2 12 all right what about planting things in the desk at school see lets clean this up 23 4 234 234 all right weve got that all clean nothing more about planting the desk but theres plenty on ruining freds reputation see all right so lets fish around and the pc gives you lot of bozwoz and lot of nonsense that doesnt have anything to do with the price of fish he says well he says well i i i i nattered to him i nattered to him to the principal and i i told his girlfriend actually that he sneezed and i did this and i did that and all of it just youre pulling withholds you see anything thats coming up what youve got to meet here is the fact that every time you get off hot one you sort of take the lid off the boiling pot and it boils over for while and you clean up the mess and then you get back to this other thing well what about ruining freds reputation and all of sudden well thats dead thats dead one so you knock out that 11 youd just knock that flat thats gone now ruining freds reputation but remember we graduate upstairs again what about hating fred and he says oh yes my god i certainly do and so forth and not so bad as i did hes not bad man he simply should be electrocuted and hanged and so forth and well now have you done anything else to him you havent told anybody about you see thats your incidental question thats leader see what about this and he says oh you know mmmmmmmmm well i actually made an attempt on his life haha three days before this problem hahehheh hehhehhehehhh and it has been totally missing from view that fred was included in the plans of killing his wife he had never remembered doing that it was just somehow out of view kind of but he of course has sensation that he knew about it all the time because he did but he hasnt thought about this and it doesnt blow you see immediately well what about threatening freds or what about trying to take freds life you see thats your new subl all right well it goes clear back to when we were boys and i just remembered this incident and we were down at the old swimming hole and so forth and he was floundering in the middle and i stood on the bank and i didnt save him and now thats all cleaned up isnt it and you say well thats fine thats fine what about the old swimming hole and it goes clank it didnt clean well thats your test see it didnt clean so youve got to clean it up now what rocks lets get little rule together here is after youve put down what whether its the main 1 or the sub1 or the sub2 or the sub3 if you go back and ask about it and it rocks you actually have subquestion that youve now got to write down you get the idea but remember not to ask it with restimulative word in it you say what about the old swimming pool or the old swimming hole you say that see and the pc says well yeah thats right i stood on the bank and didnt save him you say what about the old swimming hole theres nothing on that thats not sub 12 see weve cleaned it see because make allowances here you see youre really blowing things and your incidental test and not too precisely either you know your incidental test is when you repeat it or when you ask him what question and you dont get any rock on the thing well he blew it so lets get something else to ask what question about lets not clutter up the auditors report but every time you get big bang after hes given you withhold he has not told all so its really should be what question that is your basic fundamental on which youre dealing all right so anytime we put anytime we write anything down if weve written it down then we go 234 234 234 on that question until it cleans and we finally say what about the old swimming hole and there it is now by the way you probably dont realize in this demonstration which you have just watched and i want to thank fred for that that took brave man didnt it what hasnt emerged from view is is because it was only an hour session i didnt run end rudiments as an interim action i ran didnt have time i ran skimped they were adequate but end rudiments in which i was hitting halftruth and untruth and damage harder than the devil because those are the things that are going to give you trouble in prepchecking now frankly every now and then if the going is getting very gummy and too rough run that end rudiment or run as many end rudiments as you care to and run his havingness or anything else you care to you see but for heavens sakes dont go more than an hour before you do your end rudiments because this question what about this incident in rome cleaned i didnt put it back on the meter because i didnt want to throw the pc back into session we were already running out of time but it cleaned on the end rudiments how do i know it cleaned well i watched carefully the needle pattern that was still residual and when i did the end rudiments that needle pattern cleaned on the halftruth the untruth and damaging himself i wont ask you to do that kind of emetering because you dont have to do that kind of emetering but there we went and that was why we were still getting knock on it which is why i closed it off with the speed with which i did i said well theres nothing much left on this this goes back someplace else i would have left the pc with the feeling like it couldnt possibly be clean and hed be hunting all over the place on bare street you see of course the thing knocks now naturally i will go back and test it when i audit the pc again see ill check it but the odds are very much in favor of it being clean now do you see how an incident can be held in what question can be held in because your end rudiments went out but the beginning rudiments go out in 3d criss cross and the end rudiments go out in prepchecking isnt that fascinating to get rudiments in you do end rudiments in prepchecking do you want to do bangup job of getting rudiments in why just do the end rudiments and in 3d criss cross if you want to get the rudiments in why do the beginning rudiments i think its quite amusing an entirely different aspect of it anyway you saw those exact needle patterns tend to fall onoff on the subject of halftruth untruth and try to damage anyone in the session well now listen when youre doing when youre doing bunch of withhold pulling let call your attention to something self is the fellow he feels he is damaging because sometimes giving up withhold threatens personal survival that makes sense doesnt it so he feels he might be damaging self and sometimes pcs run themselves down and make themselves appear worse than they are just as this pc did in desperate effort to make it blow see we found out it wasnt quite that discreditable and there it is it all of sudden came back into focus again you saw those falls that you had been left on 11 what about this incident in rome see theres that one we consider that thing pretty washed if theres anything on that its going to be somewhere else but will come up as another what on 1 here now what are we cleaning on 1 lets take look at this were cleaning are you zero are you willing to talk to about your difficulties zero1 of course were starting out with the dynamics arent we all right and zero1 is where we got to and on zero1 we were cleaning 1 what about these physical difficulties that was the kind of the withhold the pc had see you got the idea so were cleaning up here zero are you willing to talk to about your difficulties and go on cleaning that up for long while thats one of these broad atlanticwide questions see and then zero1 self well thats the mouth of the mississippi or something like that thats as wide as that thing is and now each time he gives us some kind of withhold on physical difficulties we get out of this 11 as what now out of that 11 if we cant clear this 11 with the 234 234 234 and it doesnt clear up right away and all of sudden some hotter subject shows up while were doing this we get 12 new what because that will be brandnew withhold dont you see and he says fred he said well fred fred doesnt know it but he was in the sporting goods store with the day that ohmmmmm he was in there the day i bought this shotgun i was going to shoot him with probably wont become what why it blows see that blows right there but all of sudden you press him little bit further and he gives you another withhold well i havent told anybody that ive always been looking for the perfect weapon with which to kill fred and still am you say what about the perfect weapon to kill fred and youve got new 1 subsomething now well run this off see and were still working on this thing about extincting fred see now weve got the subject of killing fred and maiming fred and ruining fred in various ways weve got thats all out of the road weve cleaned that back up remember weve still got hating fred you see and now we go to town on the thing because hating fred at this point he doesnt think of any other withholds right away and its all the needle seems kind of quiet and everything seems kind of quiet well lets run the end rudiments see and the end rudiments will probably sweep out of the way whats left on it now as far as repeating the when or the precision of the when you adapt your when all and who to the needs of the instant just the need of the moment of course the more difficulty youre having with it the less precise the pc has the when see so the more whens you use the more often you come around the little squirrel cage the more often you have to ask him when the more precisely you ask him when the more often the more precisely that is the rule until you get right down there to point of where youre dating it well was it ten minutes of ten or five minutes of ten six minutes of ten you see you could get down into it that precisely if this thing wasnt blowing and every time you do this you come by youll date it little more precisely and get right on the bouton and finally that is all assisting in the blowing you see all right so you would date it but at first well when was that he says well that was when i was child you say fine if youre going by it again well about how old were you you see youre asking him when but its with another phraseology you about how old were you youve already kept it in mind that he said with great generality when i was child you know lets get how old he was and he said well i guess i must have been about ten and you say thats fine thats good enough and now youre coming by youve done the others and now youre coming by it again and you say what year were you ten oh what year was i ten lets see that must have been 1941 that must have been 1940 it must have been 1939 it must be that year i was twenty ah let see and as long as hes willing to figure it out and hes making some progress dont interfere with him see dont let him run on dont let him run on and on either but dont interfere with him he says hes figuring it out i was thirtynine thats thats lets see i was thirtynine when i was well ten and ten lets see what year when was i born well thatll give it to what year was i born i was born in 1921 all right thats good that was the year i was born so ten this must have been 1930 couldnt have been 1931 why i must have been twenty when this thing happened yeah why i was twenty thats terrible but i was twenty when this thing happened and you say all right well what date does that make it he says it must have been 1941 i was well i was twenty years old when it happened you say good now you say if hes gone into this much of comm lag kind of prime the pump little bit you know what youre working on here he just got through telling you that he threw rock and you say well is that all about throwing rock is that all is that all there is to that about that isnt any more to it is that all there is to it and he says something and answers your question and then you want to find who didnt and who did and was there any determination that never in the future would anybody ever find out about it you know your notknows can go that far they can go past present and future notknows you know you can run the whole gamut the most fruitful ones is who tried to find out about it and failed or who should have known about it and failed to who didnt find out about it who had an opportunity to that kind of question is your hottest button remember that so dont fail to stress that but at the same time you can say well who didnt know about it who decided never to remember it what you can run whole lot of postulates out of this on the subject of memory if you want to you see actually the stress with which you can do this far exceeds the need of it you have far more tools than you need to pull the simple fact of somebody stayed in ignorance of this misdemeanor all right you could get very fancy with this and very complicated you know but its kind of fun sometimes just to throw it around you just play this off the cuff it isnt the way it looks to you youre not reading any crystal ball you just say well weve talked about weve talked about his wife never found out about it for long time how about fred you know lets us just interject this thing well did fred ever find out about any part of this well as matter of fact he occasionally and so forth well should he have found out about it you know press it little bit well did he ever almost find out about it oh well yes and youll get some little peak on this thing yes he as matter of fact he turned around just as i was standing there and i put the rock in my pocket yeah the dumb fool he could have seen do that you know the way they blame somebody for not having discovered something is what is marvelous about the thing you see what im saying anyway you run it down the line and youre back to your question well what about throwing rock at fred something like that deader than doornail nothing to this thing you graduate upstairs again ask this upper one maybe you can clear that now maybe not and if you cant clear it of course you can run 234 on it if he gives you new withhold and you find yourself stuck with new what well that what had better be written down with the 12 dont you see so you clean the lower ones and go back to the upper ones you got the idea so you can keep this scale going on and on and you keep moving it upstairs it takes an awful lot of withholds to make single zero1 that takes lot theres an awful lot of whats to make whole clearance of self see thats pretty terrific but eventually you graduate it upstairs and youve got that are you willing to talk to about your difficulties requires subself now what is the exact question that you would ask to find out if you should move on to sex or something else therell be something else here yeah well youve got subquestion at zero1 and that question would be all right are you willing to talk to about yourself you see and the guy is all set now yeah youve cleaned these other things up so he says yes now youve got your new one which is zero2 which is sex children zero3 family zero4 here we go you see and whenever you see these prepcheck questions youll see zero1 and all that sort of thing youll know what that is see and you just move it out of that category zero1 into your 1 and thats the first big broad general cracking withhold the pc gives you and they usually are very broad and this one is perfect example 1 is what about these physical difficulties for gods sake how much broader see do you want naturally youre going to run lot youll find it comes out pretty textbook actually its not difficult subject just dont make difficult one out of it if the every oh some twenty percent of the withholds that you run across or something like that are going to stick the other eighty are going to blow the first time theyre ever mentioned because theyre little tiny things you know now theres another aspect of this i should mention and that is that the pc gums the system up now dont get impatient with the pc because he insists on giving you information that doesnt fit into your form that is the way government operates not the way an auditor operates you see the government gets into savage roaring fury you see if what should be on line four appears on line two the quartermaster will never issue it the treasury department will never pay it well dont get that bureaucratic on this because the pc insists on giving you the when what and all in the same sentence just consider it an added bonus but dont omit asking your routine but not in such way that it invalidates him hes just told you well i had i had whole operation and i never told anybody about it and nothing about it i had this whole operation when i was twentyone and nobody at all knew about it secret from everyone boy has he fixed your clock apparently on first glance you see hes given you the when and hes given you and he tells you maybe very in extremis you know he tells you all the details and what he withheld from the doctors too you see and it all comes out brrrrrrr see and there is the situation all laid out on silver platter for you so what are you supposed to do well dont let your system get in the road of the pcs withholds thats why when i was auditing you saw an irregularity in the system the pcs already given the data what was i expected to do invalidate the pc the pc says it was at three oclock in the morning the night of december the twentythird 301 and you immediately say well when laughter you see the invalidative use of the thing i wouldnt put that in practice if he gave that much detail why id just let the system skid its wheels for that particular one and go on to the next one now its interesting to use system with fluidity and flexibility because after all all its trying to do is keep your number on what page of the book youre reading see thats the only thing the system is trying to do and let tell you that bookmarkers never get in the road or shouldnt ever be permitted to get in the road of the adventures of don quixote you see you dont ordinarily let bookmarker stop the paragraph do you well thats all prepcheck system is is series of bookmarkers thats all youre recording here but the odd part of it is if you omit it entirely you find yourself reading the last chapter when you ought to be reading the first chapter and you get lot of restimulated withholds now thats the only danger that you run is not getting all of it and missing it so you use every now and then have i missed withhold on you or you certainly use it before you start end rudiments or something like that just throw it in gratuitously not very often because its rather selfinvalidative dont throw it in very often but before you start running end rudiments or something like that you know youre just going to run little bit of punch end rudiment just to find out that weve cleaned up the halftruths and that sort of thing kind of precede it with well have i missed withhold here and watch your meter very carefully and itll flick but when you ask that question have i missed withhold here for heavens sakes dont put any restimulative reference into it because of course itll fall and remember the pc is still working on withholds you still have halftruths and that sort of thing and if you cant clean that have i missed withhold on you go ahead and run the halftruths and so forth realize you havent cleaned have i missed withhold and after youve got the halftruths whole truths so help god get the damage and then have i missed withhold on you because of course that he was telling halftruths and untruths and damage will also be missed withhold so dont beat that to death just keep your finger on it because after all youre pulling withholds all the time im sure you at the end of the session you wont have missed any withholds on him but its good one to throw in occasionally you know just as checker now youll find that the system itself has high degree of flexibility and it prevents you from sounding like woundup doll providing you dont exactly codify the wording of every line i think you think that i think you the demonstration im sure the pc was not even aware of really much of system going on and yet i was asking him the very salient points of exactly these things and he didnt notice any system going on because these are the questions you ought to be asking see however im sure that if somebody worked on this real hard they could get that well obtruded into the situation what about stealing your brothers marbles thank you when was that is that all of it who should not have found out about that thank you and you know i think the pc would get vague notion there that he wasnt really being listened to i think that would be little bit poor youve got flexibility so you have to keep the sense what im asking you to do is keep the sense of what you are doing in your head the sense of it whizwhizbang you know and wont its just basically this well right now its when you know hes told and hes given some other remarks and its when whats the date of that see anything that fits its what is appropriate to it when was that is fairly early whats the date of that now precisely when did this occur precisely look ill help you out here all right and we go ahead and we just date it down we take maybe three or four minutes dating the thing you know ah we found out it was december the 10th and 1941 203 oclock in the morning 203 and 15 seconds you can do that if it was it couldnt have been it couldnt have been thats when i said i was oh oh i get that now yeah yeah and you get another one falling out of the hamper so anyway that is preview of what prepchecking looks like and sounds like and acts like and i wanted you to have this so that it wouldnt look strange and peculiar to you i think youll find it very easy to use because it sure do pull those withholds now i want to point something else out to you at any time did the pc even look like he wasnt going to tell audience the pc protested the embarrassment of telling couple of times but didnt ever say he wasnt going to tell it never entered his head theres reason why it should have the difficulties of the session were very minor very minor difficulties the pc to some degree was braced in that session as an auditor and so forth and he was watching the model session steps and he was checking it off very very carefully very see challenging my right to omit rudiment things like that and so forth well all of that comes in ill tell you why that comes in the pcs riding up on hot stuff do you see the pcs fine and remember were clearing are you willing to talk to about your difficulties so the withholds were pulling are restimulative of having difficulties with the auditor you see but you can expect that sort of thing fine three cheers another point in withhold sessions you can waste lot of time by asking for withholds when youre not working with when youre working withholds in the body of the session man can you waste time because youve started your session out without inquiring about present time problem its more important that you get the rudiments covered than you try to do the body of the session in the rudiments so did you notice we omitted the question we were going to work on are you willing to talk to about your difficulties as far as cleaning it up was concerned i asked it and saw it fall and then i said well thats all right i says to the pc this is what were going to take up in the session and we went on to the next one all right we omit withholding why otherwise see why waste time you see on that and it was for your sakes that i tried to omit havingness at the end and you saw my you know auditing is what you can get away with and you saw miss you know but i pc looked okay his face looked bright and everything and so on he said his havingness was down i took closer look at him and sure it was down so i ran havingness just before i ended the session but in lieu of finding his havingness process and throwing your timing way out i ran the surest one i know see and we didnt run any distance see we didnt have anything very far away and i call your attention to that process if youre ever caught short on the without pcs havingness process and have to do something i just call that demonstration to your attention because it nearly always works perfectly you see its the reason why its reach see with the hands its feel it doesnt tell him to do anything with it and he becomes aware of the presence of something you see and of course hes been aware of this desk straight away and then his chair and of course hes been aware of the chair straight away and just table and chair and table and chair and your feet on the floor that is the oldest form of that was feel the floor beneath your feet and youll find out thatll bump up havingness and that was an interesting thing i had him clear down at 0 there on the sensitivity or close to and we got thirdofadial drop gain on the thing before we left that thing and we had how many commands on it twelve fifteen something like that so anyway that is that is good one by the way on some pcs that is only adventurous because it doesnt flatten in hurry and it turns on exquisite agony it just hurts like the blue blazes on some pcs some small proportion of pcs are so far out on their havingness that this is such positive enforcer touching things that when they touch things they havent touched anything theyve been carefully not touching things while they were touching things and it turns on pain in their finger tips and the pcs that are having the most trouble with havingness are most likely to turn on tactile pain with that particular thing but if the pc does my god that was what needed to be run all right well thats just comments broad comments on the session were talking mainly here about prepchecking blowing withholds blowing overts before they are finally cleaned up on the whole subject matter you are working on will reduce havingness you get your biggest resurgence in havingness when you blow whole package youve got whole chain and youve blown all these overts and that sort of thing and the guy has got this all taped and straightened out and youll find his havingness is in pretty darn good shape when hes done that but before he gets to that point his havingness will go up and go down and its very irregular and if hes been under considerable strain in the session and youve gotten charge off of it we only got i think slightly less than half division of charge off that particular session but did you notice he was walking back up toward 20 and remember how hard we had to work on that down in australia trying to get him up from the 00 out there well prepchecking brings them up and you just saw an example of it i dont know if you noticed it we watched something weve been trying to solve for years in that particular session prepchecking was bringing up pc who was running at 14 on the meter and brought the pc up to 19 at the finish i thought that was fascinating huh since its impossible was impossible for long time with old earlier processes to bring the pc higher on the meter when they were registering below between 10 and 20 remember well did you notice that we did it in that particular session all right this is prepchecking and although you will see lot of publications on this one way or the other the complications of it are not very great its sort of auditor shorthand on where are we going and the system itself simply gives you the questions in the exact rotation they are to be asked now that is the basics of the system everything else thats added to the system is simply let the auditor keep track of what he is doing and youd hate to have to stop session in the middle of the big withhold that has just tumbled out at one hour and fortyfive minutes of twohour session and the pc says well of course there was the time when i murdered my grandmother and you say good thank you what about murdering your grandmother and you get fourtonedrop movement of the tone arm i think at that time you want to have what about murdering your grandmother on your auditors report numbered with its proper subnumeral in the proper sequence of things to be cleaned up i think itd be very beneficial at that time and it would also be very beneficial to have the pcs confidence both from having done good job of auditing and because the pc was cleaned up on the auditor and i think that would also be very beneficial because it means your pc will survive till the next session and do you know there are those who might not believe this but i myself am person who favors the survival of the pc till the next session i belong to that small small band of diehard auditors who believe the pc ought to live through it anyway so there it is i hope you understand it i hope it looks good to you and more basically than that i hope it works for you like mad thing okay
