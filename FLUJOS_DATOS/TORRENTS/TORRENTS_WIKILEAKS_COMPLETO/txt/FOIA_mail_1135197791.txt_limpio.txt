meeting and solid progress toward the sod of chapter 6 as well as give you report on the ts meeting that took place on friday im in transit so havent been able to see any emails but i suspect eystein is also sending some updates on what we need to be doing well have to work fast and hard to make all the deadlines but i think its safe to say that our chapter will have real impact i want to personally thank you for your dedication to our team effort please read the following carefully the tsspm meeting on friday was exhausting as appears to be traditional for all things ipcc but it was quite impressive in terms of how paleo was viewed by the broader wg1 team of authors this is reflected in the decision to consider without any pushing from believe it or not several new figures from our chapter below i list these along with the others that will need refinement for use by the ts please note where i insert action item these are very time sensitive assignments that should be carried out asap ie before the new year where possible note that everything ie figures in the ts will also have to be in our chapter 1 the orbital box eystein and i have the draft completed by valerie et in new zealand we will readedit action item and send around to the group for further editing the ts version might have to be altered to reflect the broader audience and im not yet sure what figure would best go with the ts version i believe valerie action item is exploring with stefan nice figure that illustrates the mechanisms of orbital forcing 2 there will also be an model evaluation box in the ts that will have paleo once i get more feedback on this chap 8 is leading on this box ill connect the rest of our team with this effort with bette in the role of lead chap 6 person 3 there will sea level box led by chap 5 im not sure what the fig will look like in this box but if dick action item can produce his new chap 6 sea level figure fast we can float it as possible contributor to the ts box figure it would be great to get paleo sea level perspectives in this box 4 there will be expanded discussion of abrupt change with focus on paleo richard alley is leading this and i think that will be real plus in making sure the discussion isnt just model based 4 keiths sites through time figure is also still ts item there will hopefully also be fig showing the distribution of instrumental sites keith has the action item on his figure peck and eystein can help get the data released to keith and tim if needed just let us know 5 keiths 68 figure will have to be worked on to find the best mode of presentation and i have separate email on this one for him and tim the ts team would like to see inserted on the fig eg along the lower edge of the figure perhaps some depiction of how the site number used changes back in time and some color coding to denote how our expert judgement suggests the implied confidence in the recons change back in time im guessing this will require some phone conversations to think through with keith action item for eystein peck and keith 6 new figure depicting inferred solar forcing over the last x centuries the request is that we show judith lean et als latest for 1600 to present this could include the volcanic forcing too but it seems more appropriate that we stick with our plan to add this to the expanded 68 well have to try both figs this new one and the expanded 68 figure w and wo the volcanic series ie detrended multicore average excess sulfate from each of two polar regions on each fig i think keithtim gets the action item on all this figure stuff perhaps david action item can send judiths latest solar recon to keith 7 expandedmodified recent forcing figures by fortunat action item one will be for chap 6 the other will combine chap 2 and 6 perspectives into single figure for the ts ill send separate fig to fortunat with the details but everyone likes his new rate of change depiction and the ts team also wants ice core tropospheric aerosol record too eg for the last couple centuries jean jouzel thought we could do this using greenland ice core data and wed add this to the ts fig and either chap 2 or 6 figure since everyting in the ts has to also be in chapter 8 new figure for the ts and maybe not chapt 6 since we already have 68 and 610 with most of the info should be the one of keiths that we showed in our plenary talk on thursday the multimodel range of simulated change over the last 1000 red shading superimposed on our chap 6 observed record represented by grey shading as in the fig we showed requested modifications for keithtim action item include using 20th century ref period as in the current fig 68 b adding where possible simulations that include natural forcing only and thus not enough warming in 20th century and c adding one or more emic simulations using the new lean solar recon at least over the last 400 years with all the other forcing this last one is tricky since one at the ts mtg thought such simulation exists but it seems it is ok for us to getuse new long simulation by one of the emic models used in chap 10 peck action item needs to figure out how to get this but thomas stocker indicated hed help stafan what about you guys doing this who else could we ask for fast turnaround 9 another new figure that i actually fought including since we dont want to be seen showing off our own stuff of last interglacial lig change the ts team and susan really liked this paleo message so we came up with proposed scheme which i already discussed with bette who has the action item that will involve the inclusion of more than one lig climate simulation plotted with observations superimposed and perhaps more than one lig ice sheet reconstruction as well should tarasov and peltier be considered for this fig forced by icecore inferred lig climate are there others for this figure to work it has to be synthesis of multiple studies not just the recent ottobleisner et effort so that is the news all good from the view point of chap 6 exposureimpact but of course not so good in terms of the additional fastturnaround work that is needed the other tough issue is that after several negotiating sessions with susan the last one with jean jouzel helping the best we could do is get our page limit increased from 30 to 35 pages that doesnt sound too bad except that we have to get all our existing material into less space than now were currently at an estimated 36 pages and b get the new figures mentioned above in two i think solar plus the lig fig we can do it but everyone has to be thinking now about how to reduce our text again many thanks for all the travel and hard work over the last two weeks also in advance for all the hard work coming up this month and
