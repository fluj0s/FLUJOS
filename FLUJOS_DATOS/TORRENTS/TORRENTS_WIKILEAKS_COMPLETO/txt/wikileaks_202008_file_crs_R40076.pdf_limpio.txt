groups established to provide independent advice make recommendations for changes in public policy study or investigate particular problem issue or event or perform duty while legal definition exists for what constitutes congressional commission in this report congressional commission is defined as multi member independent entity that 1 is established by congress 2 exists temporarily 3 serves in an advisory capacity 4 is appointed in part or whole by members of congress and 5 reports to congress these five characteristics differentiate congressional commission from presidential commission an executive branch co mmission or other bodies with commission in their names over 80 congressional commissions have been established in the past 20 years throughout american history congress has found commissions to be useful entities in the legislative process by establishing commission congress can provide highly visible forum for important issues and assemble greater expertise than may be readily available within the legislature complex policy issues can be examined over longer time period and in greater depth than may be practical for legislators finally the nonpartisan or bipartisan character of most congressional commissions may make their findings and recommendations more politically acceptable both in congress and among the public critics argue that many congressional commissions are expensive often formed to take difficult decisions out of the hands of congress and are mostly ignored when they report their findings and recommendations the temporary status of congressional commissions and short time period they are often given to complete their work product makes it important that legislators craft statutes creating congressional commissions with care wide variety of options are available and legislators can tailor the composition organization and working arrangements of commission based on the particular goals of congress as result individual congressional commissions often have an organizational structure and powers quite different from one another this report provides an overview and analysis of congressional advisory commissions

commissions are formal groups tablished by congress to provide independent advice make recommendations for changes in public policy study or investigate particular problem or event or perform specific duty usually composed of policy experts chosen by members of congress andor officials in the executive branch commissions may hold hearings conduct research analyze data investigate policy areas or make field visits as they perform their duties most commissions complete their work by delivering their findings recommendations or advice in the form of written report to congress occasionally legislation submitted by commissions will be given fast track authority in congress although legal definition exists for what constitutes congressional commission in this report congressional commission is defined as multimember independent entity that 1 is established by congress 2 exists temporarily 3 serves in an advisory capacity 4 is appointed in part or whole by members of congress and 5 reports to congress these five characteristics effectively serve to differentiate congressional commission from presidential commission an executive branch commission or other bodies with commission in their names over 80 congressional commissions have been established in the past 20 years throughout american history congress has found commissions to be useful tools in the legislative process and legislators continue to use them today by establishing commission congress can provide highly visible forum for important issues and assemble greater expertise than may be readily available within the legislature complex policy issues can be examined over longer time period and in greater depth than may be practical for legislators finally the non partisan or bipartisan character of most congressional commissions may make their findings and recommendations more politically acceptable both in congress and among the public critics argue that many congressional commissions are established by legislators seeking blame avoidance and take difficult decisions out of the hands of congress other observers have suggested that commissions are undemocratic with their members neither electorally accountable to the public nor their meetings and decisionmaking processes public finally some critics see commissions as financially inefficient arguing that the costs of establishing commission outweigh potential benefits especially since their findings and recommendations may be ignored by congress congressional commissions can be categorized as either policy commissions investigatory commissions or commemorative commissions most congressional commissions are policy commissions such as the united states co mmission on north american energy freedom 1 that study particular public policy problems and typically report their findings to congress along with recommendations for legislative or executive action far fewer commissions are investigative commissions such as the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states2 that are established to examine past events small number of commissions are commemorative 1 pl 10958 119 stat

plan coordinate and oversee celebrations of people or events often in conjunction with milestone anniversaries the temporary status of congressional commissions and short time period they are often given to complete their work product makes it important that legislators craft statutes creating congressional commissions with care statutes tablishing congressional policy commissions generally include language that states the mandate of the commission provides membership structure and appointment scheme defines member compensation and other benefits outlines the commissions duties and powers authorizes funding and sets termination date for the commission variety of options are available for each of these organizational choices legislators can tailor the composition organization and arrangements of commission based on particular goals as result individual commissions often have organizational structures and powers quite different from one another

entities are congressional commissions there are several reasons for this confusion first the term congressional commission is not defined by law observers might disagree as to whether an individual entity should be characterized as such second many different entities within the federal government have the word commission in their name such as regulatory commissions presidential advisory commissions and advisory commissions established in executive agencies conversely many congressional commissions do not have the word commission in their name instead they are designated as boards advisory panels advisory committees task forces or by other terms in this report congressional commission is defined as multimember independent entity that 1 is established by congress 2 exists temporar ily 3 serves in an advisory capacity 4 is appointed in part or whole by members of congress and 5 reports to congress this definition differentiates congressional commission from presidential commission an executive branch commission or other bodies with commission in thei r names while including most entities that fulfill the role commonly perceived for commissions studying policy problems and reporting findings to congress 4 each of these characteristics is discussed below 3 pl 106173 114 stat 14 february 25 2000 4 alternative definitions might be equally appealing the wide variety of boards task forces panels and commissions created by congress coupled with the lack of legal definition for congressional commission results in many gray areas consequently some entities created by congress that do not meet all five characteristics might be considered congressional commissions by observers using different criteria for example in the 110 th congress legislation was enacted creating committee on levee safety pl 110114 sec 9003 november 9 2007 the committee is temporary advisory body created by statutory authority but its membership is determined by executive branch and state officials and it reports to both congress and the secretary of the army while it is not included in this report some observers might consider it congressional commission

hed by congress usually by statute5 not all advisory commissions established by statute however are congressional commissions congress routinely establishes advisory commissions in the executive branch by statute conversely not all advisory commissions serving the federal government are established by congress commissions may be established in the executive branch by the president department heads or individual agencies6 congressional commissions are also independent of congress in function this characteristic excludes commissionlike entities established within congress such as congressional observer groups working groups and ad hoc commissions and advisory groups created by individual committees of congress under their general authority to procure the temporary services of consultants to make studies and advise the committee pursuant to 2 usc 72a7 g22g142g150g153g152g155g138g155g162g561g7g161g146g156g157g142g151g140g142g561 congressional commissions are established to perform specific tasks with statutory termination dates linked to the completion of the tasks this restriction excludes entities that typically serve an ongoing administrative purpose do not have statutory termination dates and do not produce reports such as the house office building commission 8 or senate commission on fine art9 also excluded are entities that serve ongoing diplomatic or interparliamentary functions such as the us group to the nato parliamentary assembly10 or the canadaunited states interparliamentary group11 finally congress has created number of boards to oversee government entities such as the united states holocaust memorial council12 and the john f kennedy center board of trustees13 although these entities could arguably be considered congressional commissions their lifespan purpose and function differs from temporary congressional commissions 5 an example of commission that was widely considered congressional commission but not established by congress was the iraq study group congress appropriated money to the us institute of p eace and informally arranged for the selection of the chairmen but did not formally establish the group by statute or resolution in addition some bodies created by chamber resolution might be considered congressional commissions 6 many wellknown advisory commissions have been established by the president or by an agency for example the us commission on national security21st century the hartrudman commission and the national commission on social security reform greenspan commission were both established by executive order of the president 7 for example the advisory commission to study the consumer price index was established by the senate committee on finance in june 1995 and submitted its report to the committee in december 1996 see us c ongress senate committee on finance final report of the advisory commissi on to study the consumer price index committee print 104th cong 2nd sess

commissions congressional commissions are not typically granted administrative authority and they usually lack the power to implement their findings or recommendations instead advisory commissions typically produce reports that present their findings and offer recommendations for either legislative or executive action

do not fall neatly within the jurisdiction of any particular committee in congress26 by virtue of their ad hoc status commissions can circumvent such issues similarly commission may allow particular

from charges of partisanship30 similar charges may be made against investigations conducted by congress31 the nonpartisan or bipartisan character of most congressional commissions may make their findings and recommendations less susceptible to such charges and more politically acceptable to diverse viewpoints the bipartisan or nonpartisan arrangement can give their recommendations strong credibility both in congress and among the public even when dealing with divisive issues of public policy 32 commissions can also give political factions space to negotiate compromises in good faith bypassing the shortterm tactical political maneuvers that accompany public negotiations33 similarly because commission members are not elected they may be better suited to suggesting unpopular but necessary policy solutions34 g21g152g149g159g146g151g144g561g5g152g149g149g142g140g157g146g159g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g139g149g142g150g156g561 commission may allow legislators to solve collective action problems situations in which all legislators individually seek to protect the interests of their own district despite widespread agreement that the collective result of such interests is something none of them prefer legislators can use commission to jointly tie their hands in such circumstances allowing general consensus about particular policy solution to avoid being impeded by individual concerns about the effect or implementation of the solution 35 for example in 1988 congress established the base closure and realignment commission brac as politically and geographically neutral body to make independent decisions about closures of military bases36 the list of bases slated for closure by the commission was required to be either accepted or rejected as whole by congress bypassing internal congressional politics over which individual bases would be closed an d protecting individual members from political charges that they didnt save their districts

political and scholarly observers these criticisms chiefly fall into three groups first critics often charge that commissions are an abdication of responsibility on the part of legislators 41 second commissions are undemocratic replacing elected legislators with appointed decisionmakers third critics also argue that commissions are financially inefficient they are expensive and their findings often ignored by congress g3g139g141g146g140g138g157g142g141g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 critics of commissions argue that they are primarily created by legislators specifically for blame avoidance42 in this view congress uses commissions to distance itself from risky decisions when confronted with controversial issues by creating commission legislators can take credit for addressing topic of controversy without having to take substantive position on the topic if the commissions work is ultimately popular legislators can take credit for the work if the commissions work product is unpopular legislators can shift responsibility to the commission itself43

vary widely ranging from several hundred thousand dollars to over 10 million coupled with this objection is the problem of congressional response to the work of commission in most cases congress is under obligation to act or even respond to the work of commission if legislators disagree with th results or recommendations of commissions work they may simply ignore it in addition there is guarantee that any commission will produce balanced product commission member s may have their own agendas biases and pressures or they may simply produce mediocre work product 46 finally advisory boards create economic and legislative inefficiency if they function as patronage devices with members of congress using commission positions to pay off political debts47

it may undermine one of the primary legi slative advantages of commission the timely production of expert advice on current policy matter if legislators seek to create commission to address pressing policy problem short deadline may be appropriate in addition the cost of commission will increase with longer deadline legislators should also carefully select which event triggers the start of the deadline clock selecting specific calendar date will ensure delivery of final report at predictable time but may leave the commission less time to complete its work product than anticipated if there is delay in member selection or staff hiring linking the deadline to flexible date such as the first meeting will often give the commission more predictable amount of time to complete its work but may

expenses for any indi vidual commission are dependent on variety of factors the most important of which are the num ber of paid staff and duration of the commission many commissions have few or fulltime staf f others employ large numbers such as the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states63 which had fulltime paid staff of 80 additionally some commissions provide compensation to members others only reimburse members for travel expenses many commissions finish their work and terminate within year of creation in other cases work may not be completed for several years secondary factors that can affect commission co sts include the number of commissioners how often the commission meets or holds hearings and the number and size of publications the commission produces although congressional commissions are primarily funded through congressional appropriations many commissions ar statutorily authorized to accept donations of money and volunteer labor which may offset costs g20g158g149g142g156g561g152g143g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g561 most statutes authorizing the creation of congressional commissions do not specify how the commission should conduct its business instead the statutory language is typically either silent on internal commission procedure or specifically empowers the commission to determine its own rules of procedure for example the statute authorizing the national gambling impact study commission provides that the commission may establish by majority vote any other rules for the conduct of the commissions business if such rules are not inconsistent with this act or other applicable law 64 certain rules of internal procedure however are found in the language of most statutes that establish commissions for instance many commission statutes provide that votes taken by the commission will be by simple majority or that quorum will consist of particular number of commissioners 65 similarly commissions that are given subpoena authority are usually statutorily directed as to who on the commission has the authority to issue the subpoenas66 many commissions provide that rules regarding staff hires will be determined by the commission for instance the statute authorizing the commission on protecting and reducing government secrecy states that 63 pl 107306 116 stat 2408 64 pl 104169 110 stat 1482 oct 3 1996 65 for example the statute creating the brown vs board of education 50th anniversary commemorative commission pl 10741 115 stat 206 provides that majority of members will form quorum while the statute creating the commission on the national military museum pl 10665 113 stat 880 provides that specific number of commissioners six will form quorum 66 for example see pl 107306 which created the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states

authorizing commissions commissions vary widely in how they adopt their procedures in general three models exist formal written rules informal rules and norms any individual commission may make use of all three of these models for different types of decision making 1 formal written rules some commissions choose to formalize their procedures for meetings and hearings for example the united states china economic and security review commission68 established written rules of procedure for the conduct of both meetings of the commission and for hearings held by the commission the rules include procedures for selection of chairpersons proxy use budgeting expenditures of money hiring and firing of staff commissioner ethics and periodic revision of the rules69 changes to the rules require majority vote of the commission as well as review by outside counsel70 the commissions written rules for hearings include procedures for the hearing structure the selection of panelists generation of questions opening statements and posthearing recommendations to congress71 2 informal rules some commissions adopt set processes for establishing rules piecemeal as the need arises for example the national surface transportation policy and revenue commission72 did not establish formal written rules of procedure73 however the members of the commission did take occasional votes to clarify pa rticular procedures that the commission would use for meetings for example at the first meetings of the commission members voted by simple majority as to whether future votes of commission members could be conducted by proxy74 although the result of this vote was used as precedent for the remainder of the commissions existence neither the result of the vote the ru or the rules governing the vote itself were formalized in written fashion75 3 norms many advisory commissions choose not to create formal rules for commission meetings or hearings instead these commissions rely on collegial relationship between commission members and staff and conduct the meetings in procedurally flexible manner in some cases deference to the wishes of the chairman is followed for procedural matters for instance the congressionalexecutive commission on china does not operate within system of 67 pl 103236 108 stat 255 apr 30 1994 68 pl 103698 114 stat 1654a334 oct 30 2000 69 united stateschina

agreements about operational issues such as the recording of minutes or voting procedure but these agreements are created and enforced by collective norms not formal action or votes77 similarly the national surface transportation infrastructure finance commission78 relied on member collegiality and deference to the chair and cochair of the commission for procedural decisions79

be based on variety of factors such as the size of the commission frequency of meetings commission member preferences regarding formality the level of collegiality among members and the amount of procedural guidance provided by the commissions authorizing statute regardless of how procedural issues are handled procedures for decisionmaking regarding the following operational issues may be important for the commission to consider at the outset of its existence eligibility to vote and proxy rules staff hiring compensation and work assignments hearings meetings and field visits nonstaff expenditures and contracting reports to congress budgeting agenda setting modification of existing rules g5g152g150g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g561g22g142g155g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561
