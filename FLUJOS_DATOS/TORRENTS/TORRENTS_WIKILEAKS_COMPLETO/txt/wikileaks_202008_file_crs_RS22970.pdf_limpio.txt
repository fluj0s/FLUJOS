developing countries is one of the main drivers behind the recent surge in emissions5 when co2 emissions accumulate in the atmosphere faster than the rate at which they are removed from the atmosphere by sinks atmospheric concentrations rise scientists have concluded that the increased concentr ation of greenhouse gases ghg over the past century due to human activities is likely re sponsible for most of the global warming observed since the 1970s and could lead to climate changes over the next century that would be unprecedented in the course of human civilization the potential impacts of such climate change including the possibility of nonlinear or abrupt effects cause alarm among many scientists and citizens reports that co2 emissions may be rising more rapidly than expected often conclude therefore that the climate system may be changing sooner than expected comparing co2 emissions with established scenarios carbon dioxide emissions have been risi ng almost continuously since

emissions with the ipcc emissions scenarios misses the mark first the ipcc scenarios are not predictions the ipccs special report on emission scenarios8 sres which produced the co2 emissions estima tes cited above stated scenarios are alternative images of how the future might unfold and are an appropriate tool with which to analyze how driving forces may influence future emission outcomes and to assess the associ ated uncertainties the possib ility that any single emissions path will occur as described in the scenarios is highly uncertain while observed increases in co2 emissions merit attention nd concern comparing annual or shortterm multiyear emissi ons with the ipcc ghg scenarios reflects misunderstanding or mischaracterization of the ipcc scenarios and the models that produce them second the ipcc exercises are intended to produce scenarios not predictions over multiple decades and to provide only longter m averages the time steps of model outputs from the six models that

periods between model outputs th scenarios are meant to provide conceptual results over multidecadal periods not predictions for year or particular decade as the sres report states the modeling tool s that have been used to develop these scenarios that focus on the century time scale are less suitable for analysis of near term decade or less developments9 in addition the assumpti ons and parameters used in modeling will change over time creating value in updating the scenarios periodically normal interannual and interdecadal variab ility of actual energy use and resulting co2 emissions would be expected to produce yearly emission values that fall both above and below multiyear averages for example although recent economic growth in china and india may have been higher than projected in the first part of this decade those rates may drop below the projected vel perhaps substantially due to the current and expected economic adjustments figure 2 provides estimates of recent annual changes in energy related global co2 emissions the average annual rate of increase between 1981 and 2005 was about 18 but clear cyclical patte rns are evident in 1981 global emissions declined by 14 in 2004 they rose by 55 economies routinely experience cycles of faster and slower growth the ghg emissions associated with these cycles normally fluctuates as well if policies controlling emissions remain constant china whose emissions have contri buted substantially to recent global co2 increases is also likely to experience periodic increases and slowdowns in emissions after recent period of very strong growth chinese officials now expect period of slower emissions gr owth over the next few years10 210123456 1981 1983 1985 1987 19891991 1993 1995 1997 1999 20012003 2005 2007percent change on

emission drivers p opulation economic development and growth and energy use by john blodgett and larry parker the gcp averaged all models results for each scenario rather than using the ipccs most representative model results when saying that this makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case ipccsres scenario14 the gcp statement is true only when comparing emissions with its av eraged model results not those published by the ipcc recent emissions are below the a1 b illustrative scenario and the top of the range ipcc found in publishe d research literature moreover comparing recent emissions with the ipcc scenarios is not in itself adequate to understand future global ghg trajectories although the sres a1b scenario has the highest ghg emissions in the near rm of all the ipcc illustrative scenarios its assumptions result in emissions beyond 2050 that are far below some other scenarios like a1f which has lower nearterm emissions understanding the factors driving emissions in the short and longrun is more revealing than comparing current emissions with scenarios monitoring emissions trends watchfulness over annual co2 and other ghg emissions is vital element of addressing climate change and evaluating the effectiveness of actions to mitigate it and it is important to use appropriate data in monitoring progress evaluating recent trends may help to dis cern which future ghg emission paths are most likely and why15 for example recent population growth has been lower than many of the sres scenarios while the use of some lowemission technologie s eg low emissions vehicles wind power etc has been faster than in many of the scenarios the combined effects of such differences however require complex analysis both the environmental protection agency epa and the energy information administration eia in cooperation with additional federal agencies track co2 and other ghg emissions and evaluate the factor s that influence interannual variability and longerterm trends several international entities provide similar services including the international energy agency the world bank and bp formerly british petroleum the epa and eia also analyze how changes in the factors driving ghg emissions may affect understanding of future climate trajectories some analys ts believe however that the epa and eia do not have ade quate funding to analyze fficiently how policies may influence emissions and climate trajectories in sum the past few years of exceptionally high growth may not provide good basis for setting expectations for emissions rates in the coming few years or in the long run other changes including the rate of grow th in the global economy emission control policies and regulations and the specific t echnologies drawing i nvestment may provide greater insights into future ghg trajectories monitoring these factors and how they may be determining future emissions and climate pa ths remains important as input to policy making to address climate change
