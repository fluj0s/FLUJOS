program the fiveyear savings in medicare amounted to 43 billion in 1990 56 billion in 1993 119 billion in 1995 and 112 billion in 1997 the savings were achieved through combination of lowered benefit payments increased premiums and other changes the medicare savings indicated in table 2 are net figures in some instances even greater savings were offset partially by the costs of program expansions in the 1997 reconciliation legislation for example medicare spending was increased over five years for expanded coverage of clinical preventive services 4 billion greater assistance in paying premiums 15 billion and other initiatives medicaid savings by comparison were far more modest in these four years ranging from fiveyear savings of 1 billion to 7 billion except for the vetoed reconciliation measure in 1995 52 billion over five years in 2006 the fiveyear savings in medicare 6 billion and medicaid 7 billion nearly were equal net savings over five years from other mandatory spending programs ranged from 14 billion in 1993 to 32 billion in 1990 to 77 billion in 1995 the net savings amounts reflected some significant offsetting costs including 17 billion in 1990 19 billion in 1993 and 12 billion in 1997 for the earned income tax credit in 1997 the costs for the earned income tax credit along with initiatives for childrens health insurance 20 billion supplemental security income
