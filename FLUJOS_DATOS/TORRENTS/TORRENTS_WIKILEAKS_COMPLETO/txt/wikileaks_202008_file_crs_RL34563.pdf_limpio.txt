habilitation act of 19732 prohibits discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with disability solely by reason of disability in any program or activity receiving federal fina ncial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by an executive agency or the us postal service3 the stated purpose of the rehabilitation act is to ensure that individuals with disabilities can be independent and fully participate in society4 the act seeks empowerment of individuals with disabilities by maximizing employment economic selfsufficiency independence and inclusion nd integration into society through the guarantee of equal opportunity5 the department of treasury however is not required to take actions that would result in fundament alteration of program or in undue financial and administrative burdens in order to comply with the act6 1995 national research counc il study concluded that an important aspect of an individuals ability to fully participate in society is being able to conveniently and confidentially exchange currency in ever yday transactions as when using public transportation or making purchases7 however us citizens with low vision experience uniquely

impaired and more than 200000 who have vision according to 1995 estimate9 although the supreme court has require d any interpretation of section 504 to give effect to the statutory objectives of ensuring the independence and full participation of individuals with disab ilities within society the court has also established countervailing interest in keeping sec tion 504 within manageable bounds10 for example in alexander v choate the court held that section 504 did not require state to go so far as to alter its definition of the medicaid benefit because individuals with disabilities have greater medical needs the court in choate observed that section 504 requires evenh anded treatment and an opportun ity for individuals with disabilitie s to participate and bene fit from programs receiving federal funds the act doe s not however guarantee th handicapped equal results from the provision of state medicaid even assuming some measure of equality of health could be constructed11 similarly other federal and state court decisions have held that violations to section 504 woul d not be present when the remedy would result in an undue burden12 american council of the blind v paulson overview in 2002 the american council of the blind along with two individuals with visual impairments coll ectively the council filed suit against the secretary of the treasury of the ited states the council alleged that us paper currency violates secti on 504 of the rehabilitation act it sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the secr etary from continuing to manufacture notes greater than 1 in their present format and to require the secretary to create and implement corrective action plan13 the secretary responded by denying the allegation of violation and defended the treasurys practices claiming that adherence with the councils recommenda tions would be unduly burdensome the district court held that the secretary was in violation of the act however the court while acknowledging the secretarys vi olation withheld from electing the appropriate alternative or design change to bring the secretary within compliance instead it ordered status conference with both parties for the purpose of discussinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34563crs3 14 the dissenting judge opined that this case was not yet ripe to be heard by the court of appeals since final judgment with an appropr iate remedy had not been determined by the lower court am council of the blind v paulson 525 f3d 1256 1274 ddc 2008 15 id at 1256 16 the council identified variety of accommodati ons relating to the color size and shape of paper currency as well as the addition of durable tactile feature such as embossed dots foil microperf and raised intaglio printing id at 1261 the court held that the accommodations are facially reasonable since other countries have adopted them the secretary did not suggest how each was not feasible and the costs of some are of similar magnitude to the costs of current redesigns see id at 1259 17 id at 1271 18 id at 1266 19 the three elements are considered to be selfevident because 1 section 504 defines an individual with disability as any individua l who has physical impairment which substantially limits one or more of the individuals major life activities the term physical impairment includes visual impairments 2 an indi vidual with visual impairment is able to meet the currency programs requirement of being purchaser in spite of his handicap see davis 442 us at 406 3 the court stated that it has tended to give program or activity an expansive meaning am council of the blind 525 f3d at 1266 n 13any remedy in may 2008 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia in 21 split decision uphe ld the district courts ruling14 the us court of appeals held that th secretarys failure to design produce and issue paper currency that is readily dis tinguishable to blind and visually impaired individuals violates section 50415 the court reasoned that the council had established that individuals with visual impairments lack meaningful access to currency and that the council had provided facially reas onable methods for currency redesign which would provide m eaningful access to those populations16 the court concluded that the secretary of the treasur did not demonstrate that implementation of every method proposed by the council would result in an undue burden for the treasury17 the court came to its decision by assessing the four necessary criteria used to determine whether program or agen cy is in violation of section 50418 the four criteria plaintiffs must establish are 1 they are disabled within the meaning of the rehabilitation act 2 they are otherwise qualified 3 the program or activity in question is carried out by federal executiv agency or with federal funds and 4 they were excluded from denied the benef it of or subject to discrimination under the program or activity three of the four elements were selfevident in this case19 and the secretary focused his arguments on the remaining elem ent of exclusion denial of benefits or discrimination under the program the secr etary maintained that individuals with visual impairments have m eaningful access to currency as required by section 504 and therefore there is exclusion denial of benefits or discr imination present he further asserted an affirmative defense stating that if disc rimination were foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34563crs4 20 permitted as an affirmative defense under 31 cfr 17150 a2 21 see am council of th blind v paulson 463 f supp2d 51 ddc 2006 amcouncil of the blind 525 f3d at 1267 22 id alternatively meaningful access is not lik ely to exist where the plaintiffs want to expand or alter the scope of the program id 23 the secretary challenged this holding on appe claiming that the district court did not have legal basis for concluding that the id entification must occur without assistance the court held that governmentprovided interpretive services such as portable currency readers might be sufficient as meaningful ac cess but there are such affordable accurate interpretive services currently av ailable the assistance instantly available is either through the kindness of strangers or expensive unr eliable equipment neither of which provide proper access am council of the blind 525 f3d at 127071 24 id at 1269 25 even if the electronic readers were accurat they would still not suffice as meaningful access because of their cost the ability of an individual to spend money on aides in order to fully participate in society does not overcome lack of access see rothschild v grottenthaler 907 f2d 286 291 2d cir 1990accommodating the visually impaired in the manners suggested by the council would impose an undue burden on the treasury20 the lack of meaningful access the first part of the secretarys argument that visually impaired individuals already enjoy meaningful access to currency is complicated by the lack of legal precedence to establish definition of meaningful access21 here the court determined that lack of meaningful access is likely to exist where plaintiffs can identify obstacles impeding access22 the council sought to remove an obstacle that visually impaired individuals confront in using paper currency for everyday transactions the secretary argued that individuals with visual impairments have removed an obstacles through coping mechanisms which provide them with all the access re quired by section 504 these mechanisms include asking sighted persons for assist ance during transaction using portable electronic reader to identify bills or by keeping differing denominations folded in distinct ways so that each could be distinguishable by touch another mechanism mentioned was through cashle ss payment such as with credit andor debit cards so that the blind could still enjoy autonomy in sales transactions w ithout being hindered by uniform bills the appellate court affirmed the district courts finding that these coping mechanisms were not adequate because it reasoned that meaningful access exists if an individual with visual impairm ent cannot accurately identify money without assistance23 the court likened the secretarys arguments regarding coping mechanisms to contending that merely because the mobility impaired may be able either to rely on the assistance of strangers or to crawl on all fours in navigating architectural obstacles they are not denied meaningful access to public buildings24 the use of the electronic reader was rejected as means of meaningful access since the reader costs 270 and is not always accurate25 bills folded according to denomination can help an individual di stinguish between them through touch at the time of the transaction but the method still requires sighted personshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34563crs5 26 am council of the blind 525 f3d at 1270 27 id 28 see cases cited supra note 12 29 id at 1271 n 18 30 id 31 id 32 id 33 in the district court the secretary argu ed that the councils recommendations would make it more to difficult for the treasury to prevent counterfeiting the court held that contention to be unsupported by evidence and that other countries have used these same recommendations in order to combat counterfeiting am council of the blind v paulson 463 f supp 2d 51 60 ddc 2008confirmation of the bills value before it can be folded appropriately even cashless methods could similarly requi re sighted persons assura nce that the receipt bears the correct charge26 furthermore the court concluded that utilizing these mechanisms might allow individuals with vi sual impairments to make purchases but they would still deny them access to entry level jobs that require even minimal cash transactions27 the secretary does not b ear an undue burden under section 504 program or activity is not obligated to accommodate an individual with disability when the means required for accommodation would be unduly burdensome28 the test to determine if so mething is unduly burdensome is one that requires comparison of the resources of the defendant to the cost of the accommodations that are required for compliance with section 50429 here the secretary argued that the district court erred when it categorically denied that compliance with the councils recommendations would not constitute an undue burden for the treasury30 in particular the secretary contended that the most expensive accommodation should have constituted an undue burden the court rejected this claim stating that liability under secti on 504 requires only that the least burdensome accommodation not be unduly burdensome31 the court found that the secr etary did not demonstrate why each of the facially reasonable accommodations offered by the c ouncil would be burdensome he had only attempted to demonstrate why the accommodations as whole would be burdensome32 applying that standard the appellate court held that the district court was correct in its ruling the accommodations could be categorically accepted as not constituting an undue burden since the least burdensome accommodations were not unduly burdensome in reaching its conclusion the court relie d in part on the practice of currency systems worldwide the secretary did not address why any of the accommodations practiced in the 180 other countries that i ssue paper currency were infeasible in the united states33 the court also placed emphasis on the lack of accurate evidence regarding the burden of cost the secretar provided figures for the redesign of all currency including 1 bills which would not be included in the proposed alterationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34563crs6 34 am council of the blind 525 f3d at 1271 35 id 36 id among the estimates offered by the secr etary were including numeral on each denomination at least

45 million and 75 million and increase the annual cost of currency production by between 9 million and 18 million adopting different sizes for each denomination could cost in excess of 200 million id at 126364 citations omitted 37 id at 1271 38 id at 1259 the cost of the 1996 redesign was approximately 34 million and increased the annual cost of producing currency by over 31 million the cost for the 2004 redesign was over 113 million and increased the annual cost of producing currency by more than 25 million id at 1272 39 id at 127273 40 am council of the blind 525 f3d at 1274 on july 30 2008

httpwwwhousegovappslisthearingfinancialsvcs_demhr073008shtmlremedy34 since 1 bills account for nearly half the bills that are printed35 the costs offered as being associated with re design were found to be inflated36 also the secretary had suggested that the shorter life span of the redesigned bills would increase costs yet he failed to provide statistically significant data on this issue37 finally the court ruled that the similarity between the co sts of some of the proposed accommodations by the secretarys own timates and the costs of recent paper currency redesigns to prevent counte rfeiting provided s upport for financial feasibility38 the secretary further contended that altering the size of us currency would place an undue burden on third parties such as vending machines cash processors change machines and cash registers the court rejected the secretarys argument on two grounds that the effect of the remedy on third parties is us ually not considered and that the secretary failed to demonstrate the severity of the burden that each redesign would place on the third parties39 implications for legal remedy the secretary did not app eal the court of appeals decision and the case was remanded to the united states district court for the district of columbia to address the american council of the bli nds request for injunctive relief40 this section considers several

provide meaningful access to individuals with low vision on appeal the secretary challe nged that holding clai ming that the district court had impermissibly curtailed the secret arys discretion the appellate court rejected that contention stating that the district court expressly acknowledged the secretarys discretion in its ruling furthermore the appella court held that since the secretary did not demonstrate that accommodating individuals with vision would present uniquely undue burden accommodating only those with low vision would not be sufficient to bring him into compliance of section 504 am council of the blind 525 f3d at 1273 43 diabetic retinopathy and agerelated macular degeneration are among the four leading causes of low or vision the basis of those impairments diabetes and

by the conflicting points of view within the community of individuals with visual impairments41 the district court held that any solution that accommodates some but not all individuals with impaired vision is at best half measure42 the solutions suggested by the council included wide range of options the spectrum of individuals affected by uniform currency likewise spans wide range from individuals with low vision to those with vision among the causes of visual impairments two also correlate with decreased tactile ability43 the correlation between visual impairments and tactile function presents more complex issue regarding an adequate remedy to accommodate all individuals with impaired vision if the secretary is charged with redesigning currency so that individuals with visual impairments including the subpopulation w ith decreased tactile function can gain meaningful access to it more than sub tle tactile features would have to be incorporated it is unclear whether the more involved remedies such as alterations in size and shape will pass the test of undue bur den since none of the proposed remedies was specifically analyzed using that test the adequacy of the remedy may be stioned even further publicly since not all advocates for the visually impaired agree that there is lack of meaningful access during the appeal the secr etary had the support of the national federation of the blind the federation which filed an amicus brief asserting that the blind currently have meaningful access to curre ncy with 50000 members the federation is the largest organization representing blind and visually impaired individuals44 the federations position is that the cost involve d in changing us currency is not worthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34563crs8 45 see

blind mitch pomerantz its president states that this is tremendous victory for the american council of the blind and for every blind and visually impaired person living in the unite d states today and in the future we hope that the treasury department will now sit down with us to come up with mutually satisfactory way of making our currenc accessible the amer ican foundation for the blind afb has similarly lauded the ruling this is an important victory for people who are blind and visua lly impaired said the director of public policy for afb we applaud the american council of the blind for championing this issue and look forward to the day when people with vision loss have as reliable access to paper money as everyone else47 in conclusion despite the c ourt of appeals holding in paulson many issues regarding an appropriate remedy to address discriminatory elements of us currency remain unresolved
