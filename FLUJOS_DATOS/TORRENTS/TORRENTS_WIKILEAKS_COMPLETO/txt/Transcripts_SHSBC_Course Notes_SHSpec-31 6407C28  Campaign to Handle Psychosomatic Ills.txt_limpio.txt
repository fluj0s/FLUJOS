6407c28 shspec31 campaign to handle psychosomatic ills there will be small popular textbook on the handling of psychosomatic illnesses healing is nobodys monopoly if it becomes anyones monopoly it will be the monopoly of those who can produce results he who can do the job should be the authority there are three actually four aspects or types of illness 1 predisposition eg rats carrying disease impure water etc 2 precipitation 3 acuteness ie acute illness or injury 4 prolongation ie any illness that goes beyond its expected term when there is an acute injury or illness one that exists right now but is temporary then there is job for medico he is the authority in that field that is where he is trained we should grant him that beingness if someone gets cholera he is sick get the medico where the medico errs is in trying to take in terrain that is broader than the sphere of his authority there are two other things that happen in illness the predisposition or cause of it the medico is just faintly into this it is more the province of the public health officer who is often an engineer not an md efforts to handle predisposition factors are put on physical level tb testing industrial health programs etc medicine cant often determine the length of time involved in predisposition it begins with an indeterminate point as far as medicine or doctors are concerned with physical cause eg germ or malarial mosquito or the alcohol that drunk driver who injured himself drank before he drove such things are what the medico attributes predisposition to they are physical things not mental ones the other area of illness is prolongation the perpetuation of an illness the failure to recover speedily by the expected term of the illness doctors know the expected duration of the acute phase of an illness they have way of estimating the period of predisposition unless they can establish disease contact even that is not really accurate since person can be predisposed to certain illness before contacting germs contact with the germ is really precipitation of the illness so medicos are only slightly involved in predisposition they have acute illness as their exclusive purview and they are totally ineffective in the area of prolongation prolongation is fuzzier area since the treatment of the illness can contribute to it the medicos whole idea of prolongation is 1 treatment not soon enough 2 improper treatment 3 complications but prolongation can only be co trolled to limited extent by medicine if an illness enters the stage of prolongation with complications setting in the medicos tend to go into apathy just like the patient because there are elements in the prolongation of the illness that they cant control medicos understand predisposition by physical means they understand the acute phase in physical terms in scientology we would say that the cycle of action would be from the first contact with the predisposing factor to the end of the expected normal term of the illness the doctor can handle this cycle but sometimes complications occur because of poor or absent treatment in his view again it is physical but the medico tends to be rather apathetic about it or to go into frantic activity eg repeated operations or heroic measures shock or postoperative shock is physical thing to doctor usually he can neither prevent it nor do anything about it he neglects any possible mental influence when you say illness and healing the md of course thinks of physical address to these since this is what he means by these terms however most doctors know that they are up against something else when they are dealing with psychosomatic illness if you say psychosomatic healing this is way out to the doctor how the doctor somes to recognize the existence of psychosomatic illness is puzzler since this type of illness is not started by physical contact the faults that the doctor finds with psychosomatic healing are only that 1 it encroaches on his field 2 he doesnt understand it the psychosomatic healer tends to overreach himself and to enter the field of physical healing in which he is not trained and he tends to inhibit or prohibit treatment of physical illness when it exists for example doctor will therefore condemn chiropractor he will point out that the chiropractor adjusted the slipped disc of ten patients and of course nine of them felt better but he did the same thing with the tenth patient who was really suffering from tb which undiagnosed by the ignorant practitioner subsequently caused the death of the patient therefore chiropractor is dangerous to the doctor that is the professional mds professional objection in its entirety this argument is neatly handled by us if we send sick patients to an md before we handle them the md also recognizes that when he gets into the field of psychosomatic illness he is in nevernever land he knows not of because it is not purely physical an auditor cant do much with someone who is acutely physically ill such person has too much ptp and not enough ability to asis heavy acute illness is ptp and you cant audit over ptp so dont try get the ptp handled first by doctor if necessary then the field of prolongation of illness belongs to scientology dont audit over high temperature you could perhaps use very simple process reachwithdraw from the pillow perhaps and see if it works but thats all the proper approach is to try to put such pc in communication at very low level if you dont get sudden resurgence leave it there is point in trying to complete whatever action you were on because the pc is too distracted by his body problem to asis what you were on prolonged illness is in the field of psychosomatic healing ie scientology touch assist shifts the pcs attention off of the place where the pc decided to stop the shock wave and it discharges that part of the incident thus touch assist allows the incident to run through the places where the shock wave did go to can be run out if you continued the touch assist you would put the pc back at the beginning of the incident again then you would have to run the incident out again the reason why an engram persists is that it contains lie the pc has tried to stop the motion and with the stuck picture has apparently done so but actually the pc did not stop the incident or the movement of the shock wave through the body so it has to be run through to be asised so when accepting pc for auditing you would be wise to have him get good physical exam first so that any acute physical illness can be treated before you start auditing him however if the pc has an untreatable illness there is point in telling the doctor that you are going to heal him you are not talking about the same kind of healing so you will just get into big disagreement you can get into communication with the doctor on the basis of his expertise in his area get him to write report on his findings dont appear to challenge him in his field when you are in the field of psychosomatics you are in the field of prolongation of illness your argument with the md takes an interesting turn at this point there is nothing that he can do you can tell him this is question of psychosomatic illness there is probably some mental condition holding the illness in place he can agree with you in oversimplified terms you can tell him that it is more complicated than that and he will agree it is something that has exceeded his cycle of action so he has to become the effect of it if you can do something about psychosomatic illness when the doctor cant he will be glad to send those patients to you because those are the patients he can do nothing about which makes him feel like fraud and gives him loses these are the patients whose illnesses go on longer than they should you can tell the doctor simplified version of what you will do as one specialist to another then you get your result and the doctor will look on you with awe the md knows that the psychiatrist is failure because among other things he cant handle never solved the problem of prolongation for the md if scientology made its position completely clear to the medical doctor namely that we are not interested in trying to heal obvious physical injury and illness our view would become much realer to the md and we would be seen as doing him service in handling the crocks just agree to the truth that skull fracture for example is nothing that psychosomatic healing should be practiced on that there is purview that belongs properly and exclusively to the md and surgeon and he will stop fighting you instantly psychosomatic healing actually has an old tradition older than the mds this includes witch doctoring magic etc naturally it is the oldest tradition it has truth behind it because it is the tradition of the spirit this is just small part of scientology but it is where we belong in the field of healing
