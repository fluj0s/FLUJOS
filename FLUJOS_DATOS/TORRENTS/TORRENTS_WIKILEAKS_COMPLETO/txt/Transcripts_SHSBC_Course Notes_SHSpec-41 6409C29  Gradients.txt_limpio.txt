6409c29 shspec41 gradients gradients are vital in all areas of scientology and life gradient is concept that has bypassed many scientologists as evidenced by the difficulty that some of them have in pulling withholds if you knew gradients well you would never have trouble with auditing pcs what you are really having trouble with isnt what you appear to be having trouble with the same applies to pc or student if you are not getting case gain on pc it could be mistake in the gradient you cant get someone over trouble that he isnt having so if you process his problem and he doesnt get better you have him over his head on what he can confront and handle what he complains of may not be the real problem at all some processes like what could you confront handle this automatically this doesnt mean that you dont have to follow gradient in your address to the case you should plan it on gradient processes are all designed with the idea of starting with little and moving up to lot the classification program is designed the same way as the auditor moves up in class he can handle more difficult pcs and more of the pcs case you can handle just about anything by tackling the first fundamental thing first and taking on more and more bit by bit in lots of research people have never gone to the fundamentals they have never asked what they were looking for or where to approach it or observed some obvious basics for instance you can examine sound gross vibration with light fine vibration but you cant examine light with sound you cant look at it with anything but itself the only thing that can look at color light waves is you the color wheel cant be circle the same color appearing at the other end of the spectrum must be matter of harmonics this gets into taste you are the only thing that can evaluate color harmonics when you dont know about gradients you try to build castle on top of palace on top of condition that you call the pcs case without going to the fundamentals knowing what you are looking for or where to approach it or observing some obvious basics this happens because you never walked up the gradient and never saw the fundamentals of th pcs case you only wind up with notion of the fantastic complexities of existence if ones observations are nonsense then ones solutions will be nonsense and if you keep trying to observe the totality of the case without observing one little thing about it you will never find the gradient that leads to observation of the case approach case with the question what is he doing that i can understand you wont be able to remedy the case unless you can find one thing to handle at time on the case to remedy case find one thing you can understand about the case and fix it then find another as this proceeds the case will become simpler dont try to grasp or handle the whole damned case in two days the pc is always at the top of selfcreated gradient of complexity that he hasnt climbed and he tries to get the auditor there too so you get suckered in on it and try to solve the whole case overnight thus you get lose now take overts you ask the pc if he has ever committed crime that could send him to jail if it were discovered that is flying to the top of the building jumping the gradient and making the auditor feel as though he cant pull overts you pull overts on gradient what gradient would work first you have to take into consideration the fact that you are pulling the pcs overts on comm line which may be pretty tenuous to start with the comm line must be sturdy enough to hold the level of charge or overt that we want to have come over on it first build up the comm line then start getting some little overts that come across easily leading to bigger and bigger overts always pulling overts of magnitude that the pc can confront there are two gradients 1 the pcs willingness to talk to the auditor 2 the level of overt that he is willing to tell there are degrees of willingness to talk to the auditor you cant expect pc who is unwilling to talk to you to tell you some big overt once you have the comm line in the pc will be able to tell you as much as he himself can confront which will increase the more he tells you people can generally confront thought more easily than they can confront masses or things so on the pe course stick to definitions of things like life or body not necessarily even definitions of scientology terms you can blow tons of charge with nothing but definitions dont get into heavy bank stuff use light gradient definitions about thoughts are easier for people to grasp than definitions of masses if someone cant see the data that you are giving him he cant apply it and he flies up to the top floor of the building adds complexities to the data and then considers that it is complex and that there is fundamental there so he invents bunch of nonsense with regard to it misses it entirely and never gets any result with it so be careful about gradients in training the student has to be able to see and apply what you are talking about what you want to watch for in pc is glibness unreal answers and comm lag trying to find gradient to enter in on with that fellow is fantastic because he is already stuck in the top floor but unreal the gradient had better be low slow approach you have to find something about the case that you can grasp then go ahead the time to start looking for something in the case that you can grasp is when the case gets into some difficulty some lack of advance undercut the case on the basis of ability if you undercut on the basis of sanity you may insult the pc find out what the pc can really do and get him to do it better when pc doesnt advance find lower gradient find something about the pc that you can grasp the next time you feel queasy about pulling pcs overts look the situation over do you have comm line there to pull the overts on when you do the next stage is what could the guy himself confront approach the pc gradiently with questions like what have you done and why wasnt that an overt you have to keep the comm line in while pulling the overts by pulling them gradiently you can err by asking the pc for more overt than he himself can confront having done as long as you are asking for overts he can confront the comm line will stay in and your manner wont even matter asking for things that he cant confront only restimulates him it is not matter of politeness when we pick up points in the gradient of living that the person has bypassed and gotten stuck on and get him to understand them we call this clearing at those points the pc had wrong answers or omissions when those are cleared up he can confront and live life easily dont be so dedicated to the gradient that you fail to observe when someone climbs it very fast as can happen complicating factor that hasnt been recognized is peoples prior education or knowledge of some area or activity this is generally explained as natural talent or knack you can get mistaken ideas about the difficulty of auditing or about your ability to audit when the real problem is only that of approaching the case on the right gradient it is trebly important to train students on the right gradient so that people can win at it and know that they can do it and keep on doing it
