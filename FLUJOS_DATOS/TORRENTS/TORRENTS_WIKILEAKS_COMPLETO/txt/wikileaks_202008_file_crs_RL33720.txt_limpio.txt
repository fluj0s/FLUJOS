science and industry division imports of canadian waste summary private waste haulers and canadian cities including the city of toronto ship large quantities of waste to the united states about four million tons as many as 400 truckloads day have been shipped annually since 2004 according to receiving states nearly threequarters of this waste has gone to two large landfills near detroit the influx of waste has been highly controversial in part because the ability of state and local governments to restrict it is limited under court rulings concerning the us constitutions commerce clause only congress can authorize restrictions that discriminate against foreign waste thus for several years the state of michigan and the michigan congressional delegation have pressed congress for action legislation to provide limited authority to restrict waste imports hr 518 was introduced early in the 110th congress by representative dingell with the co sponsorship of the entire michigan delegation the bill was reported by the energy and commerce committee march 29 and passed the house by voice vote april 24 2007 congress began to focus on this issue in the summer of 2006 in july of that year in the department of homeland security appropriations bill hr 5441 the senate approved the establishment of an inspection program for waste imports that might have added more than 400 in fees to the cost of importing truckload of waste in early september the house passed legislation similar to hr 518 hr 2491 in the 109th congress which would have given states limited authority to restrict waste imports in between these actions an agreement was reached between michigans two senators and the ontario ministry of the environment under which ontario will eliminate shipments of municipally managed waste to michigan by the end of 2010 the steps taken by congress in beginning to move legislation as well as separate legislation enacted by the state of michigan clearly played role in bringing about the voluntary agreement between michigans two senators and ontario but large issues remain the agreement is not treaty or an international agreement so it does not formally bind the united states or canada or the parties shipping and receiving the waste assuming that its provisions are adhered to by ontarios waste managers it still would not address twothirds of the waste being shipped to michigan ie the waste being managed by private waste management firms and it would not affect waste shipments to states other than michigan this report provides background information on the history

shipments and waste has flowed across the border in both directions for years1 the federal government does not report data regarding such shipments but information is available from environment canada the ontario ministry of the environment and from some us states according to these sources the united states appears to be net exporter to canada of hazardous waste2 but because of plentiful landfill capacity lowcost disposal options and existing contractual arrangements the united states is much larger net importer from canada of nonhazardous solid waste the latter category can include municipal solid waste msw3 construction and demolition cd waste medical waste and nonhazardous industrial waste us canada bilateral agreement under 1986 agreement between the united states and canada4 shipments of hazardous waste require notification to the importing country and that countrys consent before waste may be shipped the notification must include the exporters identity description of the waste the frequency or rate at which the waste will be 1 prior to july 1991 the amount of municipal solid waste shipped to the united states was rather small because the animal and plant health inspection service of the us department of agriculture aphis required incineration of all foreign garbage shipped to the united states to prevent foreign pests and diseases from harming us agricultural production canadian waste was exempted from this requirement in july 1991 when aphis decided that it did not have the legal authority to prevent the importation of canadian garbage or to require its incineration because there was biological basis for these restrictions the amount of canadian waste shipped to the united states increased at least fivefold following this decision 2 environment

while exports totaled 327746 metric tonnes hazardous waste is defined in regulations at 40 cfr part 261 3 municipal solid waste is not defined by statute or regulation but is generally considered to

importing country is considered to have objection consent is not irrevocable whether express tacit or conditional the importing countrys consent may be withdrawn or modified for good cause the bilateral hazardous waste agreement was amended in 1992 to establish similar requirements for municipal solid waste5 but for lack of legislative authority the amendment was never implemented6 it is these unregulated shipments of non hazardous waste principally municipal solid waste that have proven controversial lacking notification or consent requirements for msw many state governments do require the operators of solid waste management facilities to report the origin of waste they have received for disposal after the fact on quarterly or an annual basis according to these data entities in the canadian province of ontario have shipped major quantities of waste principally msw and cd waste to the united states in recent years waste import data state waste reporting requirements are not uniform the reporting periods vary as do the methods used by states to collect the data some states dont collect data at all although one can often find knowledgeable official willing to provide an estimate using these sources crs has from time to time compiled the existing state data in an attempt to provide comprehensive and comparable estimates our latest survey published in june 2007 indicated that michigan received 3781171 tons7 of municipal solid waste from ontario in fy2005 october 2004september 20058 new york the second largest recipient received 195228 tons from ontario in calendar year 2005 the only other recipient we identified was the state of washington which received 101834 tons from the canadian province of british columbia in 20059 the proportions are consistent with amounts reported in earlier years thus it appears that more than 90 of the solid waste that canada ships to 5 amendment to the agreement between the government of the united states of america and

and fiscal year 2006 in fy2006 michigan reported that it received 12084907 cubic yards an estimated 403 million tons of non hazardous waste from canada canada accounted for 195 of all the waste

michigan has attempted to restrict imports of waste in 1992 however in fort gratiot sanitary landfill v michigan dnr waste import restrictions authorized by the state were held unconstitutional by the us supreme court12 under article i section 8 of the us constitution congress is given power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in long series of cases beginning in the 1800s the court has held that this grant of authority to congress implies prohibition of state actions to discriminate against interstate and foreign commerce absent the consent of congress recent developments providing congressional consent is the goal of numerous bills that have been introduced in congress hr 2491hr 518 in the 109th congress the most prominent of these bills was hr 2491 gillmor which was reported by the house energy and commerce committee on september 27 2005 and passed the house by voice vote september 6 2006 similar legislation hr 518 was introduced by representative dingell in the 110th congress was reported by the energy and commerce committee hrept 11081 march 29 2007 and passed the house by voice vote april 24 2007 as of january 2008 there has been action on the bill in the senate hr 518 would implement the bilateral uscanada waste trade agreement as amended in 1992 to deal with municipal solid waste shipments between the two countries it would require the epa administrator to perform the functions of the designated authority under the agreement and require him to implement and enforce the agreements notice and consent requirements in considering whether to consent to waste importation the epa administrator would be required in the words of the bill to give substantial weight to the views of the state or states into which the municipal solid waste is to be imported and consider the views of the local government with jurisdiction over the location where the waste is to be disposed the administrator would also be required to consider the impact of the importation on continued public support for and adherence to state and local recycling programs landfill capacity and air emissions and road deterioration from increased vehicular traffic and to consider the impact of the importation on homeland security public health and the environment the bill would also authorize states to restrict imports of foreign msw provided they do so prior to the bilateral agreements implementation under the latter provision states would have window of up to 24 months after the bills 12 fort gratiot sanitary landfill v michigan department of natural resources 504 us 353 1992 the restrictions at issue were at the county level but were authorized by the state crs5 enactment to impose restrictions of their choosing on the receipt of foreign msw and those regulations could remain in effect as long as the state desires michigan hb 5176 michigan has already enacted legislation that would go into effect if this provision of hr 518 were enacted on march 9 2006 the governor signed hb 5176 which prohibits the delivery and acceptance for disposal in michigan of msw generated outside of the united states once congress authorizes such prohibitions13 dhs appropriations bill in the 109th congress hr 5441 the department of homeland security dhs fy2007 appropriations bill as amended by the senate july 13 2006 also contained provisions that would have discouraged canadian waste imports an amendment submitted by senator stabenow for herself senator levin and senator baucus provided for inspections of international shipments of msw and required the secretary of homeland security to levy fee to cover the approximate cost of such inspections14 in floor statement senator stabenow explained the effect of the amendment as follows based on information provided by the inspector general of the department of homeland security we know that it will take four customs agents about 4 hours for each trash truck inspection based on personnel and administrative costs we estimate that the fee for each trash truck will be approximately 42015 separate amendment introduced by senator levin with the cosponsorship of senators stabenow and voinovich and also approved in the senate by unanimous consent would have required that the secretary of homeland security deny entry into the united states to trucks carrying msw unless he certifies to congress that the methodologies and technologies used by the bureau of customs and border protection to detect the presence of chemical nuclear biological and radiological weapons in municipal solid waste are as effective as those used to screen for such materials in other items of commerce entering the united states in commercial motor vehicles16 exchange of letters with ontario following passage of the stabenow and levin amendments on august 30 2006 the ontario ministry of the environment reached an agreement with the two senators under which ontario will eliminate shipments of municipally managed waste to michigan by the end of 2010 in return the senators agreed not to pursue 13 act 57 public acts of 2006 state of michigan 14 the amendment samdt 4657 was agreed to by unanimous consent july 13 2006 15 congressional record july 13 2006 p s7476 16 samdt 4617 for consideration see congressional record july 13 2006 pp s7470 7471 crs6 passage of the inspection fee and certification provisions in the homeland security appropriations bill or to pursue similar current or future measures17 the inspection fee and certification provisions were deleted in conference18 and the bill was signed by the president october 4 2006 on september 19 2006 torontos city council approved letter of intent to purchase landfill near london ontario where it is expected to ship its waste as it phases out shipments to michigan19 in fy2007 shipments of solid waste from ontario to michigan declined for the first time since fy199920 the steps taken by congress in beginning to move legislation as well as the separate legislation enacted by the state of michigan clearly played role in bringing about the exchange of letters with ontario but large issues remain remaining issues issues remaining to be addressed include some posed by the exchange of letters and others posed by hr 518 issues posed by the exchange of letters the agreement reached by the two michigan senators in their exchange of letters with ontarios minister of the environment would address portion of the waste shipped from ontario to michigan but it would not eliminate the majority of it the letters refer to municipally managed waste and specifically use 2005 baseline amount of 134 million tonnes21 of municipal waste shipped22 accompanying materials from the ministry of the environment however note that in 2005 4 million tonnes of waste were exported to the us with 90 of this waste being sent to michigan landfills23 thus ontarios commitment appears to cover only onethird of the waste shipped from the province to the united states or 37 of the waste it shipped to michigan the reason for excluding the majority of the waste is that it is not municipally managed it is waste collected by private haulers and shipped to michigan 17 letter of senators stabenow and levin to hon laurel c broten ontario minister of the environment august 30 2006 18 see hrept 109699 p 181 19 city of toronto toronto approves landfill purchase as part of solid

21 tonnes are metric tons which are equivalent to 11 short tons 22 letter of laurel c broten ontario minister of the environment to senators stabenow and levin august 30 2006 23 ontario ministry of the environment how ontario manages its waste the basic facts and figures fact sheet august 31 2006 crs7 landfills under private contracts these wastes are shipped to michigan either because it provides lower cost disposal options or because the landfills in michigan are controlled by the same company that collects the waste in canada the provincial government and the local governments within the province have authority to prevent these private waste shipments from leaving ontario thus the province has committed to eliminate what it can ie that portion of the waste that is municipally managed second the exchange of letters addresses the shipment of these wastes to michigan but not to other us states given the subsequent action by the toronto city council it would appear that when the waste is diverted from michigan it will be shipped to site in ontario but nothing in the letters would prevent the waste being shipped to other us landfills instead of those in michigan third the exchange of letters represents voluntary good faith commitments by the parties it is not treaty or an international agreement and does not provide the enforcement provisions or penalties that legislation might offer to summarize those who continue to be concerned about canadian waste shipments are likely to note that the exchange of letters does not address twothirds of the waste being shipped does not protect states other than michigan and contains enforcement provisions addressing these issues would require congressional action issues posed by hr 518 hr 518 by contrast would apply to private contracts would apply to all 50 states and would provide for enforcement the bill would clarify that actions taken under its authority shall not be considered to impose an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce and thus would be immune to challenge under the commerce clause of the constitution but the effect of the bill might still be uncertain in section 4011a3 it states nothing in this section affects replaces or amends prior law relating to the need for consistency with international trade obligations the bill thus appears to recognize that us trade agreements would have role to play in defining the scope of the states authority to act pursuant to the legislation it is not clear how these obligations and the bills grant of authority to the states to restrict waste imports would ultimately be reconciled opponents of the bill including the national solid wastes management association which represents the us waste management industry have already made clear their intention to challenge its provisions in court if it is enacted this issue would presumably be among the provisions litigated for other versions of this document see
