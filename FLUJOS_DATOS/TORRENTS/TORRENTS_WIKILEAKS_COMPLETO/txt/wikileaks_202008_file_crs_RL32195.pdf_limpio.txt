needy families tanf the community service block grant csbg and substance abuse prevention and treatment programs1 when congress did not enact legislation to appl the concepts behind charitable choice to more programs the administration issued an executive order directing wide range of social programs to follow the rubric of charitable choice2 despite the focus on charitable choice dur ing the bush administration perhaps the broadest example of charitable choi ce rules are those established by the 1996 welfare reform law pl 1041933 the provisions of the 1996 law are probably the most farranging set of rules so far set out and have been basic model for charitable choice provisions since enacte d proposed or established by regulation in general the laws major charitable choice provisi on bars government from discriminating against an organization applying to provi publicly funded services on the basis of its religious character so long as the program is implemented in manner consistent with the establishment clause of the first amendment to the us constitution moreover it stipulates the following rules with regard to faithbased organizations applying for or receiving public funds and applicants forrecipi ents of services religious organizations remain independent of government and retain control over the definiti on development practice and expression of their religious belief

since its inception charitable choice has been persistently controversial and president bushs faithbased initiative made that controversy highly visible much of the legal controversy has centered on the constitu tionality of the federal government directly subsidizing faithbased social services programs and on whether subsidized religious organizations ought to be able to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices this report provides analysis of num ber of factual civil rights and constitutional questions that have been raised regarding charitable choice in general the analysis is generally focused on thos provisions enacted as part of the 1996 welfare reform law more recent char itable choice regulations issued under the executive order discussed below may give rise to the same or similar concerns primarily this report focuses on the civil rights concerns that have arisen in the context of charitable choice and first amendment issues as well as recent legal developments related to ch aritable choice it will be updated as events warrant civil rights concerns several civil rights concerns have b een raised in the debates on charitable choice the primary one has been whether the religious exemption in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 which allows religious organizations to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices should apply to religious organizations that receive public funds under the rubric of charitable choice president bushs december 12 2002 executiv order eo 13279 raised related issue by exempting religious organizations that contract to provide goods and services to the federal government or that participate in federally financed construction contracts from the relig ious nondiscrimination in employment provisions of executive order 11246 there has also been some concern over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs3 4 42 usca 2000d et seq 5 20 usca 1681 et seq 6 29 usca

on whether charitable choice shoul d preempt state and local ci vil rights laws that go beyond federal nondiscr imination requirement s and bar employme nt discrimination on such bases as sexual orie ntation and marital status these issues arise in the context of complex panoply of ci vil rights mandates and exemptions that already exist the following subsections explicate charitable choice with respect to 1 existing mandates barring discrimination in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance 2 existing regulatory mandates barring discrimination in employment practices particularly title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and 3 the preempti on of state and local nondiscrimination laws that go beyond federal law fi nal subsection discusses the employment nondiscrimination requireme nts of executive order 11246 and the presidents exemption of religious organizations from the religious nondiscrimination requirement of that order nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs federal law imposes number of civil rights obligations on the provision of services in programs and activities that receive fe deral financial assistance title vi of the

blindness in admissions in education programs5 section 504 of the rehabilitation ac t of 1973 bars discrimination on the basis of handicap6 the age discrimination act of 1975 bars discrimination on the basis of age7 all of these prohibitions on discrimination apply generally and are triggered by the receipt of federal funds but most of them apply only to the delivery of services and not to the employment practices of the entities that receive federal funds the applicability of these statutes to federally financed programs and activities is not altered by charitable choice in contrast there is comparable federal statute that generally bars religious discrimination in fe derally funded programs and ac tivities individual programs sometimes contain such prohibition8 but there is general statutory prohibitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs4 9 see pl 106554 10 42 usca 12201 et seq 11 29 usca 621 et seq 12 42 usca 2000e et seq 13 20 usca 1681a3 14 42 usca 12113cnonetheless charitable choice has since its inception as part of the welfare reform measure in 1996 included provisions that bar religious organizations from discriminating against beneficiaries on religious gr ounds and that require government to make an alternate provider available to any beneficiary who objects to the religious character of given provider all of the existing charitable choice statutes with the exception of the community service block grants c sbg pl 105285 bar religious organization that receives assistance from di scriminating against beneficiaries on the basis of religion or religious belief three of the four statutes also bar such discrimination on the basis of refusal to actively participate in religious practice but one of the substance abus statutes does not include this latter prohibition9 nondiscrimination in employment federal statutes impose number of employment nondiscrimination requirements on public and private employers and generally these are not dependent on whet her or not the entity receives federal financial assistance ie they are regulatory requirements that apply regardless of whether an entity receives federal assistan ce with the exception of title ix none of the nondiscrimination statut described in the previous subsection applies to the employment practices of entities that receive federal funds unless primary objective of the federally f unded program is to provide employment but most public and private employers that employ more than specified number of employees are barred by the americans with disabilities act from discriminating in their employment practices on the basis of disability10 by the age discrimination in employment act on the basis of age11 and by title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 on the bases of race color na tional origin sex and religion12 number of these statutes contain special provisions with respect to the employment practices of religious institutions religious educational institutions are exempt from the sex nondiscrimination requireme nt of title ix for instance if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization13 the americans with disabilities act while barring religious organizations from discriminating on the basis of disability in employment specifically provides that they may still give preference in their employment practices on the basis of religion and ma require their employees to conform to their religious tenets14 most important title vii specifically exempts religious employers from its ban on religious discrimination in employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs5 15 42 usca 2000e1 title vii also cont ains two other exemptions now largely redundant allowing religious employer s to discriminate on religious gr ounds the first allows educational institutions that are religious ly controlled or that are directed toward the propagation of particular religion to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices the second allows all employers not just re ligious organizations to use religion sex or national origin as crite rion in their employment practices if religion sex or

most exte nsive debate in the discussion of charitable choice because all of the charitable choice stat utes and proposals so far have explicitly provided that the title vii exemption shall not be affected by the religious organizations provision of assistance under or receipt of funds from program described in title vii bars most public and privat employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating in their employment practices on the bases of race color national origin sex and religion this threshold requirement of 15 employees means that many churches synagogues and other congregational entities as well as small religious social services providers are not large enough to be covered by any of the nondiscrimination manda tes of title vii but section 702 of title vii specifically exempts those religious employ ers that are large enough to be covered from its prohibition on religious discrimination as follows this title shall not apply to religious corporation associati on educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation association educational in stitution or society of its activities15 thus religious organizations otherwise covered by title vii may use religion as criterion in their hiring firing promoti on and other employment practices and they may do so not only with respect to employees engaged in religious activities but also those engaged in purely secular activities this exemption has been unanimously upheld as constitutional by the supreme c ourt with respect to the nonprofit activities of religious organizations16 and has been applied to allo w wide variety of religious entities to discriminate on

possible misunderstanding all f our charitable choice statut have stated explicitly that the religious exemption in title vii is not lost simply because religious employer receives public funds that in turn has generated vigorous opposition from those who believe government shoul d not subsidize such discrimination religious organizations that meet th minimum size requirement of title vii ie the organization has 15 or more employees are not exempt from the other employment nondiscrimination requirements of title vii regarding race color national origin and x and charitable choice does not

degree with constitutionallybased employment discrimination exemption for religious organizations that has been labeled the ministerial exception this exception exem pts religious organizations from all statutory prohibitions on discrimination with respect to the employment of ministers and other ecclesiastical personnel the free exercise of religion clause of the first amendment it has been held bars the government from interfering in any way with the relationship between religious institution and its ministers the ministerial exception has been held to apply to the em ployment of ministers including youth ministers probationary ministers and ministers of music seminary faculty and hospital chaplains22 it has been held not to apply however with respect to the employment by religious organizations of persons who are not engaged in religious ministry or in the training of persons for such ministries such as the administrative and support staff in religious institutions23 because the ministerial exemption is constitutionally based it is not modified by charitable choice in any wayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs8 24 pl 106554which added charitable choice provisions to title v

eo 12086 43 fed reg 46501 oct 10 1978preemption of state and local civil rights laws another issue that has raised concerns is the preemptive effect of charitable choice on state and local civil rights laws that bar forms of discrimination that are not barred by federal law such as discrimination based on sexual orientation or marital status all of the charitable choice statutes that have been enacted to date provide that religious organization that is program participant shall retain its independence from federal state and local government including such orga nizations control over the definition development practice and expression of its religious beliefs similarly all of the charitable choice statutes to date have barred government from requiring that religious provider alter its form of inte rnal governance and as noted above have explicitly provided that religious orga nizations exemption under title vii shall not be affected by its pa rticipation in or receipt of funds from designated program but with the exception of provision added to the charitable choice statute concerning subs tance abuse programs24 little attention has been paid to whether these provisions might have pr eemptive effect on state and local civil rights laws under the supremacy clause of the constitution25 it seems clear that congress has the power to preempt state and local laws pursuant to charitable choice what has been the subject of debate has been the desirability of doing so in this case it might be noted however that executive order 13279 issued by president bush on december 12 2002 discussed infra directs federal departments and agencies to implement similar policy regarding the independence of religious entities from state and local laws in their social services programs

race color religion sex or national origin section 301 in turn requires that the same provisions be incl uded in all federally assisted construction contracts on december 12 2002 president bush issued executive order 1327928 that order inter alia amends eo 11246 with respect to the prohibition on religious discrimination as it applies to religious organizations the amendment adds the following language to eo 11246 section 202 of this order shall not apply to government contractor or subcontractor that is religious corpor ation association educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation association educational instituti on or society of its activities such contractors and subcontractors are not exempted or ex cused from complying with the other requirements contained in this order29 eo 13279 states that the amendment is t further the strong federal interest in ensuring that the cost and progress of federal procurement contracts are not adversely affected by an artificial re striction of the labor pool caused by an unwarranted exclusion of faithbased organizations from such contracts30 the amendment tracks wordforword the exemption afforded religious entities from the religious nondiscrimina tion requirement of title v ii of the civil rights act of 196431 thus like the title vii exempti on the exemption it affords covered religious entities is broad it applies to all of the activities of the organizations regardless of whether an employees functi ons are secular or religious but the amendment does not affect the obligation of covered religious entities to comply with the other requirements of the ex ecutive order regarding employment nondiscrimination on the bases of race color sex and national origin nor does it affect the obligation of covered nonreligious entities with respect to religious discrimination to the extent the amendm ent modifies part ii of eo 11246 it seems doubtful that it has substantial significance for religious organizations part ii in itself is not applicable to the federal grant and cooperative agreemen t programs subsidizing the provision of social services that have been the primary focus of debate about charitable choice and religious discriminati on by faithbased organizations part ii concerns federal procurement contracts ie contracts fo r the provision of goods and services directly to the federal govern ment such contracts can range from food services to office supplies to bombers and can obviously invol ve substantial sumshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs10 of money but it is not at all clear that religious organizati ons have historically played significant role in such federal procurement contracts however the amendment also appears to apply to part iii of eo 11246 ie to federally assisted construction contracts part iii defines construction contract to mean contract for the construc tion rehabilitation lteration conversion extension or repair of build ings highways or other impr ovements to real property and its coverage includes cons truction contracts that are incident to carrying out federal grant contract loan insurance or guarantee program thus part iii reaches beyond the federal pr ocurement contracts addresse d by part ii and applies to the construction aspects of fe deral grant programs such as for example those of the department of housing and urban devel opment because religious organizations have historically been extensively i nvolved in federally assisted housing and community development programs and b ecause other federally assisted social services programs in which faithbased organizations participate may incidentally involve constructi on or renovation activ ities the amendment to this part of eo 11246 likely has greater signifi cance for such organizations first amendment issues as noted above the charitable choice st atutes contain number of provisions that seem intended to ensure their constitutionality all of these measures require that they be implemented consistent with the establishment clause of the united states constitution all require that pub lic funds that are di sbursed directly to religious organizations not be used for pur poses of religious worship instruction or proselytization all have provisions to protect those who r eceive services from religious organizations from religious disc rimination all requi re equal treatment but not preferential treatment for religious organizations seeking to participate in government social services programs on the other hand all of the statutes also allow religious organizations that receive public funds to discriminate on re ligious grounds with respect to their employees to display religious symbols on the premises where services are provided and to practice and express their religious beliefs independent of any government restrictions none of th em moreover require the pub licly funded program to be separately incorporated fro m its sponsoring religious or ganization in addition the measures allow religious organizations that receive public funds indirectly ie by means of vouchers to engage in religious worship instruction and proselytization in the funded program and to impose relig ious requirements on beneficiaries after they are once admitted to program finally all of the charitable choice initiatives seem premised on the assumption that charitable choice may in some manner allow religious organizations to employ their faiths in carrying out the publicly funded programs regardless of whether they are directly or indirectly funded as consequence questions have been raised about whet her charitable choice on its face or in its implementation is consistent with the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment one asp ect of this issue concerns whether it is constitutional for public funds to go to or ganizations that discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices mo re generally the question is whether it is constitutional for public funds to go to

religious organizations by means of grants or cooperative agreem ents in the specified programs and at least in the case of temporary assistance for needy families tanf public aid that is given indirectly in the form of vouchers that can be redeemed with religious as well as nonre ligious organizations the constitutional strictures that apply to these two forms of aid differ and as consequence the form in which the public aid is provided to re ligious organizations under charitable choice has implications for the constitutionality of the aid these questions are further complicated by the fact that the supreme courts interpretation of the establishment clause has been shifting prior to its recent decisions the courts construction of the tablishment clause made it difficult if not impossible for religious organizations that are deemed pervasively sectarian to receive aid directly from the government even for avowedly secular purposes and have required that programs receiving di rect public aid be essentially secular in nature but the courts recent decisions in agostini v felton32 and mitchell v helms33 have relaxed the strictures on direct aid and eliminated the pervasively sectarian barrier although the court still requires that direct aid to religious institutions not be used for religious i ndoctrination with respect to indirect assistance the courts past jurisprudence has been less restrictive and its recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris34 appears to legitimate an even broader array of voucher programs the following subsections detail the constitutional frameworks that appear to govern direct and indirect aid nd apply them to charitable choice direct aid in general terms the establis hment clause has been construed by the supreme court to absolutely prohib it governmentfinanced or government sponsored indoctrination into the belie fs of particular religious faith35 government inculcation of religious be liefs the court has stated has the impermissible effect of advancing religion36 to guard against that effect public assistance which flows directly to religious institutions in the form of grants or cooperative

primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion finally the statute must not foster an ex cessive entanglement with religion39 the secular purpose prong has rarely posed serious obstacle to the constitutionality of direct aid program but the courts or iginal formulations of the primary effect and entanglement tests ofte n proved fatal to programs providing direct aid to pervasively religious institutions the court construed the primary effect test to mean that direct public aid must be limited to secular use thus direct aid program could founder on this aspect of the lemon test in either of two ways it could be held unconstitutional if the aid was not limited to secular use either by its nature or by statutory or regulatory constraint40 it could also be held unconstitutional if it flowed to institutions that the court deemed to be pervasively sectarian ie entities whose religious and secular functions were so inextricably intertwined that their secular functions could not be isolat ed for purposes of public aid41 moreover even if an aid program was limited to secular use it often foundered on the excessive entanglement prong of the lemon test particularly in the context of direct aid to pervasively sectarian or ganizations the court held that government had to closely monitor the use religious organizations made of the aid provided in order to be sure that the limitation to secular use was observed but the very act of monitoring the court sometimes said excessively intruded the government into the affairs of the religious institution and for that reason the aid program was unconstitutional42 thus under this application of the lemon test religious organizations were not automatically disqualified from participat ing in public programs providing direct assistance but in order to meet the secu lar use requirement such organizations had either to divest themselves of their religious character and to become predominantly secular in nature or at the least to be able to separate their secular functions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs13 43 the court did not lay down hard and fast definition of what makes an organization pervasively sectarian but it looked at such f actors as the proximity of the organization in question to sponsoring church the presence of religious symbols and paintings on the premises formal church or denominational control over the organization whether religious criterion is applied in the hiring of em ployees or in the selection of trustees or in the case of school to the admission of student s statements in the organizations charter or other publications that its purpose is the propagation and promotion of religious faith whether the organization engages in religious services or other religious activities its devotion in the case of schools to academic freedom etc see eg bradfield v roberts 175 us 291 1899 lemon v kurtzman supra tilton v richardson 403

has also made clear that it is not enough to show that the recipient of grant is aff iliated with religious institution or that it is religiously inspired bowen v kendrick supra at 621 indeed none of these factors by itself has been held sufficient to make an institution pervasively sectarian and therefore ineligible for direct aid such finding has always rested on combination of factors for

government to provide direct funding to their secular functions this former interpretation of the establishment clause also generally meant that it was constitutionally impermissible for religious organizations that are pervasively sectarian to participate in dir ect public aid programs43 as practical matter these interpretations of the establishment clause had their most severe effects on progra ms providing direct aid to sectarian elementary and secondary schools because the court pres umed that such schools are pervasively sectarian the court presumed to the contrary with respect to sectarian colleges hospitals and other social welfare organi zations although it held open the possibility that some of these agencies might be pervasively sectarian44 in its most recent decisions however the court has reformulated the lemon test and abandoned the presumption that some religious institutions such as sectarian elementary and secondary schools are so pervasively sectarian that they are constitutionally ineligible to participate in direct public aid programs the court still requires that direct public aid serve secu lar purpose not have primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religi on and not lead to excessive entanglement but the primary effect test now means that the aid itself must be secular in nature must be distributed on religiously neutral basis and must not be used for purposes of religious indoctrination moreover the court s now made the excessive entanglement test one aspect of the primary effect inqui ry and it longer assumes that such

establishment clause decision and held it to be constitutional for public school teachers to provide remedial and enrichment services on the premises of private sectarian schools to children attending t hose schools who were eligible for such services under title i of the elemen tary and secondary education act46 the earlier decision of aguilar v felton supra had found the delivery of such services on the premises of sectarian elemen tary and secondary schools to be excessively entangling because the pervasively sectarian nature of the institutions required government to engage in very intrusive monitoring to be sure that the title i employees did not inculcate religion but in agostini the court stated that subsequent decisions had abandoned the presumption that public employees will inculcate religion simply because they happen to be in sectarian environment47 as consequence it said it had also to discard the assumption that pervasive monitoring of title i teachers is required48 the court also stated that the factors we use to assess whether an entanglement is excessive are similar to the factors we use to examine effect thus it is simplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and treat it as an aspect of the inquiry into statutes effect49 most recently the court in mitchell v helms50 upheld as c onstitutional an esea program which subsidizes the acquis ition and use of educa tional materials and equipment by public and priv ate schools more particularly the court found the provision of such items as computer rdware and software library books movie projectors television sets tape recorders vcrs labor atory equipment maps and cassette recordings to private sectaria n elementary and secondary schools not to violate the establishment clause in the process the court overt urned parts of two prior decisions which had held similar aid programs to be unconstitutional and which had been premised on the view that direct aid to pervasively sectarian institutions is constitutionally suspect51 although the justices could not agree on majority opinion the plurality opinion by justice thomas and the concurring opinion by justice oconnor joined by justice breyer both appear to have eliminated pervasive sectarianism as constitutionally preclusive characteristic regarding direct aid and modified the primary effect test accordingly agostini had hinted at this result but mitchell confirmed it as summarized by ju stice oconnor the primary effect test now has three essential elementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs15 52 mitchell v helms supra

aid including the courts decision in zelman v simmonsharris supra and for summaries of recent state and lower federal cour t decisions see crs report rl30165 education vouchers constitutional issues and cases by angie welborn1 whether the aid results in governme ntal indoctrination 2 whether the aid program defines its recipients by refere nce to religion and 3 whether the aid creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion52 thus the court now appears to construe the establishment clause to allow some forms of direct aid to religious entities that formerly were deemed constitutionally excluded because of their pervasively religious character under the reformulated lemon test direct public aid must still serve secular purpose and not create an excessive entanglement but the most critical elements appear to be that the aid is distributed in religiously neutral manner ie that it does not define its recipients on the basis of religion and provide an incentive for beneficiaries to undertake religious indoctrination and that it does not result in re ligious indoctrination which is attributable to the government indirect aid indirect aid in the form of ta x benefits or vouc hers however was less constrained prior to the courts recent revisions of its establishment clause jurisprudence and the courts most recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris53 appears to loosen the constitutional bounds ev more like its standards for direct aid the court requires that indirect ai d programs serve secular purpose and be distributed to their initial beneficiaries on religiously neutral basis ie that the beneficiaries not be chosen or given preference on the ba sis of religious criterion but the critical element seems to be whether the initial beneficiaries have true private choice in deciding whether to obtain subsidized services from secular or religious providers in its earlier decisions the court held indirect aid programs unconstitutional if they had been designed in such manner that the universe of choice available to the beneficiaries was almost entirely religious54 but if the initial beneficiaries had genuinely independent choice among secula r and religious providers the court held the programs constitutional and ruled that even pervasively sectarian entities were not precluded from participating55 indeed the court made clear that indirect aid which ultimately is channeled to religious institutions does not have to be restricted to secular use but can be used for all of the institutions functions including their religious ones56 the courts recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris supra further loosened the constitutional constraints on indi rect aid that cas involved

programsof educational vouchers that lowincome parents could us at private schools in the city of cleveland most of those schools we re religious in nature but the court held that in evaluating whether the parents d true private choice in using the aid all of the educational options open to the pare nts needed to be considered and not just the private school options thus enrollment in public schools magnet schools and community schools as well as the possibility of receiving special tutoring assistance all needed to be considered as options ong with the private religious and secular school possibilities in other words the court held that the universe of choice available to the voucher recipients was not defined solely by the private providers where the vouchers could be used but included number of public school and non voucher educational options as well constitutionality of charitable choice some aspects of the charitable choice proposals that have b een enacted likely satisfy the foregoing requirements that seems particularly to be the case with respect to social services aid that is provided in the form of vouchers the cour ts interpretations of the establishment clause make clear that such aid can ultimately flow even to pervasively sectarian institutions so long as the initial recipients have true private choice among service providers that means both that such aid can go to religious entities that discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices57 and that such entities need not be barred from engaging in religious worship instruction and proselytizing in programs receiving such support thus there does not appear to be constitutional problem in the provisions of the charitable choice statutes that allow such employment discrimination and that permit religious institutions receiving social services aid indirectly to enga ge in religious worship instruction or proselytizing in the subsidized program nonetheless there may s till be constitutional questi on raised about charitable choice with respect to indirect aid the critical issue for indirect aid continues to be whether there is genuinely independent decisionmaker between the government and the entity that ultimately receives the assistance or whether the government has dictated that the aid ultimately goes to religious entity all of the charitable choice measures with the exception of csbg requi re that those who object to particular religious provider be given an alternative that is either secular or not religiously objectionable

in part in uphol ding direct public grants to colleges 59 indeed in some decisions the court has given that factor weight at all see eg bradfield v roberts 175 us 291 1899 upholding constructi on of wing at hospital run by an order of catholic nuns on the condition th wing be used for the medical care of the poor and tilton v richardson 403 us 672 681 1971 in finding several religiously affiliated colleges not to be so permeated by religion as to be ineligible for federal construction grants for academic buildings the court placed primary emphasis on the fact that the schools were characterized by an atmosphere of academic freedom rather than religious indoctrinationsecular and religious providers initially whether this is sufficient to meet the courts standards doe s not seem certain whether direct aid to religious entities that discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices as allowed by all of the charitable choice statutes can pass constitutional muster seems more complex but still likely prior to mitchell the courts decisions had often used such employment discrimination as an indicator that an entity was pervasively sectarian and he nce ineligible for direct assistance58 but it had never relied on that f actor alone other factors always entered into the constitutional equation59 those rulings consequently seem to suggest that religious discrimination in employment by itself might not have been enough to render direct aid program unconstitutional mitchell seems to strengthen that possibility at least for certain kinds of di rect aid in that case as noted the court upheld as constitutional direct aid program providi ng educational supp lies and equipment to entities that the court had previously f ound to be pervasively sectarian and had previously held to be constitutionally ba rred from receiving such aid sectarian elementary and secondary schools in so doing the court shifted the constitutional focus from the nature of the organization receiving the aid to whether the aid is distributed in religiously neutral ma nner and whether it is used for religious indoctrination as consequence whet her the entity receiving the assistance discriminates on religious gr ounds in its employment practices seems to have become of little or concern at least for inkind direct assistance the more critical question concerns the role of faith in carrying out social services programs that are directly subsidized the courts decisions make clear that direct public aid cannot be used fo r religious indoctrination and all of the charitable choice measures seem to meet this requirement by explicitly prohibiting direct aid from being used for religious wo rship instruction or proselytizing but the underlying assumption of charitable choi ce has been that religious organizations ought to be able to retain their religious character and employ their religious faithshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs18 60 mitchell v helms

how particular subsidized programs might be implemented it seems likely that constitutional questions will inevitably arise in the implementation of direct aid programs under ch aritable choice notwithstanding its prohibitions on the use of direct aid for religious wors hip instruction and proselytization in addition it should be noted that mitchell involved an inkind aid program educational supplies nd equipment all of the justices in mitchell expressed doubt that direct grants of money to religious entities could pass constitutional muster even under the courts loosened standards for di rect aid programs and direct grants of money are what seem contemplated in the programs to which charitable choice now applies justice oconnor joined by justice breyer stated in mitchell both that this court has recognized special establishment clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions and that direct subsidy would be impermissible under the establishment clause60 justice souter joined by justices stevens and ginsburg stated we have long held government aid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious education the risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in the form of government funds makes its way into the coffers of religious organizations and so from the start we have understood the constitution to bar outright money grants of aid to religion61 justice thomas joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia and kennedy asserted that neutrality is the essential constitutional criterion governing public aid programs that benefit religi ous entities but he nonethel ess observed that we have seen special establishment clause dangers when money is given to religious schools or entities directly rather than as in witters and mueller indirectly62 these statements are all dicta and do not indicate with any certainty how the court might rule on case involving particular gran t or cooperative agreement but they do indicate constitutional doubt bout direct money grants in addition it deserves notice that one fede ral district court in decision handed down some years prior to mitchell held religious discrimination in employment by religious organization in position specifically funded by government grant to be unconstitutional63 neither agostini nor mitchell addressed the constitutionalityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32195crs19 63 continued that public funding of such di scrimination would have primary effect of advancing religion and would entangle the government in th

should also be noted that although not in direct conflict federal appellate court recently upheld state program providing general aid to colleges including religiously affiliated ones as applied to seventh day dventist college notwithstanding that the college gave an express preference in hiring to members of the church64 another recent case that was thought to raise the question of the constitutionality of public funding of an agency that discriminated on religious grounds in its employment practices turned out not to do so in pedreira v kentucky baptist homes for children inc65 the federal district court held that the firing of an employee because of her lesbian lifestyle by an organization whose christian values abhorred homosexuality did not involve religious discrimination because the orga nizations policy did not require employees to accept or practice its religious beliefs but only to conform to behavioral requirement as final observation it also deserves notice that formal neutrality as the controlling constitutional principle did gain the adherence of four justices in mitchell v helms supra chief justice rehnquist and jus tices scalia kennedy and thomas this perspective contends that the critical constitutional elements governing direct public aid to religious entities are whether the aid itself is secular and whether it has been distributed in religiously neutral fashion ie without preference for religious entities from this perspective it makes difference whether the institutional entity eventually uses the aid for religious purposes or not slight shift in the membership of the court thus could foreshadow furt her changes in the courts jurisprudence in this area recent legal developments in 2004 several decisions addressing some aspects of charitable choice generally were handed down by the united states supreme court and other lower federal courts while none of these cases specifica lly addressed th constitutionality of any
