after deduction of beneficiary premiums are estimated at 2086 billion medicare consists of two parts the part program covers hospital services skilled nursing facility snf services and home health care part b covers physicians services laboratory tests durable medical equipment outpatient hospital services and other medical services the ability of medicares current financing structure to adequa tely fund program growth has been of concern for many years the part trust fund had been projected to become insolvent in 2001 in that year revenues coming into the trust fun d primar ily payroll taxes together with any balance carried over from prior years would have been insufficient to cover the payment for part benefits in that year unlike part because of the way it is financed medicare part b has not face d insolvency however policymake rs have also been concerned with the rapid growth in part b payments and the impact of this growth on general r evenue spending and the federal budget deficit further compound ing the funding problems is the fact that the large babyboom population will start to become eligible for medicare in 2011 on may 15 1997 the president and

enters hospital and ends when he or she has not been in hospital or snf for 60 days medicare pays the remaining costs for the first 60 days of hospital care the limited number f beneficiaries requiring care beyond 60 days are subjec t to additional charges patients requiring snf care are subject to daily coinsurance charge for the 21st through the 100th day 95 in 1997 there are costshar

system under feeforservice beneficiaries obtain cov ered services through providers of their choice and medicare makes payments for each service rendered the amount of payment per service is generally subject to certain limits taken together spending for inpatient hospita l and physicians services account for close to 70 of medicare benefit payments medicare makes payments fo r inpatient hospital services under prospective payment system pps predetermined rate is paid for each inpatient stay based on the patients admittin g diagnosis payments for physicia ns services are made on the basis of fee schedule specific payment rules are also used for other services 1 medicare and managed care managed care encompasses wide variety of arrangements including healt h maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos typically managed care plans control costs by restricting an enrollees choice f provider or by giving enrollees strong financial incentives to choose particula r providers they also reduce costs by managing enrollees use of services they may reduce unnecess ary hospitalizations diagnostic tests or specialty referrals either by giving part icipating physicians financial stake in the cost of the services they order or through programs that review the use of services managed care plans may also select lowcost providers of services or negotiate discounted rates from providers hmos are the oldest type of managed care organization like traditiona l insurers an hmo accepts financial responsibility for defined set of health car benefits in return for fixed monthly per capita premium paid by or on behalf of each enrolled member unlike other insurers an hmo directly provides or arranges for services through affiliated physic ians hospitals and other network providers instead of simply paying bills generally an hmo controls access to covered benefit s through primary care gatekeeper medicare has been authorized to contr act with hmos since 1972 but the major managed care program the medicare risk contract program dates to 1982 with the passage f the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra this is why risk contracts are also known as tefra risk contracts the intent of tefra was t enable beneficiaries to enroll in managed care organizations as an alternative t traditional feeforservice medicare and also to capture efficiencies of hmos an d thus save medicare money enrollment of beneficiaries in medicare managed care has grown significantly from about 4 in 1985 to over 13 of medicare beneficiaries by the end of 1996 most medicare managed care enrollme nt is in risk contract plans the remainder arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97802crs3 enrolled in h mos that are paid on the basis of actual costs or are

entitlemen t program that pays for as many medical services as the eligible population needs between 1980 and 1996 spending increased at an average annual rate of 112 and its share of the federal b

cbo estimated using its january 1997 baseline that under the law in effect prior to the enactment of bba net medicare outlays would increase at an average rate of 86 over th fy1997fy2007 period the ability of medicares current financing mechanisms to adequately fun d program growth has been of concern for many years since 1970 the medicar trustees have been predicting the impending insolvency of the part trust fund however 1995 was the first year that the insolvency of the trust fund became major part of the budget debate the trust fund was projected to become insolvent in 2001 in that year revenues coming into the trust fund primarily payroll taxes togethe r with any balance carried over from prior years would have been insufficient to cover the payment for part benefits in that year unlike part medicare part b has not2 faced insolvency because of the way it is financed however policymakers have also been concerned with the rapid growth in part b payments and the impact of thi s growth on general revenue spending and the federal budget deficit addressing the part insolvency issue has been only one of the concerns facing medicare beginning in 2011 medica re will begin to experience the impact of major demographic changes first babyboomers persons born between 1946 and 1964 begin turning age 65 second there is shift in the number of workers supportin g persons receiving benefits under part in 1996 there were 39 workers pe r beneficiary the ratio is expected to decline to 23 by 2030 because of its rapid growth both in t erms of aggregate dollars and as share of the federal budget the medicare program has been major focus of deficit reduction legislation passe d by the congress since 1980 with few exceptions reductions in program spending have been achieved largely through reductions in payments t providers primarily hospitals and ph ysicians these reductions stemmed but did not eliminate the yeartoyear increases in medicare outlays the 104

slowing the rate of growth i n payments to hospitals physicians and other providers and by establishing ne w payment methodologies for skilled nursing fa cilities home health agencies and other service categories it further extends the solvency of the part trust fund through 2006 bba 97 also includes provisions to increase the private plan options available to beneficiaries while these new options will include feeforservice arrangements they will also include managed care plans such as preferred prov ider organizations and provider sponsored organizations the agreement also changes the methodolog used to pay such plans the government will continue to set rates for plans suc h rates howev er should better reflect the actual cost of delivering health care in local areas than is the case today the conference agreement largely reflects perspective that increased managed care enrollment for medicare will help slo w the rate of growth in medicare expenditures this perspective is in part encouraged by the experiences of the private sector where the rapid moveme nt of large group health plans from fee forservice into managed care has helped to slow the rate of medical care inflation in 1987 only 27 of participants in employer plans were enrolled in managed care plans by 1996 74 of participants in such plans were enrolled in managed car plans while this change is not regarded by everyo ne as positive concerns exist for5 example that the growth of managed care has reduced access to services for lower income populations the bba 1997 shows that substantial support exists for trying to restructure medicare to make it work more like the large group private insurance market while the bba 97 achieves significant savings it does not address the longer term funding problems that will be exacerbated when the baby boom generatio n begins to receive program benefits the question of how to address these issues including the possibility of significant structural reforms will be considered by new national commission bipartisan commission on the future of medicare thi s commission authorized under bba 97 is required to report its recommendations by march 1

in home healt h spending since 1989 spending has increased from 25 billion in 1989 to 18 1 billion in 1996 for an average annual rate of growth of 33 most of the growth in spending has been the result

agencie s are paid for every medically necessary visit they provide up to thei r aggregate cost limit as noted above most of the growth in home health spending has been the result of an in creasing

agencies in each region with low historical costs and by slightly decreasing the cap for agencies in each region with high historical costs note that this per beneficiary limit eg 5000 is not applied to each individual beneficiary served by the home health agency but rather to its unduplicated count of medicare patients this means that the act ual limit faced by the agency is determined by multiplying an agencys per beneficiary limit by the number of people served b that agency as result agencies c an serve beneficiaries who cost more than the per beneficiar cap so long as they also serve persons who cost less to continue th example of an agency with per beneficiary cap of 5000 if this agency served 3 medicare beneficiaries in year and two beneficiaries cost 6000 each and the third 3000 the agency would not exceed its limit since the sum of its cost for these three patients 15000 is the same as its limit 3 x 5000 the secretar will be required to establish the per visit
