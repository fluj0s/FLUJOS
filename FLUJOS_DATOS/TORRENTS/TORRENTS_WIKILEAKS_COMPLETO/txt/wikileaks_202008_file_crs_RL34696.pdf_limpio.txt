the 2008 farm bill faced potentially significant budgetary and spending constraints while the 2002 farm bill was crafted during period of budget surplus second the 2008 farm bill debate was set against backdrop of an ongoing multilateral negotiation which targeted farm subsidie s and challenged us support and legal programs under existing trade ru third the bush administration submitted its

interests also submitted specific recommendations that ra nged from maintaining the status quo to making dramatic policy changes budgetary considerations as with all federal programs the farm bill debate was influenced by budgetary constrai nts imposed by congress recent federal deficits raised concerns with respect to reauthorization or expansion of current farm programs prior to congressi onal consideration of new farm bill budget projections showed lower baseline budget for agri culture programs mainly because high commodity prices had caused projections of future farm program spending to fall sharply below previous projections th congressional budget offices cbos march 2007 baseline budget served as the official benchmark for the fy2008 budget resolution and for scoring the budgetary imp acts of the new farm bill the cbo baseline assumed tinuation of current farm bill policies under expected economic conditions the budget resolution set th actual spending constraints for the agriculture committees as they drafted new farm bill in may 2007 congress approved the fy 2008 budget resolution which adopted the baseline budget as the fis cal parameter for the next fa rm bill it also included 20 billion reserve fund above ba seline for new farm bill spending over five years1 however any new spending wa s required to be ficitneutral meaning that it would have to be offset with quivalent reductions in other federal spending for existing mandatory programs or by ra ising revenues large increases in the market prices of corn and other commodities since the summe r of 2006 contributed to lower march 2007 baseline for farm program spending for example the march 2007 baseline projected spending for commodity suppor t payments under current law to be 424 billion for the fy2008fy2013 period about 30 billion lower than actual spending in the previous six years table 1 baseline estimates for mandatory conservation and nutrition programs for the next six year s

commitments the farm bill debate was also influenced by obligations concerning the sign and size of farm subsidies under the world trade organization wto agreement on agriculture as well as by the us position in the doha round of multilateral ne gotiations agreement in the doha round was expected to converge in 2007 with the expiration of the 2002 farm bill and to occur well before the june 30 2007 expiration of trade promotion authority tpa which provides for expedited congressional consideration of trade agreements some policymakers wanted doha round agreement so that the next farm bill could be made consis tent with new farm trade rules others argued that the unite d states should not unilaterally change its own subsidy programs ahead of any multilateral trade agreement progress on the doha round stalled in 2006 and again in 2008 and criticisms nd legal challenges by some wto member countries of current us farm progra ms have continued2 the administrations policy recommendations in january 2007 the bush administration released its own detailed recommendations for the farm bill that aimed to substantially alter many aspects of the current commodity support system and other existing farm bill programs3 the administrations stated approach for designing its 2007 farm bill recommendati ons was to take reformminded and fiscally responsible approach to making fa rm policy more equita ble predictable and protected from challenge4 in part this referred to the perceived need to more evenly distribute federal program spending and benefits across larger share of the us farm community as well as the percei ved need to modify current farm programs to better comply with wto obligations and limit future legal challenges from other countries some of these same concer ns were voiced in recommendations and proposals by other organizati ons and interest groups the administrations proposed changes would have also f aced potential funding obstacles given budget constraints for the 2008 farm bill nevertheless president bush repeatedly threatened to veto any legislation that included certain revenue and taxrelated provisions being c onsidered by congress as well as legislation that failed to implement certain policy changes including cuts in farm income subsidies among other policy issues and concerns5 also during the debate the

conference agreement on hr 2419 second bill containing all 15 original farm bill titles hr 6124 was again vetoed on june 18 among the reasons cited by the administration for the veto were congress inclusion of certain revenue and taxrelated provisions in both bills the administration was also concerned that the legislation did not include certain policy reforms in farm income subsidies and was concerned about possible incompatibility with us obligations under the wto among other policy issues doha round negotiations are continuing however if agreement is reached then implementing legislation could require changes in some farm bill programs and limit spending on farm support other recommendationsproposals the 20072008 farm bill debate differed from the 2002 debate in the number and scope of proposals seeking range of changes to existing programs as well as the addition of new ones many of these recommendations gained support within and outside congress in addition to the administration proposal several organizations and interest groups released their own farm bill recommendations these included state organizations national farm groups commodity associations conservati on and rural development organizations nutrition program advocates and several nontr aditional interest groups these policy recommendations repres ented diverse interests seeking objectives ranging from maintaining current programs to substantially altering or eliminating them some recommendations were in corporated into bills introduced by some members of congress during the debate who sought to directly challenge the existing farm legislation and programs through co mprehensive and broadbased proposed legislative changes others in congress were reluctant to change current programs because they are strongly supported by the longtime beneficiaries legislative development in anticipation of the 2007 farm bill both the house and senate agriculture committees conducted hearings in washin gton dc and across the country during 2006 and continued to hold hearings early in 20077 early in 2007 the chairmen of both the house and senate agriculture committees indicated their intention to

provisions in the house and senatepassed bills usdas economic research service ers also s published sidebyside comparison of the 2008 and the 2002 farm bills as enacted15 title i commodity programs grains oilseeds and cotton support the enacted 2008 farm bill generally continues the farm commodity pr ice and income support framework of the 2002 farm bill it revises payment limitations by tightening some limits and relaxing others and adjusts target prices and loan rates for some commodities it continues the direct payment countercyclical payment and marketing loan programs for the 2008 through 2012 crop years the enacted b ill also creates pilot revenuebased countercyclical program beginning with the 2009 crop year it also has pilot program for planting flexibility restrictions on base acres developed for residential use and new provision that eliminates benefits to farms with fewer than 10 acres for direct payments the payment rates per commodity remain the same as under the 2002 farm bill but the overall formul contains 2 reduction in direct payments for crop years 20092011 this is accomplished by changing the ratio of base acres on which direct payments are made from 85 to 833 of base acres the 85 ratio is restored for the 2012 crop year to maintain baseline for the next farm bill at higher level the reduction to 833 does not affect the countercyclical payment formula the final bill also adopts house and senate provisions that eliminate making advance direct payments in the 2012 crop year and thereafter this provision delays payment of 22 of the direct payment amount from december to the following october thus into new fiscal year and allowing the farm bill to score budget savings of about 11 billion in fy 2012 farmers will have to wait longer but will receive their full payment support levels for counterc yclical payments and marketing loans are adjusted with many crops receiving notable incr eases and support for cotton being reduced slightly several commodity groups felt th at their support levels were not high enough relative to other commodities in the 2002 farm bill and did not receive counter cyclical support ever or as often eg wheat soybeans for countercyclical payments six out of 10 commodities have an increase in their target price wheat sorghum barley oats soybeans and nor oilseeds one has small decrease cotton and four are new in 2009 dry peas lentils small chickpeas large chickpeas for marketing loans eight out of 20 commodities have an increase in their loan rate wheat barley oats minor oilseeds graded wool honey cane sugar beet sugar two have decrease dry p eas lentils and one is new in 2009 large chickpeas the 2008 farm bill does not change the b eneficial interest rules and thus continues to allow farmers to lock in their loan deficiency payments ldp when market prices are low continue to own the commodity and sell it at future and possibly higher market price policy makers want farmers to c ontinue to have thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs12 flexibility to market their commodities in re sponse to market signals and benefit from the program but advocates for change point out that if farmers can sell their crop for more than the support price then gove rnment support should be unnecessary the bush administration had identified this as one of its priorities for commodity title reform for the new revenue countercyclical option the average crop revenue election acre program the final bill adopted the senate approach but with significant modifications compared to the senatepassed bill the acre program starts year earlier in 2009 with less change to its interaction with direct payments and marketing loans the housepassed farm bill offered pilot revenue countercyclical program base d on nationallevel revenues while th senatepassed bill offered statelevel re venue countercyclical pilo t program beginning in 2010 that replaced direct payments with fixed payment and offered only recourse loans farmers will choose either the traditi onal pricetriggered countercyclical program or the new revenuebased acre op tion participants in the acre program will continue to receive direct payments but at 20 reduced rate participants will also continue to be eligib for nonrecourse marketing ans but with 30 lower loan rate to receive an acre payment tw triggers need to be met first the actual state revenue for supported crop durin g the crop year must be less than the statelevel revenue guarantee amount s econd an individual farms actual revenue for supported crop during the crop year mu st be less than the farms benchmark revenue benchmark yields at the state and farm levels are olympic averages dropping the highest and lowest price of the most recent five years price guarantees are averages of the marketin g year price or the marketing loan rate reduced by 30 if greater for the most recent two years if both triggers are met an individual farm will receive an acre payment that is based on the statelevel difference between actual revenue and the acre guarantee per acre multiplied by percentage 833 or 85 depending on the crop year of the farms planted acreage but prorated based on the individua l farms yield history compared to the states yield history the white house has criticized the acre program because its twoyear price guarantee feature will incorpor ate the historically high r ecent market prices into the guarantee and consequently possibly requi re large payments to farmers if market prices decline from their currently reco rd high levels in 2007 and 2008 the white house has argued that the cbo score does not reflect the magnitude of this possibility because market prices in th baseline are assumed to remain high the 2008 farm bill also includes pilot planting flexibility program for fruits and vegetables for processi ng while continuing the ove rall restriction on planting fruits and vegetables on base acreage th pilot program begins in 2009 and allows farmers in seven midwestern states to plant base acres to cucumbers green peas lima beans pumpkins snap beans sweet corn and tomatoes grown for processing their base acres are temporarily reduced for the year resulting in lower direct and countercyclical payments but restored for the next crop year the states include minnesota 34000 acres wisconsin 9000 acr michigan 9000 acres illinois 9000 acres indiana 9000 acres ohio 4000 acres and iowa 1000 acreshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs13 16 calculated as follows 40000 65000 75000 180000 doubled to 360000 17 calculated as follows 40000 65000 105000 doubled to 210000the farm bill includes senate provision that eliminates base acres on land that had been subdivided into multiple residen tial units or other nonfarming uses prior rules have eliminated base only for land developed fo r nonagricultural commercial or industrial use the farm bill also eliminates payments to farms with fewer than 10 base acres of all crops except for farms owned by socially disadvantaged or limitedresource farmers and ranchers the acreage approach is different than house provision which set minimum threshold of 25 per type of payment the senate had similar provision the bill requires usda to reconcile social security numbers of program recipients with social security database twice year to assure program beneficiaries are alive and to issue regulations describing how long deceased persons estate may continue to qualify for program benefits this is less specific than the senate provision which specified twoyear period this provision is in response to 2007 gao report showing that farm commodity payments continue to be paid to deceased farmers or their estates beyond the twoyear regulation payment limits two types of payment limits exist one sets the maximum amount of farm program payments that pe rson can receive per year the other sets the maximum amount of income that an i ndividual can earn and still remain eligible for program benefits means test regarding the limit on the amount of payments the enacted 2008 farm bill continues the 40000 limit on direct paym ents and 65000 limit on countercyclical payments the countercyclical limit will apply to both tr aditional and revenue countercyclical payments the final bill does not place any limit on marketing loan benefits and thus they are now unlimited in the 2002 farm bill marketing loan benefits were limited to 75000 per farm per year but use of commodity certificates and forfeiture were unlimited thus creating equity issues the 2008 farm bill still allows doubling of those limits by having spouse but eliminates the threeentity rule that formerly allowed an alternative means of doubling by having multiple farms with di fferent ownership arrangements along with elimination of the threeentity rule the conference agreement requires direct attribution of prog ram benefits to living person if program payment cannot be traced to living person within four levels of ownership the payment to the original entity owning the farm is reduced proportionately under the 2002 farm bill the limit on payments was commonly regarded as 360000 per farm per year16 given the elimination of limits on the marketing loan program an equivalent comparison to the 2008 farm bill is difficult the limit on direct and countercyclical payments c ontinues to be 210000 per farmer couple per year17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs14 regarding the adjusted gross income agi limit the 2008 farm bill adopts slightly different approach than the 2002 farm bill or the house or senate bills formerly the agi limit had an exception if certain proportion of agi eg 75 was earned from farming sources the 2008 farm bill eliminates the exception and creates two new measures of agi adju sted gross nonfarm income and adjusted gross farm income first if threeyear average of nonfarm agi exceeds 500000 then program benefits are allowe d direct countercyclical nd marketing loan second if threeyear average of farm agi exceeds 750000 then direct payments are allowed but countercyclical and marketing loan benef its are allowed for these higherincome farmers pr ogram participants can have income from both sources but the caps for each type are hard caps that is there are exceptions to the cap as with soft caps except that the cap on farm agi applies only to direct payments for example if fulltime farmer has nonfarm agi over 500000 their program payments are eliminated regardless of their farm income taxpayers agi may also be between 750000 and 125 million and still r eceive program benefits if the income is split in such way to remain below the caps on farm and nonfarm income moreover the 2008 farm bill dopts senate provision that allows agi of married couple to be divided as if separate tax returns were f iled while in principle this provision could allow doubling of the agi limits the income needs to be legitimately allocated between the spouses likely by social security numbers or equivalent identifiers for more information on the commodity programs above and payment limits see crs report rl34594 farm commodity programs in the 2008 farm bill dairy two federal programs that suppor t milk prices and dairy farm income were among the farm bill programs set to expire in 2007 the dairy price support program dpsp and the milk income loss contract milc program in the past under the dpsp usda had been required to indirectly support the fa rm price of milk most recently at 990 per cwt 100 pounds which it has done by purchasing surplus butter nonfat dry milk and chees at specified minimum prices the 2008 farm bill continues the dpsp through d ecember 2012 but modifies the program by specifying in the law itself the minimum purchase prices for these manufactured dairy products if net removals esse ntially usdas surplus purchases for 12 consecutive months exceed statutory limits usda may reduce product purchase prices under the final law under expiring law the milc program had paid participa ting farmers 34 of the difference between target price of 1694 per cwt and the monthly market price for farm fluid milk in new england when th market price is below the target per farm payments had been limited to the first 24 million lbs of annual milk production the enacted 2008 farm bill extends the program but generally increases the payment factor to 45 of the price differential for the period from october 1 2008 through august 31 2012 as proposed by the senate conferees also increased the production limit for payments to 2985 million pounds compared with senate proposal that would have raised the limit to 415 million pounds furthermore the 1694 per cwt payment rate must be adjust ed to reflect feed cost increases abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs15 18 type of loan where farmers or processors pledge commodity as collateral to obtain loan from the commodity credit corporation ccc at commodityspecific perunit loan rate the borrower may repay the loan with interest within specified period and regain control of the commodity alternatively the commodity can be forfeited to the ccc with penalty if market prices fall below the loan rate at the end of the term the government takes recourse beyond accepting the commodity as full settlement of the loantrigger levels specified in the enacted farm bill cbo has estimated the total net fiveyear increase in outlays for the bills key dairy provisions at 386 million third ongoing federal dairy policy tool federal milk marketing orders require dairy processors to pay minimum price for farm milk depending on its end use ie the type of product produced federal or ders are permanently authorized but number of issues were brought to the attention of congress for the farm bill debate dairy processors had been seeking change in statute to exempt them from paying the federal milk marketing order minimum price whenever they forward contract prices with dairy farmers the 2008 farm bill authorizes farmers to voluntarily enter into forward price contracts until sept ember 30 2012 with none to extend beyond september 30 2015 the legislation contains safeguards designed to ensure that dairy farmers are not compelled by processors to participate in the program the final bill also establishes subject to the availability of appropriations commission to review and evaluate federal milk marketing order policies and procedures and in the meantime revises the formal hearing procedures used to consider amendments to the orders other dairyrelated provisions in the enacted bill bring alaska hawaii the district of columbia and puerto rico into the dairy research and promotion check off program lower

more information see crs report rl34036 dairy policy and the 2008 farm bill sugar the sugar program is designed to guarantee the price received by growers and processors of sugar beets nd sugarcane but at cost to the us treasury to accomplish this usda limits th amount of sugar that processors can sell domestically under marketin g allotments and restricts imports in order to keep market prices above support levels this way the incentive exists for sugar cane processors and beet refiners to repay nonrecourse price support loans18 extended by usda rather than hand over processed suga r as

program in terms of total annual f unding is the crp the enacted bill caps crp enrollment at 32 million acres down from its previous cap of 392 million acres the managers report on the conference agreement states th is reduction is not an indicator of declining or reduced support for crp how ever in other sections of the report usda is encouraged to assist producers who are transitioning from land retirement to working lands conservation the bill makes certain program changes including allowing for usda to address state regional and national conservation initiatives expanding the program to cover beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers ranchers allowing for certain types of managed grazing and installation of wind turbines on enrolled lands but at reduced rates requiring that program participants manage lands according to conservation plan requiring usda to survey annually the peracre estimates of county cash rents pa id to crp contract holders clarifying the status of

programs and received additional budget authority under the 2008 farm bill the enacted bill did not adopt senate proposal that would have closely coordinated csp nd eqip under the socalled comprehensive stewardship incentives program for eqip the enacted bill expands the program to cover practices that enhance soil surface and ground water and air quality and conserve energy it also covers grazing land forestland wetla nd and other types of land and natural resources that support wildlife the bill sets aside 5 of eqip spending for beginning farmers and ranchers and 5 for socia

will continue to enc ourage conservation practices on working lands but will be different than the former program in that it eliminates the threetier approach removes 10year c ontracts and requires direct attribution of payments among other changes thus requiring th at usda promulgate new rules for the program the bill sets target of rolling more than 13 million acres annually in the new program with individual pr oducer payments limited to 200000 per entity in any fiveyear period the types of elig ible lands are expande d to include priority resource concerns as identified by states certain

crop rotations pr ogram payments may not be used for the design construction or maintenance of animal waste storage or treatment facilities or associated wa ste transport or transfer devices among other programs the 2008 farm bill reauthorizes whip at current funding levels but limits prog ram eligibility to focus on nds for the development of wildlife habitat on private agricultura l land nonindustrial private forest land and tribal lands thus potentially excluding some previously covered areas it also allows usda to provide priority to projects that address issues raised by state regional and national conservation initiatives the bill raises the limit on costshare payments to 25 for longterm project s under whip and limits total payments to 50000 per year the bill also authorizes increased funding for several programs including the grassroots source water prot ection program and the small watershed rehabilitation program it also provides additional ma ndatory

private voluntary organizations pvos argued for the safe box maintaining that it would give them assurances of supply of the commodities they rely on to carry out development projects the administration opposed the safe box concept saying that it would deprive it of the flexibility needed to respond to emergency food aid needs the 2008 farm bill reauthorizes other sm aller programs that provide food aid to countries promoting the development of marketoriented agricultural sectors food for progress ffp or for school feeding nd nutrition programs the mcgoverndole international school feeding and child nutrition program usda administers these smaller food aid programs the b ill reauthorizes ffp without lifting the cap on cccfunded transportation of commodities an action that the senate farm bill had recommended which effectively dete rmines the volume of commodities that can be provided for the mcgoverndole program the bill provides an additional 84 million of ccc funds to remain available until expended the housepassed bill however had proposed changing th funding basis of mcgoverndole from discretionary to mandatory and incr easing spending from 140 million in

nutrition the farm bills nutrition title accounts fo r well over half of all spending on programs and activities covered by the bill with the overwhelming majority financing the food stamp program the mo st significant issues in and provisions of this title address the admin istration of eligibility for and benefits under the food stamp program funding for the emergenc food assistance program tefap and support for program of making free fresh fruits and vegetables available in schools the enacted 2008 farm bill includes provisi ons that extend expiring authorities in covered programs gen erally through fy2012 and increase spending for most programs above what would be expected under prior law above the baseline the nutrition title covers the food stamp progra m tefap the fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools the senior farmers market nutrition program programs in lieu of food stamps in puerto rico and ameri can samoa and on indian reservations rules governing procurement of food for school meal programs and various special nutrition projects under previous law th programs would cost nearly 40 billion year and be expected to grow to almost 50 billion in fy2017 total spending on these and other nutr ition programs including amounts offset by other savings is boos ted by an estimated 32 bi llion outlays over 5 years fy2008fy2012 and 102 billion over 10 years fy2008fy2017httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs24 supplemental nutrition assistance program the largest share of the new spending mandated by the nutrition title results from changes that increase food stamp benefits and establis h new standards to make mo re households eligible under the food stamp program the farm b ill also renames the existing program as the supplemental nutrition assistance progra m snap added food stamp spending is estimated to total 23 billion over 5 years and 782 billion over 10 years 73 and 77 respectively of the titles total new spending the major f ood stamp revisions boost the minimum amount of income that is disregarded when benefits are calculated by increasing and then indexing the standard deductionresulting in small but growing general benefit increase in addition to regular increases for foodprice inflation around 4 month in fy2009 increase and then index the minimum monthly benefit guaranteesetting at it at 8 of the indexed maximum benefit for one person raising it from the current 10 to at least 14 in fy2009 disregard all income spent on dependent care when calculatingbenefits removing existing caps on this disregard and substantially loosen eligibility rules relating to assets by indexing the dollar limits on allowable liquid assets and disregarding all retirement savingsplans and education savings other provisions 1 continue inflation indexed funding for nutrition assistance grants in lieu of food stamps to puerto rico and american samoa 2 extend the authority to operate food distribution pr ogram on indian reservations 3 simplify some administrative processes like reporting requirements 4 expand the availability of transitional benefits for those leavin g public assistance programs 5 give the federal government great deal more flexibility in imposing penalties on retail food stores that violate food stamp ru 6 add disqualif ication penalties for those selling food bought with food stamp bene fits and those using benefits to obtain cash for container deposits and 7 require greater federal scru tiny and oversight of state efforts to privatize and expand the use of computers in their administration of food stamps the overwhelming major ity of food stamp provisions represent policy changes that were included in bot h the house and senate bills although budget limits forced changes or that were noncontroversial however number of significant initiatives were not adopte d generally for policy rather than cost reasons these notably included hous proposal to place major limits on state privatization of food stamp administrati on and th senates provisions loosening eligibility rules for ablebodied adults w ithout dependents and eventually permitting the use of food stamp benefits to buy dietary supplements the emergency food assistance program the nutrition titles second largest share of new spending is for tefap with estimated additional outlays of 526 million over fy2008fy2012 and 126 billion over fy2008fy2017 17 and 12 respectively of the titles total estimated cost closely following the provisions of both the house and senate bills this provision in the final law greatly increases mandatory funding of food purchas for the program to levels well above the current requirement to acquire 140 million year required commodity buys are expanded by 1 an immediate infusi on of 50 million in fy2008 and 2 raisinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs25 annual mandatory purchases to 250 milli on in fy2009 indexed annually for food price inflation in later years other programs another major initiative in the nutrition title is dramatic increase in funding for the fresh fruit and vegetable program in schools in fy2008 approximately 20 million is available for this effort the bill boosts mandatory outlays by 274 million fy2008fy2012 and 1 billion fy2008 fy2017 representing some 10 of total new spending in addition to the changes in major pr ograms noted above the 2008 farm bill 1 includes limited authority for schools in sc hool meal programs to use geographic preference for locally grown and raised agricultural products when procuring food 2 increases mandatory funding for the nior farmers market nutrition program from 15 million year to 206 million year 3 continues and expands support for community food projects 4 provide s money for an initiative to use the renamed food stamp progra m to promote health and nutrition and 5 authorizes and in some cases funds several projects related to food distri bution efforts school gardens hungerfree community initiatives provision of whole grain products to schools and an urban food enterprise center in all but very few cases eg privatization and dietary supplement provisions there were important polic differences between the house and senatepassed versions of the farm bill however the bills diverged greatly in the amount of new spending they proposed for example the fy2008fy2012 estimated cost outlays of the house b ills nutrition title was 42 billion versus the senates 53 billion the bills also diffe red in funding priorities the house devoted 78 of new funding to new food st amp spending 14 to extra funding for tefap and 7 to expanding the fresh fruit nd vegetable program in contrast the senate bill provided 66 of its projected funding to new food stamp spending along with 10 for tefap and 21 for the fruit and vegetable initiative the house and senate measures further diffe red in another matter th house would have made its policy amendments part of permanent law producing 10y ear throug h fy2017 cost estimate of 115 billion on the other hand most of the senates significant revisions eg increased food stamp benefi ts were scheduled to terminate after fy2012 resulting in much lower 10year cost estimate than the house or than would have been the case with permanen t changes outlays totaling 67 billion finally the house and senate bills provided for different extensions of expiring authorities like the authoriz ation of appropriations for food stamps the house extended these authorities through fy2012 while the senate opted for indefinite extension in most cases the final 2008 farm bill deals with funding level issues and issues of allocation among programs as di scussed earlier in this section makes all policy changes

beyond traditional farm loans and into more rural housing and nonfarm businesses commercial ba nks oppose expanding fcs lending authority saying that the availability of commercial credit in rural areas is not constrained and that fcss governmentsponsored enterprise gse status provides an unfair competitive advantage the enacted bill like the house and senate bills does not allow any expansion

eligibility for water and waste water disposal loans and grants and the community facility program the bill requires usda to prepare report assessing the various definitions of rural and the effect these various defi nitions have on programs administered by usda rural development although both the house and senate farm bills included mandatory funding for several programs the enacted 2008 farm b

in renewable energy has grown rapidly since late 2005 due in large part to strong rise in domestic and international fuel prices and dramatic acceleration in domestic biofuel production mostly ethanol many policymakers view agriculturebased biofuels as both catal yst for rural economic development and response to growing energy import dependence renewable energys role in the 2002 farm bill was contained in the farm bills energy title title ix which concentrated on grants loan and loan guarantees to fost er research on agriculturebased renewable energy to share development risk and to promote the adoption of renewable energy systems usdas bioenergy program s ec 9006 of pl 107171 funding for which expired in fy2006 had been the primary exception in that it provided incentives to expand actual production of bioenergy the enacted 2008 farm bill expands and extends the provisions in the energy section of the 2002 farm bill and provi des additional funding the bill makes numerous changes to the programs in the energy title for example the bill combines the socalled section 9006 progra m with the energy audit and renewable energy development program under the new renewable energy for america program the bill also creates new programs including biomass crop assistance program to provide financia l assistance to producers for growing biomass crops and developing conversion faci lities and the agricultural bioenergy feedstock and energy efficiency research and extension initiative to provide for competitive grants to fund projects with focus on s upporting onfarm biomass crop research and extension this latter initiative is under the bills research title title vii and includes other bioenergy research programs the enacted bill continues programs fo r

guarantees for the development and constr uction of commercialscale biorefineries that use technologies that are either pre commercial or commercia lly available the bill provides for the repowering of existing biorefineries it incorporates the biomass research and development ac t of 2000 as part of the b ills energy title and will fund projects that address the critical need for integrated research and technology development in the area of biofuels it continues the biodiesel fuel education program with an expanded list of entities targeted also among the miscellaneous provisions title xv the ethanol producti on tax credit is lowered from 51 to 46 cents per gallon beginning in the first year following that in which ethanol production of 75 billion gallons is achieved fi nally the 2008 farm bill establishes the cellulosic biofuel producer credit of 101 per gallon with special provisions for small cellulosic ethanol producers mandatory spending for the enacted bills agriculturebased energy programs are projected at about 600 million fy2008fy2012 and 900 million fy2008 fy2017 this reflects reduction compared to funding levels proposed in the house and senatepassed bills the house bill had authorized more than 3 billion in new mandatory funding and more than 1 billion in discretionary funding for provisions of the energy title the senate bill authorized more than 1 billion in new mandatory funding and more than 2 billi on in discretionary funding both the house and the senate sought to fund thes provisions through various revenue and cost offset

federal programs that currently support renewable energy production in general and agriculturebas ed energy production in particular are outside the purview of usda and have legislative origins outside of the farm bill for example the energy act signed into law in december 2007 pl 110140 covers wide range of topics with extensive atten tion to biofuels in particular it includes dramatic expansion of the renewable fuels mandate to 36 billion gallons by 2022 with carveouts for biodiesel 1 billion gallons by 2012 cellulosic ethanol 16 billion gallons by 2022 and cornstarch ethanol 15

provision affec ting specialty crops includes mandatory funding of 207 million through fy2012 to 1 establish cooperative agreements with state departments of agriculture for early plant pest detection activities 2 establish threat identification and mitigation program for foreign pests and diseases and 3 provide funds and technical assistance to specialty crop producers to develop audit based certification systems to lessen the risks of pest em ergence and movement the 2008 farm bill also provides 20 million over f our years to establish centers where the specialty crop industry can obtain pest and diseasefree pl ant source material and authorizes appropriations to establish pest and disease revolving loan fund to help local governments purchase equipm ent for the speedy removal of trees that must be destroyed to stop the spread of pest or disease infestation the enacted bill also contains several provisions to encourage the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables one provides 33 million through fy2012 to expand the existing farmers market promotion program with requirement that 10 of the funds be used to make it possible for bene ficiaries of federal nutrition programs to use their electronic benefits cards at farmers markets another provides 5 million to establish healthy urban food enterpri development center designed to help make affordable nutritious

the impact of such changes on farm prices on the traditional system of independent familybased agriculture on consumers and on global competitiveness inherent in these questions is the role government should play in monitoring and regulating agricultural markets for more information see crs report rl33958 animal agriculture 2008 farm bill issues the enacted 2008 farm bill contains new title on livestock title xi that scales back much of the language in the senatepassed bill aimed at more closely regulating livestock and poultry markets for example conferees deleted senate language that would have prohibited most major packers from owning feeding or controlling livestock except within 14 days of slaughter also deleted was senate provision to establish at usda new speci counsel for agricultural competition to investigate and prosecute violations of competition laws title xi of the enacted 2008 farm bill changes the agricultural fair practices act to alter the definitions of associations and handlers not included in the enacted bill were various senate provisions intended to strengthen usdas oversight and enforcement of the act also not included in the enacted bill were senate provisions to give usda stronger enforcement authorities over live poultry d ealers among other provisions under the packers and stockyards act psa which governs market competition in the meat packing sectors in their place conferees added language requiring an annual report detailing investigations into possible violations of the psa also narrowed was senate language governing c ontractual arrangements between producers and integrators under the final farm bill poultry or swine grower more limited definition of contr act producer than in the original senate bill has the right to cancel producti on contract within 3 business days of execution unless later date is specified in the contract in lie u of senate language limiting the conditions under which contract or could require producer to make additional capital investments the 2008 farm bill stipulates that the possibility of such an investment be conspicuously stated in the contract several other provisions retained in somewhat modified form in the enacted bill are intended to give producers additional protections wh disputing contract termshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs35 the enacted bill contains provisions

coolprocessed versions of these products and diningout establishments there has been vigorous debate over whether this new program is desirable and necessary its purposes and its likely impacts on farmers processors retailers and consumers pponents of mandatory cool prefer voluntary or ma rketdriven program or at l east some relaxation of the cool laws compliance language supporte rs have continued to seek congresss and usdas assurance that the mandatory program will be implemented expeditiously for more detailed descri ption of current law requirements and issues see crs report rs22955 countryoforigin labeling for foods the 2008 farm bill implements the mandato ry program on its current schedule and adds goat meat chicken which competes with red meats in the market and which unlike red meats primarily are domes tically produced ginseng pecans and macadamia nuts as covered commodities ho wever for red meats it creates several new types of label categories that are intended to facilitate and simplify compliance in specifying the country or countries of the products for ll covered commodities the bill also seeks to ease recordkeeping and verification requirements and lower noncompliance penalties inspection registries and grading the 2008 farm b ill includes provisions covering stateinspected meat and poultry reportable meat and poultry registries and catfish grading and inspection among other provisions federal law has prohibited stateinsp ected meat and poultry plants from shipping their products across state lines ban that many states and small plants have long sought to overturn limiting stateinspected products to intrastate commerce is unfair many state agencies and stateinspected plants have argued because the 27 current stateoperated programs by law already must be and are at least equal to the federal system those who have oppos ed allowing stateinspected products in interstate commerce argued that state programs are not required to have and do not have the same level of safety oversight as the federal or even the foreign plants both the house and senate farm bills contained language to enable state inspected plants to sell products in inte rstate commerce but under divergent policy approaches conferees adopted the senates version whereby stateinspected plants with 25 employees or fewer may opt into new pr ogram that subjects them to federal laws and oversight for which they may gain the federal mark of inspection and the ability to ship interstate they would still be inspected by state employees but these employees would be under the supervision of federal official who will oversee training inspection compliance and other ac tivities states would receive at leasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs36 60 reimbursement of their costs compa red with 50 under the existing federal state program provisions which also tinues the senate language was compromise package acceptable to both supporters and opponents of the house passed language which among other things could have enabled many plants currently under federal inspection to apply for state in spection and continue to ship interstate opponents of the house option feared that many would seek to leave the federal system if they believed they could receive more lenient oversight by the states for background see crs report rl34202 stateinspected meat and poultry issues for congress conferees modified provision in the senate but not the house bill to require usda to establish reportable food regi stries for meat and poultry and their products whereby establishments would have to report whenever there is probability of such foods causing adverse health consequences the fda amendments legislation passed in 2007 p l 11085 establishes similar registry for fdaregulated foods the enacted fa rm bill amends the meat and poultry laws to require an establishment to promptly notify usda if it has reason to believe that an adulterated or misbr anded product has entered commerce another adopted provision requires meat and poultry establishments to prepare and maintain written recall plans conferees modified senate bill language to provide for two new usda initiatives affecting farmraised domestic catfish voluntary grading program administered through the agricultural marketing service ams and mandated safety inspection of such products by food safety and inspection service ie making catfish an amenable species along with the major meat and poultry species the house bill lacked this language the final version provides for catfish grading as voluntary feebased program with producers of other seafood species eligible to petition usda for similar service conferees agreed to extend mandatory inspection to catfish processors further au thorizing fsis to take into account the conditions under which catfish are raised nd transported although other fish and shellfish are not covered by the final amendment conferees noted in their accompanying report that the secretary of agriculture has standing authority to add species if appropriate the conference report states the intent of congress that catfish be subject to continuous inspection and that imported cat fish inspection programs be found to be equivalent under usda regulati ons before foreign catfish may be imported into the united states language in the bill itself instructs the secretary to define the term catfish however the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 sec 10806 had amended the federal food drug and cosm etic act to limit the acceptabl definition to one family of catfish ictaluridae effectively prohi biting the labeling of certain asiangrown fish as catfish so the scope of the regulatory definiti on developed by the secretary of agriculture could be of some interest other provisions conferees deleted two provisions in the senate bill one provision would have established congressional bipar tisan food safety commission that would have been requi red to report within one year on recommendations for modernizing food prog rams the provision was intended to be in response to recent food safety inci dents linked to both imported and domestichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs37 foods which have brought into focus the question of whether there is need for changes in federal food safety oversight at issue is wh ether the current system has the statutory authorities resources and stru ctural organization to protect consumers from unsafe food the second deleted pr ovision would have prohibited fda from issuing final risk assessment or from lifting the voluntary moratorium until completion of newly manda ted studies on the safety and market impacts of introducing pr oducts from cloned animals the provision was intended to be in response to fdas request issued in 2008 that companies refrain voluntarily from marketing meat and milk from cloned animals or their progeny until it can complete final assessment of their

supplemental agri cultural disaster assistance provided for under the bills title xv t rade and tax provisions crop insurance program the federal crop insurance program is designed to protect crop producers from unavoidable ri sks associated with adverse weather weatherrelated plant diseases and insect infestations although the scope of the crop insurance program has widened sign ificantly over the past 25 years the anticipated goal that it would replace ad hoc disaster payments has not been achieved the crop insurance program is perman ently authorized and hence does not require consideration in the farm bill some policymakers expressed interest in expanding the crop insurance program in the context of the farm bill andor complementing it with permanent disaster payment program however many viewed the crop insurance program as pot ential target for program cost reductions where savings could be used to fund new in itiatives in various titles of the farm bill the administration and others contend that the private companies should be required to absorb more of the program losses and that the reimbursement rate for their operating expenses needs to be reduced as means of reducing federal costs the insurance companies and many farm groups are concerned that significant reductions in federal pport will nega tively impact the financial health of the crop insurance industry and possibly jeopardize the delivery of crop insurance particularly in high risk areas like the house and nate passed farm bills the enacted 2008 farm bill contains several revisions to the crop insu rance program many of which are designed to reduce program costs for the enacted crop insurance title cbo has estimated net savings of 39 billion over five years fy20082012 compar ed with estimated savings of 40 billion in the house b ill and 37 billion in the senate bill approximately 28 billion of the estimated savings in the enacted bill as in the house and senate b ills is ach ieved through changes in the timing of premium receipts from farmers and payments to the companies which has effect on overallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34696crs38 subsidies to participating farmers or insurance companies portion of the fiveyear savings is realized by requiring insurance companies and farmers to share more in program costs the enacted bill increases the administrative fees paid by farmers for catastrophic crop insurance coverage and for participation in the separate noninsured assistance program to new levels that are higher than both the house and senate bills the bill also reduces reimbursement rates to private companies for their administrative and operating expenses by 23 percentage points conferees did not include house provision that would have required the insurance companies to share more of their underwriting gains with the federal government among its other provisions the crop in surance title of the 2008 farm bill also 1 requires usda to ensure that premiums are established at level so that total premiums equal total indemnity payments over time 2 allows usda to periodically renegotiate its standard reinsurance agreement which contains the obligations and financial rms of the relationship betw een the government and the participating private crop insurance companies 3 reduces available mandatory funding for reimbursing private

of the deductible on the policy an eligible producer can receive payment equal to 60 of the difference between target level of revenue nd the actual total farm revenue for the entire farm the target level of revenue will be based on the level of crop insurance coverage selected by the farmer thus increasing if farmer opts for higher levels of coverage to be eligible for payment producer must be

level cannot exceed 90 of what income likely would have been in the absence of natural disaster29 the producer also must have at least the minimum level of crop insurance cat coverage for insurable crops nd participate in the nap program for noninsura ble crops the statute makes an exception for the 2008 crop year by allowing producers who did not purchase crop insurance or nap coverage in
