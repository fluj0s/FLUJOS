building connecting all interior corridors from the basement to the roof level requirement the project is result of an ops 1 life safety study th at identified several code deficiencies the reference for this study and all applicable life safety issues pertaining to nsa facilities is the national fire protection association nfpa 101 code current situation the ops1 building was built in the 1950s and does not meet current life safety codes the new exterior building stair tower will correct three major buil ding deficiencies identified in nfpa 101 chapter 7 1 dead end exit corridors on the floors 2 common path of travel deficiencies on the wings and 3 lack of exit stairwells which discharge directly to the outside of the bu ilding these stair towers will also alleviate evacuation congestion and significantly decrease building evacuation times impact if not provided nsa would not be in compliance with dod fire protection engineering facilities criteria ufc 360001 which designates full compliance with nfpa 101 the areas adjacent to the st air tower will not be able to be occupied until applicable life safety codes id entified in nfpa 101 are satisfied employees will continue to work in an environment that does not have an acceptable code compliant means of building evac uation additional this project has been coordinated with environmental an d safety services office and is result of life safety study of ops 1 using nfpa 101 as baseline inspection document this project was originally planned to be executed in conjunction with the ops 1 north stair to wer construction due to unforeseen s ite utility conditions and accompanying time delays contract change orders resulted in an increase in cons truction costs ultimately resulting in the ops 1 south stair
