congressional oversight by christopher m davis under existing senate and house rules intelligence appropriations are under the jurisdiction of the senate and house appropriations committees each committee distributes these appropriations among five appropriations subcommittees predominantly the defense appropriations subcommittees the 911 commission recommended transferring jurisdiction over intelligence appropriations from the senate and house appropriations committ ees to the intelligence authorization committees in each chamber proponents of the commissions proposal have contended that its adoption would 1 improve congressi onal oversight of intelligence 2 counterbalance the commissions proposed consolidation of ex ecutive branch intelligence activities 3 provide more integrated perspective on national intelligence spending 4 attract members to the consolidated intelligence committees and 5 provide clear congressional accountability on intelligence w ithin congress opponents argue that consolidation would 1 reduce oversight of program quality 2 weaken intelligence oversight 3 shortchange intelligence needs of the military 4 concentrate too much power in intelligence committees and 5 increase spending opponents may accordingly argue that it would be preferable to adopt the alternative recommendation of the 911 commission to consolidate authorizing responsibility for inte lligence in joint committee third approach would be to consolidate responsibility for intelligence appropriations in new subcommittee of each the senate and house committees on appropriations

general appropriations bills here include any appropriations for variety of activities as opposed to single activity or purposea matter under their jurisdiction12 sequential referral authority similar to the senates authority also applies to house committees with jurisdiction over intelligence as congress analyzes the commissions proposals it may consider changing the jurisdictions over intelligence of the various authorization committees it could consider for example consolidating the authorization authority over the intelligence community in the house and senate select intelligence committees examples of such consolidation would include providing 1 the senate select intelligence committee with jurisdiction over the entire intelligence community 2 both select intelligence committees with exclusive jurisdiction over intelligence or 3 select intelligence committees in both houses with exclusive jurisdiction over portion of the intelligence community congress may so be called upon to consider proposals to provide exclusive jurisdiction over new national intelligence program as proposed by the 911 commission the sugge sted reorganization would replace the national foreign intelligence program with national intelligence program that would be headed by new national intelligence director one of the commissions arguments in support of tran sferring intelligence appropria tions is that it would help ensure implementation of the commission s proposals to consolidate intelligence in the executive branch see arguments in favor of consolidation below precedent for consolidation separation of authorization and appropriation separate standing committees for spe nding and authorization have been congressional fixture for two centuries in the late 19th century

committees have been in existence for almost 140 years consolidation between 1878 and 1922 beginning in the last quarter of the 19th century the house and senate consolidated the appropriation and

committees in the house the process began in 187815 and was completed in 1885 when six of the bills were transferred in total eight of the 14 general appropriations bills were transferred to various authorization committees16 this consolidation also fragmented jurisdiction over appropriations bills among several committees reducing central committee control over spending the house fragmentation lasted approximately 35 years until all general appropriations bills were recentralized in the house appropriations committee in 1920 in 1899 the senate transferred jurisd iction over seven of the 14

2004separation of authorization and appropriation resumes 19201922 the house in 1920 and the senate in 1922 resumed the separation of authorization and appropriati on functions in response to the dramatic increase in expenditures and the national debt as result of world war i21 congress decided to centralize budgetary decisionmaking in both the executive and legislative branches in 1920 the house recentralized all the ge neral appropriations bills in the house appropriations committees year later congress passed the budget and accounting act of 1921 which establishe d the bureau of the budget later reorganized as the office of management and budget and gave the president the responsibility for preparing and sub mitting the annual budget to congress22 shortly thereafter the bureau of the budg et recommended reorganizing general appropriations bills on administrative rather than topical lines the house appropriations committee soon adopted this recommendation procedural difficulties arose almost immediately however while the house had reorganized its bills along administrative lines and had recentralized all the appropriations bills under the house appropriations committee the senate continued to organize its bills along topical lines and to fragment committee jurisdiction of appropriations bills among several committees as result in 1922 the senate recentr alized all general appropriations bills in the senate appropriations committee and accepted the organization of appropriations b ills along administrative lines23 comparison of earlier period to today as during the earlier period fragmen tation of committee jurisdiction over spending exists today currently most spe nding is controlled by the senate finance and house ways and means committees by virtue of their jurisdiction over major entitlement programs and the senate and house appropriations committees comparatively small amounts of spending ar under the jurisdicti on of several other authorizing committees generally in the form of entitlements examples of entitlement programs include social security medicare unemployment compensation and various vete rans benefit programs approximately 57 of all fy2003 spending was for entitlements about 38 was controlled by the appropriations committees24 there are significant differences between the earlier period and today that limit the applicability of this precedent to the 911 commission proposal first the means by which authorization committees perform their basic function has changedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32659crs11 25the intelligence spending that the 911 commission would transfer to the select intelligence committees is discretionary spending 26multiyear reauthorizations generally range from two to five years

committees are basically res ponsible for evaluating the effectiveness of various existing and potential programs and policies or assessing program quality the programquality analysis appropriations committees are responsible for selecting items to be funde d determining the funding vels of each and examining whether funds are spent according to congressional intent the budget analysis during the earlier period authorization bills were permanent law that established an agency and provided broad missions for the agency those enactments did not explicitly provide authorization of subs equent appropriations occasionally the original act was amended by subsequent authorization act annual appropriations acts typically provided more detailed guidance to the agency than the authorization act by setting funding levels for individual activities within the agency today authorizations for discretionary spending25 agencies and programs frequently provide spending guidance to the appropriations committees through authorization of appropriations they are typically tem porary on an annual or multiyear cycle26 in many cases they establish and change prog rams or projects and also provide detailed directives to the agencies as well second the 911 commission proposal woul d transfer jurisdiction over all intelligence appropriations for both the program activities and administrative activities to the select intelligence co mmittees during th earlier period only program expenses were generally transferred earlier appropriations bills were organized by topic generally separating program activities of department from its salaries and contingent expenses27 as result the military activities of the war department for example were under th jurisdiction of the committees on military affairs authorizing committees while the salaries and contingent expenses of the civilian administration of the war depar tment were under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees today appropr iations measures are organized along administrative lines funding for both progra ms and salaries of department or agency are included in the same regular appropriations bill third there are different institutional controls for spending today during the earlier period there was institutionalized mechanism to coordi nate revenue and spending decisions or establish enforceab spending ceilings today under the congressional budget process congress 1 sets annual total spending ceilings and revenue floors 2 distributes the spending among the various committees with jurisdiction

appropriations would not be pa rt of the congressional budget process while the 911 commission recommended declassification of total intelligence spending many members are opposed29 members may consider modification of the existing budget process that would allow the inclusion of classified spending under present practices classified intelligence spending has been made part of the annual

commission report needed to provide additional control ove r the executive branch centralization of intelligence power the consolidation would provide the intelligence committees with budgetary leverage over the executive branch to ensure strong congressional checks35 provide clear congressional accountability some proponents reason that consolidating intelligence authorization and appropriation into single committee in each chamber ensures clear congressional accountability there would be single committee in each chamber that would be re sponsible for intelligence instead of at least two committees in each chamber the respective select committees on intelligence and committees on appropriations reduce conflicting congressional directives to intelligence entities under the existing committee structure the lect intelligence committees propose various intelligence policies and programs for the intelligence community the appropriations committees may provide conf licting direction to the intelligence community through for example the fundi ng decisions they make regarding each intelligence policy and program cons olidation would reduce these conflicting directives provide more integrated perspective on national intelligence t h r s maintain consolidation is needed to ensure that intelligence spending decisions are made within the context of more integrated perspective on national intelligence needs than exists today that is the n eeds of various programs and entities in the intelligence community are evaluated and coordinated and the intelligence spending priorities are established this approach contrasts with current practices in the appropriations subcommittees which it is argued focus on the intelligence needs of individual depa rtments the departmental perspective on intelligence the defense appropriations subcommittees for example may focus on the military intelligence needs of the department of defense at the expense of national intelligence needs some also argue that under present arrangements intelligence needs sometimes may not be adequately f unded due to competing nonintelligence needs since the appropriations subcommittees must balance spending needs of both intelligence and nonintelligence progra ms and activities attract members to intelligence committees transferring jurisdiction over appropriations to the intelligence committees might make membership on those committees more attractive intelligence committees may also become more attractive if the 911 commissions propos to change membership on the intelligence committees from limited terms to inde finite terms is adopted increasing the attractiveness of intelligence committee membership would help to ensure continuity of membership nd therefore more informed and consistent oversighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32659crs15 36sen daniel k inouye remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 150 oct 7 2004 p s10635arguments against consolidation reduce oversight of program quality opponents maintain that consolidation would significantly reduce oversight of program quality under the existing separation of the two functions au thorization committees are responsible for program quality the programquality analysis and the appropriations committees are responsible for items of appropriations and for examin ing whether funds are spent according to congressional intent the budget analysis under contemporary conditions budgetary control is frequently considered the more important form of power but budget analysis requires substan tial expenditures of time and effort as result it is possible that committees with consolidated jurisdiction would focus chiefly on this aspect of their work and that program quality might consequently receive inadequate attention may weaken intelligence oversight some opponents argue that due to the secretive nature of intelligence providi ng only one committee in each chamber with jurisdiction over intelligence oversight would weaken oversight as mentioned previously congress is the only instituti on able to conduct intelligence oversight in order to reduce the chances of enactment of faulty policies checks and balances within congress are needed such as an authorization committee and an appropriations committee with different responsibilities competitive analysis of intelligence in congress would also be lost if single committee had jurisdiction over intelligence there is also congressional concern that if the two intelligence committees eventually develop close suppor tive relationships with the intelligence agencies rigorous congressional intelligence oversight would be weakened not strengthened some argue that it would be less likely that four separate committees would be coopted shortchange intelligence needs of the military some might contend that the proposal would result in detrimental shift in intelligence spending priorities from the intelligence needs of the military to those of national policymakers under the existing committee structure the defense appropriations subcommittees focus primarily on intelligence needs of the military senator daniel k inouye ranking member of the senate defense appropriations subcommittee stated linking defense and intelligence is critical dod cannot operate without good intelligence the defense subco mmittee has ensured that intelligence resources support the needs of the warfighter today the defense subcommittee reviews the recommendations of both the armed services and intelligence committees the appropriations committee can minimize redundancies and make sure that the needs of both defense and intelligence are met36 increase spending some maintain that if intelligence spending remains classified and appropriations are transferred to the select intelligence committees institutional checks on funding for intellig ence will be reduced and spending will therefore tend to increase under pres ent arrangements as explained above inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32659crs16 37for example the commercejusticestatethe judiciary regular bill would include fbi intelligence spending and homeland security regular bill homeland security intelligence continuedcomparison of earlier period to today much information on intelligence spending is not publicly available as result ceilings set on total intelligence spending could not be enforced through the existing cong ressional budget process some may argue that without visible spending controls there would be little ability to restrain intelligence spending set precedent for dispersion of appropriations in the opinion of some members transferring intelligence appropriations to the select intelligence committees might set precedent for tran sferring appropriations for other discretionary spending programs and activities to applicable authorizing committees other members of congress may support establishing such precedent opponents of the proposal to merge authorization and appropriation func tions could maintain that any piecemeal or major overhaul of the current committee structure should be preceded by thorough analysis of the effect such change would have congress should examine for example the possibl delay in completin g appropriations bills that such merger might create one suggested solution is to restructure the jurisdiction of the senate and house authorization committees concentrate too much power in intelligence committees intelligence committees with jurisdiction over both authorization and appropriations in the opinion of some might be too powerful particularly if the intelligence committees also have exclusive authorization jurisd iction currently the funding decisions of the appropriations committees about intelligence policies and programs may provide check review and constraint on the policy decisions of the intelligence committees under structure that consolidates authorization and appropriation jurisdiction this check would be lost in addition reducing the size of the intelligence committee and changing membership to indefinite terms could have the longterm effect of reducing the number of members with knowledge of the secret intelligence policies and practices as result it is possible that fewer members will be willing to question the intelligence committees recommendations may require bicameral approach if only one chamber transfers appropriations jurisdiction to its select intelligence committee opponents might argue that fewer of the claimed benefits of unified policy focus would be realized in addition difficulties in the conference process would result the senate and house appropriations subcommittees have traditionally had parallel jurisdictions over individual regular ppropriations bills and each subcommittee pair has conferenced on single regular appropriations bill the result would be one chamber approving unified intelligence appropriation bill and the other passing defense appropriations bill containing most intelligence while with the rest would be in other appropriations bills the defense appropriations bill in the latter chamber unlike that in the former would include both intelligence and nonintelligence spending as would the other appropriations bills containing intelligence spending37

by christopher m davis the joint committee on atomic energy which had jurisdiction over the former atomic energy commission and nuclear ergy was established as an 18member committee with an equal number of member s from each chamber virtually unique among joint committees the joint committee on atomic energy had authority to report legislation to bot h the senate and house38 those who have studied the joint co mmittee have concluded that it became one of the most powerful committees of congress there are several reasons for the joint committees power the joint committee had exclusive legislative and oversight jurisdiction and therefore committee po licy competition was limited to the senate and house appropriations committees also the joint committee had exclusive access to restricted data not available to other congressiona l committees and strong leverage over the nuclear activities of the executive branch39 for detailed information on the joint committee on atomic

cance lling previously enacted budget authority 41spending authority refers to budget authority that is not enacted in appropriations actsseparate intelligence appropriations subcommittee within appropriations committees another alternative proposal calls for th establishment of separate intelligence appropriations subcommittees in the sena and house appropriations committees this option would transfer intelligence appropriations from the existing appropriations subcommittees predominantly the defense appropriations subcommittees to the new intelligence subcommittees this recommendation proponents reason w ould have several advantages over the 911 commission recommendation it w ould retain progra mquality and budget analyses in separate appropriations and authorization committees which would be lost under the 911 commissions proposal also it would not concentrate power predominantly in single committee in each chamber or set precedent for transferring appropriations to authoriz ation committees and it would likely be more easily implemented than the 911 commission recommendation another argument offered in favor of this approach is that it retains certain advantages of the 911 commissions conso lidation proposal proponents state for example that intelligence spending decisions would be based on more comprehensive national perspective on intelligence some argue that concentrating intelligence spending could be used to counter consolidation of intelligence power in the executive whether the congressional committees were intelligence appropriations subcommittees or inte lligence authorization committees with appropriations power the disadvantages to establishing intelligence appropriations subcommittees opponents argue are that this approach too would be likely to 1 increase spending unless the total intelligence amount is decla ssified or existing budget procedures are modified and 2 shortchange the intelligence needs of the military also concern has been expressed that congressional accountability would be more diffuse than under the 911 commission proposal instead of two committees focusing entirely on intelligence there would be
