that the time constraints placed on cfius to complete re views and investigations of investment transactions do not provide adequate time in some instances for the committee to complete its activities the committee on foreign invest ment in the united states cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius is an interagency committee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in th economy cfius was established by an executive order of president ford in 1975 with broad re sponsibilities and few specific powers4 the committee is housed in the department of the treasury and has generally operated in relative obscurity initially cfius was established with six members but the membership has been expanded over time to twelve through various executive orders the twelve members include the secretaries of state the treasury defense homeland security and commerce the united states trade representative the chairman of the c ouncil of economic advisers the attorney general the director of the office of mana gement and budget the director of the office of science and technology policy th assistant to the president

effects on national security of such investments most importantly however congress directed that the president can exercise this discretionary authority only if he determines that two conditions exist 1 other us laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect the national security and 2 that he must have credible evidence that the foreign investment will impair the national security for th purposes of this legislation congress purposely did not define nationa l security but intended to have the term interpreted broadly without limitation to particular industry6 in 1988 congress approved the exonflor io provision as part of the omnibus trade act7 through executive order 12661 president reagan implemented provisions of the omnibus trade act and he delegated his authority to administer the exonflorio provision to cfius8 particularly to conduc t reviews of foreign investment to undertake investigations and to make recomme ndations although the statute itself does not specifically mention cfius as result of president reagans action cfius was transformed from purely administrative body with limited authority to review and analyze data on foreign investment to one with broad mandate and significant authority to advise the president on foreign investment transactions and to recommend that some transactions be susp ended or prohibited the committee has 30 days to decide whether to investigate case and an additional 45 days to make its recommendation once the recommendation is made the president has 15 days to act the byrd amendment in 1992 congress amended the exonflorio statute through section 837a of the national defense authoriz ation act for fiscal year 1993 known as the byrd amendment after the amendments s ponsor the provision requires cfius to investigate proposed mergers acquis itions or takeovers in cases where 1 the acquirer is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government and 2 the acquisition results in control of person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that could affect the national security of the united states9 this amendment came under particul arly intense scrutiny by the 109th congress as result of the dp world transacti on many members of congress and others believed that this amendment requi red cfius to undertake full 45day investigation of the transaction because dp world was controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government th dp world acquisition however exposed sharp rift between what some members apparently believed the amendment directed cfius to do and how the members of cfius were interpreting the amendment in particular some members of congress apparently interpreted the amendment tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33614crs4 10 weisman jonathan and bradley graham duba i firm to

without exception if the foreign firm involved in transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government representatives of cfius however argued that there were two factors that controlled their decision not to conduct 45day investigation of the transaction first they argued that the requirements of the exonflorio provision itself precluded them from engaging in 45day investig ation because their initial review did not find credible evidence that the transaction would impair national security basic threshold for cfius to meet in order to invoke the exonflorio provision secondly representatives indicated that they interpret the amendment to mean that 45day investigation is discretionary and not ma ndatory again because of the requirement that transaction must be found to cause an impairment to national security before the exonflorio provision can be invoked as result of the attention by both the public and congress dp world officials announced that they would sell off the u s port operations to an american owner10 on december 11 2006 dp world officials announced that unit of aig global investment group new yorkbased asse t management company with 683 billion in assets but experience in port operati ons would acquire the us port operations for an undisclosed amount11 in the case of the dp world acquisition cfius representatives argued that they had concluded as result of an extensiv review of the proposed acquisition both prior to the case being formally filed with cfius and as result of 30day review that the dp world case did not warrant full 45day inves tigation during these two reviews one informal and one formal cfius members believed that all concerns that had been expressed by members of cf ius had been adequately resolved so that by the time of the review member of cfius had any unresolved concerns about the impact of the transaction on national secu rity they conceded that the case met the first criterion under the byrd amendment because dp world was controlled by foreign government but that it did not meet the second part of the requirement because cfius had concluded during the 30 day review that the transaction could not affect the national security12 through the exonflorio provision congress directed that the president or his designee may consider short list of factors in deciding whether to block foreign acquisition merger or takeove r again the president s broad discretion under the current statute to decide the basis on which he determines whether transaction might impair the national security this list includes the following factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33614crs5 13 crs report rl33103 foreign investment in the united states major federal restrictions by michael v seitzinger1 domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements 2 the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries and commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national security 4 the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports rrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and biological weapons and 5 the potential effects of the transaction on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security part of congresss motiva tion in adopting the exonfl orio provision apparently arose from concerns that foreign takeovers of us firms could not be stopped unless the president declared national emergenc or regulators i nvoked federal antitrust environmental or securities laws th rough the exonflorio provision congress attempted to strengthen the presidents hand in conducting foreign investment policy while providing cursory role for itself as means of emphasizing that as much as possible the commercial nature of inve stment transactions should be free from political considerations congress also ttempted to balance public concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nations long standing international commitme nt to maintain an ope n and receptive environment for foreign investment furthermore congress did not intend to have the exonflorio provision alter the generally open foreign investment climate of the country or to have it inhibit foreign direct investments in industries that could not be c onsidered to be of national security interest the basic approach of the provision therefore was to presume that foreign investment generally has positive effect on the economy and that it should be encouraged and restricted only in thos cases in which specific transaction had met burden of proof that the proposed inve stor might take ac tion that threatens to impair the national security at the time the exonflorio provision wa s adopted some anal ysts believed the provision could potentially wide n the scope of industries that fell under the national security rubric cfius however is not fr ee to establish an independent approach to reviewing foreign investment transactions but operates under the authority of the president and reflects his attitudes and policies as result the discretion cfius uses to review and to investigate foreig n investment cases reflects policy guidance from the president foreign investors are also constrained by legislation that bars foreign direct investment

areas from being subject to foreign control exonflorio prov ision after september 11 2001 arguably the events of september 11 2001 have reshaped congressional attitudes toward the exonflorio provi sion and the manner in which it should be used during discussion about the exonfl orio provision prior to its passage in 1988 the reagan administration opposed defin ition of national security that included essential commerce and national security because the administration argued that the definition was too broa d ultimately the reagan administration succeeded in getting the term essential commerce dropped from th provision after the september 11th terrorist attacks however congress passed and president bush signed the usa patriot act of 2001 uniting nd strengthening america by providing appropriate tools requi red to intercept and obstruct terrorism14 in this act congress provided for special support for cr itical industries which it defined as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters15 this broad definition is enhanced to so degree by other provisions of the act which specifically identify certain sector s of the economy therefore as likely candidates for consideration as critical in frastructure including telecommunications energy financial services wa ter transportation sectors16 and the cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense continuity of government economic prosperity and quality of life in the united states17 the following year congress adopted the nguage in the patriot act on critical infrastructure into the ho meland security act of 200218 by adopting the terms critical infrastructure and homeland security following the events of september 11 2001 congress demonstrated that the attacks fundamentally altere d the way many members of c ongress and many in the public view the concept of national security as result many in congress and in the public have come to believe that economic activities are separately identifiable component of national security in ddition many in congress and elsewhere apparently perceive greater risks to th economy arising from foreign investments in which the foreign investor is owned or c ontrolled by foreign governments as result of the terrorist attacks the dubai ports world case in particular

the exonflorio provisio n which views national security primarily in terms of national defense nd downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security overview of hr 5337 and s 3549 hr 533719 and s 354920 share number of common objectives and some common approaches both measures atte mpted to address c ongressional concerns by establishing cfius as matter of stat ute thereby giving congress direct role in determining the makeup and operations of the committee under the house bill the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of defense would have served as vice chairmen while the senate bill would have had the secretary of defense serve in that capacity the house bill would have retained the basic structure of the committee as it presently exists while the senate bill would have included the director of national intelligence as member of cfius and excluded except on casebycase basis the current members of cfius that are from the white house the director of the office of management and budget the chairman of the council of economic advisors the united states trade representative the director of the national economic council th director of the office of science and technology and the presidents assistant for national security affairs under both measures the committee woul d have operated under the same time frame that currently exists with 30 days allotted for review 45 days for an investigation and 15 days for the president to make his determin ation in both bills the president would have retained his authority as the only officer with the authority to suspend or prohibit certain types of foreign investments the senate bill would have allowed cfius to extend review by 30 days under certain circumstances both measures would have placed additi onal requirements on fi rms that resubmitted filing after previously withdrawing filing before full review had been completedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33614crs8 in the house bill review or investigation would have been considered to be complete until it had been signed by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of homeland security to insure that principal members of cfius were aware of all reviews and investigations completed by cfius the house bill would have required that cfius review all foreign investment transactions to determine whether transaction threatens to impair the national security both measures would have placed increased requirements on cfius to review investment transactions in which the fo reign person is owned or controlled by foreign government it is unclear however to what extent the house and senate bills would have altered the current process while both bills would have explicitly required cfius to review all investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or controlled by fo reign government neither m easure amended or altered the current statute in the area that has been the source of recent differences between cfius and congress in particular the current statute states that the president and through him cfius can use the exonflorio process only if he finds that there is credible evidence that fo reign investment will impair national security as result cfius has dete rmined as was the case in the dubai ports transaction that if the committee did not have credible eviden ce that an investme nt will impair the national security that it is not required to undertake full 45day investigation it is possible that cfius could continue to ope rate in this manner regardless of the passage of either of the measures in addition if cfius did act to investig ate all foreign investment transactions in which the foreign person is owned or c ontrolled by foreign government foreign investors likely would regard it as sharply changed attitude by the united states toward foreign investment as previously stated the current system presumes that foreign investment transactions are accepted and it places burden on the members of cfius to prove that par ticular transaction is threat to national security the house and senate bills however might have been interpreted to presume that investment transactions in which the fo reign person is owned or controlled by foreign government are threat to the nations security simply because of the relationship to the foreign government nd therefore might require the firms to prove that they are not threat althoug h the number of investment transactions year in which the foreign investor is associated with foreign government is small compared with the total number of foreign investment transacti ons foreign investors and foreign governments likely would have viewed this as significant change in the traditional us approach to foreign investment both bills attempted to increase the role of congressional oversight by requiring greater reporting by cfius on its actions either during or after it completed reviews and investigations and by increasing re porting requirements on cfius the house bill for instance would have required the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of homeland security to sign and approve any review or investigation in those cases in which the foreign person involved in an investment transaction is owned or controlled by foreign government majo rity of the members of cfius would have been required to approve of the transacti on and the president and the chair and vice chairs of cfius would have been require d to sign off on investments in which at least one member of cfius did not agr ee with the decision of the majority to approve the transaction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33614crs9 the house and senate measures w ould have required cfius to provide congress with greater amount of detaile d information about its operations albeit at different stages in the process the senate bill would have required cfius to notify specified members of congress at the conclusion of review of any investment transaction in which there is any ownership or control by foreign government both bills would have required cfius to notify specified members at the conclusion of any investment investig ation the senate bill would also have required cfius to notify the g overnors of states in which the investment transaction involved any critical infrastructure th house bill would have required cfius to report semiannually to congress while the senate version would have required cfius to provide detailed re ports annually in both cases cfius would have been required to provide more informati on than the current statute requires the house and senate measures also w ould have provided for greater reporting on and increased authority for cfius to ne gotiate provisions with the foreign firms involved in investment trans actions to mitigate the impact of the transaction under current statutes cfius has authority to negotiate such agreements with firms and it is not clear that it has any authority to enforce such agreements the house bill in particular would have pr ovided for process to track the agreements and to report the progress of such agreements and any changes to the agreements to the members of cfius and to the president both bills also would have amended the current statute regarding the meaning of national security and would have placed additional requirements on cfius regarding national security reviews the senate bill also would have required cfius to review any transaction in which the investment resulted in foreign person gaining control of any critical infrastructure in the united states the house bill would have explicitly required the director of nati onal intelligence to conduct reviews of any investment that posed threat to the national security the senate bill also would have required the director of national intelligence to have the intelligence community collect and analyze informa tion related to any proposed or pending investment transactions and to insure that the intelligence community remained engaged throughout the review and investig ation of any investment transaction in addition the senate bill w ould have required cfius to develop and implement system of assessing individual countries as part of their review of potential investors in us assets according to three criteria countrys adherence to nonproliferation control regimes countrys record on cooperation with the united states in counterterrorism efforts nd countrys potential for transshipment or diversion of technologies with military app lications historically th united states has never applied similar policy test to potential foreign investors both bills also would have provided additional factors the president and cfius could have used in assessing foreign investments the house bill would have made such factors mandatory part of the review process while the senate bill would have continued with the current statute which ma kes the use of the factors matter of the presidents discretion the house bill would have added implications for the nations critical infrastructure as matter for reviewing or investigating an investment transaction the senate would also have dded critical infrastructure as matter for review as well as investments that could affect major energy assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33614crs10 critical technologies longterm impact on u s energy
