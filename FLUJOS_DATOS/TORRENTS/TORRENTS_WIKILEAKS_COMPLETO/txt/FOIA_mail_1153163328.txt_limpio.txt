from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedukeith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject new fig 614 date mon 17 jul 2006 150848 0100 cc eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibnojoos joosclimateunibech xflowed hi peck eystein and fortunat ive drafted two versions of the new fig 614 comprising new panel showing the forcing used in the emic runs plus the old fig 613e panel showing the emic simulated nh temperatures keith has seen them already first you should know what i did so that you especially fortunat can check that what i did was appropriate 1 for the volcanic forcing i simply took the volcanic rf forcing from fortunats file and applied the 30year smoothing before plotting it 2 for the solar forcing there are 2 curves for the first i took the bard 025 column from fortunats rf file for the second i took the bard 008 column from fortunats rf file from 1001 to 1609 and then appended the wls rf forcing from 1610 to 1998 then i smoothed the combined record note that for the bard025 the line is flat from 1961 onwards which probably isnt realistic even though that is what was used in the model runs 3 for the all other forcings there are 2 curves for the first i took the co2 concentrations provided by fortunat then used the standard ipcc formula from the tar in fact the first of the three options for co2 in ipcc tar table 62 to convert this to radiative forcing i then added this to the nonco2 radiative forcings data from fortunats file to get the total radiative forcing for the second i replaced all values after 1765 with the 1765 value for the natural forcings case then i smoothed the combined record as in fig 613c i only applied 10year smoothing when plotting the all other forcings because it is fairly smooth anyway and using high smoothing results in lower final values when there is strong trend at the end of time series now some comments on the figures themselves please print them and refer to them when reading this 1 file chap6_f614_option1pdf is strongly preferred by keith and this shows the three forcing components separately which helps with understanding the individual causes of specific warming and cooling periods i have managed to reduce the size of this considerably compared to the equivalent panel in fig 613 because with only few series on it i could squeeze them together more and also reduce the range of the vertical axes 2 although we dont prefer it i have also made chap6_f614_option2pdf which is even smaller by only showing the sum of all the forcings in the top panel which version do you prefer please let know so i can make final changes only to the preferred version some more comments 1 fig 614b was originally fig 613e when it was part of that figure the colour bar showing the shades of grey used to depict the overlapping ranges of the published temperature reconstructions was only on fig 613d do you think i should now also add it to the emic panel 614b now that it is in separate figure it will be bit of squeeze because of the legend that is already in 614b 2 another carry over from when 614b was part of 613 is that the time range of all panels had to match 9002010 now that the emics are in separate figure i could start them in year 1000 which is when the forcing and simulations begin unless you want 613 and 614 to remain comparable again please commentdecide 3 i wasnt sure what colours to use for the forcing series in option 1 the volcanic and other forcings apply to all runs so i chose black with thickthin used to distinguish the all forcings from the naturalonly forcings basically the thin flat line in all other forcings the cyangreenblue runs used strong solar forcing so i used blue for that forcing the redorangebrown runs used weak solar forcing so i used brown for that forcing sound ok sorry for the long email but i wanted to get everything explained to avoid too many iterations please let know your decisionscomments on these questions or on any other aspects of the new figure cheers tim xflowed attachment converted ceudoraattachchap6_f614_option1pdf attachment converted ceudoraattachchap6_f614_option2pdf xflowed dr timothy j osborn academic fellow climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk email tosbornueaacuk phone 44 1603 592089 fax 44 1603 507784 web httpwwwcruueaacuktimo sunclock httpwwwcruueaacuktimosunclockhtm norwich city for science hosting the ba festival 29 september 2006 xflowed
