among the u s cities most vulnerable to flooding and regional growth is increasing the pot ential losses from flooding major flood could inundate developed and agricultural areas disrupting the economy and damaging infrastructure and property ho w to reduce flood risks in developed and developing areas is problem faced by communities nationwide and is receiving increased attention as the reliability of existing infrastructure is reevaluated in the aftermath of hurricane katrina sacramentos flood protec tion system which includes levees on the american and sacramento rivers as well as folsom dam on the american river has been crucial in protecting the city over the last 50 years storms in 1986 and 1996 prompted increased attention to sacramento flood concerns from the federal government which subsequen tly has contributed efforts to reduce the citys flood vulnerability beginning in 1987 congress authorized and appropriated funds for several studies by the us army corps of engin eers corps to investigate flood protection in the sacramento area thes studies showed that the citys flood damage reduction system provided less than 100year flood pr otection ie greater than 1 annual chance of flooding the st udies suggested number of options to augment flood protection including improvements to local levees various changes and additions to the federally constructed folsom dam and dam upstream from folsom dam on the american river auburn dam since 1992 congress has authorized va riety of actions including improving levees and modifying folsom dam alt hough congress authorized plans to expand folsom dams capacity to regulate rger floods some planned activities have become problematic due to changes in cost estimates current studies are exploring additional potential options ddressing flood control in the area congress is likely to revisit issues relating to authorizati on cost and oversight of sacramento flood protection projects reconsideration of auburn dam on the american river also known as the auburnfolsom south unit or another dam near the auburn site also may be debated in addition to structural changes at fo lsom dam congress also has authorized and implemented dam operational changes some actions to rehabilitate and improve levees on the american nd sacramento rivers are currently under construction others have been delayed nd are

san francisco bay in california at the confluence of the american and sacramento rivers the citys1 location puts it among the us cities most vulnerable to significant flooding potential flood losses grow as development in the area places more lives and properties in harms way as illustrated by disasters lik hurricane katrina flood damage reduction infrastructure cannot protect all areas control all floods and be completely reliable to reduce flooding risks in sacramento cal state and fede ral entities have built dams levees and other structures includi ng the federally cons tructed folsom dam on the american river these entities currently are studying and pursuing ways to improve the reliability capacity and operations of the existing infrastructure as well as construction activities to modify and build flood dama ge reduction infrastructure whether and how to combine nonstructural methods eg building restrictions and codes insurance premiums and structural methods eg levee strengthening dam modification new dam construc tion for managing flood risks is the subject of some dispute among stakeholders following significant flood threat in 1986 congress in 1987 authorized the us army corps of engineers corps to study additional flood damage reduction measures eg dam and levee improveme nts construction of new structures adoption of operational impr ovements since then congress has authorized and appropriated funding for studi and construction of sp ecific flood damage reduction measures this report outlines the status of these studies and measures with particular attention to measures at folsom dam2 historical efforts to reduce flood vulnerability sacramento has historically been prone to flooding as shown in figure 1 the american river descends the sierra nevada crest from the northeast down to the city of sacramento where it meets the largest river in california the sacramento river on occasion warm and wet west coast stor m patterns deliver rain in the nearby mountains which can create very large flows on the american river the american river water thenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33682crs2 3 as part of the central valley project dams provide hydroelectricity irrigation and continuedcombines with the formidable flows of th sacramento river producing high flood threat to the greater sacramento area sacramento historically suffered significant damage during these storms soon after th citys founding in 1839 local efforts were undertaken to reduce the citys flood damages complex t of levees dams and related facilities were built near and within the city on both the sacramento and american rivers levees were built to keep flood waters c onfined to the river and out of the floodplain where the city is located figure 1 shows levees lining both sides of the american river from its intersection with the sacramento river upstream for 17 miles levees also completely surround the natomas basin historically agricultural area just north of sacramento and east of the sacramento river these levees work in combination with folsom dam which operates to capture flood waters and for other purposes eg hydropower irrigation and municpal industrial uses congress authorized c onstruction of folsom dam 29 miles northeast of sacramento at the confluence of the north and south forks of the american river shown in figure 1 in the flood control act of 1944 pl 78534 the corps completed construction of the 340foot hi gh structure in 1956 the dam was designed to regulate floodwaters by capturing h eavy inflows from the upper

site and substantial distribution facilities commonly known as the auburnfolsom sout h unit were authorized in 1965 pl 89161 although the primary purpose of the dam as authorized was to provide new and supplemental water supply for irriga tion and municipal nd industrial needs another longsought purpose of the project was to provide flood c ontrol benefits for the lower american river constructi on on the dam began in 1965 and was halted in 1975 due to seismic safety concerns some stakeholders continue to promote discussion of dam at the auburn site as an attractive alternative for managing

understanding of flood risk sacramento is facing problem confronting communities nationwide as they update their flood hazard maps for the national flood insurance program local agencies responsible for flood control have to demonstrate that their protection meets the 1 threshold ie greater than 1 annual probability of flood the 1 standard is used for imposing building restrictions and insurance requirements under the nati onal flood insurance program sacramentos flood risk s been periodically reeval uated as understanding and factors affecting its components change fl ood risk is the composite of three factors threat of an event eg probability of flood flows of different sizes affecting the region consequence of an event eg property damage loss of life economic loss environm ental damage reduced health and safety and vulnerability that allows threat to cause consequences eg levelof protection provided by levees and dams and their reliability 4 in designing folsom dam and other flood control projects to reduce sacramentos vulnerability to flooding corps engineers used historic rainfall records river flows runoff data land use information and sta tistical tools available at the time the initial design of folsom dam was for dam with levees to protect against the threat of the largest documented flood in the wa tershed which at the time was the flood of 1862 that design was soon adjusted to protect against higher threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33682crs4 5 for discussion of risk analysis nd flooding see national research council risk analysis and uncertainty in flood

ca march 1996 unless otherwis indicated costs in this report have not been adjusted for inflation large storms in 1955 1964 1986 and 1996 pr oduced rainfall in excess of any previous storm on record for the regi on the floods in 1950 and 1955 and additional analysis following construction suggested th at the dam and levees would provide less protection than originally estimated in 1961 the corps wered its estimate of the citys protection level to protection from 120year event ie storm creating floodwaters that have 083 nnual probability of occurring5 then in 1986 and again in 1996 the vol ume of flood waters came within 90 of folsom dams flood operation capacity the 1986 storm produced record inflows into folsom dams reservoi r resulting in dam operators releasing floodwaters into the american river at rate exceeding 115000 cfs cubic feet per second which is the safe conveyance capacity for outfl ow on the rivers channel below the dam portions of the city were nearly flooded as the ameri can river came within inches of overtopping the levees major disaster for threatened areas was avoided only by abating storm conditions subsequent national research c ouncil report concluded that operational carelessness led to errors in dam operation during the 1986 flood that contributed to the flood threat that the city was exposed to6 recent studies using more comprehensiv picture of the citys flood risk place the citys flood protection at less than th 100year level ie greater than 1 annual probability of flood aff ecting the city this re vised estimate of protection is based on an improved unders tanding of the citys vulne rability that considers both the level of protection provided by levees and dams and the reliability of those structures in particular decreased confidence in levee reliability contributes to higher flood vulnerability estimates ie lower estimates of the level of flood protection confidence that levees can perform up to their full design capacity has decreased in the wake of levee failures in the region and weaknesses using current standards identified in vee construction and foundations some observers raise additional concerns about the citys level of protection they note that storm and climate vari ability as well as r unoff patterns that can result from land use changes such as conversion of agricultural land to residential and ur ban land uses may contribute to higher flood thr eat than is currently assumed large storms could have particular ly catastrophic impact on sacramento decadeold estimate of damages from an over 500000 cfs peak inflow into folsom dam reservoir 400year fl ood or 025 modeled annual likelihood indicated that sacramento would suffer 16 billion in residential commercial i ndustrial and public property damage in addition to the disr uption of government and transportation networks and the loss of lives7 recent growth in the sacramento area may increase flooding damages

formed partnership to find ways to reduce flood vulnerability and losse s since 1992 congress has authorized construction of physical modification pr ojects to improve flood protection around sacramento and folsom dam including 1 the common features project that consists of levee improvements on the american and sacramento rivers 2 the folsom dam modification that entails changes to the flood gates and spillway of folsom dam and 3 the folsom dam raise that elevates the concrete and earth portions of the dam provides for the c onstruction of permanent bridge and authorizes other related measures8 construction of the common features the dam modifications and the dam raise as cu rrently planned would raise the flood protection for sacramento to 1 in 233 year flood 04 annual chance of flooding these projects would improve levee reliability and permit higher releases from folsom dam the nonfederal partners for these projects are the state of california and the sacramento ar ea flood control agency it should also be noted that congress s authorized severa l operational changes to folsom dam including forecastbased operations and variable storage re operation is important in achieving the shared goals of the federal state and local partners forecastbased operations author ized in the department of defense appropriations act of fy1993 pl 102396 allow for the

cfs of flow from the dam the continuedthe corps resulting 1991 feasibility report10 analyzed six flood protection options designed to protect the region from flood levels produced by 100 to 400 year events the report recommended building 508foot dry dam on the american river at auburn ca dry dam is dam built for use only in flood the auburn dam that was halted in 1975 was not dry dete ntion dam but multipurpose facility with permanent reservoir the administrati on did not support the corps proposal and congress instead authorized construction of levee improvements in the natomas basin in 1993 congress also requested dditional information on flood prevention alternatives in supplemental report11 the resulting corps 1996 supplemental report12 identified three separate plans for greater flood protection in the sacramento region 1 the folsom modification plan 2 the stepped release plan and 3 the detention dam plan at the auburn site the first two plans modified folsom dams release and storage capacity while the third plan called for dry dam at the auburn site while the folsom dam alternatives had lower federa l costs than the auburn site alternative their estimated flood damage reduction benefits were lower because they would provide lower flood protection levels than detention dam at the auburn site estimates at the time indicated that the folsom modification pl an would provide 180year flood protection 055 chance of flooding annually and th stepped release plan would provide 250year protection 04 chance the tention dam at the auburn site was estimated to provide 400year protection 025 chance13 common features recognizing the contentious nature of the three proposed plans congress approved in 101 of the water resources development act wrda of 1996 pl 104303 basic set of levee improvements on the american and sacramento rivers that were common to all three plans congress subsequently authorized several miles of additional levee improvements as well as an increase in the federal funding cap in 366 of wrda 1999 pl 10653 figure 1 shows the location of the levee improvements relative to existing levees together the 1996 and 1999 wrda levee improvements became known as the common features project these improvements prima rily consisted of constructing cutoff walls14 to increase the reliability of the flood protection structures in the sacramento area

the preconstruction engineering and design stage elements of the plan could be delayed pending on the status of the dam modification plan currently design of the dam raise is scheduled to take place through 2011 with construction occurring from 2011 to 201724 notably the folsom bridge component of the project is pr ogressing on an expedited schedule due to traffic congestion and the need for connection to replace the old road over folsom dam which has been closed since 2003 becau of security concerns the estimated construction schedule for the bridge shows completion by december 2008 other considerations ongoing problems with currently authorized projects have led to the consideration of seve ral other options relating to fo lsom dam and flood control for sacramento while it is unclear whether congress will consider any of the projects in this section for authorization recent velopments suggest that they may be part of the congressional bate in the future proposed auxiliary spillway the aforementioned revisions to cost estimates for the authorized dam modifications presented the corps with several problems which it is attempting to address the normal process precipitated by the cost revisions would involve reevaluation report whic h generally takes three to five years to complete before final postauthorization ch ange report could be presented to congress this would have si gnificantly delayed c onstruction of the dam modifications25 therefore instead of conducting the reevaluation report the corps decided in the fall of 2005 to jointly evalua with the bureau of

sacramento ca june 2006 concluding remarks how to reduce flood risks in developed nd developing areas is problem being faced by communities nationwide and is receiving increased attention as the reliability of existing infrastructure is reevaluated in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the last half century the dam nd levee system around sacramento has proved crucial in prot ecting the city from flooding the folsom dam is an important component in this flood protection recently the federal government has authorized three major flood protection improvement pr ojects in the sacram ento area these include improvements to folsom dams operational rules improvements to the american and sacramento rivers and natomas basin levees as well as modifications to folsom dams flood ga tes and raise of the dam itself some of the federally authorized impr ovements involving fo rtification of the american and sacramento river levees are under cons truction or completed while others are undergoing reev aluation other plans whic h would increase the capacity and flow levels at folsom dam and improve its ability to provide flood protection remain in the preconstruc tion engineering and design stage and have encountered setbacks to construction because of high cost estimates recent plan jointly authored by the corps and the bureau suggests that an auxiliary spillway to the south of folsom dam could achieve the objectives of prior authorizations on an enhanced timetable and at reduced cost but this op tion has not yet been officially endorsed by the corps revised course of action will be suggested in the corps pac report figure 5 potential auxiliary spillwayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33682crs14 due in december 2006 additional congressi onal authorization may be required if congress chooses to adopt the auxiliary spillway alternative issues for congress include whether and if so how to modify authorization and appropriations for imp rovements to the management of floodwaters at folsom dam and in the american river basin in reconsidering these congress has range of options for example it may consider less expensive alternatives to current projects such as the auxiliary spillway or undertake full review of sacr amento flood control policy including unauthorized lternatives such as auburn dam
