appropriate while it is not directive issued by the president federal preparedness circular 65 identifies presidential decision directive pdd 67 as the authority establishing fema as the lead agency for executive branch coop activities eo 12656 assignment of emergency preparedness responsibilities eo 12656 was issued by president ronald reagan on november 23 19887 it assigns national security emergency preparedness responsibilities to federal departments and agencies subject to policy established by the president eo12656 defines national security emergency as any occurrence including natural disaster military attack technological emergency or other emergency that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the united states8 although the order does not explicitly refer to continuity of operations it specifies preparedness functions and activities to include the development of policies plans procedures and readiness measures that enhance the ability of the federal government to mobilize for respond to and recover from national security emergency eo 12656 designates the nsc as the principal forum for consideration of national security emergency preparedness policy the order requires the director of the federal emergency management agency fema to serve as an advisor to the national security council on issues of national security emergency

policy concepts enduring constitutional government ecg continuity of government cog and coop ecg is described as cooperative effort among the executive legislative and judicial branches of government coordinated by the president to preserve the capability to execute constitutional responsibilities in catastrophic emergency the fact sheet describes cog as coordinated effort within each branch to ensure the capability to continue its minimum essential responsibilities in catastrophic emergency to relocate essential personnel and functions to alternate work sites and to reasonably sustain the performance of minimum essential functions at the alternate work site until normal operations can be resumed the pdd 67 fact sheet indicates that cog is dependent on effective coop plans and capabilities coop is described in fact sheet as an internal effort within individual components of the executive legislative and judicial branches of government to assure the capability exists to continue operations in response to wide range of potential emergencies including localized acts of nature accidents and technological andor attackrelated emergencies the pdd 67 fact sheet notes that all executive branch departments and agencies including those within the executive office of the president eop are to establish viable coop capability such capability would provide continuity program that ensures the emergency delegation of authority where permissible and in accordance with applicable law the safekeeping of vital resources facilities and records the improvisation or emergency acquisition of the resources necessary for business resumption and the capability to perform work at alternate work sites until normal operations can be resumed eo 13286 amendment of executive orders

continuity of operations coop federal preparedness circular fpc 65 issued by fema on june 15 2004 identifies pdd67 as the authority establishing fema as the as the lead agency for federal executive branch coop11 according to the circular this authority was transferred to the department of homeland security dhs on march 1 2003 and then delegated to the emergency preparedness and response directorate fema femas office of national security coordination onsc has been designated as the departments lead agent for the executive branch coop program fpc 65 describes femas responsibilities to include formulating guidance and establishing common standards for executive branch agencies to use in developing viable executable coop plans facilitating interagency coordination and overseeing and assessing the status of coop capabilities in executive branch agencies the circular notes that each executive branch agency is responsible for appointing senior federal government executive as an emergency coordinator to serve as the program manager and agency point of contact for coordinating agency coop activities which include planning programming and budgeting for viable and executable coop program that conforms to fema guidance the circular does not appear to carry authority for fema to compel action by other executive branch agencies issues of possible concern for congress the authorities governing executive coop planning raise several issues that might be examined by congress these include the capacity of existing executive authorities to effectively govern coop planning and the implementation of such plans authorities governing coop activities eo 12656 pdd 67 and eo 13286 have been issued by three different presidential administrations some observers suggested that each policy directive was issued at different times in response to disparate threat conditions for example eo 12656 is continuation of cold war era contingency policies that assume nuclear confrontation with single state the former soviet union continuity planning assumption from this era is the potential for decapitating strike on the national leadership including the president cabinet and congressional leaders by contrast observers note that when pdd 67 and eo 13286 were issued the threat environment was evolving from single state model to one characterized by the advent of threat from hostile states and loose organizations of nonstate actors with the capacity to launch small scale attacks using nontraditional weapons such attacks may not disrupt senior leadership in its entirety but have the potential to impair the operations of key government functions and programs the pdd 67 fact 11 department of homeland security federal emergency management agency office of national security coordination federal preparedness circular 65 federal executive branch continuity of operations coop june 15 2004 available at httpwwwfemagovonscdocsfpc_65pdf visited feb 1 2005 crs6 sheet as well as guidance issued by fema in federal preparedness circular 65 recognize the enhanced threat of potential attack by hostile states or terrorists as well as hazards occasioned by potential natural and technological disasters document that defines the potential threat environment and that legally compels executive agencies to prepare plans to withstand such incursions however is not evident moreover it is not clear from publicly available documents what legal authority exists to implement coop plans eo 13286 is silent on the matter section 102 b of eo 12656 notes explicitly that the order does not authorize the implementation of coop plans and that any such plans may be executed only in the event that such execution is authorized in law12 the pdd 67 fact sheet notes that with warning the national security council process shall be used to reach deliberate decisions regarding the alerting or activation of governmentwide coop and cog plans and capabilities the fact sheet does not however identify the legal authority under which such process could be initiated or by which coop plans could be activated observers of presidential powers and authorities suggest that such an authorization could be found in broad national emergency powers that have been exercised by the president in times of crisis typically national emergency powers have been invoked in response to threats of the loss of life property or public order13 following the attacks on washington and new york on september 11 2001 federal government cog and coop plans were reportedly activated14 it does not appear however that declarations of emergency pursuant to the national emergencies act15 would necessarily actuate statutory provisions granting the president the authority to activate coop plans in response to threats or attack against government or detailing the ability of the executive branch to carry out its statutory missions and programs16 finally experts in public administration and management might suggest that the attenuated stream of authorities governing executive branch coop planning could lead to confusion regarding which agencies of the executive branch oversee planning activities eo 13286 requires that the director of fema and the heads of departments and agencies must ensure that their preparedness plans and activities are consistent with current presidential guidelines and policies under eo 12656 the nsc was responsible for establishing guidelines and policies following the creation of the homeland security council it appears that while the nsc retains broad national security responsibilities including those related to coop as specified in 12 53 fr 47492 13 see harold c relyea emergency powers in katy j harriger ed separation of powers

now are overseen primarily by the hsc notably guidelines related to essential coop functions described below have recently been approved by homeland security council staff the council has communicated those guidelines directly to executive departments and agencies18 and through fema publicly identifiable document explicitly vesting the council with such authority over coop planing has been identified the sensitive nature of government contingency planning likely precludes public discussion of the criteria for implementing coop plans enactment of statutory authority to establish an entity to oversee and implement such plans however might address concerns regarding the apparent lack of clear authority to activate such plans any such authority would likely vest the lead executive branch entity with overall programmatic responsibility further any such authority would likely be carried out in timely manner appropriate to the threat environment finally implementing authority could be publicly available through access to an executive order or statute congress might opt to consider legislative options to establish clear authorities for the formulation management and implementation of executive branch coop planning essential coop functions coop planners suggest that identification and prioritization of essential functions is prerequisite for coop because such an effort establishes the planning parameters that drive an agencys efforts in all other planning and preparedness areas essential functions are those that the executive branch agencies must be able to perform without significant interruption homeland security council guidance mandates the development of procedures that must be in place to enable each function to be performed regardless of the disruption that is occurring or has occurred19 if coop plans are activated continuous performance of essential functions should enable agencies to provide vital services exercise civil authority

national essential functions would be the primary concern of the president and the national leadership priority mission essential functions would comprise those department and agency activities that directly support national essential functions secondary mission essential functions responsibilities lie in departments and agencies depending on the nature and duration of the event some secondary functions would generally support agency primary mission essential functions while others could support some national essential functions national essential functions the homeland security council defines national essential functions as those necessary to lead and sustain the country during an emergency and that must be supported through department and agency continuity capabilities these functions are expected to be the primary focus of the president and the national leadership during and following an emergency national essential functions might be performed by one or more department or agency and are not new authorities requirements or functions but those that are routinely carried out during normal operating conditions the homeland security council identifies eight national essential functions that must be supported throughout an operational interruption20 these include the capacity to preserve the constitutional form of government department and agency functions should include activities that respect and implement checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government an example is the preservation of essential communications between the executive legislative and judicial branches of government during an incident provide leadership visible to the nation and the world and to maintain the trust and confidence of the american people executive branch departments and agencies are expected to demonstrate that the federal government is viable functioning and effectively addressing the emergency activities in support of this function could include communicating with the american people and providing information to state and local governments or communicating with foreign leaders defend the country against all enemies foreign or domestic and to prevent or interdict future attacks in addition to the protection and defense of the worldwide interests of the united states against foreign or domestic enemies departments and agencies are to honor security agreements and treaties with allies and maintain military readiness and preparedness in furtherance of national interests and objectives maintain and foster effective relationships with foreign nations departments and agencies are responsible for ensuring the ability of the federal government to communicate and interact with foreign 20 national essential functions definitions and examples are based on homeland security council background paper on essential functions concept and implementation crs9 governments share intelligence and identify threats in cooperation with foreign governments and bring to justice perpetrators of crimes or attacks against the united states its citizens or interests examples identified by the homeland security council include maintaining the security of the nations borders against unlawful or hostile entry ensuring the safety of commercial transportation and conducting law enforcement investigations of federal crimes provide rapid and effective response to and recovery from the domestic consequences of an attack or other incident in the event of an incident departments and agencies are to implement response and recovery plans including but not limited to the national response plan nrp21 agency actions could include the collection and dissemination of incident and threat related information or the provision of medical care to populations affected by the attack or incident protect and stabilize the nations economy and to ensure confidence in financial systems it is essential that department and agency functions minimize the economic consequences of an attack or other incident both nationally or internationally relevant executive branch department or agency activities could include coordinating the reopening of financial markets or facilitating the movement of goods and services across borders to support economic activity provide for critical federal government services that address the health safety and welfare needs of the nation22 the activities of departments and agencies must ensure that the critical national needs of the nation are met during an emergency examples could include maintenance of the safety and efficiency of the nations food supply air traffic continuance or the provision of timely and accurate severe storm warning information to the public priority mission essential functions unlike the national essential functions priority mission essential functions are to be identified by departments and agencies respectively the guidance provided by the homeland security council directs that primary mission essential functions must be performed to support or implement national essential functions before during and 21 according to the department of homeland secuirty the national response plan mandated by 6 usc 312 6 establishes comprehensive allhazards approach to enhance the ability of the united states to manage domestic incidents the national response plan is

of the federal government with national level consequence it not does apply to general wellbeing and welfare of the nation crs10 in the immediate aftermath of an emergency generally these functions are to be uninterrupted or resumed during the first 2448 hours after the occurrence of an emergency and continued through full resumption of all government activities23 each executive branch department and agency is responsible for identifying its priority mission essential functions based on the eight national functions describing those functions succinctly determining the associated national essential functions for each establishing minimum time period for performing the function during an emergency and identifying other departments and agencies upon which they depend in order to perform their functions secondary mission essential functions those activities that department or agency determines must be performed in order to bring about full resumption of its normal functions but that are not primary mission essential functions are defined as secondary mission essential functions according to homeland security council guidelines resumption of secondary functions may need to occur within very short period of time or only after several days depending on the nature of the agency mission and the nature of the disruption to normal agency functions as with priority mission essential functions secondary mission essential functions are identified by each executive branch department or agency they are to be used within their respective organizations for continuity and related planning agencyidentified secondary functions will not be collected reviewed or approved at the national level24 defining essential functions of executive branch departments and agencies in federal preparedness circular 65 fema states that the identification and prioritization of essential functions is prerequisite for coop because it establishes the planning parameters that drive the agencys efforts in all other planning and preparedness areas25 the homeland security council has provided guidance on identifying sources of executive branch department and agencyessential functions and has provided several examples of resources that agencies might use to identify their primary and secondarymission essential functions26 these include the following 23 primary mission essential

agencies related to coop planning executive branch coop budgeting the current budgetary environment is characterized by limited resources coupled with an increased demand for variety of homeland security protective measures including executive branch coop planning homeland security council and fema staff have suggested that as consequence of the multidisciplinary nature of coop planning executive branch agency expenditures for coop activities are sometimes spread across several departmental or agency accounts and data are not readily available to demonstrate agency coop funding levels on august 6 2004 omb issued budget data request33 that requires executive branch departments and agencies to submit summary table for coop programs that includes the department or agency name account title and number activity and budget authority for the enacted and request levels as appropriate in addition departments and agencies are required to submit narrative background summary of their coop plan and activities as well as an explanation of how the plan and resources committed to it adequately support established coop standards omb has announced that it will review agency coop program budget submissions as part of the fy2006 budget process in conjunction with the homeland security council34 potential consequence of this data gathering is that congress might consider specific coop program expenditures in the fy2006 authorization and appropriations cycles relatedly congress might request the congressional budget office to prepare and analyze data similar to that specified in the budget data request possible effect of the acquisition of technology infrastructure and supplies to be held in reserve for use in an emergency is the likelihood that such an allocation might reduce resources available for routine operations to the extent that coop facilities and infrastructure are integrated into daily agency operations this matter might be less salient access to specific coop program expenditure data might provide congress with tools to determine the utility of executive branch coop programs and their integration into routine agency activities 33 generally omb uses budget data requests to identify budgetary and management information related to the programs and functions for which departments and agencies are responsible according to omb the

government accountability office gao formerly named the general accounting office in february 2004 found that some agencies had created coop plans that did not include all of the elements of viable plan as defined by previous versions of federal preparedness circular 6535 consequently gao concluded that agency efforts to provide services during an emergency could be impaired additionally gao found that fema did not provide specific criteria through fpc 65 for identifying essential functions or address interdependencies between agencies review the essential functions identified in its assessments of coop planning or follow up with agencies to determine whether they addressed previously identified weaknesses or conduct tests or exercises that could confirm that the identified essential functions were correct during the 108th congress the house committee on government reform held an oversight hearing on the gao report36 in response to questions from members gao representative suggested that the plans departments and agencies had in place at the time of the study were not fully compliant with the requirements of federal preparedness circular 65 consequently gao concluded that there is assurance that executive branch departments and agencies are prepared for an emergency37 in his opening statement to the committee michael d brown under secretary for emergency preparedness and response department of homeland security acknowledged that fema was designated the lead agency to provide guidance and assistance to the other federal departments and agencies for coop by presidential guidance38 the under secretary also noted that fema guidance requires executive branch departments and agencies to develop coop plans to support their essential

october 1 2002 and were evaluated on the basis of an earlier version of fpc 65 issued in july 1999 some executive branch coop planners suggest that the report failed to take into consideration ongoing changes made to the executive branch coop program moreover these observers suggest that gao failed to acknowledge that femas advisory role is accompanied by little or authority to compel action by other executive branch agencies since the release of the gao report the department of homeland security has sponsored forward challenge 04 fullscale interagency coop exercise in the spring of 2004 the exercise was designed to involve all federal executive branch departments and agencies it afforded the participants an opportunity to execute alert and notification procedures establish operational capability at agency alternate facilities implement agency succession plans and delegations of authority test interoperable communications capabilities and test procedures for receiving processing analyzing and disseminating information from internal agency assets and from external entities40 an afteraction report on the exercise issued by fema in august 2004 reported that 45 agencies encompassing more than 300 subentities mobilized to their alternate coop locations or other designated sites to test the continuation of essential government services during national security emergency approximately 3500 4000 staff from participating agencies took part in the exercise which required them to move to more than 100 alternate site locations the fema report concluded that the executive branch had demonstrated its capability to alert and notify departments and agencies in the national capital region of coop event fema found that the exercise improved overall readiness increased awareness by senior leadership of succession plans and their responsibilities and prepared departments and agencies to provide essential services in the event of an emergency or disaster

effectiveness of resulting plans might still be salient congressional committee jurisdiction government operations in the executive branch are generally overseen by the house committee on government reform and the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs in the 109th congress the house committee has jurisdiction over government management measures including the management of government operations and activities43 which would appear to give it role in coop oversight across the executive branch at the start of the 109th congress the house converted the select committee on homeland security into standing committee and transferred some but not all related legislative jurisdiction to it from other standing committees the house committee on homeland security has both oversight and legislative responsibility regarding the department of homeland security including domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism as well as broad oversight authority over governmentwide homeland security matters44 in the senate the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs has jurisdiction over matters relating to the department of homeland security with certain limitations45 as well as organization and reorganization of the executive branch of the government46 this would appear to give both panels some governmentwide role in overseeing the guidance and implementation of coop planning related to potential interruptions due to attack or other incursion different approaches to homeland security in the house and senate have resulted in different committees having different jurisdictions and internal structures the senate pursuant to sres 445 of the 108th congress directed its appropriations committee to reorganize its subcommittees to accommodate the creation of the department of homeland security what action the senate panel will take and whether the house committee on appropriations takes similar action is not yet clear ongoing bicameral coordination of congressional legislative oversight and investigative roles over homeland security might affect congressional attention to coop activities in the 109th congress also the potential publication of coop expenditures by omb in annual budget proposals might encourage authorizing 42 see section on fema guidance and essential coop functions above 43 house rule x h 44 house rule x i d 45 crs report rs21955 sres 445 senate committee reorganization for homeland security and intelligence matters by paul s rundquist and christopher m davis the limitations do not appear to prevent the committee from exercising jurisdiction over executive branch coop programs 46 senate rule xxv 1 k 1 10 crs16 committees and appropriations subcommittees to provide more oversight of coop activities in the departments and agencies they oversee issue immediacy as the memory of dramatic disruptions such as the september 11 2001 attacks and biological agent incidents fade attention to administrative operations like coop planning may receive lower priority attention from agency planners emergency preparedness observers note that the success of contingency planning is dependent on current planning and regular drills simulations or other testing prior to the attacks executive branch coop management by the national security council and fema and guidance for other executive branch agencies were all in place and that guidance included requirements for agencywide staff education as well as the testing and drilling of coop plans nevertheless on september 11 2001 some federal employees reportedly were unaware of these plans and some agencies found they had way of accounting for or communicating with evacuated staff the apparent disparity between the level of planning by senior officials and the level of readiness and awareness by line managers and agency lead some observers to maintain that continual drills and educational awareness efforts will be necessary to achieve and maintain an appropriate degree of coop capability the current relatively low state of alert could offer an opportunity to test readiness during non crisis situation congress might elect to prevent miscommunications that occurred in september 2001 in future events by conducting oversight and exploring potential legislative options to establish such training related crs products
