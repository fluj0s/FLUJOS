states if the projections for the ear 2010 presage the actual census 10 seats will shift affecting total of 15 states crs experience with prior census bureau population projections suggests however they are an imperfect predictor of actual number of representatives states will be granted after census although the bureau of the census estima tes the population for each state annually statelevel population projections are usually issued once each decade on april 21 2005 the bureau released proj ected state populations for th year 2010 if the house of representatives were to be reapportioned based on these projected numbers 10 seats would shift among 15 states from the offici apportionment following the 2000 census arizona california georgia nevada and ut ah would each gain one seat florida would gain two seats and texas would gain three seats the following states would lose one seat alabama illinois iowa massachusetts missouri and pennsylvania new york and ohio would lose two seats if these projections prove to be accurate caveats the official apportionment based on the 2010 census will probably differ from the trial apportionment based on the projections this is becau population projections are of uncertain accuracy first projections for large geographic units are more likely to be accurate than those for smaller units thus projection of th total us population is likely to be more accurate than one for an individual state also adding or subtracting small number ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22124crs2 2 us bureau of the census population projections for states by age sex race and hispanic origin 1993 to 2020 current population reports p 251111 washington 1994 the projections suggested that arizona would have received seven seats instead of eight it actually received other states would have changed as follows if the projections had been used to apportion seats rather than the actual census re sults california would have received 55 seats rather than 53

allocates representatives among the statespeople from states population can make difference in whethe r or not seat is assigned to that state second the assumptions that underlie the proj ections and that can have significant effect on the resulting apporti onment estimates may prove to be erroneous for example the 1983 population projection for california for 1990 was 27525600 compared to 29839250 in the actual 1990 census count th 1983 projection suggested fourseat gain but the 1990 numbers resulted in seve nseat increase of representatives for california furthermore the census bureau population projections for 2000 were imperfect predictors of the actual reapportionment of the h ouse of representatives ten states had different totals of representatives after the census than had been expected based on the population projections2 third population projections ar not directly comparable to census figures for example following the practice of the annual population estimate s projections are computed for july 1 of the projection year whereas the census is taken on april 1 of each year ending in zero thus the date used fo r the projection is three months later than the 2000 census fourth further complicating factor in using projections to compute prospective apportionments concerns the status of fe deral employees who are stationed abroad chiefly military personnel and their depe ndents totaling 574330 persons in 2000 in 2000 the census bureau included these people in the populations used to reapportion the house3 the projections used to calculate the prospective apportionmen t in this report are not adjusted to account for fede ral employees stationed abroad nevertheless as imperfect as population projections are they provide rough basis for estimating what representation in the h ouse may be after the next reapportionment tables table 1 sets out the state populations used to reapportion the house of representatives after the 2000 census the april 1 2000

would require new law setting different limit article 1 section 2 of the constitution establishes minimum house size one representative for each state and maximum house size one for every 30000 or 9380 based on the 2000 census an increase of the size of the house to 473 would have resulted in states losing seats they held from the 103rd to the 107th congresses those states retaining seats through an increase in the house size would not have been able to retain their pre2000 census proportional share of house seats because othe r states would also have their delegations become larger at house size of 473 calif ornias delegation size for example would have been 57 instead of 53 seats6
