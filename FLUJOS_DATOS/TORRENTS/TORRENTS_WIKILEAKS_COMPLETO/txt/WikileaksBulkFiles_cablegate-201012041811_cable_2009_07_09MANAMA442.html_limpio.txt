for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary in july 22 meeting with assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs ambassador alexander vershbow and the us ambassador to bahrain adam ereli king hamad of bahrain was unwavering in his support for united states policies in the gulf welcomed any new requests the us may need from bahrain voiced strong support for us actions in afghanistan and iraq and said he was ready to play positive role toward israel however he voiced strong annoyance at qatari behavior particularly the recent visit of qatars chief of staff of its armed forces to iran as well as qatari rebuffs to bahraini requests for natural gas end summary 2 c king hamad warmly welcomed ambassadors vershbow and ereli and began the meeting by thanking the united states for the staunch support we provide bahrain he reminded the ambassadors that bahrain is longtime us ally remains firm in its support of us efforts in the gulf and greatly values our bilateral relationship that is of significant importance to bahrains interests he said bahrain will do anything to work together with the us he was particularly praiseworthy of the bilateral defense relationship commenting that the superb advice bahrains defense forces bdf receive from the us has resulted in the bdf being one of the cleanest organizations in bahrains government the king also noted that the equipment received through the foreign military financing fmf process was of high quality and operationally effective and he was also proud of the strong relations established with us 5th fleet 3 c ambassador vershbow thanked his majesty for hosting the military consultative committee that was currently meeting in manama and for his countrys support to us interests he noted that the usbahraini relationship was very strong and mutually beneficial and affirmed to the king that the us and bahrain shared similar vision in the region despite its many challenges afghanistan and iraq 4 c turning to afghanistan and iraq king hamad said the upcoming deployment of bahrains ministry of interior moi security unit to provide fixed site security in afghanistan would provide great experience to moi personnel and allows bahrain to show its flag and demonstrate support for the coalition he stated that us involvement in afghanistan provided golden opportunity for the afghan people to build their countrys security forces as well as their education medical science and trade programs and ministries the king added that us efforts should be touted more in the media he quoted president eisenhower saying the us is soldiering for peace and not waging war and he understood that the us was not seeking to rule over afghanistan or iraq he is convinced that the us is in both places to help the afghan and iraqi people and he was appreciative of our armed forces personnel performing their duties in places so far from home king hamad noted some instability in iraq but thought overall iraq was on positive slope asd vershbow thanked the king for his comments and said it was important that the world hears his as well as similar explanations of us policies in afghanistan and iraq 5 c commenting on bahrains participation in coalition maritime operations and efforts against terrorism and piracy king hamad said he had recently told his parliament that ships are sailing to defend the region and why dont we join them if we dont join we will miss an opportunity his remarks acknowledged bahrains past and current participation in combined task force ctf 152 and its anticipated participation in ctf 151 annoyed and concerned about qatar 6 c the king voiced concern about what is happening in the region and stated that he would like to see stronger gulf cooperation council gcc as deterrent against future threats and to provide more security in the region king hamad flatly stated that bahrain is not happy with qatar he took particular exception to the recent visit to iran by qatars chief of staff mg hamad attiyah he noted that during the visit the two sides released statement agreeing to joint training exercises intelligence exchange and manama 00000442 002 of 002 reciprocal visits of military staff and units this is going too far king hamad fumed its one thing to have trade and commercial exchanges he noted but to welcome iranian military units on the territory of gcc member state is strategic matter he went on to say that iran is the numberone threat in the region any country should be cautious about exchanging military information with iran and gcc country should allow an iranian military unit or personnel to land on its shores the king stated that he would like to show qatar some type of unhappiness for its actions with iran 7 c the king said it is rumored that mg alattiyah may retire as the qatari chod and perhaps this influenced his decision to visit iran note in separate meeting with asd vershbow and state pm assistant secretary shapiro during their july 2021 visit to doha mg alattiyah did state that his visit to iran was long planned but perhaps illtimed to coincide with recent postelection activities in tehran since it was previously planned he had not wanted to cancel his visit end note king hamad added that qatars behavior is an annoyance but it was too early to be angry at them king hamad went on saying he would like our brother in saudi arabia to send note telling qatar not to play like this 8 c asd vershbow affirmed us displeasure with iranian behavior particularly its nuclear program and stated the us would not tolerate iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons he told the king we were disappointed with the timing of the qatari chods visit but hoped the qataris could persuade iran to engage with the us to end its nuclear program rather than seeking confrontation with the international community plug for the crown prince 9 c asd vershbow said he appreciated the crown princes recent oped published on the middle east which he understood bore the kings stamp he said the crown princes points about arab countries seizing the opportunity at hand and setting aside past differences to move forward on the peace process was right on mark king hamad responded that bahrain supported usled efforts to make peace and agreed that the arab world needed to contribute positively to this effort returning to qatar king hamad noted that abdul bari atwan the editorinchief of the panarab daily quds arabi had written widelyread article critical of the crown princes oped qatar is major financial backer of quds arabi the king remarked and he clearly saw the hand of doha behind abdul baris attack continuing on this theme king hamad said there were two major issues that made him angry with regard to qatar the first was the iran issue the second was gas for years bahrain has been asking to buy qatari gas but their response has always been that qatar exports were maxed out and it was not prepared to enter into new supply contracts these rejections notwithstanding the king asserted that he had recently learned that qatar has inked new supply deal with mexico and will increase gas supplies to england he was at loss to understand qatari behavior on israel 10 c commenting on bahraini initiatives with israel king hamad said bahrain continues to do its best to make bahrains position clear to israel and the world and expressed thanks for president obamas recent detailed letter he was taking his time in drafting similarly detailed response and would share his response with ambassador ereli when it was ready king hamad said he looks forward to cooperating more with the us on key regional issues and specifically referenced the soon to be executed moves of p3 aircraft to isa air base and dods location of its forward near east south asia nesa center to manama asd vershbow and amb ereli thanked the king for his strong support for us policies and encouraged bahrain to continue its constructive behavior and leadership in the gulf 11
