substance generally recognized as safe gras under current and proposed fda rules two bills have been introduced in the 110th congress regarding the use of carbon monoxide in meat poultry products and seafood hr 3115 and hr 3610 the discussion draft of the food and drug administration globa lization act of 2008 issued by representatives dingell pallone and stupak similarly addresses the issue the bills and the discussion draft propose to amend section 201 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca under the proposals if co is used to treat meat poultry or seafood that is intended for hum an consumption and if the conditions of that use would affect the color of the produc ts co must be treated as color additive under ffdca unless the products label includes statement that is prominently and conspicuously placed to notify the consumer of the use of co and to warn the consumer of proper factors to judge the safety of th product the bills and the discussion draft would allow the secretary of health and human services hhs to establish alternative labeling requirements five years after the effective date of the labeling requirement if the secretary finds that the labeling requirement is longer necessary to prevent consumer deception th discussion draft contains an additional provision related to gras determinations that would require the secretary to publish in the federal register notice of receipt of request for substance to be determined by the secretary to be gras the secretary would then have 90 days after publication of the notice to determine whether the

industry some scientists and other supporters argue that map reduces shrinkage of the meat allows for longer shelf life keeps meat fresh protects meat and prevents crosscontamination because map packages are tamper resistant and leakproof7 one scientist believes that map offers better flavor greater tenderness and suppression of bacterial growth8 supporters of map also assert that such products are more stainable less wasteful and more flexible in terms of distribution because more packages can be transported per truck9 additionally they note that consumers prefer the bright red color of meat achieved in map10 finally map system supporters disput the scientific basis for claims that the use of carbon monoxide is misleading or dangerous and declare the consumers use sell by dates when determin ing the freshness of many products11 opponents allege that the use of co misl eads consumers into thinking meat and fish are fresher than they are that certa in populations such as those with reduced sense of smell will be at increased risk if they consume spoiled meat or fish that still appears fresh due to the use of co that consumers may eat undercooked meat because meat packed in map systems may brown faster when cooked than untreated meat that sell by dates are not adequate to assist consumers in determining freshness that consumers will be exposed to co that such map products are misbranded and adulte rated under the federal food dr ug and cosmetic act and that the fda is violating its own regulations on co12 another concern of consumer groups and some scientists is that co pr ovides cover for spoiled or temperature abused meat and fish meaning that th use of co conceals visual cues of decomposition caused in part by exposure to changes in

the f ood additive can be safely used20 gras substances must be generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate their safety21 fda regulations recognize the difficulty of establishing the harmlessness of substance and therefore define safety as reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under th intended conditions of use22 the person seeking gras status for substan ce has the burden of proving the substance is gras under conditions of the substances use23 determination that substance has

1958 and shown through either scientific procedures or experience based on common use in food to be safe under the conditions of their intended use30 fda regulations define the phrase common use in food as substantial history of consumption of substance for food use by significant number of consumers31 in this instance gras determination ordinarily turns on generally available data and

substances began in 1969 when questions arose about whether cyclamate sa lts substance that had been considered gras were safe because they were implicated in the formation of bladder tumors in rats38 the affirmation of gras status occurs through the notice and comment rulemaking process in which the commi ssioner publishes notice of the substance proposed to be affirm ed as gras in the federal register allows 60 days for comments evaluates the comments and th petition if one was filed and either 1 publishes notice in the federal register affirming the substance is gras if there is convincing evidence or 2 concl udes that there is lack of convincing evidence that the substance is gras and that it should be considered food additive subject to premarket pproval by the fda under

outlined in the proposed rule since 1998 without issuing final rule ce the fda has not issued final rule it is important to note that the fdas pro cedure set forth in the 1997 proposed rule is only guidance and not law the agency has also issued guidance for industry in the form of frequently asked questions about gras that includes discussion of the gras notification program53 more than 250 gras notifications have been submitted under the procedure outlined in the 1997 proposed rule the fda has issued one of the three responses describe d below for most of these notices and both

and the basis for the gras determination including summary of s upporting information that forms the basis for an exemption from statutory requirement55 the notifier explicitly accepts responsibility for the gras determinati on unlike the protocol in the current regulations in which such responsibility fa lls on the agency because an interested person has petitioned the fda to affirm use of substance as gras or the fda itself has affirmed substances use as gras56 rather than requiring that the fda affirm that substance is gras through noticeandcomment rulemaking the 1997 pr oposed rule provides that the fda does not make finding that substance in gras notification made under the proposed rule process actually is gras substance instead the agency states that 1 it has questions about

substance fda may question the gras status of use of substance if the information provided in notice 1 does not adequately establish technical evidence of safety 2 is not generally available 3 does not convince the agency that there is the requisite expert consensus about th safety of the substance for its intended use or 4 is so poorly presented that the basis for the gras determination is not clear fda also may be aware of inform ation that is not included in the notice but raises important public health issues that lead the agency to question gras status of use of the substance58 the fda notes that notifiers receive as benefit response that documents the agencys awareness of the gras determination by the notifier59 if as in the majority of the fdas re sponses to gras notification submissions the fda has questions about the notifi cation this determin ation does not mean that the fda has approved the substa nce in the notification as gras60 in other words none of the uses of the substan ces reviewed by the fda through gras notification are deemed to actually be gras by the fda61 moreover in contrast to the fdas gras affirmation regulations which allow the fda to place potential limits on the use of gras substance the gras notification procedures in the fdas proposed rule do not appear to llow this as the fda only responds in one of three ways noted above nonetheless an fda response of questions could give substance an imprimatur of safety from the federal government such response may also give manufacturers conf idence that the subs tance is acceptable and they would be able to tell their supplie rs and others of the fdas response to the notification additionally an fda re sponse of ques tions may convey to manufacturers feeling of less uncertainty and less pot ential liability about using such gras substance that has been thr ough the gras notification process as the agency may not be as likely to seize substance or find product adulterated or misbranded if the fda itself s said it has questions62 as mentioned above the agency has yet to issue final rule on the notification procedure however the fda has invited interested persons to submit such notifications as described in the proposed rule on an interim policy basis until thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34247crs10 63 62 fed reg 1895455 64 the fdas acceptance of gras

considered to be guidance document which is type of general statement of policy under the ad ministrative procedure act apa 5 usc 553b then the fda arguably would not need to complete the rulemaking because the notice and comment provisions of the apa would not apply see lubbers supra note 64 at 94 thus the agency would not appear to be violating the apa if the guidance document procedures are prospective and voluntary nd if the interim policy preserves the fdas discretion moreover the gras affirmation regulations are still law and may still be used by interested persons however completin g the rulemaking may clarify agency policy additionally although the apa does not impos limit on the time between an agencys publication of proposed rule and its issuan ce of final rule the 1997 proposed rule may be considered to be stale and new rule making may be necessary 5 usc 555b lubbers supra note 64 at 293 n 82 35758publication of the final rule63 the agency has accepted more than 250 notification submissions under the proposed rule procedures64 in its proposal the fda has stated that it will determine whether its experience in administering such notices suggests modifications to
