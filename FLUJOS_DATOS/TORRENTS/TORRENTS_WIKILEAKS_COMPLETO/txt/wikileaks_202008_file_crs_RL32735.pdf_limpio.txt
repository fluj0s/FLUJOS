context of the immigration and border security policies of the past particularly the us immigration reforms of 1986 and 1996 the in itiatives of the administrations of president william clinton and

legalization for undocumented migrants who already had long established ties to the united states the latter provision is often characterized as an amnesty because it permitted aliens living in the
