to save more how much individuals save will directly affect their future econo mic wellbeing but from macroeconomic perspective the source of saving be it households business or government makes difference this report presen ts standard economic analysis of the macroeconomic effects of raising saving an increase in saving means reduction in spending in the short run that is likely to result in slower economic growth than would otherwise have been the case when the saving rate rises demand for financial assets rises as well the increase in demand for assets puts upwar d pressure on their prices nd that results in decline in their yields and so interest rates fall the decline in interest rates sets in motion chain of events that tends to reduce the extent to which incomes might fall in response to an increase in the saving rate domestically lower interest rates reduce the cost of financing expenditures on durable goods as well as business fixed i nvestment and thus increase some private sector demand lower interest rates can also have an effect on the balance of trade decline in us interest rates relative to foreign rates is likely to reduce foreign purchases of us assets while an increase in saving may initially cause income to fall relative to what it otherwise would have been in time any decline in income is likely to be offset by rising investme nt demand and an increase in net exports if there is onetime permanent increase in the rate of investment each worker will have more capital with which to work and there will be onetime rise in the capitallabor ratio and thus onetime rise in labor produc tivity the onetime increase in labor productivity will temporarily raise the growth rate of output if financial capital flows easily between countries then even small decline in us interest rates would be likely to ve large influence on the demand for dollar denominated assets in that case the net outflow of capital from the us economy would minimize the decline in interest rates the smaller the decline in interest rates is the smaller any stimulus to domestic spending will be in that case more of the shortterm contractionary effect of an increas in saving would be offset by rising net exports than by increased domestic investment this report will be updated as warrantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112contents introduction 1 components of national

effects of raising national saving introduction just as individuals must decide how much of their income to save and how much to spend firms must decide how much of their profits to pay out as dividends and how much to reinvest and government must decide how much to tax and how much to spend collectively these choices determine our national rate of saving from macroeconomic perspective how ever the source of saving be it households business or gove rnment makes difference raising the share of income saved is frequent aim of public policy that may be particularly appare nt in debates about the size of the federal budget deficit but concerns about the low household saving ra have also prompted policymakers to consider ways to encourage individuals to save more one way to interpret the saving rate is as an expression of the collective importance of present versus future consum ption in other words those who tend to live for the present and discount the future are likely to save at lower rate than those for whom thrift is virtue and who hope to maintain their standard of living into retirement variations in the national saving rate can have substantial effects on the economy and those effects are quite di fferent depending on the time frame under consideration while saving more may have its benefits the immediate effect is decline in consumption this report examin what economics has to say about both the short and longrun effects of an incr ease in the national saving rate on economic growth components of national saving put most simply the saving rate refers to the share of total income that is not consumed saving and cons uming less than all of todays income makes it possible to consume more tomorrow than would otherwise be possible there are multiple sources of saving households or individuals save in order to maintain living standards into retirement and to insulate themselves from temporary variations in income due to changing economic conditions businesses save when they do not pay out all of their profits in the form of dividends as long as businesses are presented with profitable investment opportunities they will likely retain some earnings in orde r to take advantage of them the public sector can alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs2 1 for current estimates of saving rates see crs report rs21480 saving rates in the united states calculation and comparison by brian w cashell 2 for further discussion see crs report rl32119 can public policy raise the saving rate by brian w cashellbe source of domestic saving when tax revenues exceed public outlays government is net contributor of savi ng to the economy when revenues are insufficient to cover outlays the public sector dissaves in other words saving that might have gone for other uses goes to pay for current government spending together households businesses and gove rnment account for to tal national saving1 an increase in saving shortrun effects suppose policymakers decide that for wh atever reason the nation is not saving enough and enact legislation to raise the na tional saving rate that might take the form of reduction in the federal budget ficit or policy designed to encourage individuals to save more of their income2 what would be the immediate consequences for economic growth personal saving equals in come less consumption an increase in saving thus requires reduction in consum ption spending if the vel of consumption spending is what determines living standards then current living standards will fall if individuals consume less then the effect is direct if government saves more or dis saves less it will be due either to cut in outlays or an increase in taxes that means either individuals ve less income out of which to consume or government itself is spending less in either case an increase in saving means reduction in spending in the short run that is likely to result in slower economic growth than would otherwise have been the case to see that remember th at gross domestic product gdp is the sum of personal consumption spe nding investment spending government spending and net exports exports minus imports other things being equal in this elementary accounting framework reduction in either government or consumer spending will reduce gdp by an equal amount furthe r any reduction in spending would be reflected in incomes lower than they otherwise would be at least in the short term each dollar of spending represents in come for those who supply the goods and services being bought dollar less in sp ending means dollar less of income for those producers part of each dollar less in income would come out of spending and part would come out of saving suppose that each initial dollar decline in spending resulted in an additional decline in spe nding of 75 cents total income would now have fallen by 175 that dditional 75 cent decline in spending would result in 75 cent decline in income that 75 cent decline in income would then result in an further decline in spending of 56 cents 75 x 75 and so it would continue in kind of chain reaction total income would now have fallen by 231 each successive decline in income resulting from this chain of events would get smaller and smallerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs3 3 the discussion that follows will suggest that the actual multiplier is substantially less than four 4 or where saving is in the form of debt reduction the supply of financial assets fallsif the sequence continued indefinitely other things being equal the total decline in income for each dollar increase in saving decline in spending would be 1 75 75 x 75 75 x 75 x 75 which reduces to continuing with the simplified example and assuming that each dollar cut in income resulted in 75 cent cut in spending an increase of 1 of saving would ultimately yield reduction in income and output of 4 in the jargon of economics this is often referred to as the multiplier effect3 if that were the end of the story it w ould seem to make raising the saving rate much less attractive policy goal given the large effects on income and production but there are number of other factors to consider the full effect on incomes of an increase in the saving rate is not likely to be instantaneous if there is multiplier effect it is likely to take time to develop rather than occur all at once other factors will come into play and tend ultimately to offset any decline in incomes associated with an increase in the saving rate when the saving rate rises demand for fi nancial assets can be expected to rise as well4 the increase in demand for assets put s upward pressure on their prices and that results in decline in their yields and so interest rates fall the decline in interest rates sets in motion chain of events that tends to reduce the extent to which incomes might fall in response to an increase in the saving rate domestically lower interest rates reduce the cost of financing expenditures on durable goods as well as business fixed i nvestment and thus increase some private sector demands in the case of business investment lower financing costs mean an increase in the number of investment opportun ities that are profitable in the case of consumer spending lower in terest rates may stimulate demand for those goods that are typically debt financed housing and automobiles being the most important examples lower interest rates can also have an effect on the balance of trade decline in us interest rates relative to foreign rates is likely to reduce foreign purchases of us assets if yields on foreign asse ts rise relative to those on dollardenominated assets both foreign and domestic investors are likely to increase the share of foreign assets they hold in order to do that amer icans must first buy the currency in which those assets are denomin ated and sell dollars1 10 7 5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs4 5 martin feldstein and charles horioka domestic saving and international capital flows the economic journal june 1980 pp 314329 6 maurice obstfeld and alan m taylor globalization and capital markets nber working paper 8846 march 2002if foreign demand for dollardenominated assets falls the demand for dollars in exchange markets will also fall both the increased supply of dollars and the increased demand for other currencies will tend to drive down the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets when the dollar falls in value it makes imported goods more expensive for american consumer s and makes americanmade goods less expensive for foreign consumers the result is thus likely to be decline in imports and an increase in exports while an increase in saving may initially cause income to fall relative to what it otherwise would have been in time any decline in income is likely to be offset by rising investment demand and an increas in net exports whether investment spending or net exports is more affect ed depends in part on how easy it is for financial capital to cr oss national borders if financial capital flows easily between countries then even small decline in us interest rates would be likely to ve large influence on the demand for dollar denominated assets in that case the net outflow of capital from the us economy would minimize the decline in interest rates the smaller the decline in interest rates is the smaller any stimulus to domestic spending will be in that case more of the shortterm contractionary effect of an increas in saving would be offset by rising net exports than by increased domestic investment feldstein and horioka published in 1980 widely cited paper suggesting that capital did not easily cross international bor ders and their evidence was that for large number of developed c ountries variations in domes tic saving and investment were highly correlated that is when savi ng rose domestic inve stment tended to rise as well5 however there is also evidence that since that paper was published capital mobility has increased substantially6 in part because of floating exchange rates and the reduction in capital controls the volume of international capital flows at least among developed countries has increased substantially if capital is more free to cross borders rise in domestic saving is more likely to affect the balance of trade and raise net exports than it is the level of domestic investment key shortrun issue is how long it take s for any decline in income due to an increase in the saving rate to be offset by rising investment and net exports it takes time for the full effects of the increase in saving to be felt on incomes and it takes time for any consequent declin in interest rates to boost investment and net exports two macroeconomic models agree completely on either the magnitude of the effect or its duration 1988 comparison of various models suggested that the ultimate size of th multiplier was somewhere between one and two meaning that the peak decline in total income would be from 1 to 2 for each 1 increase inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs5 7 ralph c bryant et eds empirical macroeconomics fo r

suggested that the multiplier may be closer to one if not smaller8 at some point any effects of higher sa ving on the level of income are likely to dissipate once incomes make up any s hortrun losses the only likely durable economic change will be in the composition of income to the extent that the composition of income changes that may have important long run consequences the past 15 years have seen some substa ntial swings in the rate of national saving largely as result of the federa l government budget going from substantial deficits to large surpluses and then back into deficit in addition beginning in the mid1980s there was pronounced decline in the household saving rate figure 1 compares the gross national saving rate with the rate of growth of real gross domestic product gdp between 1990 and 2007 while th eory suggests that rising saving rate might tend to slow ec onomic growth it would be hard to find evidence of that in these data source department of commerce bureau of economic analysis figure 1 saving and economic growth rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs6 it may simply be that the models overstate the potential effects of changes in saving on the economy another reason for the apparent absence of connection in recent experience is that the theoretical connection assume s that other things stay the same but in fact that is rarely the case one thing in particular that might not stay the same is monetary policy because of the ease with which capita l flows across international boundaries monetary policy has greater potential to influence the shortterm rate of economic growth than variations in saving it is possible for the federal reserve fed to take steps to prevent any shortrun slowdown in economic growth that might result from an increase in the saving rate that may be especially true in the case of an increase in federal government saving either an increased surplus or reduced deficit since there is such long lead time between enacting budget and any resulting change in saving an increase in saving longrun effects as was discussed in the previous sec tion an increase in domestic saving is likely to result in either an increase in domestic investment or reduction in borrowing from foreigners this section discusses how an increase in saving might affect the composition of output and what that might mean for economic growth increased investment if an increase in domestic saving results in more domestic investment and higher capitallabor ratio will that raise the longterm rate of growth the prevailing view of economic theory suggests that the answer to that question perhaps surprisingly is that it will not in the standard model growth depends on three factors growth in the labor force advances in technology and growth in the capital stock the rate of growth of the labor force is assumed to be given and is consider ed to be independent growth in the capital stock depends on the saving rate and the rate at which capital depreciates for the sake of clarity and simplicity consider hypothetical economy with technological progress in the absence of technological progress the economy will grow at the rate of growth of the labor for ce if investment re mains constant share of output then the capital stock will grow at the same rate as output since all three variables grow at the same rate the ratios of capital to labor and of output to labor are constant as both the numerators and nominators of those ratios are growing at the same rate this might be referred to as the steadystate rate of growth in that steady state the amount invested will be just enough to replace existing capital as it wears out and to provide for enough new capital through new net investment to ensure that each additional worker in the growing labor force has the same amount of capital to work with as those already employed in other words investment is sufficient to maintain constant capitaltolabor ratiohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs7 suppose given these initial conditions th ere is onetime permanent increase in the rate of investment each worker now has more capital with which to work there is onetime rise in the capitallabor ratio and the result is onetime rise in labor productivity the increase in labor productivity temporarily raises the growth rate of output above th at of the labor force only during the transition to the higher rate of investment does the capital stock grow faster than output and the labor force furthermore in this simple example with technological advance only durin g the transition is there an increase in average labor productivity after the economy adjusts completely to the higher rate of investment the growth ra of output and the growth rate of the capital stock continue to match the growth rate of the labor force and the capitallabor ratio is once again constant figure 2 illustrates the point at point in figure 2 there is an increase in the investment share of output between points and b the economy ad justs and the ratio of capital to labor rises and average output per worker also ri ses after point b the investment rate is again constant and the capital stock th labor force and total output once again grow at the same rate as before the only permanent difference is that output is higher than it would have been in the ab sence of the increase in investment the longterm rate of growth is unaffected adding technological progress to this simplified model only changes the picture slightly with technological progress out put and the capital stock grow more rapidly than does the labor force that means the capital labor ratio rises steadily even with constant rate of inve stment if the rate of investme nt rises the rate of increase of the capitallabor ratio briefly accelerates as the economy adjusts ultimately though figure 2 the effect of increased investment on outputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs8 9 for an overview of the arguments that th rate of economic growth may depend on variety of factors see david m gould and roy ruffin what determines economic growth federal reserve bank of dallas economic

vol 14 2 pp 322 11 see crs report rs21409 the budget deficit and the trade deficit what is their relationship by marc labonte and gail makinenthe longterm growth rate is determined by the growth of the labor force and the rate of technological progress and is unaff ected by the rate of investment as with most simple models there are additional considerations while the longterm rate of economic growth may be independent of the ra of investment it may not be unaffected by the composition of investment some studies have suggested that the rate of technologi cal progress may depend on the composition of investment spending among those types of investments that have been found to be correlated with faster rates of econo mic growth are education and business equipment9 number of recent studies has found connection between investment in computers and other informa tion technology equipment and the rate of productivity growth10 if the longrun growth rate of output depends on the composition of investment then it may be that the par ticular investments made possible by an increase in the rate of investment may be as important as the increase in the rate itself moreover gains to output made possible by redirecting existing levels of investment may be comparable to those gains deriving from an increase in the overall level of investment reduced imports of foreign capital as was already discussed an increase in domestic saving might have two consequences one is an increase in domes tic investment the other is an increase in net exports and reduction in us dependence on foreign capital to finance domestic investment gdp the most widely used measure of the size of the us economy and its growth rate measures the total value of goods and services produced within the nations borders the workers producing t hose goods and services may or may not be us citizens and the capital stock may be foreign or american owned to the extent that the domestic capital stock is foreign owned income produced by that capital will be paid to foreign investors if an increase in saving does not lead to increased domestic investment then it will reduce the share of the capital stock that is owned by foreigners11 it isnt only physical capital that is subject to foreign ownership but any marketable security that includes fede ral debt an increase in domestic saving would also tend to reduce sales to foreigne rs of federal government debt eitherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33112crs9 domestic savers would buy larger share of new debt issues or if the increase in saving is attributable to reduction in fe deral borrowing there would simply be less debt for foreigners to buy in either case an increase in domestic saving would reduce foreign investors claims on income dividends interest and rent from domestic production that would leave larger share of income for americans the effect would be similar to that of an increase in investment on domestic output except instead of an increase in production it would be an increase in income policy considerations although from macroeconomic perspective it makes little difference who saves how much is saved does have an effect as with most policy choices there are benefits and costs associated with raising the nations saving ra but the benefits and costs do not occur at the same time the benefits of higher saving rate are longterm in nature while the cost of saving more is immediate there may also be conflict if policymakers decide to use spending and tax policy to stimulate economic growth in that case the immediate result would likely be decline in saving but any cost associated with lowe r saving rate would be incurred in the long run if policy succeeds in raising national saving it is likely to be because of an increased appreciation of the longrun benefits
