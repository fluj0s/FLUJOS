approximately 5 million illegal aliens were residing in the us as of octobe r 1996 this large population varies by country of origin motive for entry length of stay family composition and attachment to the community immigration w historically has taken these differences into account by allowing certain longter m illegal residents to become l egal residents despite their being here in violation of law for example our law has for decades permitted the attorney general to allow longterm illegal residents to stay on casebycase basis if their removal woul d cause undue hardship th rules governing this hardship relief known until recently as suspension of deportation have changed over time and in 1996 congres s significantly toughened hardship standards in amendments contained in the illega l immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira furthermore the new restrictions on relief potentially could have precluded any hardship relief fo r many aliens who had resided here since well before iirira was enacted among the aliens w ho were already longterm residents when iirira changed the hardship rules were several hundred thousand central americans who came here during the civil strife of the 1980s under court settlements and review policies the government had allowed these central americans to reside and work here for over decade during which time many of them established families careers an d commu nity ties not surprisingly many members of congress began questionin g whether it was appropria to apply new restrictive hardship policies to these aliens the issue of how iiriras new hardship rules were to affect central americans and others who were residing here when iirira was enacted was addressed in the nicaraguan adjustment and central amer ican relief act nacara title ii of pl 105100 under this law approximately 150000 caraguans and 5000 cubans are eligible to adjust to permanent resident status without having to make any hardship showing at all additionally approximately 200000 salvadorans and 5000 0 guatemal ans along with certain warsaw pact natives will be able to qualify fo r hardship relief under th more lenient hardship rules that existed prior to the iirira amendments large majority of these guatemalans and salvadorans have n application pending with the immigration and naturalization service ins fo r asylum whic h is distinct remedy based on prospective persecution abroad under procedures expected to be implemented in late 1998 or early 1999 these asylu m applicants will b able to have their hardship relief claims decided by asylum officers who usually consider asylum applications only rather than having to wait for determination by an immigration judges during removal proceedings while nacara benefits some longterm residents it makes clear that alien s not covered by its special rules eg haitians and mexicans who entered during the 1980s must qualify for hardship relief under iiriras tighter standards th

resided here for an extended period these ne w rules make it significantly more difficult for longterm illegal residents to obtai n permanent resident status based on the hardship that would result if they wer removed as enacted these new rules also had been interpreted as possibly applying to aliens who already had been residing in the us for extended periods whe n iirira was enacted ie aliens already in the pipeline according to the im migration and naturalization service ins approximately 5 million illegal aliens were residing in the us when iirira became law of thi s population about 60

the immigration and naturalization servic ins paroled into the united states approximately 10490 haitians who wer determined to have credible asylum claims even though 1986 law sought to control

the foregoing groups of aliens had visas that permitte d permanen t residency the extent of government acquiescence in their entry and stay clearly varied differences in equities among various segments of the undocumented population led many members of congress to question whether iiriras tighte r hardship rules were equally appropriate for all groups of illegal residents som members believed restrictive hardship standards were inappropriate for aliens wh originally came from countries with repressive regimes or civil violence attentio n especially focused on central americans who had remained and worked in the us with the governments knowledge and tacit approval greater disagreement arose1 over whether it was inequitable to judge the hardship claims of all aliens who d been here before iirira by that acts stan dards or whether on the other hand date of entry was an appropriate criterion for setting rules at all congress addressed the issue of hardship standards and pipeline aliens in the nicaragua n adjustment and central american relief act which was enacted n novembe r 19 1997 as part of the district of columbia appropriations act fo r fy1998 pl 105100 the provisions of this law are discussed below after discussion of hardship relief and the changes made to it by iirira background on suspension of deportation since 1940 congress has allowed the attorney general to grant lawful status to certain aliens who though not lawfully admitted for permanent residency hav established deep roots here as first enacted the attorney general could suspend the deportation of aliens who could show 5 years of good moral character an d prospective serious economic detriment to lawfully present members of thei r immediate families howev er several classes of aliens were ineligible and congress retained power to overturn relief by resolution over time congress has changed the basic eligibility rules for suspension f deportation the classes of ineligible iens and the role of congress as enacted the immigration and nationality act of 1952 ina expanded potential eligibility b yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs3 allowing relief premised on hardship to the prospective deportee and by shortening the list of ineligible groups but relief could only be granted if both the attorne general and congress acted the lists of ineligible groups for suspension under the ina which still is our primary immigration statute subsequently were amende d further also the supreme court has precluded congressional participation i n individual suspension cases iirira revisions of hardship relief new name new standards iirira broadly revised the rules for removing aliens who violate immigration law among its changes iirira consolidates what were formerly separat exclusion and deportation procedures into single removal process withi n the new removal process ngterm undocumented residents are subjected to tighter standard s for obtaining hardship relief than previously existed for such relief unde r deportation procedures before iirira suspension of depor tation could be granted to an alien who had been physically present for 7 years who had had good moral character and whos deportation would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to the aliens citizen or permanent res ident spouse child or parent stricter standards 10 years presence and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship existed for aliens who wer deportable on certain criminal fraud or security grounds while eased standard s existed for certain abused spouses and children iirira tightened sta ndards for suspension of deportation and made it part of new remedy called cancellation f removal the new suspension remedy permits the attorney general to cancel the removal of an alien who has been physicall present at least 10 years has had good moral character has not been convicted of crime that makes the alien removable and whose removal would result i n exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the aliens permanent resident r citizen spouse parent or child thus iirira 1 generally adopts the stricter 10 year presence and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standards excep t for abused aliens 2 eliminates prospective hardship to the alien as basis fo r relief and 3 disqualifies most criminal aliens previously criminal conviction wa s relevant only as it bore on good moral character eg aliens convicted at any time of an aggravated felony could not be found to possess good moral character furthermore iirira restricts relief in two additional ways first it limits the number of aliens who may be granted relief each year second it stops the time that may be counted toward meeting the physical presence requirement once an alie n commits certain acts or is made subject to removal proceedings regardless of ho w long the alien remains here afterwards the proced ural changes under iirira generally apply only to removal cases initiated on or after april 1 1 997 by the issuance of notice to appear iirira also permits the attorney general to terminate cases that were begun under the old deportation system by an order to show cause and to restart them as removalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs4 cases in which instance iirira not prior law applies thus as genera l proposi tion iirira would only affect longterm residents if removal proceeding s were begun against t hem after march 1997 however the numerical cap and time stop rules u nder iirira were written in way that could have affected suspension relief under old deportation cases begun many years ago numerica l limits iirira imposes three separate limits of 4000 per fisca l year on hardshipbased relief from removal 4000 per year limit is placed n adjustments to permanent resident status of aliens granted cancellation of removal another 4000 per year limit is placed on combined cancellations and adjustments under iirira and s uspensions and adjustments under cases continued under prior law third 4000 per year limit is placed on suspensions and adjustments under prior law both the subject of these limitations and their implementation were problematic some argued that the latter two limitations were like the first essentially limits n adjustmen ts only they interpreted cancel and adjust and suspend and adjust as each comprised of two distinct acts and argued that it was permissible to cancel or suspend the exp ulsion of more than 4000 aliens in one year so long as more than 4000 of them were adjusted in the same year such an interpretation bypassed the apparent arbitrariness of denying relief or delaying consideration to those aliens with meritorious applications that come before immigration judges after the yearl cancellationsuspension limit has been reached however such an interpretation also raised issues as to the sta of those whose expulsion had been suspended or canceled but who had not yet been able to adjust it also could have been seen as vehicle for bypassing any meaningful limit n suspension s or adjustments if the limit on suspension and adjustment meant only that both acts could not occur in the same year for more than 4000 aliens wha t would have prevented spending 20000 deportations during one year and allowing those 20000 to adjust in the subsequent year retroactive application of tolling provisions iirira changed the practice of allowing time spent here after the initiation of deportation proceedings to b counted toward the physical presence requirements under iirira presence ends when an alien 1 commits certain criminal or terrorist acts or 2 is served with notice to appear the document established b iirira for the initiation of removal proceedings though as mentioned above most of the rules changes in iirira apply onl in cases started on or after april 1 1997 the new timestop rules might b retroactive section 309c5 of iirira as enacted stated that the new timestop rules shall apply to notices to appear issued before on or after the date of iiriras enactment september 30 1996 the effect of 309c5 depended on ho w notices to ppear issued before on or after september 30 1996 was interpreted more particularly if the provision were construed to apply to all deportation case s that were pending when iirira was enacted tens of th ousands of central americans whose cases remained unresolved at that time could have been affectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs5 for example ins often began deportation proceedings against nicaraguan s fleeing civil strife shortly after their arrival in the 1980s nevertheless th government tacitly allowed most of these aliens to remain here and even encouraged them to apply for suspension of deportation when the nicaraguan review program ended in 1995 however if the timestop rules of iirira were applie d retroacti vely to these aliens they would be ineligible for suspension relief becaus proceedings were initiated against them before they met the minimum 7yea r presence requirement for obtaining relief after iiriras enactment there were conflicting legal opinions on how th timestop rules affected longterm residents especially those against who m deportation proceedings were begun prior to iiriras enactment in july 1997 attorney general janet reno vacated decision of th board of immigration appeals in re njb int dec 33 09 bia 1997 that would have put the continued stay of many longterm central american residents in jeopardy earlier federal distric t judge disagreeing with the bia decision in njb had issued preliminar injunction barring applica tion of the timestop provisions to class of nicaraguans tefel v reno 970805civking sd fla 1997 relief for pipeline aliens clarified legislative proposals during the first session of the 105 congress at least two senate floo rth amendments to the district of columbia appropriations bill hr 2607 and fou r freestanding bills addressed how the numerical limit and timestop changes would apply to aliens who were in the pipeline when iirira was enacted though they varied all but hr 2533 introduced by rep lamar smith chairman of the house immigration subcommittee would have assured that som of the old suspension of deportation rules and not the iirira cancellation rules would be applied to at least some classes of longterm undocumented residents especially aliens who were cover ed by the abc settlement the old suspension rules that generally would have been applied under these proposals included 1 7year rather than 10year presence requirement for most aliens 2 automati c stopping of the presence clock by the initiation of proceedings though one bil l would have stopped the clock at iiriras effective date 3 relief based upo n personal hardship to the alien and 4 elimination of numerical caps on relief of the proposals that would have grandfathered the old suspension rules s 1076 sens mack and grah am and the similar s amd no1252 was the broadest in its coverage s amd 1253 sen mack which was adopted by the senate as substitute for s amd 1252 by vote of 991 was the narro west hr 2302 rep diazbalart was similar to s 1076 in its coverage of central americans but it would not have assured that the timestop rules would not be applied in ol d deportation cases begun before april 1 1997 eg against many nicaraguans hr 2442 rep meek was substantially similar to hr 2302 but differed from it by its proposed application of old suspension rules to certain haitianshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs6 unlike other proposals hr 2533 limited relief to applying special time stop rule to the classes of aliens it covered generally aliens covered by the abc settlement and certain nicaraguans also the bill appeared to benefit only thos covered aliens against whom deportation proceedings were pending as of april 1 1997 hr 2533 also would have made clear that timestop provisions unde r iirira were to apply in all carried over deportation cases other than those involving covered aliens the bill further required that relief granted covered aliens be offset by reductions in the numbers of visas made available to unskilled laborers provisions of the nacara on november 19 1997 the nicaraguan adjustment and central america n relief act nacara became law as title ii of the district of columbi appropriations act for fy1998 pl 105100 the relief contained in it aros primarily from an agreement negot iated by rep diazbalart with rep lamar smith with the backing of the house majority leadership like rep diazbalarts bill and the senates proposal individual hardship claims made by salvadorans an d guatema lans covered by the abc settlement are to be decided under preiirir standards regardless of when removal proceedings are initiated like rep smiths bill longterm undocumented aliens not in the covered special classes must mee t iiriras timestop restrictions and numerical limits and there is reduction i n certain visa categories to offset hardship relief granted to aliens who are covered by special rules unlike any previous proposal however the final bill contains legalization provision for nicaraguans and certain cubans that allows them t adjust to permanent residency without having to make any individual hardshi p showing at all nicarag uan and cuban adjustment the nacara directs the attorne general to ad just to permanent resident status without offset against the number of allowable immigrant visas an alien in one of the classes listed below if the alie n meets two conditions first the alien must apply for adjustment before april 1 2000 second the alien must not be legally inadmissible to the us on ground s other than being prospective public charge failing to have proper documents failing to meet certain laborrelate d requirements or entering the us surreptitiously eg aliens who are inadmissible on health grounds or as criminal aliens or security threats are ineligible for adjustment absent waiver the classes of aliens covered include nicaraguans and cubans who have been in the us continuously for period beginning before december 1 1995 and ending the date of application an absence or aggregate absences of 180 days or less are not considered t disrupt continuous presence the ability to adjust is not affected by th pendency of removal proceedings or final order of removal proof f continuous presence may be made through any one of specified means r under any other method allowed by the attorney general and nicaraguan s and cubans who are the spouses or unmarried children of aliens in the foregoing class the same application deadline and legal admissibility requirements apply but the physical presence requirements ie in the us continuously since before december 1995 apply only to unmarried childre nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs7 age 21 or older children under age 21 and spouses need only be physically present on date of application spouses and unmarried children who are not nicaraguan or cuban are not eligible under nacara however they ma indirectly benefit because aliens who do adjust under nacara thereb become eligible to petition fo r immigration preference under the ina for their spouses and children regardless of their nationality hards hip relief for certain central americans and europeans thoug h they do not have the right to adjust status comparable to covered nicaraguans an d cubans aliens in one of the classes below may unless they have been convicted of an aggravated felony apply for hardsh ip relief in deportation or removal proceedings free from the timestop and numerical restriction limits of iirira and with minor exception under the standards for suspension of deportation that existed under pre iirira law salvadoran nationals who 1 first entered before september 20 1990 2 were not apprehended at time of entry after december 19 1990 and 3 either registered for benefits under the abc settlement or applied fo r temporary protected status before november 1991 guatemalan natio nals who 1 first entered on or before october 1 1990 2 were not apprehended at time of entry after december 19 1990 and 3 registered for benefits under the abc settlement by december 31 1991 salvadorans and guatemalans who filed an asylum application with ins n or before april 1 1990 aliens who at the time decision to grant relief is rendered are the unmarried children under age 21 or the s pouses of covered salvadorans or guatemalans aliens who at the time decision to grant relief is rendered are the unmarried adult children of covered salvadorans or guatemalans if the children entered the us on or before october 1 1990 and aliens who entered bef ore 1991 filed an asylum application before 1992 and are nationals of the former soviet union or ne of its successor states poland czechoslovakia romania hungary bulga ria albania east germany latvia estonia lithuania or yugoslavia or one of its former components offsets against legal immigration nacara requires that the number f salvadorans and guatemalans who obtain perman ent resident status under the special hardship relief rules be partially offset through reductions in two categories f immigrant visas diversity visas and visas for unskilled laborers beginning in fy1999 the number of aliens who may be granted immigran t visas under the diversity program for lowimmigration areas is to be reduced by the following onehalf of the number of covered salvadorans and guatemalan s receiving reli ef the prior fiscal year minus the total number of reductions in diversity visas for all previous fiscal years however in event may reductions in any year exceed 5000httpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs8 similar reduction is req uired in the number of immigration visas for unskilled laborers but the effective date of this reduction is delayed until all aliens who d visas petitions approved under the unskilled labor category as of the date th nacara was enacted november 19 1997 are admitted relie f for other pipeline aliens at the same time nacara benefit s specified groups of central americans and warsaw pact aliens it assures that other pipeline aliens will be subject to iirira standards for hardship relief nacara modifies 309c5 of iirira to make clear that the timestop rules of iirira are to apply in current deportation cases tha t were begun before april 1 1997 even though hardship relief in those cases is otherwise governed by th suspension of deportation standards under preiirira law for example consider hardship application being determined in 1998 in deportation proceeding begun in 1993 against an alien w ho arrived in 1987 the alien would be subject to 7year not 10year presence requirement because prior suspension rules generally govern preiiri ra cases but the alien still would be ineligible for relief because iirir now retroactively stops the presence clock at 1993 when proceedings wer initiated an d not when the application for relief is determined as was typical under preiirira practice th attorney general apparently has authority under 203 of nacara to avoid retroactive application of the timestop rules in such case b terminating the old deportation case and reinitiating the case as removal cas under iirira in the reinitiated c ase iiriras 10year presence requirement would apply but the relevant terminating event would be the date removal proceedings started 1998 and not the date the old deportation case began 1993 in ou r example above nevertheless the attorney general does not appear to hav exercised this authority in any case yet the new law also amends the 4000 per year caps on relief contained in iirira first the law makes clear that suspend and adjust and cancel and adjust are both to be considered two part s of single act and that for purposes of applying the caps on relief the date of the decis ion to suspend or cancel governs second the law retains the aggregate 4000 per fiscal year limit on suspensions and cancellations but makes special provision fo r fy1997 and fy1998 for fy1997 only grants of relief made after april 1 counted for fy1998 the 4000 limit is increased by anothe r 4000 minus the number of grants of relief made during fy1997 after april 1 implementation of nacara nicaraguan and cuban ad justments ins published an interim rule on may 21 1998 63 fed reg 27823 to govern implementation of the nicaraguan an d cuban adjustment provisions of nacara the interim rule became effective june 22 comments on the rule are due by july 20 1998 much of the interim rule focuses on how an applicant may show length an d continuity of presence nacara itself lists various types of federal records related to work or immigration proceedings that may be submitted to show that continuous presence began before december 1995 which is the statutory cutoff date nacara also authorizes the attorney general to accept other types of evidence of commencement of physical presence to this end the interim rules allow shttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs9 submission of st ate and local governmental records eg school hospital police or public assistance records furthermore ins is soliciting suggestions for othe r means of proving when continuous presence began regarding proof of continuity of presence as opposed to proof f commencement of presence the interim rule allows submission of one or mor documents issued by governmental or nongovernmental authority if the document bears the applicants name was dated cont emporaneously with its issuance and bears the signature of the issuing authority the number of documents required will vary with their nature for example single college transcript covering several years attendance may suffice alone while series of rent or utilities bills may be required in general the documentary evidence should not contain any gap of three or mor months other parts of the interim rule address to whom appli cations are to be submitted this varies depending upon whether the applicant is currently in proceedings before an immigration judge the rule also explains what forms fingerprints and filing fees must be submitted finally the interim rule discusses what procedures are to used in considerin g adjustment applications what documentation will be issued upon approval of n application what happens if an application is denied and what rights t administrative review exist hardship relief statements and memoranda issued by ins and the office of the chief immigration judge ocij have addressed the process for considerin g hardship applications filed by salvadorans guatemalans and warsaw pact native s who are covered under nacara as discussed abo ve nacara benefits certain salvadorans guatemalans and warsaw pact natives in more limited way than it benefits covered nicaraguans and cubans instead of broadly allowing adjustment of status on proof of continuou s residence nacara benefits these latter classes of aliens by allowing their claim s for hardship relief to be determined under more lenient preiirira standards historically claims for hardship relief have been considered only by immigratio n judges in the context of exclusion deportation or under new iirira procedures removal proceedings there has not been means for obtaining hardship relie f before ins has actually ordered an alien to appear before an immigration judge t face possible expulsion only small portion of the potential beneficiaries of nacaras hardshi p standards are currently in proceedings before immigration judges rather the great majority of potential beneficiaries including up to 240000 salvadorans an d guatemalan still have asylum applications pending before ins asylum officers under normal circumstances an asylum officer would have to consider and deny an asylum application which is separate form of discretionary relief premised upo n prospect ive persecution abroad before the applicant could subsequently be place d in deportation or removal proceedings before an immigration judge and only the n could the alien apply for hardship relief which is premised primarily on deep tie s that have been established herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983crs10 however accord ing to ins press releases and memoranda issued by the ocij the attorney general will streamline the process for considering hardship claim s made by asylum applicants covered by nacara by allowing asylum officers t determi ne hardship claims usually determined exclusively by immigration judges while the intent to allow consideration by asylum officers was made public in early 1998 procedures still have not been implemented according to some reports asylum office rs will begin to consider the hardship claims of nacara beneficiaries in late 1998 or early 1999 in the meantime ins has temporarily suspende d processing the asylum applications of applicants who will be eligible to seek hardship relief under nacara an exception has been made for aliens who reques t expedited consideration of their asylum applications regarding nacara beneficiaries without pending asylum applications those potential beneficiaries who have been ordered deported or agreed to voluntar departure may file one motion to reopen their cases with immigration judges for the purpose of applying for hardship relief under nacara standards motion t reopen must be filed on or before september 11 1998 some significant implementation issues apparently have not been completel resolved among these are the standar ds for proving the degree of hardship required for relief and whether final regulations will contain presumptions and other guidance on establishing hardship case
