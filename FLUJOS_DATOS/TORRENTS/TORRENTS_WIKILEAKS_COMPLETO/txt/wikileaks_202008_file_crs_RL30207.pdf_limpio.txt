the corps of engineers the administration requested 39 billion in fy2000 about the same as appropriated in fy1999 the senate bill s 1186 would have reduced this figure to 376 billion with most of the reductions in the construction budget the house bill hr 2605 recommended raising the corps appropriation to 419 billion the bureau of reclamation would have received an increase of more than 10 excluding offsets to 857 million the senate bill would have reduced this to 761 million below the fy1999 level the house recommendation was 785 million the house and senate conference settled on 414 billion for the corps of engineers and 7693 million for the bureau of reclamation doe programs funded by the senate bill would have risen about 4 to 171 billion about what the administration requested the major activities in the doe budget are research and development on energy and general science environmental cleanup and nuclear weapons programs the house would have reduced funding for these

often contentious issue between the administration and the congress with final appropriations bills typically funding more projects than requested for fy1998 for example the congress added 270 million 7 to the 363 billion requested by the administration similarly the fy1999 bill as passed included total of 386 billion for the corps 638 million 20 more than requested the administrations fy2000 corps request was somewhat less controversial at 39 billion it was slightly above the last years appropriation and it provided 80 million for 19 new construction starts including numerou s port improvements navigation flood control and environmental projects and the proposed challenge 21 river restoration and flood mitigation initiative at 25 million newlyproposed harbor services fund would have provided for both port improvements and harbor maintenance 693 million requested under the operation and maintenance account and 258 million requested for construction the harbor services fund would have replaced the existing harbor maintenance trust fund with new fund from proposed harbor services user fee which would replace the existing harbor maintenance tax part of which was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1998 the senate bill reduced corps funding by more than 200 million below the administrations request most of the cuts would have come in the construction budget the senate appropriations committee report said it was attempting to provide continuity of previously funded construction with specified stretching out in contracting or completion schedules the senate also declined to initiate the challenge 21 proposal nor did it modify harbor maintenance through the appropriations language the house bill increased the corps funding by more than 280 million above the administrations request including increases in most of the corps programs however the house also declined to initiate the challenge 21 proposal and did not modify harbor maintenance through appropriations language policy issues related to wetlands regulatory programs were addressed in the final bill as approved by the house on july 27 the bill included two such provisions one would require the corps to modify recentlyestablished administrative appeals process for certain corps regulatory decisions to allow unsuccessful appellants to directly challenge the decisions in court the administration supported creation of an administrative appeals process but opposed this provision saying that it would impose excessive burdens on the corps and the courts landowner and developer groups favored it the conference report hrept 106336 deleted the house language that would have made certain administrative decisions appealable to federal courts prior to final permit decision it included senate language providing that 5 million in additional funds for the corps regulatory program in fy2000 shall be used to establish an administrative process for appeals of jurisdictional determinations by the corps ie whether an area contains wetlands that are subject to corps permitting requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs5 the house bill also included provision to require the corps to submit study on the workload impact and compliance costs of replacement permits for nationwide permit 26 nwp 26 30 days prior to publication of the final permits but later than december 30 1999 the nwp 26 program permits certain activities to fill wetlands of less than 3 acres and has been highly controversial with environmental and conservation groups the corps has proposed program changes to restrict use of nwp 26 which are due to take effect by december 30 1999 landowner and developer groups supported the housepassed provision but the administration opposed it saying that the study was unnecessary and even with dec 30 deadline would increase wetlands loss in the nation by delaying issuance of replacement permits the conference report on hr 2605 modified the housepassed language by directing the corps to study the workload impacts and costs of compliance of proposed replacement permits but dropped language that would have required submission of report to congress before publication of final permits for more information see crs issue brief 97014 wetland issues and crs report 97223 nationwide permits for wetlands projects permit 26 and

in supplemental appropriations pl 10631 the office of management and budget and the congressional budget office disagree as to whether there is an offset for this fund background on reclamation policy most of the large dams and water diversion structures in the west were built by or with the assistance of the bureau of reclamation bureau whereas the corps built hundreds of flood control and navigation projects the bureaus mission was to develop water supplies and to reclaim arid lands in the west primarily for irrigation today the bureau manages more than 600 dams in 17 western states providing water to approximately 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people the bureau has undergone many changes in the last 15 years turning from largely dam construction agency to selfdescribed water resource management agency the agency describes the intent of its programs and projects as follows to operate and maintain all facilities in safe efficient economical and reliable manner to sustain the health and integrity of ecosystems while addressing the water demands of growing west and to assist states tribal governments and local communities in solving contemporary and future water and related resource problems in an environmentally socially and fiscally sound manner in practice however the agency is limited in how it can address new demands and new priorities because of numerous federal state and local statutes compacts andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs8 existing contracts which together govern the delivery of water to project users consequently any proposal to change bureau water allocation or water management policies often becomes difficult to implement and extremely controversial key policy issues bureau of reclamation the administration requested an appropriation of 8566 million for the bureau for fy2000 gross current budget authority approximately 80 million more than enacted for fy1999 excluding the 371 million offset to the cvp restoration fund the senate bill included 7612 million 954 million less than requested and 193 million less than enacted for fy1999 excluding offsets appropriations for water projects were recommended to be 404 million less than requested with reductions for many projects and increases for few the house bill included 7847 million 719 million less than requested but 27 million more than enacted for fy1999 excluding offsets and 235 million more than in the senate bill the final bill appropriated 7693 million for fy2000 approximately 85 million less than requested and 11 million more than enacted for fy1999 one major difference between the house and senate bills was funding for the california baydelta ecosystem restoration program calfed funding for calfed is requested in the bureaus budget but the appropriation will be allocated among several federal agencies the majority of funding is expected to go to the bureau and the corps the fy2000 request for calfed is 950 million 433 million less than the fy1999 request but 20 million more than enacted for fy1999 the senate bill figure is 50 million for fy2000 45 million less than requested and 25 million less than enacted for fy1999 in addition the senate bill has 373 million for the central valley project restoration fund 42 million more than enacted for fy1999 but 10 million less than the administration requested for fy2000 the house appropriations committee recommended 750 million for calfed matching the fy1999 funding but 200 million less than requested for fy2000 and 250 million more than recommended in the senate the house committee also recommended the full amount requested for the central valley project restoration fund 473 million pl 10660 appropriates 60 million for calfed 15 million less than requested and 42

appropriated 2887 million for fy2000 boost of nearly 20 million from the administrations request funding was increased for program begun in fy1999 to support innovative nuclear energy research projects the nuclear energy research initiative neri from 19 million to 225 million the energy and water bill also provides does full request 5 million for separate research program rejected by congress in fy1999 to improve the economic competitiveness of existing nuclear power plants called nuclear energy plant optimization nepo funding for nepo was identified by doe as part of the administrations climate change technology initiative to be matched by industry the nepo funding would focus on research to extend the operating lives of existing reactors and to allow them to operate more efficiently and reliably because nuclear plants directly emit carbon dioxide greater production of nuclear power from existing reactors could help the united states reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions continued operation of existing nuclear power plants avoids over 620 million tons of carbon dioxide annually according to the doe budget justification however opponents have criticized does nuclear energy research programs as providing wasteful subsidies to failing industry controversy has also been generated by the electrom etallurgical treatment of doe spent fuel process in which metal fuel is melted and highly radioactive isotopes are electrochemically separated from uranium and plutonium doe contends that such treatment may be the best way to render certain types of spent fuel particularly from the closed experimental breeder reactor ii in idaho safe for longterm storage and disposal doe received 40 million in fy1999 to complete demonstration program for the technology according to the doe budget justification decision will be made in fy2000 on whether to proceed with fullscale electrometallurgical treatment program and 107 million was requested to maintain the necessary facilities in case the option is pursued the house appropriations committee report specified that 40 million under nuclear facility termination costs be provided for the program in fy2000 including 20 million for demonstration activities the conference report boosts termination costs by 15 million over the administration request but does not specify how much should be spent for electrometallurgical treatment opponents contend that such treatment is unnecessary and that the process could be used for separating plutonium to make nuclear weapons they note that the process uses much of the same technology and equipment developed for the plutoniumfueled integral fast reactor or advanced liquid metal reactor which was canceled by congress in 1993 partly because of concerns about nuclear weapons proliferationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs13 the final bill also includes 9 million under the category civilian research and development for research into the use of particle accelerators to transmute longlived elements in radioactive waste into shorterlived elements for safer disposal science for the science programs doe requested an increase of 1169 million over fy1999 or about 43 most of this increase consists of two items 84 million 65 for continued construction of the spallation neutron source sns and 70 million for the scientific simulation initiative ssi the former is to be major user facility providing new source of neutrons for wide variety of research goals the latter is designed to develop very high speed computational capability for use in simulating complex physical and biomedical problems such as global climate change and genome structure and to carry out such simulations while both of these efforts have much support in the scientific community the extent of the increase requested for these two activities would be to leave funding for the rest of the doe science research somewhat lower than fy1999 the senate appropriated 273 billion for science for fy2000 37 below the request but 04 above the fy1999 level the senate approved 1690 million for sns construction which it stated would amount to full funding given delays that have taken place in that project the senate did not however provide any funding for the ssi project most of the other programs would receive small reduction which the senate noted were primarily the result of constrained budget resources the house recommended 272 billion for science for fy2000 45 below the request and nearly equal to the fy1999 level included in the house bill is 51 million in contractor travel and other directed reductions the house bill increases funding for high energy physics and nuclear physics over the request it did not provide any funding for the ssi program arguing that it could not support two supercomputer development programs within doe given the existence of the accelerated strategic computing initiative asci within the doe weapons activities the house also provided 50 million for sns construction stating that project management problems needed to be resolved before full construction funding could be provided the house bill directs doe to meet series of conditions to demonstrate such resolution the final appropriations bill provides 280 billion for science programs for fy2000 reduction of 11 from the request but 30 above the fy1999 level this amount includes 318 million in general reductions for contractor travel and other purposes the conferees provided 1179 million for sns construction but funds for the ssi the report contained language expressing strong support for the doe supercomputer programs both civilian and defense the conferees however did urge doe to submit comprehensive plan for civilian supercomputing program congress is providing 250 million for the fusion energy science program an increase of nearly 28 million over the request the conferees expressed their approval of the programs reviews recently completed by the secretary of energys advisory board and the fusion energy science advisory committee stockpile stewardship the primary element of does national security rd request is the stockpile stewardship program aimed at develop ing the science and technology to maintain the nations nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing the main focus of the program is the development of computational capabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs14 that can simulate weapons explosions and perform other important computations for fy2000 doe requested 5425 million for this element the accelerated strategic computing initiative ascistockpile computing that sum is 237 of the entire stockpile stewardship request and is 122 above the fy1999 appropriation the senate appropriated 2352 billion for stockpile stewardship 29 above the request and 106 above the fy1999 level the senate repeated its concern that doe is not requesting sufficient funding for this program it considers stockpile stewardship to be critically important particularly in view of the cessation of underground testing the senate directed doe to take steps to improve management of the weapons activities in order to operate effectively in the restricted budget environment the senate also noted its concern with the rate of growth of the asci project but it did provide doe with its full request for the project further the senate commended doe on its achievements so far and recommended that the project speed up to reach the 100 teraflop goal set of strategic actions now under study by doe was noted by the senate which approved an additional 35 million to the core stockpile stewardship program to begin those actions the senate also provided an additional 10 million for the inertial confinement fusion program to assist the national ignition facility nif project to avoid delays in reaching ignition once completed the house approved about 2 billion for stockpile stewardship for fy2000 121 below the request and 54 below the fy1999 level included in the recommendation are 882 million in contractor travel and other reductions that are assumed to be this programs share of the 180 million reduction recommended by the committee for all doe weapons activities nearly all of the reduction from the request would take place in the core stockpile stewardship activity which the bill would fund at the fy1999 level within that activity the house bill provides the asci effort 61 million increase over fy1999 the committee argued that cost efficiencies could be achieved throughout the weapons complex that would permit these recommendations the inertial confinement fusion icf activity would receive an additional 10 million above the request and the nif would be fully funded for fy2000 the house bill directs that 10 million be made available to further highaveragepower laser development for the technology transfer and education activities the house recommended 14 million compared to request of 52 million the house argued that budget constraints make it necessary to concentrate available funds on the weapons mission in the report accompanying its recommendations the house noted the security problems reported about the doe weapons labs in particular it cited the report by the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board that argued for restructuring of the doe national security programs as the only way to deal with those problems which the board found were very serious the house has concluded that an independent agency will be needed it argued that even separate agency within doe would not suffice because significant staffing changes would take place in order to ensure that action will take place the house recommended provision that would delay 1 billion in obligations for doe until after june 30 2000 in order to give time for congress to craft careful bipartisan legislation addressing the problem provisions reorganization the weapons program into semiautonomous agency within doe were included in the fy2000 defense authorization act s 1059 pl 10665 signed into law october 5 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs15 the final appropriations bill provides 2252 billion for stockpile stewardship for fy2000 36 million above the request the conferees directed doe to reduce funding for weapons activities by 648 million it is likely that some of that reduction will be applied to the stockpile stewardship program which makes up about 50 of the weapons activities budget therefore the actual amount available for the program will probably be less than the 2252 billion the conferees provided 316 million for the asci program 25 million below the request also the additional 10 million appropriated by the house for highaveragepower laser development remains in the final bill the conference report contained language expressing strong disappointment about news that the nif cost estimate has increased and the conferees ordered doe to submit certified cost estimate to the appropriations committees by june 1 2000 if that is not possible the conferees directed doe to submit project termination cost estimate nonproliferation and national security programs the administrations fy2000 request for these programs was 747 million about 70 million over fy1999 the house bill included 691 million funding and the senate bill 822 million the bill as passed appropriated 745 million for nonproliferation and national security programs which are included in the other defense activities listed in table 6 much of the requested increase was aimed at helping russia and other former soviet states deal with the cutbacks of their nuclear weapons activities among the programs are the nuclear cities initiative nci to help unemployed nuclear weapons designers find civilian jobs and the initiative for proliferation prevention ipp to help develop new nondefense technologies in the former soviet union ncis budget would have been doubled to 30 million and ipp received 25 million in the fy2000 request the bill as passed included 75 million for nci and 225 million for ipp for the materials protection control and accounting mpca program aimed at improving security and accounting systems at russian nuclear weapons facilities the request was 145 million 5 million increase over fy1999 the bill as passed appropriated 150 million environmental management does environmental management program em is responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination and disposing of radioactive waste at doe nuclear sites the fy2000 appropriation for the program totals 632 billion including 189 million for the privatization of several doe waste management projects such as the solidification of highlevel radioactive waste at hanford washington and 250 million for the uranium enrichment decontam ination and decommissioning fund the total em appropriation is about 35 million below the administrations request but 93 million above the fy1999 funding level the fy2000 em budget is based on the programs accelerated cleanup strategy which attempts to maximize the number of sites that can be completely cleaned up by the end of fy2006 doe managers contend that substantial longterm savings can be gained by focusing on completing work at those sites allowing the earliest possible termination of infrastructure costs major sites scheduled for completion during that period are included in the defense facilities closure projects account for which about 1 billion was provided in fy2000 about the same level as in fy1999 the largest facilities under that account are the rocky flats site in colorado and the fernald site in ohiohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs16 nearly half of ems fy2000 privatization funding request would go for phase 1 of the hanford tank waste remediation system consisting of pilot vitrification plant that would turn liquid highlevel waste into radioactive glass logs for eventual disposal other major privatized projects include facility to treat mixed radioactive and hazardous waste at the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory and waste treatment storage and disposal facilities at oak ridge tennessee the em privatization effort is intended to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting portion of project risks from the federal government to contractors profits to contractors would depend on their success in meeting project schedules and holding down costs potentially profits could be substantially higher or lower than under traditional doe contracting arrangements in typical nonprivatized doe project contractor would be hired to build and operate facility with government funds doe would approve and pay all the contractors costs and then award the contractor profit based on performance under the privatization initiative contractor would be expected to raise almost all funding for necessary facilities and equipment for project the contractor would recover that investment and earn profit by charging previously negotiated fees to doe for providing services under the contract such as solidification of radioactive waste the contractor could earn higher profits by reducing costs but the contractor could lose money if project costs were higher than expected or the required services were not delivered for nondefense environmental management the house recommended elimination of all funding 37 million for the doe national lowlevel waste program the program provides technical assistance to states and interstate compacts in managing commercial lowlevel waste over 80000000 has been provided for the lowlevel waste program over the past two decades and state expertise is now mature enough that federal funding is longer required according to the house committee report the conference report specifies that 595000 be provided to the program in fy2000 for maintaining federal lowlevel waste data bases an additional 10 million was provided for cleanup activities at does uranium enrichment plants at paducah kentucky and portsmouth ohio which are currently leased to private firm recent controversy has focused on environmental hazards posed by the plants particularly contamination resulting from the past enrichment of reprocessed uranium at paducah civilian nuclear waste disposal doe requested 409 million for the civilian nuclear waste program in fy2000 an increase of 51 million over the level provided for fy1999 of that increase 39 million would have come from unspent funds appropriated in fy1996 for an interim waste storage program that has yet to receive congressional authorization because the 39 million has already been appropriated the use of that funding reduced the programs fy2000 net appropriation request to 370 million the fy2000 energy and water development bill provides 3525 million for the program but does not release the previously appropriated funding sought by doe the civilian nuclear waste program is focused almost entirely on studying proposed permanent underground repository for highly radioactive waste at yucca mountain nevada does budget justification contends that the 409 million proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs17 for fy2000 is the minimum required to keep the waste disposal program on its current schedule the major program efforts planned for fy2000 are completion of the final environmental impact statement for the proposed yucca mountain repository preparation of site recommendation report to be submitted to the president in fy2001 and license application to be sent to nrc in 2002 if any of those critical nearterm milestones are missed doe says it might not be able to open the repository in 2010 as planned although doe did not receive its full request for the waste program the final amount was substantially more than the level approved by the house citing severe budget constraints the house appropriations commit tee had voted to cut total appropriations for the waste program to 281 million and directed doe to review all cost components to see what savings can be achieved in fiscal year 2000 the final appropriation includes 2405 million from the nuclear waste fund which consists of fees paid by nuclear utilities and 112 million from the defense nuclear waste disposal account the 2010 target for opening permanent repository is 12 years later than statutory deadline of january 31 1998 for doe to begin taking waste from nuclear plant sites nuclear utilities and state utility regulators upset over does failure to meet the 1998 disposal deadline have won two federal court decisions upholding the departments obligation to meet the deadline and to compensate utilities for any resulting damages utilities have also won several cases in the us court of federal claims although specific damages have not yet been determined for fy1999 congress provided 4 million from general revenues to pay for research on treating highlevel radioactive waste with advanced particle accelerators such treatment would be intended to transmute longlived radioactive waste into shorterlived isotopes doe did not request further funding for the effort in fy2000 but the energy and water bill provides 9 million for the program under nuclear energy research and development doe requested the restoration of funding for the state of nevada to monitor the yucca mountain project in fy2000 totaling 123 million for the state and nearby units of local government for fy1999 congress rejected all but 250000 of does nearly 5 million request for funds for nevada because of concerns that the state was using the money to fight the waste program while providing 55 million to local governments the senate voted to provide 101 million for nevada and affected local governments in fy2000 but the house recommended state and local funding the conference agreement provides 500000 for doe reimbursement of state oversight costs and 54 million for affected local governments power marketing administrations does four power marketing administrations pmas developed out of the construction of dams and multipurpose water projects during the 1930s that are operated by the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers the original intention behind these projects was conservation and management of water resources including irrigation flood control recreation and other objectives however many of these facilities generated electricity for project needs the pmas were established to market the

wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies at the lowest possible rates consistent with sound business practice and priority on pma power is extended to preference customers which include municipal utilities coops and other public bodies the pmas do not own the generating facilities but they generally do own transmission facilities except for southeastern the pmas are responsible for covering their expenses and repaying debt and the federal investment in the generating facilities the 104th congress debated sale of the pmas and did in 1995 authorize divestiture of one pma the alaska power administration sale of the remaining pmas has not since been an issue pending decisions yet to be made about the treatment of public power in the broader context of electric utility restructuring bpa receives annual appropriation the administrations request for the pmas for fy2000 was 200 million reduction of 158 from the fy1999 appropriation the savings stemmed from the administrations proposal that beginning in fy2000 customers of sepa wapa and swpa would be responsible for making their own power purchases and transmission arrangements from any suppliers other than the pma to satisfy their needs under the purchase power and wheeling program ppw the pmas have purchased electricity and transmission capability which is repaid by pma customers to supplement federal generation the premise behind the proposed elimination of the ppw program was that deregulation should make it less expensive and less complicated for pma customers to make these arrangements another possible reason is that the money appropriated to the pmas under ppw is repaid to the treasury rather than to doe this means that the ppw appropriation is fully scored against the caps on discretionary domestic spending with which doe must comply bipartisan groups in both the house and senate found this feature of the budget request controversial the senate passed the bill with the ppw program maintained and more than 80 million restored in its report the senate appropriations committee said it disagrees with the departments proposal however the house supported the administration

have been supported by congressional appropriation however critics of tva have argued in recent years that tva should absorb the cost for these programs and could do so with the savings that could be realized from more efficient operation in recent years the congressional appropriation for the tva nonpower programs has been declining the appropriation for the nonpower programs was 106 million for fy1997 the conferees on the fy1998 energy and water appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of 70 million but stipulated that tva would thereafter absorb the entire cost of these programs through internally generated revenues and savings nonetheless the administration requested 77 million for tva nonpower programs for fy1999 the house held to the intent of the prior years conference report while the senate proposed appropriating 70 million again to tva for fy1999 the house position prevailed in the enacted energy and water appropriations pl 105 245 however shortly before the end of the 105th congress conferees restored 50 million to tva for the nonpower programs in an omnibus spending bill pl 105277 the conferees also authorized tva to refinance 32 billion of its debt to the federal financing bank ffb without prepayment penalty it was expected that the refinancing would save tva 100 million annually this it was further argued should give tva sufficient annual cost savings to support the nonpowe r programs without further appropriations the legislation also stipulated that if lbl were not provided 7 million by congress in future annual appropriations administration of lbl would be transferred from tva to the forest service in line with these enactments in the 105th congress the administration requested only 7 million specifically for the operation of lbl for fy2000 the senate concurred the house did not house appropriations recommended funding for tva commenting in the committee report that final year appropriations for the nonpower programs were provided in fy1999 the conferees authorized tva to spend 3 million from previously appropriated funds for administration of tva pending transfer of lbl to the forest service and for expenses relating to the transition in stewardship nuclear regulatory commission the nuclear regulatory commission nrc requested 471 million for fy2000 an increase of 16 million over fy 1999 major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation of commercial nuclear reactors licensing of nuclear waste facilities and oversight of nuclear materials users the funding request also included about 6 million for the nrc inspector generals office the conference report provides nearly all of the nrc request although the funding request for the inspector general was cut by 1 million the house and senate appropriations committees sharply criticized nrc last year for allegedly failing to overhaul its regulatory system in line with improvements in nuclear industry safety the committees contended among other problems that nrcs regional offices were inconsistent with one another that nrc was inappropriately interfering with nuclear plant management and that numerous nrc review processes were outdated and unnecessary nrcs fy2000 budget justification asserted that sufficient funding was included to address those concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30207crs21 the senate expressed satisfaction with nrcs response to last years criticism and granted the agencys full request for fy2000 the commission as whole the five commissioners individually and the commission staff deserve great deal of credit for the commissions accomplishments in the last year the committee report says the house echoed that statement but on the grounds that the changes at nrc would result in reduced budget requirements it cut nrcs request by 10 million cut that was reversed in conference to ensure that nrcs budget will continue to be mostly offset by fees on nuclear power plants and other licensed entities the fy2000 energy and water bill includes oneyear extension of the agencys current feecollection authority the nuclear power industry has long contended that the existing fee structure requires nuclear reactor
