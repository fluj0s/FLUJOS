for reviewing the constitutionality of restrictions on abortion under the new standard reviewing court would consider whether an abortion restriction has the effect of imposing an undue burden on womans right to obtain an abortion this report will examine justice oconnors notable opinions on abortion and explore her role in the development of the undue burden standard in 1992 the us supreme court led by justices oconnor kennedy and souter adopted new standard for reviewing the constitutionality of restrictions on abortion under the new standard reviewing court would consider whether an abortion restriction has the effect of imposing an undue burden on womans right to obtain an abortion although the new standard was not formally adopted by the court until 1992 in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey justice oconnors opinions on abortion prior to casey had already expressed dissatisfaction with the trimester framework established in roe v wade and an interest in considering abortion restrictions based on whether they imposed an undue burden on the right to obtain an abortion this report will examine justice oconnors notable opinions on abortion and explore her role in the development of the undue burden standard justice oconnor first addressed the legitimacy of abortion restrictions in city of akron v akron center for reproductive health case involving five provisions of an akron ohio ordinance that regulated the performance of abortions1 the five provisions imposed various restrictions on abortion including parental consent requirement for unemancipated minors and requirement that all abortions performed after the first trimester be performed in hospital the court determined by 63 vote that the five provisions of the ordinance were unconstitutional after reaffirming its decision in roe the court indicated that the five provisions did not comply with that decision and the trimester framework articulated in that case2 1 462 us 416 1983 2 for discussion of roe v wade and the trimester framework see crs issue brief ib95095 continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 justice oconnor wrote the dissenting opinion in city of akron in her dissent justice oconnor maintained that the trimester framework established in roe was unworkable she explained that technological advances not only made abortions more safe but also blurred the line between permissible and impermissible regulations of abortion just as improvements in medical technology inevitably will move forward the point at which the state may regulate for reasons of maternal health different technological improvements will move backward the point of viability at which the state may proscribe abortions except when necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother3 justice oconnor maintained that the trimester framework which used the end of the first trimester and viability as reference points for regulation was inappropriate because of decreased medical risks and earlier fetal viability as medical risks associated with various abortion procedures decreased it would seem that restrictions on abortion to preserve maternal health would probably not be imposed at the end of the first trimester but rather at later time in womans pregnancy closer to childbirth in addition under httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198 the trimester framework earlier fetal viability would mean that restrictions on abortion to protect potential life could be imposed early in womans pregnancy justice oconnor concluded that the roe framework then is clearly on collision course with itself4 justice oconnor also noted that adherence to roes trimester framework was inconsistent with the courts more recent abortion decisions in maher v roe and harris v mcrae the court appeared to recognize that an undue burden standard should be used to review restrictions on abortion5 for example in mcrae the court stated the doctrine of roe v wade protects the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy6 justice oconnor maintained that this unduly burdensome standard should be applied to the challenged regulations throughout the entire pregnancy without reference to the particular stage of pregnancy involved7 justice oconnor reiterated her support for the undue burden standard in her concurring opinion in webster v reproductive health services8 webster involved four sections of missouri statute that imposed various restrictions on the performance of abortions including prohibition

funding for abortion counseling justice oconnor joined four other justices to uphold the four sections of the missouri statute the five justices in the majority wrote three separate opinions that concurred in the judgment but expressed differing views on roe and the trimester framework while justice oconnor discussed eliminating the trimester framework and applying the undue burden standard chief justice rehnquist and justices white and kennedy discussed another standard for reviewing restrictions on abortion9 they maintained that restrictions should be evaluated on the basis of whether they permissibly further the states interest in protecting potential human life10 the fifth member of the majority justice scalia contemplated the overruling of roe in its entirety11 despite the justices three opinions it was clear that the idea of using different standard to evaluate restrictions on abortion was not held by justice oconnor alone in fact just three years after webster the court adopted the undue burden standard in casey12 casey was decided by vote of 54 in joint opinion justices oconnor kennedy and souter expressed refusal to overrule roe and discussed why it was important to follow precedent the constitution serves human values and while the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198 effect of reliance on roe cannot be exactly measured neither can the certain cost of overruling roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed13 the court stated clearly that it was reaffirming roes essential holding and identified the holdings three parts14 first woman has right to choose to have an abortion prior to viability without undue interference from the state second the state has right to restrict abortions after viability so long as the regulation provides an exception for pregnancies which endanger womans life or health third the state has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus in affirming only the essential holding of roe the court rejected the trimester framework articulated in that case in its place the court adopted the undue burden standard for reviewing restrictions on abortion the court explained that an undue burden exists and therefore provision of law is invalid if its purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability15 9 webster 492 us at 499 10 webster 492 us at 51920 11 webster 492 us at 532 12 505 us 833 1992 13 id at 856 justices oconnor kennedy and souter were joined in part by justices stevens and blackmun 14 casey 505 us at 846 15 casey 505 us at 878 crs4 applying the new standard to the pennsylvania abortion restrictions at issue in the case the court determined that the provisions of the pennsylvania abortion control act imposing mandatory waiting period and requiring the patients informed consent the consent of one parent if the patient is minor and certain recordkeeping and reporting by facilities that provide abortion services did not impose an undue burden however fifth provision requiring spousal notification did not survive the undue burden test the court reasoned that such requirement placed substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion because fear of spousal abuse could inhibit the abortion decision altogether in 2000 the undue burden standard was applied in stenberg v carhart case involving the constitutionality of nebraskas partialbirth abortion ban statute16 stenberg was the courts first substantive abortion case following casey in stenberg the court determined by 54 vote that the nebraska statute was unconstitutional because it failed to include an exception to protect the health of the mother and because the language defining the prohibited abortion procedure was too vague17 although roe indicated that an abortion regulation must include an exception where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198 nebraska statute did not include such health exception18 nebraska claimed that health exception was unnecessary because safe alternatives to the partialbirth abortion procedure remained available to women while the court conceded that the actual need for the partialbirth abortion procedure was uncertain it recognized that the procedure could be safer in certain circumstances and maintained that ban on the procedure without health exception created significant health risk19 in addition the court maintained that the language of the nebraska statute could be interpreted to prohibit not just the dilation and extraction dx abortion procedure the procedure commonly associated with partialbirth abortion but the dilation and evacuation procedure that is the most common abortion procedure during the second trimester of pregnancy20 the court believed that the statute was likely to prompt those who perform the procedure to stop because of fear of prosecution and conviction the result would be the imposition of an undue burden on womans ability to have an abortion justice oconnor wrote concurring opinion in stenberg in her concurrence she maintained that the nebraska statute should be invalidated because of its failure to include health exception and because of the undue burden that would be imposed as result of the statutes broad definition for the banned procedure however justice oconnor suggested that other state statutes that prohibited partialbirth abortions could possibly 16 530 us 914 2000 17 for additional discussion of stenberg v carhart and partialbirth abortion see crs report rl30415 partialbirth abortion

dilation and evacuation d procedures crs5 withstand constitutional challenge21 citing the partialbirth abortion statutes of kansas utah and montana justice oconnor contended that statute that was narrowly tailored to prohibit only the d x procedure could be upheld22 justice oconnor observed if nebraskas statute limited its application to the d x procedure and included an exception for the life and health of the mother the question presented would be quite different from the one we faced today23 questions about the future of the undue burden standard seem likely following the announcement of justice oconnors retirement chief justice rehnquists dissent in casey joined by justices scalia and thomas criticized the undue burden standard and declared that it was not built to last24 chief justice rehnquist maintained that the standard was based on judges subjective determinations to greater degree than the trimester framework25 in his dissent in stenberg justice scalia affirmed his belief that the standard was hopelessly unworkable in practice26 while it appears unlikely that the court would return to standard like the trimester framework it is not entirely certain what new standard would consider to determine whether restriction on abortion is permissible httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22198 21 stenberg 530 us at 950 22 id 23 id supreme court consideration of another case
