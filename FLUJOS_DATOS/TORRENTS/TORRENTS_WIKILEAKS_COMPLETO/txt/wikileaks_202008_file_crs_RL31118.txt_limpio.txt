specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress the child care workforce summary the labor force participation of married mothers with young children rose markedly in recent decades and contributed to the increased demand for paid child care assistance the cost of child care consequently is now an integral component of more families budgets than in years past since the enactment of welfare reform in 1996 the affordability of child care has become particularly important to growing numbers of lowincome mothers as they leave the welfare rolls for jobs congress passed legislation principally the dependent care tax credit and the child care and development block grant ccdbg that expressly subsidizes workrelated child care expenses the credit offsets portion of employmentrelated costs incurred for the care of certain dependents including children under age 13 the ccdbg is intended not only to enhance the affordability of child care services but also to improve the availability and quality of paid care provided to youngsters under age 13 in lowincome families with working or inschool parent the high labor intensity of the child care industry means that caregivers wages largely drive the fees charged parents through the early 1990s child care providers appear to have been able to meet parents increased demand for services by drawing from the plentiful pool of lowwage workers and at the same time to hold down their single largest cost the ability of the industry to continue to do both may be in jeopardy because it seemingly has had to bid up wages to attract staff while competing with other employers for the dwindling supply of available workers during the longest economic expansion in the nations history nonetheless workers in the child care industry earned just 63 cents for every dollar earned by all workers on average in 2000 among preschool teachers the portion of the child care workforce that typically has bachelors degree median earnings in 1999 were 841 an hour considerably less than other workers with college diploma the 691 an hour earned by other child care workers also was below the pay of many jobs with similar shortterm onthejob training requirements these very low wages as well as the small chance of getting betterpaying position in the field by undertaking further educationtraining and the stressful nature of the work likely contribute to the high rate of turnover among child care staff although lowpaid workforce makes child care more affordable for parents frequent job turnover inhibits the development of stable youngstercaregiver relationship which is one input for good quality care the wages of the child care workforce also appear to be positively related to the quality of care provided initiatives consequently have been undertaken to increase the compensation of child care personnel these efforts most often focus on raising the quality of child care by improving the credentials of caregivers and secondarily their pay through such means as training professional development scholarships and loan forgiveness the strategy of directly increasing the compensation of the child care workforce through retention grants or wage supplements for example is less often used governments advocacy groups labor unions and the business community among others have sometimes worked together and at other times worked separately to improve either directly or indirectly the compensation of child caregivers contents some basic facts about

and 2008 projected 9 the child care workforce perhaps one of the most dramatic changes in the composition of the labor force during the last century was brought about by women increasingly engaging in paid employment over the past few decades married mothers with children particularly young children have fueled much of the increase in female labor force participation recently 19902000 the share of women in marriedcouple families who had children under age 5 and who were members of the labor force grew from 58 to 62 similarly 76 of mothers with 514 year olds in marriedcouple families were members of the labor force in 2000 up from 72 in 19901 the now commonplace presence in the labor force of married mothers with young children in part underlay congressional passage of welfare reform in 1996 that is to say policymakers questioned why poor single mothers of young children shouldnt be induced to work if so many nonpoor married mothers currently are employed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 in turn reinforced the trend toward greater maternal employment through its implementation of work requirements for adult beneficiaries primarily single mothers of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program the heightened involvement of women in the labor force likely has decreased the availability of informal caregivers eg neighbors friends and relatives and sparked more widespread need for child care services that can be purchased in the marketplace in 1995 according to the latest published data from the us census bureau 41 of employed women with children under age 15 paid someone to look after their children in 1986 the comparable figure was 312 the cost of child care consequently has become an integral

their paychecks to this purpose child care costs absorbed 16 of the wages of families that earned 200 or less of the applicable poverty threshold in 1997 the figure for comparable families with higher earnings was 6 on average5 congress passed legislation which recognizes that the affordability of child care can affect mothers likelihood of working outside the home6 the two largest federal programs enacted to subsidize workrelated child care expenses are the dependent care tax credit and the child care and development block grant ccdbg the nonrefundable credit available to families with federal income tax liabilities offsets portion of marketbased employmentrelated costs incurred for the care of certain dependents including children less than 13 years of age7 however lowincome families eg those receiving tanf benefits are less likely than other families to make use of the credit because they more often have or low income tax liabilities and more often rely on informal child care arrangements8 the ccdbg is intended to enhance not only the affordability but also the availability and quality of child care services provided to children under age 13 living in lowincome families in which parent is either working or attending school child care assistance is not an individual entitlement and relatively few eligible children receive the subsidy eg 12 of federally eligible children

these proposals see crs report rl30944 child care issues in the 107th congress the possibility of achieving an ample supply of good quality child care at affordable prices is in part linked to conditions in the labor market for child caregivers which is the focus of this report after defining the characteristics of those who comprise the child care workforce the report analyzes the actual and projected employment pattern of paid child caregivers the earnings of the child care workforce are next examined the report closes with review of existing initiatives intended to improve the wages and benefits of the child care workforce some basic facts about the child care workforce the responsibilities of child caregivers are to nurture and teach preschoolage children as well as to look after older children while their parents pursue other activities eg jobs or school child care arrangements vary in the degree to which workers attend to the basic physical needs of their charges or engage in activities meant to develop youngsters intellectual emotional and social skills these differences in the duties of child care personnel are in part related to the age of the youngster and to the qualifications of the worker11 see figure 1 for the definition of the paid child care workforce the educationtraining qualifications of workers who care for young children vary greatly child care employees of centers and preschools for example typically are able to acquire the requisite skills for average job performance through up to one month of onthejob experience or instruction ie shortterm onthejob training in contrast prerequisite for preschool teachers typically is college education this wide variation in qualifications accords with state licensing requirements that range from high school graduation to taking community college courses to graduation from college with major in child development or early childhood education12 private employers local governments and publicly funded programs may require that child care staff possess credentials greater than those imposed by given state the jobs are considered to be physically and emotionally taxing workers often must engage in strenuous activities eg bending stooping or lifting while caring for their charges the jobs are stressful as workers need to be constantly alert in order to anticipate trouble and to effectively deal with disruptive children 11 unless otherwise noted this section is drawn from the us bureau of labor statistics bls occupational outlook handbook and related material developed by the blss office of employment projections available at httpstatsblsgovemphomehtm 12 state regulations related to the child care industry also may cover such things as healthsafety rules eg physical space and immunization requirements maximum number of children being cared for and minimum stafftochild ratios the specifics of the regulations usually differ by mode of care and some organizations eg small family day care homes may be exempt from them crs4 figure 1 definition of the paid child care workforce in this report the terms child care workforce and child caregivers encompass workers such as nannies au pairs and sitters who look after youngsters in their parents homes ie private household child care workers workers who look after youngsters in the caregivers homes ie family child care providers preschool teachers and early childhood teachers assistants the latter two occupations typically are found in centers public or private schools and religious institutions the available data sources differ in how they present information on these occupations eg one source combines preschool teachers with kindergarten teachers and another source has an occupation called child care workers that essentially is combination of family child care providers and early childhood teachers assistants for reasons of data availability the child care services industry which includes all occupations found in the industry eg managers cooks and janitors not just caregiving occupations sometimes serves as proxy for the child care workforce the industry excludes some child caregivers however eg private household child care workers and certain family child care providers the hours of child caregivers vary depending in part on their place of employment child care centers that are not under the auspices of schools typically are open year round centerbased employees put in long daily hours to enable parents to leave their children before their own workdays start and to retrieve them after their workdays end the centers which may be independent enterprises church affiliated or employersponsored often use both fulltime and parttime employees who work staggered shifts in order to be staffed the entire day public and private preschool programs eg head start also employ combination of fulltime and parttime workers but they usually are open only during the 9 or 10month school year preschool teachers in center and schoolbased programs typically spend uncompensated time beyond their scheduled hours to do such things as meet with parents and plan curriculum individuals who offer care in their own homes ie family child care providers are largely selfemployed13 and thus can have flexible hours and daily routines but they usually work very long hours or odd hours to accommodate the schedules of parents who work nights or weekends for example the child care workforce is employed parttime much more often than other labor force participants in ranking of occupations by the prevalence of persons working less than 35 hours week the bls places child caregivers in the top quartile ie occupations in which more than 27 are employed parttime according to crs tabulation of data from the current population survey cps about 40 of 13 in 2000 95 of family child care providers were selfemployed 433000 out of 457000 according to unpublished data from the current population survey cps crs5 child caregivers in 2000 worked parttime compared to about 24 of workers across all occupations14 child caregivers are selfemployed to greater extent than other workers as well about onefourth of the child care workforce in 2000 was selfemployed in sharp contrast with under onetenth of all workers in the civilian economy self employment is highly concentrated in one occupation namely family child care providers15 the numerous family child care homes and independently run centers reflects the ease of setting up child care business visavis other kinds of enterprises eg the relatively low capital investment and the comparatively limited educationtraining needed to enter the field the child care workforce also tends to be fairly young its median age in 1998 was 36 compared to 39 for all workers more child caregivers are less than 20 years old 8 as against 5 which in part reflects the occupations relatively limited educationtraining requirements in addition the child care workforce is predominantly female women constituted almost all family child care providers 98 private household child care workers 98 early childhood teachers assistants 95 and preschool kindergarten teachers 9916 in marked contrast women accounted for 47 of all employed persons in 200017 job growth and turnover among child caregivers demand for paid child care services as measured by changes in caregiver employment increased relatively rapidly in recent years based on the statistics in table 1 the number of child caregivers grew more than the number of workers across all occupations 18 and 14 respectively between 1992 and 2000 the average employment gain for all child care occupations was pulled down by the 24 decrease among private household child care workers eg nannies the relatively largest employment increase occurred among family child care providers who experienced 42 gain between 1992 and 200018 employment of preschoolkindergarten teachers expanded by 29 and employment of early childhood teachers assistants by 23 14 the prevalence of parttime employment varies among the groups that comprise the child care workforce relatively more persons who look after youngsters in parents homes or who provide care at centers work fewer than 35 hours week about 50 compared to family child care providers and preschoolkindergarten teachers about 30 15 according to unpublished cps data 98 of all selfemployed child caregivers in 2000 were family child care providers or 433000 out of 443000 16 data are not collected separately in the cps for preschool versus kindergarten teachers 17 bls employment and earnings january 2001 18 data first became available in 1992 for this subset of the child care workforce crs6 table 1 employment in child care occupations

for all these child care occupations were not available before 1992 in 2000 according to data from the occupational employment survey preschool teachers accounted for 65 of the combined teacher group b early childhood teachers assistants like preschool teachers principally are employed by day care centers schools and religious institutions an even greater increase in demand for child care services can be inferred from industry data see table 2 over the same period 19922000 jobs in the child care services industry grew almost 3 times faster than jobs across all nonfarm industries 58 and 21 respectively19 over longer time frame 19722000 employment in the child care services industry increased 5 times faster than the all industries average 388 and 79 respectively 19 employment in the child care services industry covers not only the occupations of child care worker preschool teacher and early childhood teachers assistant but also such others as manager cook janitor and bus driver

statistics establishment survey note the child care services industry includes establishments primarily engaged in the care of infants or children or in providing prekindergarten education eg child care and preschool centers and nursery schools family child care homes are included only if the provider has employees establishments in the industry generally care for preschoolers but may care for older children when they are not in school the child care services industry does not cover head start centers operating in conjunction with elementary schools establishments providing babysitting services or private households employing inhome child care although child care employment is projected to continue growing at an above average rate for the next several years demand could moderate compared to the trend over the last 2 decades because the pace of demographic changes that spurred past increases in child care enrollments is likely to slow for example the bls expects women of childbearing age to comprise smaller share of the labor force and their rate of labor force participation to rise less rapidly in the nearterm than during earlier periods the number of preschool children also may not increase very much in the next several years further dampening demand for child care services nonetheless employment of child caregivers is projected to continue growing comparatively quickly under the presumption that an increasing share of youngsters will attend early childhood education and care programs particularly if parents think these programs benefit their offspring and if government continues to directly fund or otherwise subsidize them20 the number of child care workers excluding private household workers across all industries in which they are employed is projected to expand by 26 between 1998 and 2008 see table 3 in contrast the bls expects employment growth across all occupations and industries to average 15 the shift among parents in favor of centerbased arrangements is reflected in the faster pace of job gains anticipated among child care workers and preschool teachers employed in the day care services industry 39 and 33 respectively by comparison the rate of increase among child care workers who are selfemployed ie largely operators of family child care homes could be considerably less 21 20 studies have shown an inverse relationship between the price and use of paid child care arrangements by lowering the price that parents pay such government programs as the dependent care tax credit and the ccdbg promote

supplemented by data from the cps the disparity in child care employment for 1998 found in tables 1 and 3 relate to the cps querying individuals and the oes querying employers and to differences in the occupational classification systems of the cps and the oes eg in contrast with the oes the cps does not categorize preschool teachers separately from kindergarten teachers b this occupation is combination of selfemployed family child care providers and child care staff comparable to early childhood teachers assistants from the cps crs10 the need for child caregivers is likely to remain strong not only because of growing demand for their services but also because numerous workers regularly leave the occupation in each year of the 19982008 projection period an average of 329000 positions for child care workers excluding private household workers could become available due to combination of employment growth and the need to replace persons who change occupations retire or otherwise leave the labor force eg return to school or start family similarly an average of 42000 positions for preschool teachers could develop each year for both these reasons21 as shown in table 3 employment of private household child care workers is projected to decrease by 97220 jobs between 1998 and 2008 however 115000 positions could open up annually on average because of the frequent departure of employees from the occupation looking at actual as opposed to projected experience 30 of child care workers excluding private household workers left the occupation between 1995 and 1996 the separation rate ie occupational turnover rate for child care employees in private households was an even higher 45 across all occupations in contrast occupational turnover averaged substantially lower 1722 the share of preschool teachers who left their occupation between 1995 and 1996 was much lower 8 than commonly reported figures of turnover possible explanation for the difference is that while preschool teachers frequently go from one employer to another ie job turnover they may not as often change occupations ie occupational turnover23 according to longitudinal survey of day care centers in three california communities the job turnover rate among preschool teachers between 1996 and 2000 was 75 but 42 of the teachers who left their employers moved from one center to another ie they did not leave the occupation24 compendium of data on job turnover among child care staff in numerous geographic areas shows that between 20 and 39 of centerbased teachers left their positions in 1999 or 2000 in six california counties turnover in 2000 among center based teachers was 32 in idaho 29 in iowa and 20 in maine the job turnover rate among this group of preschool teachers was between

and referral services 4 opened up family child care businesses and 7 became elementary school teachers the remaining 49 of job leavers either went into nonchild related employment 21 or they were looking after their own children fulltime 15 attending school fulltime 4 or retired 25 crs11 child care centers typically was higher than that of teachers in those instances for which data were available for the two occupations in the same areas25 even at good quality centers turnover among teaching staff could well be high eg an average of 30 in 19992000 at accredited or highly rated day care centers in three california communities26 some regard the frequent job turnover of child care personnel as matter of concern for the following reasons there is link between child outcomes and the quality of care as measured by continuity of the youngstercaregiver relationship among other factors it is not coincidence that the highquality intervention programs that have generated positive developmental effects have employed highly qualified staff and experienced virtually teacher turnover27 in addition parents must repeatedly take time to make new child care arrangements if their inhome caregivers leave if their family day care providers go out of business or if centers close or cutback on the number of youngsters they can handle due to vacancies arising from staff departures28 unstable child care arrangements can jeopardize parents ability to keep their jobs and interfere with their productivity as well moreover as child care operators must spend time and money repeatedly recruiting new employees failure to retain staff may not only lower the quality of care for children but it also may raise the prices charged parents the high turnover rates of child care staff could be associated with the short career ladder that affords them little upward mobility through additional educationtraining and thereby little opportunity to improve their wages while staying in the field the physical and stressful nature of the work including the isolation reportedly felt by family child care providers also could prompt caregivers to look elsewhere for employment some people may become family child care providers to earn money while staying home to look after their own young children they thus regard the job as temporary one and intend to move into other occupations once their own children reach certain age29 perhaps most importantly the higher pay of many other fields likely drains the ranks of the child care workforce 25 center for the child care

child caregiver wages and wage growth workers who care for young children are very low paid in 1999 the median earnings of child care workers were 691 an hour30 compared to the approximately 114 occupations that bls found to have the same educationtraining requirements ie shortterm onthejob training child care workers bring home small paychecks for example service station attendants had

the personal care and service occupational group they retain their lowpaid designation of the 29 out of 31 occupations in the personal care and service classification for which median hourly wage data are available just six earned less than child care workers31 preschool teachers whose median wage in 1999 was 841 an hour are paid less than some of the abovementioned occupations that have much more limited educationtraining requirements they also do not earn much more than other members of the child care workforce which suggests that preschool teachers are not greatly rewarded for their investment in additional education preschool teachers average earnings of 19610 in 1999 do not compare favorably with the approximately 74 occupations having the same educational qualifications ie bachelors degree such as recreational therapists 29280 child family and school social workers 31720 interior designers 38360 public relations specialists 40780 training and development specialists

occupations that are paid an hourly rate eg preschool teachers the bls constructs annual earnings by multiplying the average hourly wage by 2080 hours 40 hours per week x 52 weeks if hourly paid employees work less than full time yearround their estimated annual earnings from the oes will overstate their actual earnings as this is the case for preschool teachers their actual earnings probably

earnings of family child care providers is available34 the average annual income of family child care providers ranged from 7374 to 10000 in two california counties in 2000 the average gross annual enrollment revenue for family child care providers in the district of columbia was 18011 the average annual salary of these largely selfemployed workers in maryland was 18503 in five north carolina counties the median wage of family child care providers ranged from 408 to 630 per hour35 the heightened demand for marketbased child care services as demonstrated by the increased share of families with employed mothers who pay for child care assistance and the aboveaverage pace of job growth among child caregivers also is visible in their relative wage trend the earnings of employees in the child care services industry rose from an average of 213 an hour in 1972 to 866 an hour in 2000 or by 30636 average hourly earnings across all private nonfarm industries went from 370 in 1972 to 1375 in 2000 for comparatively smaller increase of 272 despite their aboveaverage wage gain workers in the child care industry earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by all workers on average in 2000 the real inflationadjusted wages of workers particularly those at the bottom of the earnings distribution such as child caregivers declined from the 1970s through the early 1990s consequently child care centers and family day care homes were able to hold down their single largest cost37 some have argued that the low wages of child care staff constitute supply subsidies in effect they comprise labor donation to the cost of providing child care services as 33 bls occupational employment and wages in 1999 34 neither the oes nor the cps yields information on the earnings of most family child care providers the two surveys provide wage data for wageandsalary workers but recall that 95 of family child care providers are selfemployed 35 center for the child care workforce current data on child care salaries and benefits 36 bls current employment survey ces note drawback of ces earnings data is that all persons employed in an industry regardless of occupation are included however the oes does not provide long timeseries on earnings by occupation in addition the monthly cps does not provide an accurate reflection of wages for child care workers as it covers only full time wageandsalary workers as previously noted well aboveaverage share of child care staff are employed parttime 37 labor costs ie wages and benefits averaged 70 of total monthly costs per child at centers and 64 at family child care homes according to data from the cost quality and child outcomes in child care centers study and from the study of children in family child care and relative care reported by suzanne w helburn and carollee howes in child care cost and quality the future of children v 6 2 summerfall 1996 hereafter cited as helburn and howes child care cost and quality see also morris john r market constraints on child care quality the annals of the american academy of political and social science may 1999 crs14 caregivers are forgoing the higher wages they could presumably earn in another occupation based on their education gender age and other characteristics38 the forgone earnings subsidy could perhaps have reduced the total cost per child at centers by some 20 the wage penalty for being in the child care field rather than in other occupations was estimated to be about 5200 year for preschool teachers and about 3600 year for assistant teachers however these forgone earnings may be overstated for two reasons first the researchers did not have data on the prior labor market experience of the similarly educated women of the same age raceethnic origin and marital status with whom female child caregivers were compared in order to derive the wage estimates if the other women had spent more time in the labor market than had child care personnel the pay gap and hence the labor subsidy would have been smaller than estimated second the analysis did not take into account benefits derived by caregivers that may not have been available to otherwise comparable workers one example of such benefits is discounts on child care that centers commonly provide to their employees the discounts could not only reduce the size of the penalty for being in the child care workforce but also help to explain why mothers are willing to accept jobs in this lowpaying field child care staff also might get nonmonetary benefits eg enjoyment from working with children that offset the occupations low wages and effectively narrow the wage differential39 the ability of employers to continue to meet parents increasing demand for child care services by drawing from the pool of lowwage workers may be in jeopardy however the 9 increase in the average real wage of employees in the child care industry between 1993 and 2000 suggests that employers had to bid up wages to attract staff as they competed with other employers for the diminishing supply of available workers during the longest economic expansion in the nations history40 in contrast the average real wage for all workers in the private nonfarm sector rose by slightly lower 7 according to bls as the child care industry expands or improves quality or if as has been the case during much of the 1990s the national labor market tightens it may be naive to expect more and more women to continue to work for these lower wages despite centers provision of employee discounts for child care or any predilection among women toward the field41 if child care employers try to pass on higher labor costs to parents by raising fees42 they risk bumping up against the constraint of family budgets parents could 38 helburn and

providers or small family day care homes that are exempt from regulation or some mothers could withdraw from the paid labor force this falloff in demand would likely prompt higher wage organizations to cutback their services given the positive relationship between staff wage levels and the quality of care43 the childcarecostfamilybudget constraint dilemma could mean reduction in the availability of better quality centers and preschools alternatively child care is very competitive industry and employers may have difficulty passing along their rising labor costs to parents once again higher wage organizations might have to curtail operations and thereby reduce the supply of better quality services thus it could prove difficult to attain an adequate quantity of good quality child care at prices that families can afford initiatives to improve the compensation of the child care workforce arguments to increase the compensation of the child care workforce typically are framed in relation to raising the quality of services provided as mentioned at the outset of this report the federal government provides funds for quality improvement in the child care and development block grant ccdbg in 1995 before the passage of welfare reform legislation 66 million went toward this purpose and 80 was used for resource and referral monitoring and training and technical assistance efforts to improve staff compensation which many view as an important accompaniment of efforts to improve staff qualifications via training received 1 percent of the quality funds44 since then the size of the block grant has increased greatly and states are required to devote at least 4 of their ccdbg expenditures each fiscal year to activities intended to raise the quality and supply of child care current information neither is readily available on the share of the grant that actually is going toward improving the quality of child care including the wages and benefits of child caregivers nor on the specific qualityrelated activities being funded an urban institute summary of state programs and proposals to raise child care workers compensation groups initiatives according to whether they

improve the supply of good quality child care assistance the hopedfor secondary outcome is better pay and benefits for child care staff direct strategy looks to compensation first it assumes that better pay and benefits will increase the industrys likelihood of recruiting and retaining higher skilled workers who will provide better quality care45 the indirect strategy was determined to be present in 37 states and the district of columbia at the end of 2000 included in this approach are training and mentoring programs whose purpose is not only to bring new employees into the field but also to retain experienced child care staff to serve as mentors46 some of these programs provide stipends to staff that act as mentors in eight states and the district of columbia the training programs serve an additional purpose they are aimed at tanf recipients and skills learned in the programs could help these individuals move off the welfare rolls into child care jobs47 money for training and mentoring programs comes from government sources eg federal funds from the tanf block grant and state funds through the maintenance of effort provision in the 1996 welfare reform law and from private or corporate foundations according to the urban institute report while some of these programs operate statewide others are pilot projects in select geographic areas another approach professional development for experienced caregivers is the most often used indirect strategy while 15 states and the district of columbia have training and mentoring programs professional development efforts were present in 25 states at the end of 2000 the availability of scholarships student loan assumption or forgiveness programs and financial incentives for continuing education is meant to assist those in the occupation improve their qualifications48 third approach utilized in 19 states is to increase reimbursements 45 twombly eric c with maria d montilla and carol j devita state

child care apprentices with 4000 hours of supervised onthejob training and 300 hours of classroom instruction career ladder component of the program raised the salaries of participating child care workers as their skill ability and knowledge increased 47 the us department of labor dol awarded 203000 to the ymca of the washington dc metropolitan area in 2000 to train welfare recipients to become

loan program and the william d ford federal direct loan program is forgiven based on the number of consecutive years of fulltime employment ie continued crs17 to family child care homes and child care centers to promote enrollment of low income children although more funding for targeted subsidies could increase the supply of services for these children it does not automatically lead to higher pay for caregivers numerous states use more than one of these indirect approaches policymakers in many fewer states are willing to play direct role in improving the compensation of the child care workforce at least one direct strategy was found in 12 states and the district of columbia at the end of 2000 according to the urban institute these initiatives rely heavily on public funds and often came into being after advocacy groups launched strenuous campaigns the most often used direct approach is the retention grant which is offered in five states to encourage child caregivers to remain in the field four states often as part of universal prekindergarten programs provide preschool teachers with wages comparable to those of elementary school teachers some states and localities also supplement the hourly wages of child care staff the extra pay may be tied to caregiver achieving specified level of education experience or responsibility ie the career ladder model or to caregiver who will work in an underserved area or during unusual hours four states take different approaches to increase the access of child care personnel to health benefits in two cases the states employee health insurance plan has been opened up to eligible members of the child care workforce the business community is involved in compensationenhancing efforts as well principally through indirect approaches firms are members of publicprivate and corporate partnerships that in part work toward improving the quality of child care services by for example funding training for center staff49 individual companies infrequently offer employees access to child care resource and referral services as part of their benefit packages the services provide information on the qualifications of caregivers in locality among other things which can help parents make more informed decisions about child care arrangements50 in addition to working independently with other firms or with statelocal governments employers also are involved in child care quality improvement through cooperative efforts with community groups advocacy organizations and labor unions among others51 48 continued

to these services according to the bls pilot survey on the incidence of child care resource and referral services in june 2000 report 946 november 2000 the share of state and local government establishments that provided these services 14 and the share of employees with access to these services 17 were higher than in the private nonfarm sector 51 see the following for information on the various ways in which private and public sector continued crs18 unions are attempting to organize child care staff and to directly increase their compensation through the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements with providers despite some notable successes only small share of the child care workforce is represented by unions perhaps 552 the structure of the industry ie employees scattered across numerous small employers and worksites makes organizing very difficult moreover childcare workers are currently so underpaid that they likely could not afford union dues and staff turnover in the field is so high as to discourage workers from committing to membership53 in those cases where unions are able to organize caregivers labor negotiators could well have difficulty obtaining higher wages for them at the bargaining table because child care centers ability to give in to demands for higher wages is limited by the competition from family child care providers54 for these reasons collective bargaining alone is unlikely to substantially improve the earnings and benefits of the child care workforce in concert with other groups labor unions are pursuing alternative strategies to increase the pay of child caregivers eg the career ladder model mentioned above55 51 continued organizations either jointly or separately finance child care programs mitchell anne with
