6408c13 shspec36 study and education education is acquiring knowingness in subject and an ability to act in that area the whole subject of education has as its end the accomplishment of certain doingnesses study that doesnt have that intention is only directed towards acquaintance dilletantism or doodledaddling that is not really education education is to accomplish certain things with that subject if person is educated in subject he can accomplish the results of that subject because he knows that subject this is why education in schools isnt really education at all you cant really separate education from some role some professional doingness as the end in view that is the modern quarrel with education in schools much is spent to educate students but they dont get educated people dont get educated in arithmetic because it doesnt have an end product it could have an end product but the end product hasnt been defined or described in universities the student is expected to use higher mathematics to solve problems that could actually be solved with arithmetic if arithmetic hadnt been degraded by being thought of as nothing but groundwork for higher mathematics as the purpose of subject deteriorates or is purported to deteriorate the subject itself disappears if the individual learning the subject has purpose for the subject it will die away in him live study is one that has use dead study has use you can cause subject to die away either by making its use die away or by omitting its purpose as part of the educational process ie not telling students what the subject is for this brings to mind the dissemination formula this is related to the fact that you need purpose to study something getting persons ruin and applying the formula gives him purpose for looking at the subject of scientology it is possible to become obsessive in the study of some subject that has use in talking about scientology people will think of it as subject only when they see that it has purpose that is real to them as an attainable purpose for an educational subject to continue to exist it must have purpose that can be seen to be an attainable action to the individual addressed in his view the value of subject depends upon the value of attaining its stated purpose culture is held together only by education the achievement of an education is remunerated to the degree that 1 its service is understood to be valuable this shows that some odd services are thought to be valuable eg undertaking which has survived as technical line for thousands of years 2 it is understood continuing need for subject will preserve the subject but its technology must be relayed which it will be if it is needed one could destroy subject by destroying its purpose or by destroying its technology or by adding things to its technology that are unnecessary in educating person in certain subject the longer it takes to get to the point of using the subject the more opportunities there are to fail at it this is is the reverse of the toosteep gradient cf the analogy of the runway if it is too short you cant take off but if it is too long you are likely to damage the plane on the ruts and stones before you can take off true knowledge gives correct emphasis merely theoretical knowledge will give wrong emphasis this can result in technology getting lost as would happen if for instance you studied three weeks on how to make emeter varnish and other such matters unrealities enter when you teach solutions to problems that dont exist or when you fail to solve problems that do exist by experience you learn where the problems are it is hard to teach subject with which you have immediate personal experience this is one reason why education gets bad name since most professors dont know what they are talking about those that can do those that cant teach all subjects wind up in finite doingness if subject doesnt wind up in finite doingness person cannot be educated in that subject anything that winds up in specific doingness can be educated education in the absence of the mass with which the technology will be involved is hard on people it makes them feel squashed bent sort of spinny bored exasperated sort of dead pictures of the mass would help you would expect the greatest incidence of suicide and illness where people were studying subject whose mass was absent too steep gradient gives different physiological reaction confusion and reelingness the bypassed definition gives blank washedout notthere feeling followed by nervous hysteria the eventual manifestation of this is blow from the subject for summary of these study manifestations see fig 27 below to remedy the absence of mass supply mass to remedy the toosteep gradient find the last point that was well understood and find the misunderstood right there or just after to remedy the misunderstood word get it defined and used figure 27 manifestations of study problems absent mass 1 squashed feeling 2 bent feeling 3 feeling sort of spinny 4 boredom 5 flatness 6 peeling sort of dead 7 exasperation 8 headaches 9 stomach aches 10 eyes hurting 11 dizziness too steep gradient 1 confusion 2 reelingness bypassed definition 1 blank notthere washedout feeling 2 followed by nervous hysteria 3 followed by blow from the subject this is the final manifestation gradients are more involved with doingness though they do hang off in the subject of significance but it is the action that we are interested in the misunderstood word is the most important thing in establishing someones doingness the restoration of doingness depends only on getting the misunderstood word defined and understood though to do well or with talent may vary from person to person person say doesnt know word in psychology so he cant move over into scientology the misunderstood word opens the gate to education so it is the most important aspect of study tech
