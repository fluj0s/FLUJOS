technology and hidden standards lecture given on 2 march 1965 thank you very much i take that that early applause you gotten there who was that for mary sue who was that for audience mary sue mary sue well you want to be awfully carefulyou want to be awfully careful how you encourage her ah dear shes having ball weve got reorganization going and shes taking over the point of staff training officer thats where she is from very high echelon and we is about to go organizationally mango go go and frankly ive had to clean everything off of my plate just so that i could turn out the materials necessary to carry it and i found bunch of natural laws in the field of economics which makes the subject of economicsall they had before was supply and demand you know kindergarten they found out peoplepeople exchange things so thats economics you see the second i start doing vii materialseconomies and organizations are matter of the mest universe and let give you tip if somebody around you or your organization is having trouble with organizational matters you just processed them subjectively too long it just doesnt matter how much you process them subjectively now theyre not going to go anyplace the trouble with them is objective see and you want to give them objectivetype processes not subjective and youll find their eyesight will pick up and all kinds of wild perceptive things will occur dont you see and when i get back to this point of economic zing why all weve got to do all we got tothis isnt our main line of action our main line of action remains scientology all weve got to do is write this up ive got these natural laws along this line well write some textbooks up and we formed up course up at telesurance to teach all these salesmen in the television industry its going over beautifully now after being in the run for couple of years all thats very successful all we have to do is use this swell it up as wave get it wider and wider carrier wave and next thing you know well be teaching every business executive who amounts to anything in the angloamerican world and as soon as weve got that channel being plowed openof course we havent got too much to do with that channel you dont have to worry about that channelthe fellow will be asking all the time this stuff works this stuff works this stuff works lets see wheres it come from theres some obscure mentions of the subject called scientology back of this damn thing and theyll say well thats for dont you see and well put them on demand basis of scientology in the business world thats where you come in it doesnt mean that well be going into the business world dont you see youll be going intointo the wider zones of society all this time on quite another much larger channel but this is just one of these little subsidiary channels thats leader weve taken couple three years now to plow this little line hasnt it and then all of sudden why weve got materials or product to put on this line of magnitude it should go out with crash but whats very interesting to us organizationally and much more important actually than its application in business is the fact of having isolated these basic laws of promotion organization and deliverywhat are these things and how do you straighten up the lines and exactly what actions do you take along in this particular line some years ago somebody came along and said well we ought to be able to work out dissemination techniques out of the technology of scientology youve heard that often im sure well thats now beingthatsthats been done and my plate is so doggone stacked up that trying to get it down into even its rudimentary form so that it can be issued is just flatout proposition ever since i comecame home my finger here from holding pens and that sort of thing is absolutely scarred and messed up to fantastic degree its actually you can feel it developing calluses all the way along the line andjust trying to get the materials out now some of you havewell this is the subject of the lecture so let finish off the footnotethe foreword on this your materials and so forth are coming to you with great rapidity but this administrative material is right outright out there in front because this will make central organizations and i found all the points where they dont expand and all the things which make them not expand and things that automatically contract them and how organizations after they go through emergencies always shrink in size rather than increase in sizefound all these various points so that in actual fact this technology is not the type of technology which you have in processing it is the type of technology one should tell the janitor what the formula isonly this formulas applicable to civilizationbut you tell the janitor what the formula is and ask him to look that over with relationship to his job and follow it for few days and he doesnt just sneer at you its very comprehensible to him he says hey you know thats true and the next thing you know why his lines are cleaning up like crazy and everything is going in all directions like crazy in the janitorial department his willingness to work was jammed by ignorance of the law which governed that work under its various conditions thats interesting isnt it he was never really unwilling to work but he was trying to handle his post or position in rather ineffective and stupid way which would kill it off sooner or later dont you see well there was right way for him to handle his post that he could follow bangbangbang right now you could probably have conversation i dont think with whatshisname and i forkeep forgetting his namethe rest of the world has forgotten it almost too hes got some post up here in england some kind or another some kind of secretarial post and you could probably take one of his smarter ministers and you could certainly take the opposition at the moment and you could say look youre running formula one or formulayeah youre running formula one backwards now it goes in this sequence and not in this sequence see and youre running it in this sequence and if you continue to run it in this sequence in england as you have for the last century you will continue to get smaller as nation now all youve got to do is reverse these two in sequence and instantly england will start expanding and hed look that over and its the same formula you gave the janitor see but the janitor understood so for sure this guy will understand it and even though he might louse up and do some weird things as long as he followed this particular sequence and didnt reverse it or get it out or follow the wrong condition the guys in condition of povertythis is not one of the conditions but lets just give you an ideahes in condition of poverty and he applies the condition of affluencethe formula of affluence you see well hes going tohes going to go appetite over tin cup of course thats gross thing that anybody can see but this other one is not quite as gross but its just as visible all youve got to do is run one of these formulas backwards and youll shrink collapse go bankrupt its villainous now you think im talking to you from hidden standard basis but im not im merely announcing to you that the formulas do exist and that i am writing them down and you will have copies of the policy letters which have to do with that before the textbook is issued on this particular subject and thats about the value of what the material is it means scientology organizational expansion right on out out out out up up up up and our little subsidiary lines like an administrative line that plows into the business world and so forth just readies you up new market see we can already reach it with just what weve got dont you see all right lets get out into the business world and then all of sudden create future demand so that after weve gone pretty distant in the present scope that we are operating in weve developed new scope and after that by that time we will probably have some channel into government and we can then put in some little lines into government and then make those lines bigger and so forth and there we go and you say world without war and so forth well have it very soon as long as they dont commit one before we make it and thats the rush and thats why i consider my plate so highly loaded is were operating against schedule we have however made all of our deadlines and there wont be anything happen in the immediately foreseeable future before we arrive now which is very very good news i mean its longer any question of our arriving before everything blows up because its going to take about three years for china to complete its development to blow up things and by that time well be there so it was nip and tuck proposition the questionable periods are all behind us and that we can do something about it is rather fantastic now you sit there and say well what could i do about this sort of thing its rather hard to see from personal viewpoint its an operational organizational action that is required in order to utilize and channel your activities and it requires knowledge of the basic economic laws which apply to you and which make it possible fordo your post fitting inside wider organizational structure which is running right dont you see and those combinations are the combinations required organization is important to you andbecause only in that way can you build it on up to civilization level dont you see so it goes from the individual to the single organization from the single organization it goes to what you call all scientology and it goes from all scientology to civilization see and its gradient scale and just likeyou are going to start out tomorrow and form personally without any assistance from anybody new civilization well of course that just is like telling the pc all right go ahead and run the gpms you see and hes just in off the streetthat looks impossible but when you recognize that this would permit you to straighten out where you sitright where you sitas person straighten up your economic and organizational lines as person and then move up little bit higher than that permit you to straighten up the organizational andactivities and so forth from where you sit as personwhether youre field auditor or an organizational staff member this doesnt matter your zone of influence in other words small or large you can straighten that up and all of sudden it starts going zing you see you start going zing and then it starts going zing then you realize that the component zings added together inside one scientology organization and so forth would make it go zing and then the composite of those scientology organizations all going zing of course makes scientology go that way you follow and then civilization could resist the impact and then your nextnext action of course is widening zone of influence and your widening zone of influence goes out in view of the fact that our intentions are good and are not based on anything reprehensible why well make it if our intentions were entheta to some degree and so forth dont you see we wouldnt make it we would have some success and then collapse but its foregone conclusion nowi can speak to you from the fact that its now foregone conclusionthat we will make it this was still in doubt let us say january of last year see would we make it in time well we didnt have all of our technology and we didnt have this and we didnt have that and things were in question exactly what we would do was in question and so forth well that picture has entirely changed now and there is slightest doubt of our making it now its not even question of how fast we will make it its ait isnt question of how fast we will make it because as soon as the materials are in your hands you cant actually help but make it its unfortunate you see i mean youve had it i know that here and there i will be smelling rubber as the brakes burn dont you see it wont do anybody bit of good as i just say it isnt the unwillingness to work on the part of the janitor its just he doesnt know which way to put the brooms dont you see what should he do as his first action in any given condition well if he selects the longwrong oneand the wrong selections he can make are almost infinite in an uninformed statethen what happens at professional level of professional in the intricacies of his decisions and so forth well if theres sortingout formula which he applies to any given situation that carries him through right and he knows what he reif he reverses couple of these things hes going to go wrong why there isnt much doubt about his arrival dont you see so thiswere back to the chinese poet who was very famous chinese poet and is one of the greatest of chinese poets even to this day and every time he wrote poem he would go down and talk to the old flower woman and read the poem to her and if she didnt understand it hed tear it up and if she did understand it why hed publish it and he to this day thousands of years later is the greatest chinese poet okay this is what date audience march 2nd second second of march hmm ad what audience fifteen ill bet some of you thought 14 march 2nd ad 15 and weve got ourselves little lecture here about technology and hidden standards of technology and so forth youve got in the human race and in the mind barrier called hidden standard when anyone is critical they are apparently criticizing against hidden standard of behavior they seldom tell you what the exact standard of behavior should be they never spend much time on this they just tell you what it shouldnt be your mama and your papa telling you that you were bad girl or bad boy very seldom defined for you what good girl or good boy was inwhen they did it was somein some antipathetic definition that would have upset anyone to have tried to have been good that way you see definition of good boy is somebody who eats spinach so man doesnt even have definitionwell he today doesnt have definition of what normal person is well thats easy to see how he wouldnt have this because this character normal person doesnt exist read science fiction story recently in which some fellow was the normal average of the whole civilization so they elected him president because they all wanted to relax or something and the civilization eventually collapsed theynobody knows what normal person is butand thats easy to see why not but nobody really knows what good person is good person is something that isnt defined very actively very few people write this up the commies approached it recently in trying to write up what was good communist and theyit was very interesting it was chinese effort and he was apparently somebody who wanted rewards who wanted to be anonymous who wanted credit for anything he did and was totally anonymous and was missing as far as the society was concerned i thought this was terribly interesting knowing that if somebody isnt known to some slight degree he gets reward or anything else i can think of this some poor guy in central organization who has been working down there on the address machine or something like that and hes just been doing bangup job dont you see and somebody else comes along and is appointed address incharge over his head and does perfectly horrible job you see and gets an increase in pay and is moved on up through the line and so forth and this guy keeps on running this little address machine and so forth well you say whats wrong with this bloke well theres something missing he didnt make himself known i mean thats always part of work you know this anonymity it gets somebody into awful lot of trouble dont you see whos running the address machine well he is thats all and its as crude as thisits as crude as this when he sees an executive around the organization much less the org sec and so forth he should say im the fellow who does all of the address machine work you know just as crude as that introduces himself in the business world this has become in successful areas rather interesting action in that its now courtesy for fellow to announce his name whenever he ismeets somebody else for conference dont you see shakes somebodys hands he always says his name he doesnt wait to be introduced or something like this he says john jones glad to meet you mr smithers which has just about gotten to be standard courtesy among the more successful firms so much so that esquire has started to lampoon it and so forth and it quotes one instance of saying damn it bill you dont have to keep saying bill smithers to im your father man but nevertheless we must know its step in the right direction if esquires joking about it anyway thats rather obscure that joke too we have an index in scientology of certain people fight thingstheyre almost test peopleand if they fight certain things then we know theyre good so we do them we know these people are instinctively trying to knock us in the head so if they criticize certain actions which we undertake then we look these actions over very carefully for potentially successful actions it isnt the sole reason we use but oddly enough over the years it could have been do what your enemies protest always do what your enemies protest and its crude test and its not perfect formula of success and its not any natural law but it nevertheless would get you through somehow when you had other line of judgment for instance the examination systemthese little tests and systems are quite interesting as they weave through the societythe way they choose doctors to get top doctors knowing well that the examination system just doesnt work in the field of medicinethe theoretical examination only with practical application dont you see of course doesnt work in actual fact appointments to major hospitals are usually measured on the fellows position on the football team look it over for minute you talk about wildly gone test see they have other standard which is reliable and if you think the standard over for moment as medical doctor was telling just last night its not too bad standard its preferable to weighted standard which doesnt turn out result so the standard that you could use in that particular instance well lets see we dont know whether he was examined fairly or unfairly we dont know whether he was good bad or indifferent we dont know whether weve got fellow with initiative or initiative we dont know what kind of fellow weve got well what was hiswhat was his position in the realm of sports in the medical college and so forth oh he was captain of the football team well very good thats theout of these candidates thats the man we want yet the fellow was supposed to be an orthopedic surgeon this would be his qualification for an orthopedic surgeon dont you see given the fact that he got through the medical college they have then other security on how to rate the man so they merely takehe must have been popular he must have been fairly well physically coordinated he must have been able to get along somehow and he must be somewhat extroverted in order to be in this position but maybe he waswhen we apply this to basketball this would of course in the united states give us only surgeon generals in hospitals who were six feet seven so its not very good way to define it and youll find examination and selection of personnel gets into trouble continuously for lack of standard lack of standard there is proper standard the hospital is blaming the university but just as i found that some of our nonexpansion and so forth was traceable to the fact that my plate was too fullin other words the nonexpansion was traceable right there under my chin and yours too dont you seebut nevertheless it was traceable to my chin there it was you know and if i couldnt handle certain of these itemsif i didnt have time to handle certain of these itemsit would cripple expansion dont you see i had to make then way to do this so they blamewhereas i might have blamed the organizations or the field auditor which i didntyou know say well the reason were not expanding is hes not working seeall the time all the time holding on to the materials in front of here that he needed vitallytheres troops on the front linetheyve got neither guns nor ammunition dont you see or directions of how to load them if they did have dont you see nobodys even pointed out the enemy and so on and all of that directional action and coordinative action is stacked up on one plate not done see not digested there it is so of course how could you expect him to do anything well the medical university is blamed of course then by the big general hospitals for not making it plain which is the best student well when we get down to this this is another operation of the hidden standard in other words the medical hospital is running hidden standard on the university because the medical hospital is not telling them what an optimum surgeon is now theyd have to havebefore they could demand of the medical university what was good doctor or good surgeon then they would have to have complete map of this individual and theyd say now you give somebody who fits these characteristics and he will be appointed at once to our staff they would have to do this but they dont do this its almost human foible that they dont do this its general they set up hidden standard they dont say and then they say to somebody else deliver it im not going to tell you what boojum isremember the old joke from way back im not going to tell you what boojum is but youve got to give some thats the hidden standard at work and youll find it all through now youve got thenyouve got this situation where the individual is not able to know whatswhat hes supposed to deliver if everybody stands around and says give some boojum and then he doesnt know what boojum is and so on why he gets into sort of spinny confused state and the wife says well youre not successful husband and he goes around holding his head in his hands saying im not successful husband well its very interesting because he hasnt got clue what successful husband would be what was husband you could probably handle all marital relations just with that datum of the fact that people run hidden standard on others and that you to straighten up that situation only need to demand to know the standard you do this sometimes out of rancor and so forth in debate and so forth all right well what is good boy dont you see but if you were to make wife who objected to her husbandnow we know technically its because she hasnt understood him and got overts but thats the mental aspect well talk about the viiththe viithyou see the physical universe aspect of here the level vii what exactlythe relationship of the spirit to the physical universe what exactly is she demanding be out there in front of her thatwhat is she demanding be out there in front of her and youre liable to find all kinds of things now you run into this as aoh you could make her define it and youd straighten up all sorts of things youd find out it was supposed to be cary grant dont you see or rudolph valentino and hes been dead for years very hard to furnish so itsit gives an apparent atmosphere of dissatisfaction and people who are going around in state of dissatisfactionperfectly all right for people to be dissatisfied thered be challenge in the environment unless they were but if you wanted to do something about this and so forth the thing to do waswould be to discover what they would be satisfied with and there youre going to pull the longest comm lag in history on some people theyre going to sit there for hours man for hours they cant tell you now we used to have processes that handled this sort of thing with auditors now you as an auditor come up against this very very often very very often and you as an auditor have to face up to pcs who are running hidden standard on you all the time and you have somebody that say only l ron hubbard could audit meand youve run into this character large majority of you haveare actually looking at somebody who is running some kind of hidden standard but you never probably realized he was also running hidden standard on see not only you but too and lord knowslord knows what his standard for is and even more intimate to the situation is lord knows what his standard for you is now you say well its hardly worth dreaming up because it has something to do with saint peter or the archangel michael or something like this youd have to be the virgin mary to audit him you know you must realize that when you look at that situation you are not looking really at standard but perversion so you could be more specific and call it hidden perverted standard but nevertheless he does have standard so we could call it standard but its hardly real enough to merit very serious acknowledgment on our parts and we make mistake when we dont rather seriously acknowledge this fact because its the unacknowledgment of the standard which he holds which has held it parked on the time track nobodys ever acknowledged this standard you see shes always demanded that her husband bababababa and its probably something silly andso that if she in any lifetimeits probablyyou know and the other thing is is they carry these on for lifetimes even when they address you the auditor its for years theyoh ages and ages and ages theyve had this same standard that anybody who was going to do anything for them had to dont you see and then its blankblankblank and in this case the wife you see in order to have husband that she could have any faith in the husband would have to blankblankblankwell whatever it is dont you see and if she announced this originally way back in lord knows what lost eons to some fellow he probably laughed at her its probably something silly dont you see you know its like if you were really husband why on saturday morning at 930 you would bring red roses of course he cant do it because he doesnt know this is what she requires she has forgotten this because the first time she ever announced it i would really realize you cared for if every saturday morning at 900 or 930 you brought in vase full of red rosesand it must be in green vase and so forthand then i would know exactly where i stood with you and when you stop doing this i will realize that youve gotten tired of dont you see and we will set this up as code system maybe it worked once or twice you see very successfully and then all of sudden she met some fellow and she said this is the code symbol and of course it was rather sillyif it had much to do with love it would be silly id hate to replay some of my own very youthful conversations in this particular line when i say youthful i mean way back on the track when i first got mixed up with humans i probably sounded very silly itssufficiently that today i always have little bit of hard time writing dialogue of that character in stories when i do write stories and so on i have trouble with it so it obviously is something that gets you in trouble anyway it was some silly standard of this particular character and this bird laughed in her face didnt acknowledge it nonacknowledgment so when you add up these various inventions and characteristics you must realize that not one of them has ever been acknowledged if they are now still in existence theyve not been acknowledged they have been refuted or protested and so the standard is the collection of nonacknowledgments that the person holds in some zone sphere or activity its this collection of nonacknowledgments now if you wantnow this goes further than that see acknowledgment is quite mechanism if you want to end cycle of action you acknowledge but let show you something that if you dont want to end cycle of action dont acknowledge this has terrific application to auditing theres such thing as halfacknowledgment which is actually continue an encouragement this has had part of our interest in our own technology we use this the halfacknowledgment you seethe encouragement the mmhm mmhm mmhm and people who acknowledge that way very often wonder why on earth people talk to them forever they shouldnt blame the person talking to them forever they just never have acknowledged what the person said and they go on mmhm mmhm well hmm well well mmm mmmm mmm hmm and next thing you know the poor bloke talking to him and so forth finds hes got dry throat and his head is starting to ache and just realizes suddenly hes not being received or acknowledged dont you see if hes not received hell arc break and if hes not acknowledged hell go on talking you see to that degree then he is trapped in this cycle all right acknowledgment very full acknowledgment of any given cycle ends it and nonacknowledgment continues it hidden standards are merely collection of nonacknowledged things theyve never been acknowledged so therefore theyre kind of goofy you see if nobody ever agreed with them never acknowledged them and so forth why naturally theyd be pretty nutty so all these hidden standards are nutty and they form some of the most interesting bricabrac that you ever saw disassociated on one sheet of paper when you start writing them down they just dont seem to bear any resemblance to anything dont you see well thats because they come from civilizations we know not what of anymore thats because they come from customs and peoples that we have contact with and the person himself has forgotten where it came from anyhow dont you see or who he was when he first collected it but the common denominator of all hidden standards is that its nonacknowledged material its not that its protested or suppressed nothing violent about this its just that its never acknowledged do you follow thats why people tend to get uglier after certain period than prettier nobody ever says my how ugly you look today nobody ever does goodness i certainly see youve been putting on weight lately thank you dont you see and one of the fixations into the form of human body and so forth is because nobody ever says to him well i see youve become man this lifetime gertie good for you if it was discovered early on the track it would have been on the basis of what youre man this lifetime thisthese nonacknowledgments as we come up the line now this is very applicable to registrars very applicable to your handling of pcs very applicable to handling of students and that sort of thing its reallyits really hot material and this is borderline on organizational material this is just borderline however its not one of the laws if you acknowledge the person before he arrives in any way shape or form he wont arrive and i discovered this in 1952 quite accidentally on looking back over 1951 i found outi was working on whole track research and in 1951 on study of situation which i was making at that time i found out that my own work had never prospered better and that things for certain period of that time had never run better this was true within limits see it was compounded by the fact that i wasnt on deck too and that messed it up butnever answering procurement lettersif i never answer personal letters they arc break with but procurement lettersnonanswering of procurement letters had resulted in more people coming in for auditing than when procurement letters were answered you say well there must have been lot of silly answers before that there justnobody answered them very much but there was an attempted mail line along this line in the early foundations but in that particular zone and period there was attempt of any kind to answer any such letter as i want some processing and i will be in next august there was slightest attempt and more people came in you explain it all right well all these years later theres the explanation see thirteen years later theres the explanation nobody ever acknowledged their intention and so asised it and so ended its cycle person intended to come in they wrote to the organization and said so then if somebody there answered up and said good thank you fine all right oh youre going to come in well thats very good thank you so much it probably left him in bit of daze and they never arrived but the person who said im going to come in for processing one of these days who had received letter well weve got lot of auditors available at the beginning of the month i hope to see you they probably would arrive very expeditiously and youd never dare put an acknowledgment in procurement letter justor nobody will ever appear for training or processing if you acknowledge too heavily you can just cut it down to nothing and thats something youd better find out as an auditor this guy says you know id like some processing good for you fine thats the end of his auditing the right procedure is just severeis very very good courtesy tell him how much and where and that you hope to see him there if anything little doubtfully well so many hours thatll becost you about five hundred dollars and the usual auditing periods are in the afternoon and i will be available next week do you have any time next week well the person says well yes yes i do have dont say good see say all right well see you probablyprobably see you monday morning then huh i hope so and the person will come on in and be audited do you follow that this applies also to such things as appointments lets take military appointment the laziest people in the world are military people i know ive been one you in actual fact get the most action out of one when hes working toward being something and get the least action when he is it so you commission themand the military is peculiar then as being one of the laziest areas known to man would then be investigatable from the standpoint of what makes it that waythats because they issue commissions the man is lieutenant he is captain he is major hes commissioned as major that finishes it thats an acknowledgment that finishes it right there he doesnt have to work to be major now he doesnt have to keep going to run the company he doesnt have to do anything else he is major and of course these are the most cocky overbearing insufferable people with regard to rank you ever had anything to do with thats all theyve gottheyve arrived so youre dealing all the time now it sounds very funny and i wont try to phrase this expertly or usably or anything else but their commission should read you have been captain and thereby are qualified to work toward the rank of major isnt that fascinating youre qualified to work toward the rank of major now this would thank him and wipe out all the monkey business and upsets and so forth of his captaincy and would be very kind thing to do and youve given him something to work toward on his next rank unfortunately youre going to see this function ofa type of this sort of thing in organizations in their appointments and so forth youll see some shadow of this but it operates like magic the old businessman who doesnthe is he is the general manager leaves him only thingone thing to work for man and thats the next post up which makes him of course sort of revolutionary bloke and overthrows the board and does various things but he ceases to do that and one day he realizes that hes working toward retirement hes got to have something to work toward so he can work toward vacation or he can work toward retirement of course when hes reached retirement hes had it because there is rank higher than retirement theres nothing to go forward to so theres nothing to attain so there is future and you could actually look over actual statistics on this of the number of blokes who kick the bucket immediately after being retired and you can assign it to many things and you just better assign it to acknowledgment thats where it belongs retirement is an acknowledgment of his total active life reward and acknowledgment for your total active life youre an active human being thank you is what its saying see nobodys ever wished him any further longevity see that acknowledges that and that aloneof course there are many other contributing factorsbut thats the central factor an acknowledgment of his total active existence would finish him an acknowledgment in the form of military commission of major of course makes major it doesnt havethe guy has future and he has place to go makes the military very conservative now you could say eventually he will become lieutenant colonel light colonel by the selection system or he will become something by the selection system he hopes and lot of those boys are working on it on career basis but how many of them around are there who dont work on it on career basis its funny thing because its an invitation to overthrow their superiors you want to know why they have mutinies at sea and in armies and that sort of thing well thats the basic reason nobody ever said to anybody when he was advanced to lance corporal thank you for having been private you are now entitled to work toward lance corporal while wearing the chevrons and so forth of lance corporal you can become lance corporal now wein organizations and so forthwe have to differentiate between the being and the hat probably not occurred to many people in organizations and so forth that there is hat called d of t and the only way that person can get in trouble is to be george smith while hes pretending to be the d of t the d of t is set of beingnesses and lines and actions and policies all by itself and that is the d of t and then theres being who runs the d of t hat now the only way he can get in trouble is to be george smith miscalling himself d of t see hes operating like george smith one hundred percent of the time and never operates as anything but george smith dont you see someday well have d of t called george smithi can see it now but dont you see hes only george smith he has familiarity or knowingness with regard to what this hat is so of course he cant wear it hes not studied it or something like this you see so he goes around operating as george smith he isnt even operating as let us say an hca or an hpa either he isnt wearing that hat either well this would make pretty random training department and i think youd object to it and would be one of the first ones to object to this training department because the hat of d of t is the functioning hat there and it is not being worn well the funny part of it is it must be in the process of being attained always in order to get hat on you must put it into the process of being attained very peculiar because the attainment is an acknowledgment the second that you mention that its been attained why that is the end of that do you follow now youve given the guy future youve cut off the finished cycle of action he doesnt study it anymore he sits back and relaxes and the hideous part of it is he may be sitting back and relaxing as the d of t now you have hat d of t which is apparently being worn because you dont have george smith you cant really detect smithisms and yet the d of t hat isnt running so you wonder what on earth has happened here and you get condition of noncompliance not to go off into organizational matters this all applies to hidden standard do you see that these mechanismsthe only thing im showing you is these mechanisms of acknowledgment have great deal to do with life and existence and theres some rather astonishing things to find out about that you have to be very careful what you acknowledge as an auditor and very careful to acknowledge certain things and therefore your acknowledgment cant always be good because its sometimes insulting little arthur tells hes had horrible day at school i dont dare tell him good do you see because he gets upset with im insufficiently sympathetic to be talked to dont you see and i sayi say something onwell making sure that i did well you had horrible day at school im sorry about that im really sorry about that well at least its an ended day isnt it yes thats right hes already told about it ive received it and to that degree acknowledged it and it instantly goes onto the backtrack in other words you as person or you in an organization or you in civilization have the power to put somebodys past on the past track and to give them future and if you want to kill them dead and so forth why you never fail to acknowledge everything with crash and this of course gives them future future future future and you havent got them stretched out on the trackyouve got them stacked up on the track supposing you always acknowledged well im awfully glad youre going to be painter thats fine thats very very good career thatspainting is good career thank you for being painter or even thank you for dreaming up the idea of being painter guy would feel suddenly lost he wouldnt quite know what happened to him well youve cut his future out from underneath his feet you could do this the thing to do is worry about how hes going to become painter and youll find him take off in steep spiral they just go zing right on upstairs on the subject you dont be doubtful about it well all right youre going to be painter eh that soundsyoure going to be painter you say whatwhatwhats the best schooling or training for that kind of career you know whats the best schooling or training and get involved in some deep argument about what would be the best schooling and what would be some style that would be best to master or something of this character and just keep on talking in that line and then when you break it off of course acknowledge the conversation not the action well it was good talking to you see that puts the conversation on the backtrack and doesnt leave him hanging with it see theres fine art here involved with the handling of acknowledgment and you could handle your environment quite markedly and quite remarkably with acknowledgment its something that needs quite bit of study but it is an interesting weapon and it is very interesting way to help and it has many many uses and many ramifications and many complexions now recognize then that something that had quite few uses and so forth would be very easily gang agley on the backtrack very very easily go off into the wild blue yonder very easily get perverted bevery easily get twisted very easily get messed up when it gets messed up then you have thing called hidden standardis one of the many things which arise out of the immediate result amnesia is one of the things that arises out of it guys shotthats too much of an acknowledgment for his former lifetime so of course he forgets it thats the basic mechanism behind not remembering past life now things that arent acknowledged because they were totally out of agreement while good things that were in agreement were acknowledged bring about condition where everything disappears out of the persons past except the nonacknowledged things that people thought were silly or something of this sort or protested or were upset about and so this gives you decay of personality as the fellow moves along time track therefore whether you had gpms or notand the gpms account for itim not talking to you about what you might call native aberration person would be subject to these things anyhow but not to any vast degree and he would be able to recognize them and do them and undo them almost at will dont you see you couldnt do very much to guy to hold him down but he will nevertheless be prone to these things if he didnt know these things he could use these tools the wrong way to you see and get into mess againbut not to the serious degree that he did but he would find himself going downhill little bit and so forth well he should know some of these things and one of them is he would have tendency to collect all those things which were never acknowledged now thats because of course he has some dependency on the communication formula when youve licked that why of course youve probably risen above this line but i still think you will want to communicate with somebody and as long as you have any desire to communicate with somebody or do communicate with somebody to any degree or are having an association with anybody you will be liable to certain parts of the communication formula one or another and when they go awry why something is really going to go awry you see that you dont retain this as aberration is the future state of affairs you wont retain it as aberration you see it wont go on and on and on and you wont be aberrated on it forever but one could regulate his conduct and so forth by knowing what parts of the communication formula were good and what parts were bad what parts would natively get him into trouble and wouldnt get him into trouble in other words if youre going toif youre going to associate with your fellow beingand we can assume jolly well that you willif youre going to associate with your fellow being why you are then going to have to use communication formula and you can work it out any way you want to its going to wind up as the communication formula you could have it threeway and try to dream it up in seventeen different ways but you would eventually come around to the same communication formula that youve got which is cause distance effect with intention and attention and so forth and this can have certain things go wrong with it nothings going to change about that and therefore the material im giving you now is native aberration rather than madeup or agreedupon aberration and so on well the agreedupon aberration and so on gpms and so on they have tendency to hold enough foundation so that the bank tends to retain these minor aberrations which collect you see and you get hidden standard now basically youre talking about what is insanity well insanity could be two things it could just be this collection of unacknowledged things or it could simply be the outright overt commands in the gpms you see to be nuts which exist you see in the gpms and youve got then direct source of direct aberrationgot direct source of direct aberrationand then youve also gotthats the gpms and the basic reactive mind you seeand youve got this other thing which could stem from native condition of the being hes liable to this type of aberration see now when you get both of those things working together the gpms or the basic reactive bank can hold the collected aberrations or nonacknowledged things and so on in firm position and make them assume tremendous importance and make them quite aberrative so insanity actually could be defined at first surface glance dont you see as just that collection of things which have never been acknowledged and the person is not in agreement with the physical universe about i refer you to many years ago weve had many lectures on this subject person isif nobody agrees with anything person does of course hes crazy they all brand him as crazy well they dont acknowledge those things and they dont realize that what he is doing is the collection of things which have never been agreed with and therefore never been acknowledged now knowing that about aberrationknowing that about aberrationyou can actually take aberration apart bit by bit in almost anybody well you know that hes going to run into aberration at the level of level vi and level vii and youre going to have this type of aberration appear which is just collection of notagreedwith things in other words youve got two areas that you can work with here its either the areas which are from the fundamental bank and fundamental universe those areas and youve got another area which is the incidents of livingness the accidents and incidents of livingness and what happens to him in the progress of life of course thistheres doubt about it that thats about eight billion to one but the funny part of it is that its eight billion volts worth of reactive bank you see and only one volt worth of accumulated locks see that would be the relative effective power of the thing to make him run crazy you see the bank is there that is it but theres this other you see theres this one volt proposition tooits also there thats this native liability for the collection of aberration by the thing that nobody agrees with certain holdings and so on that he does nobody ever acknowledges these things and so on well thats there well of course when an individual is very pinned down youll find that the reverse is what he thinks it is you see he thinks that its the one volt worth which has got the billion volts of charge in it and that the bank itself couldnt possibly be making him do anything like this it must be life it must be the fact that his mother denied him peanuts all during his youth that makes him crazy and so on youve seen people around theyre always assigning their aberration to what they can confront and they cant confront very much and so you listen to former schools of the mind and youll get the rather interesting view of man is this little flimsy straw in the wind you know corporal coughs unduly hard one night on night patrol and it frightens person so much that hes been shock case in mental hospital ever since you see and you get an idea that man and beings are not hardy and that they cant stand up to certain kinds of mental shocks matter of fact they can but theyve already stood up to too much shock just by the basis of having reactive bank now therefore you can take human being apart or handle human being and so forth in two different ways you can unburden the charge of the reactive bank which is to say clear off these locks key them outhowever you want to call this thingbut just detach them from the reactive bank get them sort of blown up and put into place and proximity and so onand by doing this you tend to key out the reactive bank so that its not immediate because these little locks make connection between the individual and the bank dont you see and so you could knock those out and you could sort of pat the bank back into place and the individual will feel pretty good and hell tell youhell look pretty good and so forth and of course thats eight billion times what anybody has ever been able to do before for human being and this is so fantastic you know many people dont realize that whats gone up is not the delivery weve been delivering pretty well at the level which we were delivering but whats gone up is what we could deliver and this has gone up so high and the nomenclature that describes it is so unchanging and the states which can be attained are so unimaginable and undreamed of dont you see that it looks like maybe we havent delivered the lower states do you see how this could be there have been people cleared up of aberration since time immemorial which is all that clear meant well clear would just be this matter of kicking out these little things keying them out disconnecting the fellow from his bank giving him better more rational look at the existence permitting him to perceive the physical universe around him and after awhile why he considers hes pretty much human being compared to what he was before see we leave out this comparative thing were now running you see the human standard on thei mean the hidden standard on the person you follow that so nobody will then admit that you have reached any state because nobody has ever told you what state you were supposed to reach in the first place that is to say amongst your fellow human beings what state were you supposed to reach and then the hidden standard with regard to state people have tendency to put the hidden standard in place of the actual standard if you want to know what state of clear is its just free needle with the tone arm at the male or female read thats all the state of clear is there isnt any other standard connected to it not today you see this has been the test for clear for many many many years and if you keep rushing at it and plunging at it all the time and hammering at this individual and running processes over his head of course his tone arm is going to go up and the needles going to stick if you keep trying to assign his aberration to the wrong areas and you dont just key out the thing and so forth why youre going to make his tone arm climb hes going to feel worse hes not going to be clear do you follow so this kind of cycle sets in you finish him up in session he feels good then he runs into the human race after the session and they run hidden standard on him and they maketry to make him prove that hes maybe now in better state this medical doctori almost laughed in his face last night i actually did i smi smiledi went on talking to him but i almost roared in his face he had the castiron nerve to ask to prove the workability of scientology and actually my jaw dropped you know now of course these guys are in the dark on this sort of thing and so forth and all that and we can understand all that but nobodys done that to for years he set uphe wanted to do some kind of an experiment and so forth and i know why he wanted to do an experiment hes in trouble one way or the other cause he brings this up every time he talks to he wants some auditing sooner or later im going to have to audit him or get somebody to but this bird this bird was asking for proof well the day passed long time agolong long agoabout proof and the public and so forth that suddenly starts telling you that you should prove to them it works and so forth well at least be up to reality where you feel like laughing at them because its whatall they deserve now anything thats been in existence and been shot at this hard for period of fourteen years must have been workable all the way along the line to some degree or anothermust have been more workable than other areas and zones of workso the comparison must have been pretty good and anything that went up from few hectograph copies of little tiny book to organizations on every continent with comm lines that reach from here to the moon certainly i9 not an unworkable activity if it were totally fraudulent activity the government would have shot us down long before they still try but they flub they miss theyre missing all the time they cant make it we couldnt ever stand up to any attacks if we were that way and yet we just stand up to them all and sooner or later they all blow over but the point herethe point hereis that we must have been better and we must have been furnishing more service and the funny thing i woke up to the other day is the fact that scientology done very wrong is far better than anything man ever had before thats something for you to wonder about i mean it could be alterised to fantastic degree and still work you know well what it will do when it isnt alterised is fantastic see i mean its exclamatory and it really in the public view has never emerged into that state but in the state its been in it has built an empire of considerable size so somebody coming up to you and saying well prove that it works start laughing because its funny its funny what proves that something works is demand if it didnt work there wouldnt be any demand i know i can do an awful fast sales talk i know that but believe people getting faster sales talks than im giving them right now and its brought right into their home at vast expense by tv the american medical association spends far more money blowing up the doctor far far more money advertising the doctor and so forth than we ever dreamed of and their sales talks are so fantastically greater than at my highest points of optimism face it really fantastic the comparative line and theyre shrinking and were growing theyre shrinking and theyre advertising an appeal budget and organizational setupand the budgets and so forth they get from governments are utterly fabulousand theyre shrinking theyre about to fall apart in england did you ever realize that this symptomof fall apart they permitted themselves to be taken over by government now they want out now theyre striking striking against the government what kind of position what are they some mendicants or something or other carrying banners outside of parliament pay us more money so we wont starve thats very very shabby look for professional organization frankly they are going to pieces you say well they couldnt possibly be and so forth well they never look better before theyjust before they fall on their heads they have decided to become monopoly they have decided all sorts of things and all of these things backfire theyre not delivering if you go out amongst the public and count public noses if you counted scientology group counted noses youd find some small percentage in that group had not had delivery see itd be small percentage in the group lets just take random group someplace or another i dontwouldnt even venture what the figure was because id never done it see not like gallupcant make it up according to which party pays the most but i know if you went into the general public which is the doctors group right now about healing and so forth and counted noses youd get nothing but sour grapes the figure would be fantastic the percentage would be quite reversed the number of successfuls would be our number of failures and our number of successfuls would be their number of failures you see and the percentage would be just reverse youve got to deliver thats all there is to that now what is delivery well delivery is tremendously interfered with with this idea of hidden standard youll find out that sales talk or what youve offered to the individual has nothing to do with it being clear being release being anything else has nothing whatsoever to do with it at all this is all pale shadow theres reason to talk to them about this because theyre going to set up hidden standard around this thing to some people clears are ots and to some people guy perfectly willing golly he doesnt have an excruciating pain across his eyesthank heaven hes now clear dont you see another bird why hed have to be twice as tall as the empire state building you see and be able to do ballet on the top of milk bottletheres all kinds of these things and you say what are all these definitions of clear well let tell you frankly you cant settle one down it bucks straight up against the hidden standard see you cant settle this thing down because youve talked to man basically about freedom and his optimum state that he envisions for himself and thats different practically for every human being there is he has to find his own optimum state but you use this statement of clear and it means what it is its an adding machine term and you clear off certain aberrations and you clean off the reactive bank of the accumulated locks which are also part of the bank but connected intimately to the individual that key it in you clean those things off you had cleared those things one after the other dont you see and when youve gone as far as you can go in that direction and this is pretty clean and it will show on the meter as floating needle andi remember i was clear as bell i dont know several years ago you didnt know i ever heard thisbut i was demonstrating the emeter during one of these lectures and so forth and i put myself on the emeter and herbie was sitting overway overcornerto the side where he could see the meter well the needle was floating and it had been floating for some months because i hadnt gone on with investigation in any other upper line it was about the time i was taking off into the total investigation of reactive banks and goals you see which of course messed the tone arm read up so hes sitting over there he told mary sue afterwards oh theres something about this i forgot exactly what it wasi overheard thisfirst i heard his brain go snap and i looked back at the meter quickly to see what he had seen you see and the needle was floating you see back and forth well itd been like that for long time i could probably put it back into that condition rather rather easily and so on im just not particularly interested in it is so variable on read it all depends on exactly what ive been doing in the last twentyfour hours with the reactive bank of what the meter reads itll read anything from 50 to 25 dont you see and the needle practicallyknocking on woodjust wont tighten up that is very often very difficult to doto get the needle so that it will read properly i have to key something in to get read all right so that gives you standard youve got standard youve got meter which will behave in certain way and you say all right well thats clear thats about the only thing you could say well are you worried now about getting worse im not now worried about getting worse scientology works im not worried about getting any worse good youre release the only standard that you could have would be this type of standard now youre going on up to vi and youre going on up to vii and so forth those standards are very obvious theyre very very apparent and they of course soar well above the hidden standard but take long time to attain because theres so darn much coal as mcpheters was saying the other day to shovel out of the way and he just was trying to see little distance between himself and the coal pile well hes only been at it month or soguys being lousy optimist youre going to see distance between yourself and the coal pile how can you see distance between yourself and the coal pile you have to rake the coal over to yourself so you can burn it up youre the only flame around there now hes never looked on the other side of the coal pile if he looked on the other side of the coal pile and hed find that side was getting less distant see but hes always on this side of the coal pile pulling it in toward him and its pretty arduous and you go through various phases and so forth and you never went through so many changes of beingness in your life and its pretty arduous and you canyou getyou get to battling around with this stuff its very discouraging in some instances extremely discouraging because you can startall of sudden your eyes just start burning and burning and burning and burning and so forth and you feel terrible and youre all exhausted and so on the only crime you can pull is not taking responsibility for your own case and picking up meter and finding out what its all about because youll find it out sometimes it takes you two or three four days to find out sometimes it takes you couple of weeks to find out what the devil you straighten that out and then because youre now in an erasure see this is an erasure condition negative gain youre always experiencing negative gain you never realize how much better you are than yesterday because youre experiencing negative gain thats longer wrong with you so of course you are not now worrying about it and youre aware of the fact dimly and all of sudden youll hit something where the gradient goes up suddenly little steeper and youll become aware of the fact that youve made sudden gain or one day itll suddenly occur to you that you longer have hole through the back of your spine you see you say hey theres hole in the back well thats very interesting now as you were saying about politics you were talking about i mean just have more concern to you than that see things are only of concern to you when theyrewhen they are pushing at you or having an effect on you things are not of concern to you if they are not having any effect on you and particularly if they never again will have any effect on you ever and believe methat you become very disinterested in you see there was only misery there to remember so when the misery is all gone there isnt even anything to forget fantastic situation but hidden standards operate as to who you are going to be in order to audit them hidden standards exist with regard to what condition they should be in in order to have had ease gain hidden standards exist for any condition you have described to them as better condition in scientology and hidden standard exists for known standards now take it up to there because the individual becomes so aberrated about this or another type of condition that after youve said it is pink sheet that is the standard which we require pink sheet they keep bringing you in green ones they say is this what you wanted send something off to printer someplace and get the chitchat back and forth between you and the printer of what you want youve described to them cleanly and clearly that you want paperback of certain dimensions and so forth well usually they can encompass this but you say heavy paper and they give you light and you say big type and they give you small and you do thattheres always some wild point here well theyre altering your standard well they dont know theyre doing it well thats with visible mest object that theyre doing this so think of how much more easy it is to do for an actual standard to exist out here someplace to be totally misunderstood and misapplied well thats because the individual with his concatenationhis string of nonacknowledged ideasadds up to nonobservational point he cant observe from this point he cant tell how he is he doesnt know what youre saying to him as to how he should be and hes just all mixed up and hes just like fire drill in the swiss navy see mess completely now what would he do what would he do well he will do one thing he will keep on trying to bail himself out providing hescan seehe isnt overwhelmed by that he is asked to bail or providing you dont give him nothing to bail in other words if you dont give him too much to bail out of the rowboat at time and if you dont give him toowell nothing to bail out of the rowboat at all thats auditing then you get to the happy condition ofhe will continue to bail within the realm of his understanding and ability to confront and if you dont exceed that amount of bailing required he will eventually float thats all you have to remember its just bailing at all thats verboten too much bailing demanded all at oncecant confront it doesnt even see that its there and so forth up to his neck in water and he saysor you say all right now just get bucket from someplace and take all the water and throw it over your shoulder and get rid of it and hes up to his neck in water and he says well iover my shoulder i cant do that in that way you dont even qanda with his hidden standards now very often when an individual sits down and tells you that this has got to be run and thats got to be run and something elses got to bethe pcand this has got to be run and i cant make any advance unless this is run or thats run or something else is run and so forth all youre doing all youre doing is trying to match up to some unimaginable hidden standard that he himself cant even grasp and the guy who sits down and sets as his session goalyoure going to do an assist you see hes hurt his footand he sets as his session goal he just gratuitously sets session goal and he says well he says i want to make ot in this session well of course hes just gone crazy on the subject which is just anotheranother variation of hidden standards so the only thing you can do is to assign very exact action which is to be done in order to attain an acknowledgment and that goes in little cycle and it goes in big cycle in other words it goes in process cycle youve started this process and you assign this action and then you now tell him that that process is complete when it is complete the tone arms gone out of it its complete all right level 0 why hes longer getting comm lags and he can answer and do these things easily thats complete so you say that process is complete you can do that you see he was able to do it and he did it until he was able to do it very very well and if you carried it on much further hed be bailing nothing dont you see and you give him too high level process and of course hes given too much to bail too suddenly and hes got himself condition now where he can work see well you run this process this is the process we run this is the next process we run all right this is the next process we run and then now youve run all of the processes of this level and we give him certificate to that effect certificate to that effect youve done all the processes of level 0 all right we now hereby certify that he has runbig letters level 0and is all ready to attack level i and acknowledge it youll be surprised how much that will also kick out on the backtrack see that knocks out the sessions the auditing it keys out the whole lot youve just acknowledged the whole lot good bad or indifferent you say he didnt do it well he didnt do it completely he didnt do it thoroughly you say you did itthank you very much youve acknowledged everything thats happened during that period of time thats that so hes still got the gain nothing can take that away from him in scientology anything that wasnt gain youve also acknowledged so you havent set up hidden standard of auditing tends to wipe that out hesnever afterwards will have to have the same kind of an auditor under the same conditions dont you see in order to say that he has gain because you can set up auditing conditions ive seen pc get resounding win with some auditor and ever afterwards be pestering d of p or somebody to get that auditor back and insist on running that process my god the process was flat in 1951 but hes got to run it why its the hidden standard of what is auditing so you cant qanda with these hidden standards you can make it easier for the person you can do whatever you can you can acknowledge what kind of an auditor would have to be able to audit him you can patch this thing up one way or the other in numerous ways you can just get him to announce who would i have to be to audit you remember that old process and acknowledge the living god out of every answer see see just acknowledge that see well good hey thats pretty good all right thats fine id have to be voodoo priest very good repeat his answer even now if you acknowledged that properly and you were doing that thing very smoothly it would have resounding gain because you are operating and working right in the field of major therapeutic beingness see big big gain big gain various ways of handling this particular aspect but the only safe way to evaluate case progress is mechanical method such as meterthats because of hidden standardsand completed cycle of processes hes completed them now it so happensit so happens that if he does complete this cycle of process he will reach better ease state and it so happens that this can be strung out along the line of levels now to such degree and sufficiently accurately that you dont have pcs that are different i mean youve got such basic and fundamental processes strung out along this line now that youre not getting different pcs all the time so hes working to complete level well if you get him interested in completing level youre all set thats all he has to be interested in well you just complete this level yeah ioh youve had bad headaches lately well thats too bad bad headaches huh oh thats pretty bad im sorry you have headaches well youve had bad headaches all right not well ill see what i can do about that thats fatal remark youve now continued the headache the only safe thing to do is just to go on and audit them up the line level by level and let them take those processes and not go steaming and snoring and snorting and shouting and so forth and saying im not clear and im not release or im not he is level i pc who is working to become level ii thats what he is and thats state of beingness that any fool could figure out and its state of beingness that he doesnt have to be wise man to see but he doesnt also have to be fool to see because he sees hes making some progress and he would make progress now this is basically the use to which levels are put today and this is basically whats going to happen thats whats going to happen here now on the subject of hidden standards you very often feel that there is hidden technical standard that you dont know what it is and so forth well that comes from an alteris when you get an alteris of the technical standard you see then you must believe that there is something back of this that is being alterised but let tell you what your hidden standard is right now technically ill tell you exactly what it is technically and so forth its not very hidden its not hidden at all it just isnt totally released and the reason it isnt totally released is there is so much work on my plate and my finger can develop just so many calluses and im getting it to you as fast as i can so to that degree it is hidden do you follow that thats all there is to that there is probably two or three more paragraphs to write on the subject of level 0 boy youve got lot of stuff that the public could be taught and that sort of thing but theres just as far as the technology of level 0 is concerned id say two or three paragraphs nothing and theres however the rackup of the remaining levels and the exact processes which fit at the level and the exact condition the pcs supposed to reach i havent written that im going to make rough draft writeup of that and issue it to you so itll longer be hidden anyway get difference between an nonissued standard which somebody knows aboutand its merely slow coming on the linesand hidden standard because nobodys trying to hide any technology but theres tremendous numbers of hidden standards which you confront as an auditor i just threw the other one in for an example tremendous numbers of hidden standards youre going up against and the thing to do is not qanda with them not go in spin about them just hold very standard technology that is your best answer to all of these things hold it very standard when youve got it you see and then run processes in just that sequence finish them off issue the guy certificate and run your next level and the fellow is going to make it willynilly in the end its very simple to do today because we have the answers we are in that enviable position thank you very much
