that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint judges of the supreme court and all other officers of th united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law president bushs judicial nominations during the 101st and 102nd congresses introduction under the constitution of the united states the president nominates and subject to confirmation by th senate appoints justices to the supreme court as well as judges to most lower federal courts1 the presidential nominating power directly affects the composition of nearly all of the courts making up the federal judiciar there are ten courts or court systems to which the president nominates judges specifically these are the supreme court of the united states united states courts of appeals united states district courts i ncluding the territorial courts united states court of international trade united states court of federal claims united states tax court united states court of veterans appeals superior court of the district of columbia district of columbia court of appeals and united states court of military appeals during the four years of his presiden cy george bush nominated persons to judgeships on all of these courts the president however does not nominat federal bankruptcy judges who are appointed by the united states courts of appeals administrative law judges appointed by federal agencies or us magistrates appointed by the united states district courts nor ar these judges subject to senate confirmation justices on the supreme court and j udges on other courts established by congress under article iii of the constitution hold their offices during good behaviourie they receive lifetime appointments in addition to the supreme court the article iii courts consist of the us courts of appeals the us courtcrs2 2 two courts of local jurisdiction for the dist rict of columbia as well as the territorial courts in the us virgin islands the northern mariana islands and guam have been created pursuant to congresss power to di spose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or othe r property belonging to the united states article iv section 3 clause 2 under th is power congress has enacted laws providing for 15year judicial appointments to the district of columbia courts and for 10year judicial terms on the territorial courts besides the local courts of th district of columbia four courts of specialized subject matter jurisdictionthe us claims court the us tax court the us court of veterans appeals and the us court of military appealshave been created pursuant to constitutional authority other than article iii congress has enacted laws providing for 15 year judicial appointme nts to these courts 3 the focus of this report is appointments thr ough the process of presidential nomination and senate confirmation but on rare occasions ppointment to these courts are made without submitting nomination to the senate this may occur when president exercises his constitutional power to make recess appointme nts specifically article ii section 2 clause 3 of the us constitution empowers the president to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session du ring his tenure in office president ronald reagan made one judicial recess appointment th appointment to the us cl aims court was made after the sine die adjournment of the second session of the 97th congress and prior to the convening of the 98th congress see us library of congress congressional research service president reagans judicial nominations during the 100th congress report 8950 gov by denis steven rutkus wash ington 1988 p 3 during his presidency however george bush made j udicial recess appointmentsof international trade and the us district courts in the 50 states the district of columbia and the commonwealth of puerto rico the president as previously noted nomin ates judges to other federal courts as well these are the socalled legislative courts which are created by congress under divers constitutional authority not requiring lifetime good behaviour tenure presidential nominations to these courts entail fixed terms of various lengths2 in the following pages ten separate sections provide b ackground and statistics concerning president bushs judicial minations to each of the court categories listed above3 each section begins by briefly discussing the composition and jurisdiction of the court or court system in question then various statistics are provided including overall number of nominations to the court which were received confirmed or not confirmed by the senate during mr bushs presidency the number of president bushs appointees who currently serve on the court as distinguished from those who since their ppointment may have ft the court and breakdown for both the 101st and 102nd congresses of the number of nominations received by th senate confirmed or failing to receive senate confirmation also noted is the committ ee to which judicial nominations to particular court were referred af ter being received by the senate the most common ways in which judicial nomination fails to receive senate confirmation are thesecrs3 4 paragraph 6 of senate rule xxxi provides in part that if the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon at the time of taking such adjournment or recess shall be returned by the secretary to the president and shall not again be considered unless they shall again be made to the senate by the president 5 one us district court nomination failed to be confirmed for none of the abovelisted reasons when president bush the same day w ithdrew the nomination of an individual to one district judgeship and nominated him to j udgeship in another dist rict see october 24 1991 and november 5 1991 nominations of jimm larry hendren table 3 6 the nomination in question was that of kenneth l ryskamp of florida to be us court of appeals judge for the eleventh circuit on april 11 1991 motion in the senate committee on the judiciary to report favorably the ryskamp nomination to the senate failed by 68 vote second motion to report the nomination to the senate without recommendation also failed by 77 tie vote see biskupic joan homestate senators opposition marked end for court nominee congressional quarterly weekly report v 49 april 13 1991 p 922 in the months imme diately after the negative committee action president bush declined to w ithdraw the nomination with the result that it was returned to him on august 2 1991 pursuant to rule xxxi when the senate adjourned for more than 30 days see mitchell george j retu rn of certain nominations to the president remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition v 137 aug 2 1991 p s12131 7 thus the statistics in this report distinguish between the overall number of nominations once failing to receive senate confirmation and the smaller number of nominees who failed ever to be confirmed the former number covers all instances of nominations failing confirmation when returned pursuant to rule xxxi regardless of whether the nominees continued1 the senate committee to which the nomination has been referred either votes against reporting the nomination to the senate or makes clear its intention not to act on the nominationafter which the president usually withdraws the nomination 2 the full senate votes against confirmation 3 without confirming or rej ecting the nomination the senate adjourns or recesses for more than 30 days at which time it returns the nomination to the president pursu ant to rule xxxi paragraph 6 standing rules of the senate 4 during president bushs tenure in office all but one of those judicial nominations which eventually failed to be confirmed fell in the third category5 one of the failed nominations fell into the first as well as the third category having received unfavorable action at the committee level before being returned by the senate6 in number of instances when the senate returned judicial nomination pursuant to rule xxxi president bush re nominated the individual involved after which the senate then confirmed the indi vidual each court section notes where applicable the respective numbe r of nominations that were returned by the senate were resubmitted by the president and ultimately were confirmed or failed to be confirmed7crs4 7 continued involved were later renominated and confirmed the latter number accounts only for individuals who failed ever to be confirmed either because of unfavorable committee action senate rejection the withdrawal of the nom ination or the presidents disinclination to renominate upon receiving from the senate returned nominationat the end of each
