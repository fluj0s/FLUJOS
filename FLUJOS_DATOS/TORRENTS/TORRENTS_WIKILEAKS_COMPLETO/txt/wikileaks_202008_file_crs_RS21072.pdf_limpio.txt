presiden cy of fernando rua on december 20 2001 on january 1 2002 the argentine congress lected peronist pa rty leader eduardo duhalde to complete his term of office for over year president duhalde struggled with congress to define an economic strategy that would unify the country and solidify support for new round of intern ational financial ssistance unable to come to terms with the imf over mediumterm package on january 24 2003 the fund approved with some reservations new transiti onal 68 billion arrangement that provided enough financial resources to roll over argentina s current imf

and monetary policy was forcibly constrained to uphold that promise by tying its currency and monetary policy to the united states argentina was able to achieve its goal of similarly low inflation rate the currency boards monetary restricti on however effectively required fiscal constraint as well because government defic it had to be covered by debt rather than by printing money monetized2 therefore the currency board raised hopes for credible economic stabilization based on compulsory monetary restraint and implied fiscal discipline both long absent in argentina the economy performed well in the early 1990s stabilization brought low inflation and interest rates attr acted new investment and spurred economic growth but its success hinged on continuing economic growth and disciplined macroeconomic policies particularly if it were to weather the inevitable external shock three major areas of vulnerability were clear from the outset the fiscal deficit which would threaten the financial stability of the currency board the high level of external debt which would compound budgetary pressures and leave argentina vulnerable to the vagaries of external capital and real inflationadjusted appreciation of the peso which would cause international competitiveness current account problems3 economic challenges despite these concerns bein g well known argentina failed to heed them first and foremost argentinas convertib ility regime required fiscal c ontrol this was small task given weak tax compliance recession induced revenue shortf alls and overspending by provincial and nationa l governments as fiscal defic its continued debt rose to become the key vulnerability as may be seen in table 1 since 1995 the consolidated primary fiscal balance which excludes interest payments was slightly negative or positive but the overall balance with interest grew to become serious deficit by 1999 the difference between the two deficit measures shows how between 1995 and 2001 the portion of the budget spent on servicing public debt interes t payments grew from less than 2 to over 5 of gdp the debt servi ce ratio measure of the fore ign component of public debt was equally dismal more than doub ling from 295 in 1995 to 657 in 2001 importantly budget defic its and debt plagued bot h provincial and national governments eventually under mining credibility in the countrys overall fiscal policy and by extension the convertibility regime4 fiscal sharing guaranteed federal payments to provincial governments that served as significant portion of their revenue an arrangement that discouraged discipline at the local level and proved difficult to alter neither was there sufficient external pressure on argentina to change fiscal course given continuing lending by

it started in 1991 w ith argentinas higher inflation rate relative to the united states but became serious issue when the us dollar appreciated from 1995 to 1999 meaning that the dollarlinked pe so also appreciated relative to the currencies of argentinas tr ading partners argentine exports became less competitive and imports bargain as seen in the deteri orating current account ficit argentinas competitiveness was further eroded by th brazilian devaluation in january 1999 diminished terms of trade due to falling commodity prices and rising interest rates by the late 1990s these i nhospita ble external factors along with the global downturn in 2001 compounded the effects of poor domes tic policy decisions to compromise argentinas current account budget deficit and debt position see table 1 by 2000 argentina faced major adjus tment problem crea ting policy conundrum that was centered on the inherent constraint s of the currency board in countries with flexible exchange rates pers istent current account deficit th at is not financed by capital inflows would force the exchange rate lower correcting the currency overvaluation improving competitiveness and in time re storing balance given weak productivity growth and argentinas inability to devalue its nominal exchange rate the only way to become more competitive was to allow dollars to leave the country thereby reducing the money supply and causing domestic prices to fall facto po licy of deflation5 this process could take years to restore competitiveness and find new growth equilibrium and at severe social cost argentinas deepening recession and growing unemploymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21072crs4 the constraints of the currency board also kept argentina from fighting its lingering recession with either strong fiscal stimulus or expansionary monetary policy as the united states did in 2001 in fact the c onsensus policy recommendation was to do just the opposite and tighten the budget to addre ss concerns over moun ting debt and overall fiscal credibility in short argentina had way to address both problems of debt and economic growth simultaneously and still maintain its currency board unable to address basic economic imbalances president rua again guided by minister of economy domingo cavallo opt ed for increasingly novel and desperate measures to meet pressing shortterm financial needs in june 2001 295 billion of shortterm debt was exchanged for new debt with longer maturities and higher interest rates it was assumed that the return of strong economic growth would allow argentina to cover the higher debt service argentina then engineered an effective 7 devaluation of the peso for foreign trading expecting to improve its competitiveness but which also further compromised confidence in the currenc board as perceptions of risk rose interest rates followed so liquidity became tighter and both the fe deral and provincial governments issued bonds in the form of scri p to pay public salari this quasimoney was allowed to circulate as currency further undermining the monetary system argentinas last hope for fi nancial recovery rested on the debt swap announced in november 2001 the federal g overnment had 132 billion dolla rs in debt 95 billion in bonds some 60 billion of bonds were refina nced as taxreceipt guaranteed loan lowering the average interest rate from between 1112 to 7 and extending the maturity of the notes by three years the november debt swap strained cr edibility with private lenders who labeled it distressed exchange and treated it effectively as default in addition the interest savings proved to be much smaller th an anticipated and argentina failed again to meet the fiscal targets promised in its imf program this led to the imfs refusal to extend 13 billion draw schedul ed for december 2001 by then argentina found itself cut off from international financia l markets both public official and private as confidence in the peso waned the flight to dollars accelerated and international reserves fell by over 4 billion in november president rua responded with decree limiting individual cash withdrawals to 1000 pe r month setting off the violent protests that culminated in full blown crisis and soon thereafter his resignation the role of the international monetary fund argentinas attempts to deal with its financial difficulties included an ongoing relationship with the imf as table 2 suggests argentina is stranger to the imf since the latin american debt crisis in the 1980s it has tapped the imf repeatedly and in general for increasingly large amounts of money argentin as curren t 68 b illion transitional eightmonth imf standby arrangemen t was approved on january 24 2003 it replaced the march 20 2000 arrangem ent requested by president rua which in turn had replaced the extended rrangement of february 4 1998 argentinas growing indebtedness to the fund has been conditioned on repeated promises of fiscal adjustment including reducing transfers to provincial governments and obtaining their commitments to cut local budgets as part of broader revenueshari ng reform effort previous arrangements also assumed that argentinas economy would grow by 35 in 2000 and 40 in later years which clearly did not happen the argentine government projects the economy to grow by 3 in

facility provides funds at higher rates and shorter maturities to countries that have experienced sudden loss of market confidence but have corrective reform measures in place argentinas continued weak economic perfo rmance during the crisis prompted the imf on january 12 2001 to augmen t the original agreement by 70 billion sdr 52 billion this was part of larger pack age that included 50 billion in loan commitments from the interamerican development bank idb and the world bank 10 billion from spain and voluntary refinancing from th private sector of 20 billion the imf advanced these funds with an expectati on that the argentine economy would grow by 25 in 2001 which also proved unattainable leading to third augmentation of 74 billion sdr 56 billion on september 7 2001 th is increase was also based on promises of strong fiscal re form as defined by the zero deficit law passed on july 29 2001 and revenue sharing reform with the provinces despite imf funding it became increasingly clear that the high cost of debt combined with recession and doubt over argentinas ability to make needed ad justments led the country to default outlook president duhalde was given broad emer gency powers by the congress to keep argentinas financial crisis from mushrooming into economic and social collapse he initially attempted to restore argentina to financial competitiveness and credibility by abandoning the currency board and the pesos 1 to1 peg with the dollar in favor of dual exchange rate system based on an official rate for foreign trade transactions of 14 pesos to the dollar and floating rate for domestic transactions dollar denominated bank loans up to 100000 were converted to pesos at th 1to1 rate passing on the cost of devaluation disproporti onally to creditors mostly banks duhalde also guaranteed dollar deposits but to avoid bank runs retained the policy of limiting monthly withdrawals begun under president ruahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21072crs6 from the beginning this plan faced oppos ition from both international creditors and domestic interest groups to complicate matters further on february 1 2002 the argentine supreme court ruled that the freeze on bank deposits was unconstitutional to avoid run on the banking system duhalde responded by easing li mitations on withdrawals but decreed moratorium on enforcement of the supreme court order on february 3 2002 duhalde announced new ec onomic plan adopting single floating exchange rate system and changing array of capital controls the foreign exchange market was unstable for months before the peso settled losing over 70 of its value duhalde also gave up on his earlier promis to guarantee dollar deposits which were converted to pesos at the previ ous official rate of 14 to the dollar the mismatch in the conversion rate between ba nk loans assets and deposits liabilities left banks undercapitalized and relying on government assurances for financial assistance argentina was also unable to move quickly to resolve host of othe r structural problems that impeded development of credible plan to rebuild the financial system and work out new imf assistance package the argentine economy resumed growth in late 2002 much sooner than many had predicted resolving severe economic and social problems including high rates of unemployment and poverty will require more time in addition argentina remains in default of its private debt and is s ubsisting on shortterm transitional 68 b illion arrangement put in place on january 16 2003 which was supported by the united states and other g7 countries as necessary for arge ntina to avoid defaulting on the imf the fund provided sufficient financial resources only to roll over argentinas imf repayments through august 2003 under the ssumption that mediumterm arrangement could be put in place by september 9 2003 when 27 billion payment comes due the interim agreement helped provide the stability argentina needed to complete the presidential election cycle that resulted in gove rnor néstor kirchners victory in what was widely reported as fair election w ith near record voter turnout 80 as the kirchner administration takes over argentina has already begun reform process that will have to c ontinue if it is to achieve longterm economic growth and stability the freeze on bank deposits has been lifted following supreme court ruling various scrips are being replaced with pesos and fiscal control is being reexerted although argentinas economy has stabilized it remains fragile and deeper structural reforms await action these will make for di fficult political decisions on such issues as the sovereign debt workout banking sector reform public utility contract negotiations and tax reform just to name few in addition to dealing with the imf therefore although this chapter of argentin as financial crisis appears to be over returning to path of growth and prosperity presents longterm challenge to the country
