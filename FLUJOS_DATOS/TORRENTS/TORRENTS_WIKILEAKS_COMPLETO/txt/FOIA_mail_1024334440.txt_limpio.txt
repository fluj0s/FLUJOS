from ed cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re esper et and mike mann date mon 17 jun 2002 132040 0400 xflowed hi keith of course i agree with you we both know the probable flaws in mikes recon particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff your response is also why i chose not to read the published version of his letter it would be too aggravating the only way to deal with this whole issue is to show in detailed study that his estimates are clearly deficient in multicentennial power something that you actually did in your perspectives piece even if it was not clearly stated because of editorial cuts it is puzzling to that guy as bright as mike would be so unwilling to evaluate his own work bit more objectively ed i have just read this lettter and i think it is crap i am sick to death of mann stating his reconstruction represents the tropical area just because it contains few poorly temperature representative tropical series he is just as capable of regressing these data again any other target series such as the increasing trend of selfopinionated verbage he has produced over the last few years and better say more keith dr edward r cook doherty senior scholar treering laboratory lamontdoherty earth observatory palisades new york 10964 usa email drdendroldeocolumbiaedu phone 8453658618 fax 8453658152 xflowed
