oup that formed in the sp ring of 2007 in order to disrupt or stop the republican national convention rnc it is likely that they will target transportation infrastructure surrounding the rnc in an attempt to accomplish their goal the rncwc strategy utilizes layered approach that emphasizes flexibility and diversity of ta ctics in order to maximize member strengths and knowledge both individually as well as masse overall the rncwcs early formation comprehensive membership drives strategic partnerships and flexibility is likely to resu lt in more robust and balanced effort than other groups at previous conventions also basic social network analysis shows the rncwcs potentially high power centra lity and betweenness relative to other protestanarchist groups with similar intentions and reveals that collaboration and information sharing are lik ely prevalent consequently security is apt to be more difficult to maintain than during previous national conventions

on sept 14 2008 the republican national convention welcoming committee rncwc is an anarchistanti authoritarian group which form ed in the spring of 2007 in order to disrupt the rnc and ultimately start new reality through teaching1 the group was formed because its founding members belie ve the republicans are responsible for an enormous amount of the horror and vastation currently experienced by the world and its peoples2 since its inception the rncwc has attempted to obtain financial support and increa membership via the internet3 and public appearances at various locations across the us45 the rncwc plans to utilize layered approac h that emphasizes flexibility and diversity of tactics the strategy seeks to maximize the knowledge and experience of the rncwc members both individually as well as organizationally the individual layers they plan to use are tier one establish 1520 blockades utilizing diversity of tactics creating an inner and outer ring around st pauls xcel energy center where the rnc is to take place tier two immobilize the delegates tr ansportation infrastructure including the busses that are to convey them tier three block the five wester n bridges connecting the twin cities6 the groups stated strategy is dependant on the number of supporters they are able to garner the rncwc leadership is likely to have an approximate number of attendees however the final count will not be known until august 31 2008 according to the stated plans the t argets will be assigned individual colors based on their importance to the overall mission and the tactics that followers will use to achieve whatever successes they hope to achieve the rncwc plans to designate some targets as red zones prepared for selfdefense yellow zones peaceful but assertive and green zones iming to avoid any risk of arrest so as to accommodate wide variety of creative tactics and involve individuals with differing needs talents and commitment levels7 if the number of participants is relatively low then only tier one will be carried out but if the numbers are optimal based on rncwcs judgment then all three tiers will be utilized8 the amount of information researched about the transportation infrastructure in the area is high see append ix 1 2 overall photographs placed on the rnc wc website show pattern of bridge and roadway presurveillance figure 1 rncwcs members have proposed numerous met hods of disrupting or closing unclassified for official use only law enforcement sensitive u fouo 3the rnc using the transportation infras tructure these methods include setting vehicle tires on fire underneath expre ssway bridges to decrease motorist visibility or planting stalled v ehicles to limit thoroughfare access9 also members have suggested spreading large tal chains across highway lanes or placing starnails caltrops10 on access roads to restri ct access to the rnc the group also disclosed plans to use dump trucks to spill dirt or other large materials onto the road11 law enforcement should consider monitoring all potential methods to restrict or block traffic the group has also announced that they are purchasing tasers for its entire membership12 even though the rncwc denies that it is r eacting to the st paul police departments recent purchase of similar nonlethal devices or that the tasers are for anything other than pers onal protection this announcement should not go unnoticed by law enforcement in th area now or duri ng the convention though they are accepting donations in person and via the internet it is unknown whether the group has the financial resources to buy such devices on large scale since they r ange in price from 300 1000 the groups stated goal is the disrupti on of the rnc to that goal they are collaborating with other anarchistantiauthoritarian groups such as unconventional action ua ua states that its primary objective is to complement the work of local organizers in denver and the twin cities with figure 1 areas of known surveillance by rncwc including xcel energy center lower right courtesy hwwisac unclassified for official use only law enforcement sensitive u fouo 4regional organizing throughout t he rest of the country13 the ua website posts copies of its own strategies general anarchist guidesprinciples and list of anarchist contacts across the country on feb 9 2008 the two groups co sponsored an event called the northwest dncrnc resistance conference at the evergreen state coll ege in olympia wa14 the workshop discussed topics ranging from street tactics to sup porting protests and even had childcare available for its participants unconventional action states that after the completion of the democratic national co nvention dnc mem bers will travel to minneapolis to assist with the rnc effort15 this will provide quality venue for sharing information concerning general security procedures and effective countermeasures furthermore at l east one protestanarchist group ie pnc2rnc is using an open wiki accessible to the public but only members can edit as its website16 therefore private wikis only members can access and edit may be in use to share tactics andor strategy among these individuals or groups which are locat ed across the united states basic social network analysis sna using only each groups website and the links each possess to other likeminded sites reveals how connected the figure 2 social network analysis of rncdnc anarchist websites links unclassified for official use only law enforcement sensitive u fouo 5national convention protestanarchist gr oups potentially are figure 2 the community at large appears to be decent ralized network since it does not possess one central hub however it does possess several important hubs consequently these networks are more di fficult to disrupt due to their loose connections and easy ability to replace damaged or compromised nodes as such the national convention anarchists are following the pattern of most terror networks in this aspect although it is decentralized it appears that the rncwc possesses the most power centrality among the protest groups within this community toward both the republican and democratic national conventions figure 3 the pr eviously mentioned ua is second most likely due to its coordination with both republican and democratic anarchist groups the rncwc also possesses the highest amount of betweenness in this community the protest rnc 2008 and ua groups directly follow it overall betweenness refers to the number of groups that node or individual group has indirect ties to through the direct links that it possesses in other words it represents th number of times that node lies along the shortest path between two others nodes with high degree of betweenness act as liaisons or bridges to other nodes in the structure consequently the concept shows t he potential importance and information sharing capabilities that the rncwc ua protest rnc 2008 and dnc disruption 08 represent to the rest of the community although this analysis only reflects the links that each website possesses to others it provides glimpse of how coordinated this anarchist community may be and allows law enforcement to plan accordingly overall the rncwcs early formation comprehensive membership drives strategic partnerships and flexibility will likely result in more robust and balanced effort than in recent conventions consequently security will likely be more to difficult to maintain than in previous years based on the hwwisac database
