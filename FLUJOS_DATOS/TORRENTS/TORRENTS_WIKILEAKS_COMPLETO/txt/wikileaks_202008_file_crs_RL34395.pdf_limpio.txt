illegal wildlife is growing illicit economy estimated to be worth at least 5 billion and potentially in excess of 20 billion annually some of the most lucrative illicit wildlife commodities include tiger parts caviar elephant ivory rhino horn and exotic birds and reptiles demand for illegally obtained wildlife is ubiquitous and some suspect that illicit demand may be growing international wildlife smuggling may be of interest to congress as it presents several potential environmental and national security threats to the united states threats to the environment include the potential loss of biodiversity introduction of invasive species into us ecosystems and transmission of disease through illegal wildlife trade including through illegal bus hmeat trade national security threats include links between wildlife trafficking and organized crime nd drug trafficking some terrorist groups may also be seekin g to finance their activities through illegal wildlife trade according to experts w ildlife source and transit countries may be especially prone to exploitation if know n to have weak state capacity poor law enforcement corrupt govern ments and porous borders the us government addresses illegal wildlife trade through several national and international venues congress has passed numerous laws that regulate and restrict certain types of wildlife impor ts and exports including the endangered species act of 1973 the lacey act and l acey act amendments of 1981 and several speciesspecific conservation laws these laws and others establish authorities and guidelines for wildlife trade inspection at ports of entry and wildlife crime law enforcement and prosecution internationally the united states is party to several wildlife conservation treaties includi ng the united nations convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites which serves as the primary vehicle for regulating wildlife trade foreign training

involves the illicit pr ocurement transport and distribution internationally and domestically of animals and animal parts and derivatives thereof in contravention of laws foreign and domestic and treaties illegal wildlife trade ranges in scale from singleitem cal bartering to multi ton commercialsized consignments shipped all over the world wildlife contraband may include live pets hunting trophies fashion accessories cultura l artifacts ingredients for traditional medicines wild meat for human consum ption or bushmeat and other products numerous reasons exist for wildlife trad regulation current international and domestic laws often seek to prevent 1 the decline of species threatened or potentially threatened with extinction 2 the import of nonnative species which could harm the receiving habitats 3 the import of species that could transmit diseases harmful to humans animals or plants 4 the inhumane transport of wildlife and 5 the distortion of trade in otherwise legitima wildlife products through unfair foreign pricing government subsidies and forms of illegal trade protectionism congress has sought to regulate wildlife trade for more than century enacting the first wildlife trade prohibitions under the l acey act in 19001 congress also regulates wildlife trade unde r freestanding provisions in the lacey act amendments of 1981 the endangered species act of 1973 and other laws that prohibit the trade in specific threatened species or specifi c animals that pose potential health and disease risks2 see appendix internationally wildlife trade is regulated to safeguard certain species threatened by overexploitation and extinction the primary international treaty governing wildlife trade is the united nations convention on international trade

illegal wildlife trade appears to be economic gain continued demand in many parts of the world for illegal wildlife provides opportunities for criminals to turn profits along the supply chain according to international law enforcement officials some of the most lucrative illicit wildlife commodities include tiger parts caviar elephant ivory rhino horn and exotic birds and reptiles due to its clandestine nature the illegal trade is difficult to quantify with any accuracy nevertheless so estimate that it is worth at least 5 billion and may potentially total in excess of 20 billion

attribute this partly to increasing numbers of wildlife species regulated by cites and othe r international and domestic wildlife protection laws7 others caution that estimates of demand may be increasin g because of greater public and governmental awareness of the issue in recent years which has led to more investigations into the scope and magnitude of wildlife crime8 as result some analysts question whether demand for illega l wildlife is necessarily growing or whether new data is simply capturing mo re information about potentially stagnant or declining source of demand reasons behind the current demand fo r illegal wildlife nd related products appear to vary according to regions and cu ltures in asia where analysts claim that substantial portion possibly the larges t in the world of the global trade of illegal wildlife takes place mand is driven by the need for specific animal parts to practice traditional asian medicine for human consumption and as symbols of wealth9 demand for illegal wildlife is reportedly increasing in southeast asia due in part to the regions econo mic boom and resulting affluence10 in africa demand for illegal wildlife is driven by bushmeat consumption in rural and urban areas in other regions such as europe and north america analysts find that demand for illegal wildlife includes wide variety of products such as luxury fashion items tourist souvenirs purchased abroad and exo tic pets as well as traditional medicines and wildlife meats for human consumption11 quantifying us demand while reliable estimates of us demand for illegal wildlife are publicly av ailable many analysts agree that demand for illegal wildlife in the united states is likely to pa rallel us demand for legal wildlife if this is the case the united states may be significant destination for illegal wildlife and the magnitude of the illegal trade may be increasing the united states is estimated to purchase nearly 20 of all legal w ildlife and wildlife

demand for wildlife products that exceeds what the market can legally supply the value of illegal wildlife products continues to increase as consumers are willing to pay greater am ounts see table 3 thus as certain type of animal or wildlife product beco mes more endangered and rare its price increases along with the financial rewards for smugglers20 in many developing countries however the

may diffe rentiate poor hunters and traders from internationa l criminal syndicates involved in the trade who engage in the trade purely for profit another factor is the perceived low risk of capture or penalties associated with wildlife trafficking22 such perception can be the consequence of limited enforcement capabilities or willingness to puni sh such illegal behavior due to lack of resources infrast ructure expertise or political corruption additionally the wildlife trade may be considered less risky than other highvalue black markets including the drug trade as the penalties associated with wildlife crime tend to be substantially less severe than with other trafficking crimes according to series of united nations reports powdered rhinocer horn can be worth more than the equivalent weight of cocaine or gold combined with the low level of vigilance and modest level of penalties applied to wildlife crime cases criminal entrepreneurs are attracted by the prospect of high profits

1 village hunter s who trade small wildlife as source of subsistence cash income or who kill some wildlife to protect their people and crops from attacks 2 wildlife experts 3 criminal entities sometimes including terrorists rebels drug traffi ckers and others able to evade detection and transport and secure the products as well as launde r the proceeds 4 legitimate businesses serving as

globalization has improved the ease of travel transport transactions and other crossborder barriers that previously limited wildlife trade the magnitude of highly organized criminal syndicates role in wildlife trafficking is subject to debate although little is cer tain about wildlife traffickers anecdotal evidence indicates that suppliers have historically tended to work in small but wellorganized groups26 organized criminal syndicates by contrast while likely to be participating in the trade of certain highvalue wildlife commodities including caviar traditional asian medicine ivory and reptile skins are not necessarily operating in all segments of the illegal wildlife trade27 some observers including officials fro m fws and interpol have identified growth in the scope sophistication and organization of wildlife crime in recent years according to one fws report inve stigations increasingly involve multiple suspects in multiple locations committing multiple felonies28 traffickers are

the declared number of items shipped ch anging the declared value of items or declaring wild species as captivebred species or 3 trafficked using forged or stolen trade permits to give the false

seizure data from 1998 to 2006 the most heavily imp licated ivory trading countries include cameroon the peoples republic of china the democr atic republic of congo and nigeria37 us and international law enforcement officials also indicate that highly organized crossborder poachers from s udan and somalia are poaching elephant populations in chad and kenya38 analysts suspect that largescale ivory trafficking involves transnational crime syndicates which are located in african source countries and along transit routes through countries that include tanzania djibouti united arab emirates hong kong macao philippines and singapore39 due to the clandestine nature of the activity analysts have difficulty identifying specific pathways of illicit wildlife trade however one documented case of elephant ivory trafficking which law enforcement officials clandestinel monitored provides some insight into how the illicit trade in african elephant ivory operates this case also highlights the often circuitous pathways that illicit shipments travel to avoid detection in 2006 taiwanese authorities confiscated more than five metric tons of elephant ivory over threeday period concealed in shipping cargo shipping documents indicated that the illegal consignment originated in tanzania and was destined for the philippines after departing from tanzania the ivory transited through malaysia and into singapore where the cargo remained for some time the shipment then departed for the philippi nes but was rerouted to taiwan from taiwan the consignment arrived in the philippines but without being offloaded returned to taiwan as the ivory was bout to return to the philippines with shipping documents identifying different importer than when the shipment was originally sent to the

addition others report that the illegal wildlife trade combines with habitat loss or alteration to contribute to species decline the actual extinction of species as result solely of trade is not widely documented in the literature41 although exploitation combined with habitat loss and alteration is linked to significan t declines in several species42 some observers for example claim that while great apes make up less than 1 of the bushmeat trade in west and central africa this rate of harvest combined with habitat loss and alteration has led to very severe populati on declines if this trend is unchecked extinction is likely43 species that are currently in decline due primarily to exploitation for trade are speci that are rare or have historically low population levels for example some have attributed sharp declines in three rare species of tropical asian bears to the illegal trade in bear parts especially bear gallbladders for use in traditional asian medicine44 insufficient

party trade in appendix listed animals and plants is based on system of governmentissued permits and certificates that must be pr esented before consignments can leave or enter country many analysts observe however that cites is limited in its ability to monitor illegal wildlife trade and enforce member states compliance with the provisions of the treaty125 cites on its own does not make illegal wildlife trading crime or prescribe criminal penalties against violators instead the treaty relies on member states to execute national legislation that enforces cites commitments and to report to the

and exporting wildlife fees have not been increased since 1996 raising fees is intended to recover some costs of inspecting shipments other regional efforts to combat the illegal wildlife trade similar to asean wen have grown in popularity in recent ears though the united states is not as heavily involved in them at this time thes regional efforts are generally perceived by observers as positive development as they bolster regional commitments to solve criminal activity that is inheren tly transboundary in nature some however question whether these new initiatives will be sufficient in curtailing the illegal wildlife trade issues for congress the role of congress in evaluating us policy to combat wildlife trafficking is broad this section analyzes some issues congress may choose to consider which include 1 funding levels for us w ildlife trade inspection and investigation capacity 2 assessing the role of us foreign aid to combat wildlife trafficking 3 supplementing legislative provisions to courage privatesector involvement in controlling wildlife trade 4 evaluating trade sanction laws relative to foreign countries with weak enforcement of wild life laws 5 incorporating wildlife trade provisions into free trade agreements ftas and 6 addressing the domestic and international demand for illegal wildlife through public awareness campaigns and nongovernmental organization partnerships funding for domestic and international wildlife trade inspection and investigation some observers suggest that improving us capacity to prevent illegal wildlife from entering the border and combat transnational wildlife crime syndicates may require congress to fund and authorize additional inspector s at the border according to fws approximately 75 of declared w ildlife shipments are not inspected at the border there are few inspectors in undesi gnated ports of entry where undeclared wildlife shipments are rarely checked133 some have suggested that fws should increase its inspection of declared and undeclared shipments of wildlife in both designated and undesignated ports of try in the united states one possibility would be to increase the number of wildlif inspectors in proportion to the increase in wildlife shipments entering the united states in recent years this has not occurred since 2000 the number of wildlife inspectors has increased at an annual average of 38 while the number of shipme nts has increased at an annual average of approximately 87 see table 4 the cost of implementing this proposal however would likely involve congress increasing appropriations for fws or increasing user fees for inspecting wildlife at the border134httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34395crs34 135 see for example testimony by claudia mcmurray

suggest increasing the investigative capacity of fws to address the illegal wildlife trade controlled by orga nized crime from 2000 to 2006 the number of special agents for fws has increased an average of 03 annually while the investigative caseload has increased an average of 97 nnually more special agents might result in greater number of arrests and prosecutions of wildlife smugglers further more agents may in crease the fws capacity to target specific wildlife smuggling rings or to monitor w ildlife smuggling in developing countries where it is thought to be most prevalent the cost of adding more special agents to the fws may also involve an increase in appropriations by congress some have argued that this cost might be partially ffset by fines paid to the government from more prosecutions of wildlife criminals many observers have highlighted the value of recent international law enforcement initiatives to combat illegal wildlife crime135 to this end some suggest that fws receive additional authorities fro m congress to expand its reach beyond the us border proponents argue that such policy could help fws in conjunction with foreign counterparts target more highvalue transnational smuggling syndicates in testimony to the house natural resources committee in 2008 one analyst indicated that such an expansion if fws authorities could be modeled on us drug enforcement administration authorities which permit federal drug law enforcement agents to conduct operations internationa lly as well as to staff numerous country offices worldwide136 critics of this option however argue that wildlife crime is not sufficiently priority policy issue to warra nt the attendant budgetary costs that would be associated with such an expansion of fws authorities foreign assistance for comb ating wildlife trafficking the majority of endangered species in the world are found in developing countries where there is need for assist ance in protecting species and habitats137 some contend that one opportunity to stem the illegal trade in wildlife is to improve the enforcement capacity of developing countries to c ontrol the illegal harvest and export of species congress could further this option by appropriating new funds or directing funds in preexisting conservati on programs to train and assist foreign wildlife trade officials in monitoring detecting and investigating wildlife trafficking fws and other observers ve identified building of wildlife law enforcement infrastructure in source c ountries as priority for stemming the illegal trade138 options for achieving this include increasing us efforts to train wildlife inspectors and special agents in developing countries where the illegal wildlife trade is flourishing the justification of such pr oposal is based on three premises 1 directhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34395crs35 139 22 usc 2431 140 usaid usaid biodiversity and forestry conservation programs fy2005 2007 at

fws and several nongovernmental organications ngos the benefits associated with this proposal would have to be weighed against the costs of increasing training overseas by fws to offset these costs congress could direct funds in some conservation progra ms toward increasing the law enforcement capacity in countries with high wildlif crime for example the tropical forest conservation act139 authorizes the use of debtforn ature swaps to create funds that can given as grants to local organizations to improve the security of nature reserves speciesspecific programs under the mu ltinational

is need for more information on international tr afficking routes and need for that information if or when collected to be shared among interested parties today national intelligence on environmental crimes is reportedly not collated and disseminated effectively across countries and law enforcement jurisdictions141 as fws report explains combating wildlife trafficking today requires steppedup

tracking technologies could be applied to wildlife products including satellite monitoring and the use of barcodes chemical tracers and radiofrequency id tags and transponders these technologies are alr eady used in tracking wide variety of products ranging from narcotics to highv alue fashion mercha ndise furthermore recent scientific findings indicate that ivory products can be traced through dna analysis with significant accuracy alt hough this technology is not ready for commercial use145 not all source countries however especially in the developing world have the financial resources to commit to potentially costly tracking technologies other questions include whether such tracking technologies are reliable consistent or feasible for market such as the illegal wildlife market that includes such wide variety of products indeed such trade tracking options are unlikely to be applicable for regulating smallscale wildlife shipments another option could involve further expans ion of partnerships with the private sector and development of models of corporate social responsibility for soft regulatory regimes146 such regimes could involve i ndustry certificati on schemes for manufacturers of traditional as ian medicine products inte rnetbased companies that sell wildlife products the fashion industr wild game hunting and tour guide operations and many other bus inesses that may involve illegal wildlife in some cases as with the labeling of traditional asian medicines some pilot programs are underway in other countries such as the united kingdom the nonprofit organization international fund for anima l welfare ifaw has also sought to promote legislation in california to blish statewide labeling program for traditional asian medicines and congre ss may choose to consider establishing similar national programs147 potential limitations to this option include the possibility that some wildlife commodities ma be so valuable that profits would trump voluntary commitments this has been seen in the us illegal caviar trade where companies fraudulently labeled tins of illegal caviar148httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34395crs37 149 theodora greanias tool of

in other cases however analysts report that the pelly certification proce ss has had or limited effect on offending nations155 additionally some analysts argue that its sporadic use since the early 1990s including further use of sanc tions since taiwan in 1994 may be reflection of its ineffectiveness other analysts suggest that the us government may have political disinclination to impose sanctions against countries for wildlife trafficking as noted earlier the cites secretariat currently identifies seven countries in noncompliance with cites provisions none of which are currently certified or sanctioned for th eir noncompliance it also remains unclear how the united states monitors and evaluates fore ign country compliance with international programs for endangered or threatened species and how or when such evaluations trigger the certification process there also appears to remain some debate surrounding whether the pelly amendment sanction violates world tr ade organization wto and general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt guidelines although article xx of gatt allows for certain environmental trade meas ures to trump the international free trade regime gatt and wto have often ruled agai nst unilateral trade restrictions based on environmental conservation statutes duri ng the one instance in which the united states applied pelly sanc tion it was against country that was not member of gatt or wto as result it remains to be seen whether pelly amendment sanction would hold up in wto dispute challenge156 in the meantime congress could move to reevaluate the effectivene ss of the pelly amendment as sanctioning tool and conduct oversight on agencies i nvolved in the certifi cation and sanctioning process free trade agreements the increasing globalization of trade interconnectedness of markets and supply routes and emergence of transnational businesses has increased the potential for the illegal trade in wildlife indeed some conte nd that free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta may facilitate the illegal trade in wildlife because of fewer trade restrictions generally for example some argue that free trade agreement fta with singapore increased us imports of illegally obtained timber and wildlife from singapor and other countries that transport products through singapore157 others argue that trade agreement with peru would have led to an increase in exports of ille gally logged timber and wildlife to the united states from peru to address these envir onmental concerns nd others some

wildlife trade congress is responsible for imple menting legislation for ftas and might consider ftas with columbia pa nama and south korea in the 110th congress some of these concerns were addressed in usperu trade promotion agreement tpa158 the tpa requires that parties dopt laws and measures to fulfill its obligations under multilatera l environmental agreements such as cites further the tpa would require parties to enforce their own environmental laws and would establish policy mechanism to address public complaints that party is not effectively enforcing its environmental ws whether or not the failure is trade related complaints could be filed by individuals and firms of each party to the agreement and would be addressed according to set of procedures outlined in the tpa159 an annex on forest sector governance in the tpa specifically addresses the parties commitment to combat trade associat ed with illegal logging and illegal trade of wildlife160 the framework for the environmental section in usperu tpa could be modified to address the illegal wildlife trade in future agreements with countries that have significant illegal wild life trade proponents of this view see several benefits to including environmental provisions to ter the illegal wildlife trade in free trade agreements the fta may increase the awar eness of the illegal wildlife trade and create additional enforcement mechanisms to address trade violations eg dispute mechanisms within the agreement further agreements can provide layer of assurances that parties comply with international treaties and enforce their environmental laws if there is mechan ism for third parties eg outside groups such as ngos to verify compliance and report violations to committee supporters assert that it might uncover more wildlife crimes potential drawback of this proposal is that requirements for compliance might require additional funding if funding is not available resources might be allocated away from other enforcement and monitoring activities to meet the conditions of the agreement if the agreement allows outside parties to monitor and conduct investigations into possible violations so within the country might view this as an infringement on national sovereigntyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34395crs40 161 environmental education for afghans essential us officials say armed forces press service august 15 2007 162 hayman and brack international environmental crime p 31public awareness and governmentngo cooperation one potential strategy to combat the illegal trade in wildlife is to reduce demand for wildlife supporters of this view ggest raising public awareness through public service announcements and campaigns to ducate consumers re tailers and importers of wildlife products in some cases as with many tourists consumers are simply unaware of laws prohibiting th import of products made of protected wildlife retail shopkeepers manufacturers as well as importexport suppliers may also benefit from learning about the availability of stainable alternatives and the potential consequences of illegal wildlife trade us government and nongovernmental organization ngo campaigns aimed at demand reduction domestica lly and internationally ar ongoing in october 2007 for example the state department identifie d bo derek as special envoy of the secretary of state for wildlife trafficking issues together with assistant secretary of state for oceans environment and sc ience claudia mcmu rray derek conducted series of outreach events to raise public awareness about the illegal global trade in wildlife in southern florida which is one of the major points of entry for legal and illegal wildlife in afghanistan there has b een some concern that us personnel may be attempting to bring back to the united states furs and other wildlife artifacts that are protected under cites afghanistan law and us and miliary laws to address this the department of defense in concert with officials from the state department environmental protection agency and th nonprofit wildlife conservation society organized information sessions to educat us personnel about illegal wildlife and the consequences of fostering demand for such wildlife products161 some reports indicate that these public awareness campaigns may show results the wildlife protection ngo wildaid for ex ample launched reportedly successful series of public advertisemen ts and short films to create awareness about the impacts of the sharkfin trade among consumer s in asia the campaign reported 5070 decrease in demand in some markets162 however it remains to be seen whether future campaigns can show similar results and if these campaigns can effect long term changes in consumer culture congress might play role in the use and evaluation of demandside st rategies in several ways for example congress could conduct oversight of exis ting demandside reduction programs evaluating the effectiveness of dema ndside programs and assessing what policy options may exist to enhance the costeffectiveness of demandside antitrafficking initiatives additionally congress could direct funds or require us agencies to include demandside reduction programs in their antiwildlife trafficking efforts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34395crs41 163 16 usc 4201 et seq pl 100478 as amended congress also enacted
