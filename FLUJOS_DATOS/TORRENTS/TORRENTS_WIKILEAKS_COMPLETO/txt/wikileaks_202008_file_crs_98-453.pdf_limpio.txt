generally is subject to statutory limit 31 usc 3101 from time to time congress considers and adopts legislation to change this limit this report provides brief overview of debtlimit legislation within the congressional budget process the gross federal debt which represents the federal governments total outstanding debt consists of two types of debt 1 the debt held by the public and 2 the debt held by government accounts the debt held by the public represents the total net amount borrowed from the public to cover the federal governments accumulated budget deficits by contrast the debt held by government accounts represents the total net amount of federal debt issued to specialized federal accounts primarily trust funds eg social security trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special federal government securities and thus are held in the form of federal debt at the end of fy2007 about 56 or about 450351 billion of the gross federal debt which equaled 895047 billion was held by the public almost 44 or 39156 billion of the gross federal debt is debt held by government accounts since the statutory limit applies to the combination of both types of debt budget deficits or trust fund surpluses may contribute to the federal government reaching the existing debt limit budget deficits increase the federal debt by requiring the federal government to borrow additional funds to fulfill its commitments trust fund surpluses contribute to the federal debt by requiring the federal government to issue securities to the trust funds consequently the federal debt may reach the existing statutory limit even when the federal budget is balanced for more information on current federal debt limit issues see crs report rl31967 the debt limit history and recent increases

the president from time to time must enact legislation to raise the statutory limit on the debt legislation to raise or lower the debt limit is considered in the context of the congressional budget process the annual congressional budget resolution specifies the appropriate level of the public debt for each fiscal year covered by the resolution although the budget resolution does not become law itself the specified debt limits serve as guide for any necessary debtlimit legislation section 303 of the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 2 usc 601 688 as amended prohibits consideration of debtlimit measures for the upcoming fiscal year before budget resolution for that year has been adopted this provision however can be waived in the house or senate by majority vote congress may develop debtlimit legislation in any of three ways 1 under regular legislative procedures 2 under house rule xxvii or 3 as part of reconciliation legislation regardless of the process by which debtlimit legislation is developed the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee maintain exclusive jurisdiction over debtlimit legislation under house rule xxvii commonly referred to as the gephardt rule after its author former representative richard gephardt joint resolution specifying the amount of the debt limit contained in the budget resolution automatically is
