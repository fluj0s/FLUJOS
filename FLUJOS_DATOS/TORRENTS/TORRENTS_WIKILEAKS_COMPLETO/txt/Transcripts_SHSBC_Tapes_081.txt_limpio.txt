shsbc 81 checking case reports lecture given on 8 november 1961 now this is what the 8th of nov 61 yeah hundred years ago man and boy i was just getting out of vmi virginia military institute and joining the confederate army as young dashing second lieutenant well times change now we are hitting beachhead of different character okay 8 november 61 saint hill special briefing course and you have never seen do any of your case reports of one kind or another and im going to go over these case reports and thats going to step on some of your toes and thats going to let your pc in on what i think of you as the auditor and thats probably going to upset the pc because he will say in tomorrows session well ron said but i think it might be little bit educational to you if you saw how this was done and so i made up my mind that i had better make lecture on this particular subject at this time all right okay now usually these things have sec check in them but the sec checks have already been marked and so were not going to do any sec checks because tonights sec check has not yet been done we are just going to do the daytime auditing and this is routine 3a is what is being embarked upon here and weve got routine 3a started on many people whose goals have already been found but who have to yet have the modifier found which may mean some variation or change in terminal but not necessarily sometimes you get the modifier and you get the same terminal and sometimes you dont but lets take up some of these reports and see what happened today now this is report here fred fairchild auditing carl wilson and he says that this modifier was not checked out and the auditor didnt see the notice and should it be checked straightaway and pcs attention will now be on terminal well that all depends on whether or not it is the modifier and as far as checking out is concerned its always pretty good idea to get somebody else to check something out see it doesnt you shouldnt get this down as special saint hill routine that takes place nowhere else if you find goal or terminal or level or something like that not so much level but certainly goal and in this particular case goal modifier terminal whether you get them checked out every time you find each piece or before you start in desperation to do run get the goal the modifier and the terminal checked out all at one time certainly get it checked out by somebody it doesnt matter whether you are here or someplace else why it gives you certain amount of confidence somebody else has taken look at the thing it has given you some sort of feeling that you wont be going off the deep end when you start auditing it its good thing to do dont you agree now similarly every time rudiments crosschecking see has been done cases have made very nice progress so in an hgc or center where great deal of this of goals running particularly and that sort of thing is going on if rudiments are crosschecked why that would be very good idea but to have the director of processing crosscheck every rudiment on every pc every day is unfortunately already indicative of mess because the d of p director of processing never gets chance to do anything else now weve already had one tied up in washington dc i didnt realize that they had him strapped to the chair checking rudiments strapped to the chair checking rudiments he never got anything else checked never got any cases run or anything important like that and his administration dropped behind gorgeously well much better solution was just to have staff auditors check staff auditors rudiments thats all the best time to check rudiments by the way is midday not beginning of the day why well it works like this the first auditor the fellow gets that day see hes all grogged up and his basal metabolism is by the boards and he has got eighteen present time problems and he is anxious to unload his case and he hasnt had much auditing lately anyhow all these things in sort of monotone he isnt too familiar with any of the auditors in this center anyway and auditor doakes walks in and sits down in the auditors chair thats the pcs auditor for the day thats it although he then gets up and leaves you see you get the idea in other words first crack out of the box all of his anxieties and worries that hes been thinking up all night are in he wants to unload these things on the auditor and hes put on wait by another auditor so he can elect that auditor he can elect that auditor his auditor and all that auditor is doing is checking his rudiments so end of session or in the middle of an auditing day or something like that is better time to get rudiments crosscheck in this particular case the smartest thing to do here of course would be to go ahead and find the goal see we have great suspicion of this particular auditor and just lets let him go ahead hes got the modifier the pcs attention is now going to be on the goal well theres various reasons why the modifier might not get checked out properly well just let him go ahead and find the terminal and now lets check out the goal modifier and terminal lets get somebody else to check out goal modifier and terminal before we run anything on it and then weve got sweeping checkout that would save time anyway so you could either check them out one at time as theyre found which of course if youre operating with very tyro auditors who are you know theyre looking at the meter and they say now lets see this is the tone arm and when the word hubbard turns red its good idea to check out their rudiments three times every session check out their emeter set their emeter so it will read on the proper readings and hold their hand while they audit you see all these things would be there and to check out the goal when it is found the modifier when it is found the terminal when it is found the prehav level when it is found and the prehav level checked every time it is changed all of these things would be desirable but what are you doing youre adjusting the amount of checking you are doing to the quality of the auditor right well the limiter on this is that before anybody runs anything desperate you know he actually runs this terminal and so on any auditor even it would be nice thing to have somebody else look it over you know and say well it checks out it checks out all the way with too why well actually one auditor and another auditor can have different effects upon the pc that can throw the case one way or the other you see rudiments come under this heading exclusively rudiments well rudiments can be in for joe and out for mary any day of the week you see so if you have two auditors checking the rudiments of the pc you know pretty well youre not going to be running the pc with rudiments out so that has very little to do with auditing skill it has great deal to do with pcs reaction to male female auditors with blond hair auditors with green hair all these differences you see has great deal to do with where the pc is being audited too its always better to check pcs rudiments in another auditing room but this isnt convenient sounds wild but its true it isnt convenient of course you do get him set for the exact auditing room he is in if you check his rudiments in that auditing room where he is going to be audited but of course you would detect it much more rapidly that cases havingness was by the boards if his havingness was out in any room that point you could labor far too much the point is that on the broad things before you commit yourself to long run you should get checked out the things that have been assessed now whether theyre checked out one at time or whether theyre checked out all at once has very little to do with it except this that inexperienced auditors auditors who havent got very much experience will waste an awful lot of time on the wrong on finding the modifier for the wrong goal and then finding the wrong terminal for the wrong goal and modifier they waste lot of time and by the time they have found then the wrong prehav scale for the preclear not the prehav level but the prehav scale theyve got the it can go pretty far wild so whether you check them piece by piece is determined pretty well as to what auditor skill is present and this auditors skill of course is good so we would just let it go let him go ahead and find the terminal and go on so ill just mark this thing find terminal and get goal modifier terminal checked out all right now thats enough for that and the modifier that dropped and react or reacted most and stayed in but its someplace else thats doll thats an absolute doll thats perfect type of modifier that is classic case but its someplace else of course person goes down the line and he gets to this phrase but its someplace else so he never enunciates it see thats nice one thats interesting because i was interested in this particular case i take an awful lot of interest in these cases as pure interest if you dont mind and i wondered and wondered what this particular goal may i say what this goal is male voice yes go ahead but i wondered and wondered what was going to modify this particular goal because every time the pc came toward this particular goal he kind of sparks flew out of his ears he didnt like this one see and i wondered and wondered what it would be its to work on radiant energy and field phenomena and the modifiers is doesnt make too much well it makes sense but it but its someplace else so of course you cant work on something that is someplace else and thats apparently what has been falling and whats made this goal hang up and you get this that here youve got an ambition to work on radiant energy and field phenomena which is counterbalanced with the fact that you cant because its someplace else so of course this locks up every place the goal is applied because it doesnt have anything to reach but it is actually balanced thats textbook example thats very nice and whether its the right one or not is whether its the right one or not he said he had been telling that he didnt think anything would happen in the sessions and i noticed this session he seemed to be more insession and didnt say this okay interesting were you interested in that particularly male voice yes all right okay regardless of all that weve got terminals list started on this and here we have here we have now goal modifier and we get terminals list and we get all three of them checked out so thats it the other thing i always look for was there any ta action now you normally look for ta action on the thing during the run you look down the line here and find out what the ta action was and because he was too interested in the assessment the auditor here wasnt putting down very much ta read ordinarily on run you put down lots of ta read and on assessments you sometimes flub it its good indicator so put down lots of ta reads only err on the side of always put down enough tone arm reads says it was varying from 25 to 20 the tone arm was varying from 20 to 225 on his beginning of his terminal assessment i guess thats what that is all right now this general case run here appears to be all right i was just looking here you always look up at the top you see goals none you know very well that pc is running with rudiments bit out with withholds with an arc break something like that pc who tells you they have goals for session and so forth they must be sitting in some kind of bit of an arc break see so on that adjudication i would write down here get your rudiments in see its very clever crystalballing on my part pc has goals for session theres certain little rules that you follow along these lines its like reading profiles i can look at profile and tell you whether or not the pcs havingness is up or down whether the pc has found the auditor or not has nothing to do with the textbook about the profiles it has great deal to do with something else okay the pc of course feels little bit bounced around and is having little bit of rough time but i have every confidence that hell straighten out on it and recover okay okay mary sue generally lately she used to do these mostly by herself and shed sit up till four five or six clock in the morning thats an exaggeration it was only threethirty usually and she would sit there and do these things all by herself and as soon as i spotted the fact that we did have breakthrough here and i could shove your cases and your auditing much much harder i started to do these things individually short time ago id always been interested in them and spotchecked them and kept an eye on it and took them up with mary sue but she lately has been relaxed enough to be able simply to hand the folders shes very good at that you know why shes very good at that because believe it or not she can tell the goal and the terminal and the levels run and what process is being run on and what sec check is being run on any case out of twentysix just like that female voice very good its fantastic you know almost as good as i used to be i used to remember every engram verbatim that i ever ran off of pc and i could tell them years later and theyd stagger you know theyd come in and theyd somebody i hadnt seen for years you know but i audited them years ago and id say how are you getting along oh im getting along fine say well did you ever hear any more about that birth sequence what birth sequence you know the one that i audited you know where the doctor was wearing the green hat by george you know pc had forgotten it but i didnt all right we had doris lambright being audited by ellen carter well weve got goals here to blow off headache and confusion blowing around my head and so forth and evidently they made the goal some better to be able to duplicate tapes on one hearing to pass tests quickly and easily and so forth good to be clear and finish the course and finish course by january 1st and get back for the congress okay very good okay i dont see what this is all about here apparently wing angel apparently audited this pc at some timme or another and the pc was hung up in it in some fashion the way youd get that by the way is to clip the prior confusion not the auditing what was the confusion that preceded this you know you find whats wrong with the pc and then you get the prior confusion you know you get the confusion before it dont go monkeying around too much with this sort of thing and i dont know whether the auditor did anything about this or not but that would have been the proper thing to have done may have started when this auditor was auditing her well there might have must have been prior confusion to the turnon it might have been minute before and it might have been five years before but its prior that youre sure of so spotting the prior confusion to that would have clipped it out and you at your stage of training could consider this as fairly routine activity you find the pc is worried about something in the rudiments and that sort of thing and theyve had some kind of somatic and ever since suchandso and ever since their greatgrandmother died and so forth on the sacrificial altar or whatever it is why theyve had this somatic you can get the prior confusion you know well what happened before that do little tiny bangbangbang sec check on the thing and blow it and you can get very clever at that and if you can get very clever at that you will pull some miracles off that kind of look wild to other people by the way its the british auditor is reaching new low for do you realize that charlie drake the comedian lost his memory couple of weeks ago still lost who hasnt been up knocking on his door and doing touch assist on his skull the easiest thing you could possibly do now touch assist of course violates this prior confusion those are not hard words thats just joke but i should think that somebody by this time would have gone up to bbc and found out where they could find charlie drake and gone over and done touch assist on him we did one here just few days ago boy was seeing triple wasnt couldnt remember very much and was mostly blathering did touch assist on him for an hour and half i think or couple of hours for two male voice two and half but it had cleared up on two two hours or yeah male voice two hours yeah just did touch assist on him his triple vision turned off and that sort of thing you can do miracles like this well that actually is addressing the time see that violates this prior confusion thing but of course its the best thing you can do and if theres anything left after the touch assist there must have been prior confusion that is still holding it up but its marvelous that touch assist can get rid of as much as it does but you at any time that exact thing that we on this workman here done on this charlie drake and his memory would be back you know right now its not even hard job you know i mean what the heck the hardest job would be going to find the taxicab to go over to his house that would be the toughest job but finding any kind of rudiment out or any kind of somatic that the pc is desperately worried about or that sort of thing you can take slap at it you know on prior confusion basis you know you find it out in the rudiments and you decide youre going to do something about it the fastest way to do something about it is just take couple of fast sweeps on ow on the prior confusion and its liable to blow right now and its quite quick its quite quick all right now were doing some kind of goals assessment here start the goals assessment and weve still got that and we found the pcs confront process whats the emotion of and were still doing goals assessment and its carrying on here and this goals assessment is apparently prepared for very well she started the session and did goals and then came back to and ran who left sec check question unflat we found out it wasnt sec check question it was just nosy question just before the pc left home and withheld the answer somatics lightened up whats the emotion of that object i dont read this i dont dig this at all why have we got whats the emotion of that object thats havingness process and then the alternate confront i see i get it and this is alternate confront and those two and checking goals and theyre all null and then it got alternate confront and whats the emotion and so forth ah well weve got rather standard auditor problem staring us in the teeth here the goals all nulled and the needle is rising and the tone arm is 375 and so forth i wonder how many auditors between now and the turn of the century will be at this exact desperate point of the track the goals list has been handed over and the goals are all null all right well lets get magical shall we lets get magical about the whole thing this is very tough and by the way you shouldnt use these report sheets to write goals lists on goals lists go on white pieces of paper and they get clipped together and they dont get separated and left on little bits sheets get some long white sheets dont use these things and whenever you have goals list clip it together because goals list is valuable particularly the first goals list of the pc is very valuable clip it and file it and guard it with your life he doesnt care about it but you do what are you going to do for the second goals assessment dig in here and find little bits of paper all through the pieces of report oh youre not you clip them together okay and make them look good now youve got goals assessment and they all went null how many goals have we got this is also poor job from the standpoint of the goals are not numbered the goals are not all numbered ooo and the goals are numbered in two different number sequences ohhh ellen this is the kind of thing i say at two oclock in the morning if i could just get ahold of ellen now now now you take your goals list and you better recopy this whole goals list in your own script on long white sheet and you better put date at the top of the thing and you better number every goal consecutively so i could look on here or anybody else and say we are down to this many goals and the total summation of goals amounts to 199 goals or whatever the thing is because we just look at the last number on the sheet and we see 199 we know that many goals we already have enough numbers here scattered around some numbered goal 60 some numbered goal 33 others numbered also goals 20 theres i think you have several goal 17s here i dont know whether you do or not but auditor bookkeeping these days is yes you do have there are two goal 17s we dont know what this pc is up to but i would say offhand that this pc is up to about you know anybodys guess oh well ron can do this kind of thing so go ahead and do it to him one i can im very good at cryptography this is well written by the way but some of your auditor reports i have little microscope and i get it out and i read you think im kidding well i dont think this is enough goals female voice i dont think that it is you havent got enough goals here and now thats main point you have to get up to if goals are giving you any trouble at all get up to at least 150 200 get up into that range before you start worrying too much about it but probably this has not been shaken down i can tell you everything thats wrong with this case ill just rattle it off 1 the rudiments are out 2 an insufficient number of goals has been taken from the pc 3 the pc at some earlier time has done goals list thats guess is that right female voice yeah where is that list female voice i dont know i did it one time on train and i where is it female voice threw it away who threw it away female voice it was never used it was one i did on train one time one you did on train female voice yeah i didnt have anything you sure it is thrown away female voice im not positive it could be home somewhere i didnt look yeah there you are was my guess right her goals list was done on train and has probably been thrown away her goal is probably on that list and has never been repeated and will never again be repeated anyplace so we just might as well throw im not joking im not joking really when they do an original goals list and they write the whole thing out theyre talking turkey after that theyre worrying and the primary goal that youre after has the best chance of all goals of submerging and never being repeated on subsequent list isnt that interesting theres nothing you can do about it so we just might as well scratch the pc 1 ruds out 2 get more goals off meter and 3 now you got any suggestion ellen as to how we could do that female voice get more goals how we can get over this point 3 of the original list having been destroyed is there any way we could get over that female voice can see if she can locate it hm female voice i can find out if she can locate it yeah but supposing its been destroyed lets just assume its been destroyed is there anything else we can do about it female voice yes using the meter to see if i can get her to recall them yeah thats right lets get her to duplicate the list by meter which will be nice piece of metering for you is there any other goal on that list that you have not put on subsequent lists until you finally get all fall out of it but to do that youll have to get your rudiments severely in and keep them in and you will have to get everything that appeared on the original list okay get original list off meter okay now ill put down here sorry to call you to account in front of class best ron all right in that event ill just put best ron okay now here we are and we have constantine being audited by john sears and here we have routine 3a right i wonder i wonder if this goal still falls does this goal still fall to be myself male voice yeah does it check out and fall male voice yeah what do you know how long did it take you to get that fortyfive minutes male voice yes about that much interesting male voice we had very short list too yeah very short list all right now weve got to get modifier for this and lets see how far we have progressed in the direction here and he he was still running tenway bracket and still running tenway bracket and he ended rudiments and so forth what date was this this was clear back here this heres the 8th what is this all about yes heres the 8th yup the goal was to find modifier and so forth and so on modifier there we are now he did list of modifiers here where is the list of modifiers male voice foolscap there here we are heres nice long list of modifiers thats actually about three times as many modifiers as one would ordinarily have let see what number this modifier might have been here male voice five or six yeah yeah yeah yeah was it still shaking down by meter after number five were you taking from number five on were you still reading the meter is there anything else will modify this and see if the meter knocked male voice oh it was from about eighteen on that i was doing that oh yeah and you were still getting meter knock male voice oh yeah definitely is that right male voice very definitely all right and you stripped it down and it got down to thirtyfour male voice yeah of course this is brandnew this type particular operation all right well weve got some idea the meter went null at about thirtyfour huh male voice it went null before that and the pc originated the others that are written at the tops of the pages oh i see male voice from about oh its thirtyeight thirtynine male voice yeah thats right from about eighteen to about thirty on the meter yeah male voice the others originated i see and the pc originated after the meter went null male voice yeah all right okay very good well we find it was modifier number five which falls within my guess that they give it to you in the first five or ten and its in spite of other people trying to influence which is perfectly valid modifier that checked out did it have you checked it out thoroughly male voice i checked it out thoroughly yeah it was doesnt say so here male voice but the checker who checked it said that it was going in and out female voice it did not check out others came alive didnt check out didnt check didnt think it was it seemed too reasonable theres denyer one would look at it i would dont you dare add this as modifier now to be myself in spite of not being here or to be myself although i am elsewhere you get the modifier type of the thing you have to kind of dig for those things sometimes they are hard to blow out that would be denyer type of modifier dont you see i dont care even if one of the two i have just said is his he cant have it okay reassess more modifiers yeah well that was checked out and it was found to be going in and out and some of the others came live so i would say offhand that there is denyer on this thing that puts it out of view and this in spite of is kind of denyer it is kind of denyer but there might be something else there that has something to do with it now you realize in checking these things out something interesting is liable to occur youre liable to blow the whole goal particularly on the second or third goal that you check out with the pc you repeat the modifier and you repeat the goal and then you repeat the modifier and you cant find it and then you repeat the goal and you cant find it and then you look for the terminal then you try to get the rudiments in and theyre all in and you try to find the goal and the terminals its about time to listen to the pc hes been saying its been gone for some time so that is not what occurred here id tomorrow check the goal huh male voice yeah check the goal its perfectly accurate but check it anyhow get how much its falling and see if you cant get modifier that falls like the goal is falling you know the goal falls like the modifier falls like the terminal falls like the level or pardon i should have said reacts throughout the needle reaction of the goal is the same as the needle reaction for the modifier and the needle reaction for the terminal is the same as the needle reaction for the goal the needle reaction for the level will be the same they all will more or less be the same sometimes more youll find you will sometimes get greater reaction but if you have less reaction be suspicious if your reaction decreases and if its sporadic and goes in and out we havent got it theres something wrong here either the rudiments are out or the wording is not quite correct and so forth i appreciate your difficulty in this particular case because you are dealing constantine speaks very excellent english but his basic tongue is not english and so when im doing one like that i almost always do it in the native tongue of the pc even though i couldnt write greek these days to save my life get the idea have him say it in greek to be myself and then try this thing in greek try the same goal see if it stays in see we might be running the english off the top of it you know something weird might be happening all of you by the way are language cases you realize that youve only been talking english for very short period of time do you realize that english is sort of polyglot tongue there is civilization there are two or three civilizations on the track though that do speak the same english that we speak right now theyre backtrack way way backtrack and they talked english funny isnt it its very funny you get back into that area with sonic you know and somebody is saying hey boy look out you know usually its in lingua spacia or something like that you know polyga muga rrrr i like those tongues though that are all gutturals ghlk you know where that is consonant glnk all right we got that taped yeah all right never be ashamed to be clever as an auditor just remember that never be ashamed to be clever because youre being clever as an auditor youre not being squirrel squirrel is doing something entirely different he doesnt understand any of the principles so he makes up bunch of them to fulfill his ignorance foists them off on pc and gets place and you know your fundamentals and you know what youre doing and so forth and you dont ever get clever about anything what knucklehead of an auditor you will be because you will run into impasses every now and then that youll say whats the textbook solution there was textbook solution there are textbook fundamentals but textbook solution they tell an old gag theres an old song in the marines about this marine private who went into the battle with vim and his name was mcbin i think and he went into battle with grin because although he got killed why he had used the textbook solution he died with grin that was it because hed used the textbook solution yeah well dont go around dying with grin just because you used the textbook solution because thats just an effort to make wrong youve got to be clever now and then youve got to be very clever in checking some goals some terminals that sort of thing youve got to be clever and this modifier thing requires certain degree of cleverness after the pc has said to you fifteen or twenty times well you keep asking but i just cant reach it you know after the pc has said to you for fifteen or twenty times ask him just you know go get big blue spark and suddenly say well is the modifier that you cant reach it is that it well yes yes i want to be plumber but i cant reach it there are all these denyer bits see theres another gag you can get the modifier with is you can run the goal run the goal both ways for moment or two and the modifier will show up if its hard to get you can take the goal and you can say well well well say the goal was to give myself up or something like that all right the goal is to give myself up you run an auditing command something on the basis to how would you give yourself up how would somebody else give himself up anything like that run it two ways just for little while and so forth and then ask for the modifier and youll come out at the other end with good well better look at the thing remember all nearly all modifiers are denyers theres something else to know about this particular battle front is pc goes into sort of numb games condition when hes arc broke and he wont give up anything but he doesnt have any flexibility or fluidity of mind in other words his zones of attention are very short theyre very small and if you get pc into sort of knuckleheaded wooden well ill go along with it somehow frame of mind the amount of success you are going to have in getting that pc to reach anything is going to be very poor in other words the livelier the happier the more cheerful the more fluid or fluent pc feels why the more likely you are to get goal get terminal get modifier you know and so forth pc is sitting there glumly well ill go ahead and be audited just because you say so you know dont expect him to reach very much because hes sort of not extending himself and sometimes its little bit worth your while to get pc to extend himself slightly instead of just sitting there woundup doll yourself and so forth why just have discussion about all of this you know of course in the process of the discussion you can invalidate him break the auditors code fifteen times and make him worse if you find youre doing that its better thing not to do anything wooden frame of mind is better than completely gone one all right here we have maxine kozak auditing jenny edmunds and i am sure the pc will absolutely die in her tracks at my taking up this particular report because the goal is not to be found out isnt it jenny female voice yes okay female voice yes all right and we dont find anything here we find the modifier is assessed and weve got several the modifier not to be found out well i dont know how this goes together what have we got another goal here i have been wondering about this i spent some i was worried about this as matter of fact how do we take this goal not to be found out because not to be found out sounds more like modifier than it does goal now did we ask this pc if there was any goal on the front end of it female voice today yeah female voice yeah we did female voice yeah was there anything on the front end of this not to be found out you know to be plumber but not to be found out any goal on the front end of this is there what is it female voice to tell lies yeah to tell lies and not be found out female voice yes so oh what youve got written down here is the front end female voice yeah thats how it makes sense female voice oh yes the whole list is yes yeah all right you dont say so anyplace see female voice not to be found out not to be found out is the modifier youve got the goal you did goals assessment on top of the modifier female voice yes i realize that you see female voice yes so these actually are goals and weve got the modifier up here not to be found out female voice yes all right thats the modifier and we already had that as goal female voice yes see it wasnt goal and now weve got this other goal here do you mind if i female voice hm all right she does mind female voice i tell you i dont female voice i dont really you dont really female voice all right its to tell lies and not to be found out and thats your goal modifier sequence fascinating i was concerned with that because i saw that and i said good heavens weve got the modifier end of the line now i held my breath because i didnt know whether or not we could easily get the goal end of the line and im very very glad you did hm female voice as soon as you said it last night i knew it was the modifier oh yeah all right well im very very glad that we got that pair sorted out that was very good job very good job yeah thisll theres only two or three here in this particular unit that i was concerned with and this was one of them very much so and i thought what on earth is that one going to turn out to be well that was an excellent job now has it been checked out female voice it hasnt all right well just say get it checked very nice very nice well apparently here that was went rather smoothly pc tended to have an arc break here toward the end of session because of the rudiments pc was traveling along here all during this assessment at 25 225 275 and then all of sudden on the rudiments went to 325 and then went to 30 and then stayed at 30 what was that all about female voice it was after the break when she came back after the break the tone arm went up shed been figuring female voice hm yes something on that order been figuring or something like that do you think that was it female voice i asked her what it was did you get it female voice i didnt get the tone arm down yeah well i would show that up wouldnt i in front of god and everybody female voice its okay when pcs ta goes up during break or between sessions its very good thing to investigate it rather thoroughly all right well you get it down for the next session i think thats very nice okay stop worrying about that one okay hm yeah youre having ball all right now im glad you put this one in my hands because this was the first one that was done and i gave this to bob to sort out jennys goal and modifier all right we had goal running on this particular case and it was to be racetrack driver and that goal was not it was doing all right the case kept hanging fire on the terminal racetrack driver and so forth so i caused an assessment here and this caused an upset to the pc the pc was quite upset to have another goals assessment or something like that done and while we were scrambling around on it we got in here with this goalmodifier arrangement and the auditor promptly shook it out as goalmodifier arrangement may i say what it is female voice of course all right female voice sure all right to be racetrack driver but racetrack driver couldnt rule that was what was missing off the end of it and of course this makes highly specialized terminal now what does that terminal turn out to be the terminal turns out to be may i say it turns out to be lucifer now just why it does is up to the pc and so on and were not interested in whether terminals are logical or illogical or something like that its whether or not they run but the pc couldnt run this couldnt run fiveway bracket on the assessed prehav scale couldnt do it because the pc says im too much the terminal now youre going to find that now that youre finding very finite remember what i told you i said were heading in for way of finding the terminal well of course if you get very fundamental terminal you get total association between the pc and the terminal as being almost the order of the day they dont differentiate between one another at all now you find terminals on children and you find exactly this condition you find out they cant differentiate between one thing and the other so your first auditing commands this fiveway bracket wouldnt run on this pc and our first auditing commands of fiveway bracket couldnt be checked out the auditor very cleverly did not run them the auditor actually cleared the auditing commands and possibly the pcs digging in her heels had something to do with it and found out they couldnt be run and asked on the report what to do about all this well what to do about this became very simple you just treat this as total closure that is the pc thinks of self as the terminal so you limit the bracket and i must call to your attention the tremendous importance in the prelogics of gradient scales you solve all cases by gradient scales all things are solved by gradient scales all auditing is done by gradient scale and so auditing commands when they are difficult to do are done by gradient scale and you get the simplest auditing command that you can think of and then you go from there on out now of course perimeters of attention are so limited when youve got terminal totally closed with the pc the perimeter of attention is too tight they cant get the idea actually of another person youve got the terminal and then you havent got anything else you see youve got the terminal and heres the terminal crunch you see and you say well how would you shoot another how would you communicate to another you see how would another communicate to you this is too steep this is too much but you can ask them something on the order or should be able to whether or not the person can communicate with himself or whether the terminal can communicate with itself naturally you could get that and if you ran those two youd eventually get differentiation so the auditing commands i recommended were something on the order of suggested what might you have disagreed was the level what might you have disagreed with and what might lucifer have disagreed with see not what have you disagreed with about lucifer or what has lucifer disagreed with about you you see this is just total concentric singleness what have you disagreed with what might you have disagreed with and what might lucifer have disagreed with we put might in there and the person doesnt have to answer very specifically you see we arent asking for the exact recall you ask person to recall all right recall time when you built your first pyramid thank you they cant answer that kind of question but you can say when might you have built pyramid see oh well they think well then anytime within that millionyear line see they might have done it you see and they dont even have to say they have done it and yet it will run very easily and it is quite beneficial so we put might in there that eases it up weve got already it on gradient now lets see what we did here we ran this apparently hm looks awfully good here it looks like the tone arm was flying around bit cognition and so forth heavy rock slams running between 26 25 oh it took little while to get going apparently yeah and then it started flying up here to 350 this is nice action then you got blowdown and blowdown and the pc made her goals and feels good about the tone arm action and so do i break rudiments well in and then we got went flying back up to 350 down to 225 that is very fine action by the way that is very good action 225 to 35 you would realize is threequarters of division but its in the clear range and that much action in the clear range is pretty fantastic dont think too much you can have whole tone arm action between 50 and 60 way over here and it doesnt mean anywhere near as much as half tone arm action down around the clear range its interesting you get person up at 50 all hes got to do is withhold the fact that his the end of his nose twitches and he goes up to 60 you see so anyhow that was fine and he got various blowdowns and then some apathy began to come off im glad to see that actually because shes been sitting around in it ive been looking at her now and then saying well shes swimming through some bit of it thats right isnt it and it was sticking around little too long so i was glad we found that all right and shes auditors comment is tone arm action fairly active pc felt this area was difficult to run because there wasnt much mest to grapple with felt kind of queasy in the stomach since the beginning says oh whats the use and sighs frequently however shes answered each command without any dispersal i questioned pc by expanding about expanding the bracket male voice right and the pc has certain resistance to running these agreedupon flows because she claims they dont get at one area and clean it up and she has to hop around too much to do the command in full bracket well thats perfect i agree with that hundred percent ill give you the answer to this in minute which i will have to ferret out and clean up i suspect its probably arc breaks in doing the bracket commands youre just asking the pcs to fall in over their head little bit you know and they just zzzttt and how do i expand this bracket is it lucifer to others pc to others the next way you expand the bracket you can go to straight fiveway bracket you can but the theoretical way you expand the bracket is to make an interchange between the pc and lucifer now male voice thats what i had across from it yeah well that is the that would be the next change it would be the inter what have you disagreed with what has lucifer disagreed with you could say something on the order of you could put the word might in there what might you have disagreed with about lucifer or what might lucifer have disagreed with about you you get the interchange going now you see youve got it centercenter all right now lets get an interchange going and dont swing around into lucifer to other or other to lucifer because that requires loosening attention but thats added later see all right and i think that is going very very well but heres heres some data youre in need of here the pcs goal lets go back and look at this goal see to be racetrack driver but racetrack driver couldnt rule now this integrates in some fashion with the behavior of the pc and youll find out in running goalplusmodifier terminal that the pc this is quite important may heavily dramatize the goal when they first run the terminal see they thats well lets say part of the modifier is but it is unreachable and as you run this they dont tell you directly that its unreachable they just feel very dissatisfied about the thing you see and theres nothing there and so on and they keep feeling like this as youre running it and theyre uncomfortable and dont think anybody is very comfortable running goalplusmodifier terminal because this is were getting into heavier raw meat with this stuff and the goal has tendency to be dramatized slightly by the pc the goal is not in view and so forth now i wouldnt expand the auditing command yet i would dream up method of running twoway flow on the goalplusmodifier male voice hm what racetrack driver couldnt rule male voice hm see now how do you get the reversed flow well you just say what couldnt you rule what havent you been able to rule what mightnt you have been able to rule dont you see what mightnt racetrack driver be able to rule you know anything of that character but slide that in as your three and four see you plus self on rule racetrack driver see plus self plus racetrack driver see on rule just thats it see you not rule you couldnt rule racetrack driver couldnt rule disagreed with self lucifer disagreed with and this thing will suddenly start integrating youll see different scene suddenly then you can start expanding it but i wouldnt necessarily drop the goal out of the line it all depends on how it runs you have to kind of run it by ear we dont have very much experience right here at this moment or much backlog on it we know were dead right and that it is running along fine but its just exactly how you tune up the heterodyne so it will superreceive were not quite cognizant of okay male voice right sounds sensible to you male voice yes all right add goal commands to twoway and run an awfully good job bob thank you all right this is marianne christie auditing smokey smokey all right if i mention any of this male voice i dont give damn its all right all right now i suspected that this was going to be dogs breakfast do you know why because i think that this was another one of the things where we had the modifier and didnt have the goal or there was something wrong and i couldnt imagine myself easily or readily what you could add to hidden source of action to be hidden source of action all right goal to be hidden source of action how do we modify this it seems selfmodified doesnt it so ive been kind of ive been very interested in seeing what came out of this and so forth and he got list of modifiers here apparently about oh i dont know maybe thirty somethinng like that and all were getting is restatements of goals the goal is to be hidden source of action all right and all were getting is not unknown could be found somebody could find it now how do we add that in marianne how do these make goalplusmodifier not unknown female voice it seemed real to smokey that these would be stopping or make it difficult to get that goal these were liabilities yeah but how would we make statement out of it female voice once it got known it wouldnt be possible to have goal in it thered be game on it we want full goalplusmodifier weve got misapprehension here on whats required thats what this is all about i see some sign of it here but to be apathetic or to be hidden source of action would be degraded about not being known well now that would make complete statement to be hidden source of action but to be degraded about not being known all right that would make complete thing i see here that we have double check on that it was still staying in did that stay in female voice everything has gone not just now there are only about four at the bottom there that are in these four at the bottom are still in female voice yes but these are relatively new ones added on at the last at the end of the list it tended to null the lot just in the last quarter of an hour to be hidden source of action with an intention to be found that was more recent one huh female voice yes all right well youll just have to carry on with this youll have to also make very very sure that your pc does not feel that his goal is being invalidated which it isnt we dont think its wrong we only think its incomplete see so go along and get that pcs riding pretty high here on the tone arm which is not extraordinary for this particular pc seems to have done all right though and seems to be pulling with you very well and thats very fine now this pc has already run some of his goal female voice yes and if i had any more trouble with this at all i would simply go into it on the basis of running this command how would you be hidden source of action something on that order and how would another be hidden source of action and id just run this back and forth few times see id run this for maybe fifteen twenty minutes something like that and then check out the modifier that came with it or anything that came up as following it as matter of sober fact you have very tough one here because i think it is highly probable that it is the goal and modifier all in one package statement bong see you get the idea female voice yes it just sounds like it to be hidden source of action its almost impossible you know see that forms itself enough problems to make game from here till halifax doesnt it smoke huh all right but dont go torturing the pc about it in some way if he cant get modification to it he cant and if he can he can but these sound very very promising intend to reveal some source later intention to be found wanting to reveal source later female voice there were one or two straight in the middle too that sounded very promising but then they went null mmhm well all right but hes getting the classification clarification of it and i am sure that you will get it okay ive told you ways and means of doing so okay female voice thank you okay ive just taken up some sample cases to show you what we look at how we go through it maybe youve learned something maybe you havent i havent shown you the onetwothree of how to do it and i should add the onetwothree first let us find out if the pc was audited that day now you think that is funny but by george if you dont check the time audited you may find that the session has been abbreviated or had to be cancelled out or something like that youre immediately shortcircuited then into some other interest in other words what is wrong here does not become any technical question it becomes some personal relationship of some kind or another or present time problems of the pc or something of this sort so you look over the amount of time the pc was audited that day then the next thing you look at is to look at the pcs goals that were set for the session and find out whether or not if the auditor has noted it that the pc felt he made any of his goals for the session pc felt he made his goals for the session in whole or in part well thats fine thats fine and then you check tone arm action you look down the line for tone arm action if youre not getting any tone arm action of any kind whatsoever you know doggone well one of two things is true the rudiments are out mile regardless of whats being done whether its sec check or assessment or anything else the rudiments are out mile or the pc is clear and that depends in large measure on what the tone arm is reading then you look on the list if process is being run you quickly check twenty minute periods down the column for the tone arm reads to find out if at any time this process was flat for twenty minutes and the auditor has missed it thats to make sure that youre not getting an overrun on level its very easy to do you dont have to do it with very great care thing says 30 30 30 30 30 or theres whole bunch of 30 30 30 30 30s all together you say gee what do you know dzzzzzz is there quarter of tone arm difference here on this 30 30 30 column and if there isnt why then you might find that youve got some trouble towards the end of the session and this is easily explained to you now anybody can understand how theres trouble at the end toward the end of the session all weve done is flatten the process and then weve overrun the process and then the needle was getting sticky and the pc is getting very restive and pc cant find any more answers and it all seems very stupid and masses are being dragged in on the pc and hes being crushed inexorably under the wheels of juggernaut and few minor things like this might account for the fact that there were some arc breaks at the end of the session and they come out of this area was the process flat for any given twenty minutes in the session if it was why you yelp now actually auditors going on noting tone arm reads noting tone arm reads noting tone arm reads just going on down the line down the line down the line down the line sometimes are so interested in auditing they dont realize that theyve written down 310 320 310 305 310 320 3 it wont go reading like this long i mean itll now start to do something else itll start to climb you can say that if that goes on for half an hour you know the vast difference of read between 31 and 315 and it went on for an hour now you can expect the tone arm to go to 35 375 42 4 were getting lots of tone arm motion here you see 42 425 425 425 425 425 425 425 they never mention what the needle characteristic is but of course it is rigid as girder in the eiffel tower thu uuurh chance of reassessing gone that is exactly what happens along these lines you check for that and then you check the auditors comments the next thing you check is the auditors comments whats the auditor think about this and find out if the auditor wants any advice its whether or not youre going to give him advice gratuitously whether he asks for it or not or you found something that you should comment on or whether or not he wants advice on the thing or what progress hes making and you put down whatever the adjudication you have of it now you can do an awful lot with an auditors report it depends to some degree upon the legibility of the report cryptography shouldnt be part of an auditors report study line im not good at cryptography it is much easier for to come around and read your mind than to bother with your writing sometimes but i know that auditors reports are written hurriedly and i would rather have an auditors report which is the original report written at the time of the session written during the session and i dont like copied reports i dont like report to be copied after the session or written after the session i actually like all the gimmicks and stuff written during the session i dont care how many sheets of paper it took how much scribble there is to it somehow or other it can be made out because that is better report than what you remember after the session and when it comes to tone arm numbers copying tone arm numbers when you transcribe from scribbled sheet of note paper over here to column youre liable to make some kind of mistake i like to see the report as it was written during the auditing session if its legible fine but certainly the report that was written during the session not copy of the report afterwards youll find out its much more beneficial that is about all you look for now knowing scientology as background of all of this and the various things that you see that are taking place during that particular session it doesnt take much of crystal ball to find out that this or that or the other thing is taking place during the session it isnt very hard to adjudicate that the rudiments are out why i just gave you an example of what i mean karl set goals at the beginning of the session well he must have felt kind of mug you know i can sympathize with him because i felt that way myself occasionally at the beginning of session but usually i didnt think the auditor could audit i didnt think he was going to do anything why set any goal you know so thats an easy one to adjudicate you get the idea you just say well hes didnt set goal poom tone arm tone arm action well theres something flat tone arm extraordinarily high and stays there and never fluctuates well we dont know he might be running through phase of the process he might be in an awful arc break he might have withholds he might have lot of things but now you get to point of adjudication we dont know what that high tone arm means theres nothing wrong with having high tone arm nothing wrong at all with having high tone arm but it can stem from several things if persons tone arm doesnt ever go high theyd never make any progress remember that case that is reading constantly at 30 with sticky needle forever at 30 with sticky needle will go through 70 before they come down to 30 again and will spend the greater part of their auditing career after they get launched in the vicinity of 40 or 50 you realize that its not matter of trying to keep the pcs tone arm at 20 or 30 because you take someone whos below death and work like mad to keep his tone arm between 20 or 30 youre going to be spooked all the time because every time you make gain he reads 65 you make gain he reads 12 the other thing is as you see tone arm reads drop below 20 you realize that sooner or later theyre going to go all the way around and as youre following the reports down the line and you see the tone arm has registers 12 its sort of somebody has dropped shoe and youre waiting for them to drop the other shoe because that is going to follow sooner or later if it doesnt follow the case is not progressing i gave mary sue one one night she was auditing and she got to recall something or other and i recalled something or other and turned the tone arm all the way from something on the order of 30 through 70 through 65 and down to 30 again on the other side it went on complete revolution it just sat there it went about that fast see staggered her she was good for the remainder of the session i hardly the end of the session she told about this see she was stonied recall one thing and you get revolution of the tone arm all right this was as fast as she had seen it but you shouldnt operate on huge this is criticism of what she was doing but you shouldnt operate on big withhold from your pc on what the meter is doing if the pc wants to know what the meter is doing you let the pc know what the meter is doing he asks you what the meter is doing why you say thats all right and show him what the meter is doing he says well is that goal still in or is that modifier still in well tip the meter over and repeat the modifier and let him see it knock just once dont let him sit there and make life study of it but dont deny him information through the session you see and sometimes you have to read between the lines because you havent got all the steps of the auditing session you dont quite know whats happening in the auditing session but you sometimes have to look it over from the basis well maybe code breaks and that sort of thing are occurring or maybe the pc is just being denied lots of information and so on and you only get curious about these things when pc is doing poorly go by this rule dont go charging around on case and throwing smoke into the air and so on well i can do this once in while i think the case could be moved little faster or something like that but dont go throwing your weight around on case that is moving if the case is moving its moving what means moving tone arm action pcs making their goals everything seems to be going along and they are making progress all right its relatively uneventful picture it merely means you re getting tone arm action pcs apparently making their goals auditor doesnt have any vast questions about it apparently doing all right leave it alone leave it alone just say fine okay good continue thats it you know leave it alone tone arm action pc sets ninetyfive goals makes none we see that the end rudiments took threequarters of the session something you know well actually the thing to do is to get ahold of the auditor or pass him word or write the report out in such way that you want information thats basically what you want you shouldnt be telling him things to do without some information about it you want some personal information the best kind of information is personal information youre directing lot of auditors and you see report like that and what the hell you know threequarters of the session was devoted to the end rudiments threequarters of the session devoted to the end rudiments well the thing to do is get ahold of the auditor and the pc its better to get ahold of the auditor and the pc than just the auditor always better because you can always crosscheck the pc that is to say you can always put the pc on the meter and you can find out how the pc is going find out what the pc is reacting to and so forth but this all comes under the heading of checking cases and keeping them running and ive tried to give you an example here of this of some of the things i do and look for and think about i do this every night with your cases and sometimes i actually miss your presence on deck and i have to sometimes make wild guess about it and there youre lying there in bed innocently asleep and so forth and its very hard to pick your brains very very hard to do so and the aura that comes off the auditors report is usually bit mucky so the essence of the thing is that cases making smooth progress are the cases that you pay the least attention to except to make sure that they go on making smooth progress what you pay attention to are the hangups and if case is running well leave it alone case is running well dont change it if an auditor is auditing case very well dont rouse him around dont rack him up one side and down the other see lay off but if this thing is going by fits and starts and falling on its face and that sort of thing well give them note on the report but always try to follow it through with some personal information along any communication line which you have about that particular case in this particular case why most of you whose cases are going badly auditing somebody whose case is going badly that is to say you generally will stop somebody on staff and you will generally tell them all about it you didnt know that you put communication line almost directly straight dead to ron whenever you did this because thats of course what we pay attention to want to keep them rolling well cases can be an awful worry to you they can be an awful worry and you get this many cases running all together its case of sometimes holding your breath just little bit you know well is that one coming back on the line or not you know its like keeping twentysix plates spinning simultaneously on the end of sticks something like this and theyre all different and they all have their peculiarities of operation but they all follow the same rules so i hope what i have given you here might have helped you out at some time okay all right
