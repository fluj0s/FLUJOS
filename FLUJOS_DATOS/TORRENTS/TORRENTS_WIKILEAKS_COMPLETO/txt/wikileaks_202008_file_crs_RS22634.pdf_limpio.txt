equipment used in fiber optic cable networks the plaintiffs in the case class of tellabs shareholders alleged that tellabss fra udulent conduct began with the issuing of press release which stated th at tellabs had signed multiyear 100 million contract for one of tellabss nextgenera tion products the titan 6500 tellabss chief executive officer ceo richard notebaert predicted to financial analysts that in addition to the sprint contract there would be continuing growth of the titan 5500 the 6500s pred ecessor based in part on these repres entations market analysts recommended that investors buy tellabs st ock in addition further optimistic statements signed by notebaert and richard birck tellabss chai rman and former ceo included tellabss growth is robust our markets hold signifi cant potential for sustained growth and our core business is performing well as time passed notebaert continued to issue upbeat statements within two years of the first optimistic statement issued by notebaert tellabs significantly reduced its project ed earnings and its stock price plunged plaintiffs then filed class action suit against tellabs and 10 of its executives alleging that the executives knowingly lied to th public in specific ways such as that they knew that the titan 6500 was not available nd that they knew that the demand for the titan 5500 was waning instead of growing pl aintiffs also alleged that birck engaged in illegal insider trading the district court twice dismissed the shareholders suit on the basis that the shareholders had faile d to prove scienter under the pslra5 the plaintiffs appealed to the seventh circuit arguing that 1 some of the statements that the court dismissed as mere puffery were legally actionable 2 the complaint provided enough detail to support strong inference of scienter for each of the defendants and 3the disclaimer which accompanied tellabss forecasts was insufficient and that therefore tellabs could not rely upon the pslras safe rbor provision6 the court of appeals for the seventh circ uit first listed three distinct statutory violations that plaintiffs complaint alleged first the plaintiffs contended that tellabs as company and that notebaert and birc k as individuals violated section 10b7 the general antifraud provision of the securities exchange act of 19348 and securities and exchange commission sec rule 10b59 the sec rule which implements the general antifraud provision second the complaint lleged that notebaert birck and certain other tellabs executives were control pers ons and therefore liable under section 20a10 of the securities exchange act for the corpor ations fraudulent acts third the plaintiffs alleged that birck committed insider trading violations11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22634crs3 12

1977in analyzing the issues of the case the seventh circuit noted that the pslra which governs class actions brought for securities law violations sets out particularity for fact pleading that exceeds the requirements under ru 9b of the fede ral rules of civil procedure12 under the pslra securities fraud section 10b complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleadin g the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading and if an allegation regard ing the statement or omission is made on information and belief the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed13 and state with particularity facts giving rise to strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind14 there has been debate within the courts of appeals as to how much factual detail in the pleadings is enough to satisfy the str ong inference of scienter required by the pslra for example the ninth circuit has stated that in enacting the strong inference requirement congress raised the bar under the pslra for the substantive state of mind requirement for securities fraud allegations15 the seventh circuit decision stated that it was not convinced that congress intended to raise the bar under the pslra because prior to the enactment of the pslra every circuit considering the substantive standard had held that showing of recklessness was sufficient to allege scienter16 the seventh circuit stated that because the pslra refers to the required state of mind it seemed likely that congress approved of the state of mind standard used be fore passage of the pslra and that if congress wanted stricter scienter standard to be used congress would have placed new standard in the law the seventh circuit went on to discuss th at although it believed that the pslra did not impose stricter substantiv scienter standard the act did raise the bar for pleading scienter in addition to having to meet particularity requirement plaintiffs according to the seventh circuit had to meet substa ntive requirement by pleading sufficient facts to create strong inference of scienter the seventh circuit could not find congressional intent as to what facts will creat such an inference further according to the seventh circuit there is conflict in the circuits as to how to demonstrate the required strong inference the second and third ci rcuits follow the reasoning that the pslrahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22634crs4 17 plaintiffs may continue to state claim by pleading either motive and opportunity or strong circumstantial evidence or

pleading requirement above the second circuit standard requiring plaintiffs merely to provide facts s howing simple recklessness or motive to commit fraud and opportunity to do so in re silicon graphics securities litigation 183 f3d 970 974 9th cir 1999 because the clear purpose of the pslra was to curb abusive securities litigation and because we believe that the motive and opportunity

however believe that c ongress considered but rejected the second circuits approach and instead chose more onerous burden18 the remaining six circuits according to the seventh circuit have taken middle gr ound and have reasoned that congress chose neither to adopt nor reject particular methods of pleading scienter such as alleging facts showing motive and opportunity but instead only required plaintiffs to plead facts that together establish strong inference of scienter19 the seventh circuit in this case decided to follow this middle ground having decided the line of reasoning that it would take concerning the threshold of what constitutes strong inference of scienter the seventh circuit held that plaintiffs complaint against notebaert met the threshold but that the complaint against birck did not meet the threshold notebaerts guilt derived according to the court from the evidence that he likely knew that the optimistic statements which he made concerning tellabss titan 5500 and t itan 6500 were false bi rck on the other hand made optimistic projections only up until the time that he likely knew of the titan 5500s market weakness the federal securities laws impose liability not only on the person who actually commits the securities law violation but also on the persons who directly or indirectly20control the violator therefore the plaintiffs claims against notebaert birck and the other tellabs executives for controlling person liability survived the executives according to the court may later ve an opportunity to prove that they acted in good faith further since notebaert acted within the scope of his position as ceo of tellabs his knowledge of the fals ity of his statements could be imputed to the corporate entity tellabs finally the charge against bi rck for insider trading survived because of his possibly being found to be control person conflict among the circuit courts as to how to demonstrate the required strong inference was the reason for the supreme courts granting of certiorari in the tellabs case21 in its decision the supreme court held that to qualify as strong inference of scienter under the pslra the inference mu st be more than merely plausible orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22634crs5 22 slip op at 1516 23 slip op at 11reasonable it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent the court in its analysis stated that congress has the authority to provide the standard for pleading claim congress as creator of federal statut ory claims has power to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the claim just as it has power to determine what must be proved to prevail on the merits it is the federal lawmakers prerogative therefore to allow disallow or shape the cont ours of including the pleading and proof requirements for 10b private actions decision of this court questions that authority in general22 finding clear guide from congress in the statute or in the legislative history on what would satisfy the requirements for str ong inference the court established three prescriptions for satisfying the standard 1 faced with motion to dismiss section 10b action under the rules of civil pr ocedure courts must accept ll factual allegations in the complaint as true 2 courts must consider the complaint in its entirety as well as other sources such as documents incorporated into the complaint by reference and matters of which court may take judici notice and 3 in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to strong inference of scient er court must take into account plausible opposing inferences23 the court ended its opinion by stating that it would not decide whether under the three prescriptions for the standard it descri bed as necessary for strong inference of scienter the shareholders allegations warranted strong inference that notebaert and tellabs acted with the required state of mind the lower courts did not have the opportunity to consider the matter in the light of these prescriptions therefore the court vacated the seventh circuits judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion
