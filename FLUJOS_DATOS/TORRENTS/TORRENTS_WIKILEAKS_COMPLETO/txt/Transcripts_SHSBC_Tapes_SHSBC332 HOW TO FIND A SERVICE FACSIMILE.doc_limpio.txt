how to find service facsimile lecture given on 4 september 1963 thank you im very very glad to announce that there are some of you who are not in trouble thought wed start the lecture on happy note whats the date audience four september four sept ad 13 dont know what the month is named after but probably something very barbaric well the shadow of your big toe has approached within several yards of service facsimile you remind of scout looking over citadel which is bristling with guns and quite hostile observing it from as far deep in the neighboring woods as you possibly can get and i think maybe youve caught the tip of one turret or have seen sign which says citadel and im going to ask you now to be brave and even get out to the edge of the woods and take look at this thing because its well worth looking at and perhaps the fault that you have not seen it is resident with it appears to be quite lucid to it doesnt seem to be offering very much complication and so on but i know what this breed of cat is i myself have taken look at it and have audited it and have seen the results of it and over period of years have had an unhappy history of colliding with it you know youre going down ml there and youre wide open you know and everything is fine and ill be of gun if somebody hasnt piled barrels across the road dont you see and well thats the end of that one you see pcs pcs have always been full of surprises and its been of great interest to to find out how they create these surprises and so im very very happy with what weve got here in the service facsimile because it is how they create these surprises and what happens apparently theres great deal to know about this thing and i have not to any great degree relayed this information even in the bulletin of r3sc apparently this takes lot of grasp basically because its terribly simple and its not that anybody is protecting their service facsimileyou can almost wipe that out you head persons attention toward the service facsimile and they go right on in man they go down the toboggan and over the fallscrash they are more able to keep out of the service facsimile than anything and you neednt erect now structure of philosophy to explain bad assessment by saying the pc will defend himself against his service fac being found the pc will not the pc gets to the middle of this whirlpool and just whirls thats it man all youve got to do is swing him somewhere in the vicinity of the lake in which the whirlpool exists and he dives right in and swims like mad and goes right to the whirlpool and says thats itunless hes prevented from doing so my first plea then is dont prevent the pc from finding his service facsimile that seems to be rather obvious point to make and im sorry that it sounds sardonic or sarcastic but im afraid has to be made because you could say well of course if the pc counts on this for survival hes not going to let it be found you see and you could go off on that line and make lot of hard work for yourself and actually its not of that nature at all now there are so many ways of isolating service facsimile that to cover the area of assessment at this particular stage of the game is merely to put in your hands lot of rote this and that which will more assist you to miss the service facsimile than to find it there is substitute whatsoever for knowing what one is there is substitute at all now the service facsimile first and foremost is tremendous solution which the pc believes if disturbed will end his survival it is always an aberrated solution it always exists in present time and is part of the environment of the pc and it is something that everyone unintentionally or otherwise is telling the pc is wrong and causing him to assert that it is right now you get to understand service facsimile little bit better when you recognize that last point that last point is very very important otherwise youre going to be running some of the silliest things and calling them service facsimiles and youre not going to make the boat at all the environment the mores one or another dynamics is insistently and constantly at work trying to tell the individual that the service facsimile is wrong and the individual is constantly saying that it is right and when you have that situation you have an unauditable pc because he is getting audited only to prove that this is right and actually will constantly bring it up in auditing it is about as hard to find as burning tar barrel in the middle of an empty field on dark night see the pc is always bringing this to the auditors attention this is so much the case that once you have found it you will consider that you have been very obtuse indeed but sometimes its being brought to the auditors attention in different wordings in different conduct in different approaches that one doesnt find it easy to label and it is probably labeling it that is harder than finding it now let us first look at the exact thing we are trying to do with service facsimilethe exact thing we are trying to do with it there is one thing we are trying to do with itand then this will move out of your perimeter as an auditor any necessity of trying to use this principle to make an ot because that is not what were using it for ill give you an idea now of this reg and i just had discussion moment ago and he was saying well human body would be service facsimile hes absolutely right hes absolutely right but this of course is being applied to going otnot for the purpose we are applying it see the remark is absolutely correct it turns on mass see it is being asserted constantly and so forth obviously its perfectly good service facsimile you see well all thats wrong with it is that it isnt the service facsimile we are trying to target see the wrong target because if you used that you would be going to ot dont you see and we are not using the service facsimile for that were simply using it to get person auditable this lifetime and get out of the road those constantly restimulated solutions that make it hard to audit this person and thats its purpose its purpose is simply to clear this lifetime now i can give you some beauties on the application of the service facsimile on the whole track what do you suppose you have bank for it obviously must be some sort of service facsimile obviously it turns on mass doesnt it it follows all of the rules obviously how would having bank make you right and others wrong well obviouslyhaobviously would kill the pc why well youd just restimulate the whole early track and youd throw him into countless gpms and youd overrestimulate him like mad but obviously according to the theory its perfectly valid service facsimile reactive mind is perfectly valid service facsimile but not for the purposes that we are going to use this for its well to remember the basic principles of the service facsimile when you are running somebody to ot because sooner or later youre going to find this guy and he just cant seem to get up to point where he can tilt planet youre having trouble with this pc he sits down there on one mountaintop and you sit there on the other mountaintop and youre trying to audit him see and the emeter you use are the little glows that appear in the various parts of his vicinity see you say something you see something glow you say that read probably your auditing commands are all in telepathy or something like this but we dont care much about that thats good thing to remember this guy justhe keeps complaining complainingarc breaking weather gets terrible on the planet you knowkeeps arc breaking thunderstorms and other things occur and hes got this ptp you see he just cant tilt planet weak and i bid you remember this point you see that undoubtedly you are now bucking service facsimile see which would probably after youve talked for while add up to something like being incapable and you ask him all right how would being incapable make you right and how would it make others wrong and so forth and you run it on up with just the same steps of r3sc you undoubtedly got this boy flying again you see into some new zone or area so youre never really rid of the principles of the service facsimile hes got some tremendous solution and that solution is being incapable how does he survive by being incapable at what level at some very upstage level of some kind or another you see all right so thats perfectly valid so itd be valid almost at any point of case but that isnt what we are using it for and that is not the design and style of r3sc its the same breed of catthe same breed of cat but we are attacking here solution which just like any other solution is barrier to the discharge of the confusion whats made this possible is new evaluation and new road found through the bank on guess what youve had new communication level in auditing and so forth and that clarified lot of things but of course the service facsimile is born out of reevaluation and readjustment of the confusion and the stable datumthat basic confusion and the stable datum the confusion can only stay in place as long as it has stable datum to hang it up now that is so light and so easily changed by thetan or being that this does not much get in anybodys road its only when it becomes an aberrated solution the loss of which threatens survival that the individual fails to be able to discharge the mass associated with it so if you could see confusion as stable datum you know those principles theyre old hca principles you should realize that you can actually pluck out of the center of the confusion the stable datum and at that point get discharge of the energy held in place its new discovery you see what holds the confusion in place stable datum thats new thought do you see because you handle life all the time on the reverse line youve got too much confusion put stable datum in and the confusion lines up on the stable datum thats how youve been using it before all right lets take reverse look how is the confusion held in place the confusion is held in place by stable datum so the removal of the stable datum then discharges the confusion and confusion is very good description of what is charge charge is an electrical confusion now as long as stable datum is held in place by the person the confusion will not discharge do you see this so heres new piece of advanced technologyrather remarkable piece of technologythat we have had around for very long time and its simply reverse look at the thing and we know now how to hold confusion in place now fortunately for usfortunately for usconfusions are tolerable and not always aberrative in fact the biggest part of the confusions of life are not at all aberrative they could go on for long time without hurting any thetan or incapacitating him for moment youre playing card game youre playing card game and youre having an awful time playing this card game you just never seem to really get anyplace playing this card game and you discover little booklet and it says how you play canasta see and you read over this booklet and it gives you some hot dope on the thing and after that you can play canasta this is just about as aberrative as eating blueberry pie you understand nevertheless the confusions of canasta are held in abeyance by these little rules you have learned about canasta now of course the confusions concerning canasta as i say have aberrative value whatsoever zero life you see as ive told you several times in recent lectures is not in itself an aberrative activity aberration has to be rather extraordinary it has to be worked at it has to be kept in restimulation all the time now this rather innocent action of the switchboard girl solving the confusion of her job on the principle if i have twelve calls simultaneously appearing on the board i handle one and then handle two and then handle three dont you see in other words shes got confusion of calls all you have to do is teach her to handle one call each confusion she has from that point thereon is handled by that well it actually is not at all aberrative to her nothing going to drive her mad because she has twelve calls simultaneously dont you see thats nonsense so now we pull off the casewe say all right what system or solution have you had to answering calls when they were too many or confusion of calls and she says well i answer one at time and so forth we get the motion of the tone arm here could not be detected with micromillivernier univac see it actually doesnt back up any charge you get the idea theres got to be force and violence mixed up with these things theres got to be something fabulous now she could add this up and you could add this up as part of the confusion of trying to survive by having joband this could be part of it and you might touch on it and it might appear to move some mass but actually shes got something else she is worried about her survival is threatened by the fact that she could not handle her job and shes liable to be dismissed dont you see ah but look solving how she handles switchboard does not solve what she is worried about she is worried about the fact that if she does not handle her job she will not have job and her survival will thereby be threatened ah theres much bigger tower on which this little piece of confusion was leaning dont you see all right so we address this how does she hold her job by being competent switchboard operator well im afraid that this is not very aberrative either why is she worried about holding her job you say what solutions do you have for holding your job and you get little ta action see get little bit of ta action she says soandso and be nice to the boss and so forth and so forth and you get little ta action see because this threatens her survival dont you see very muchmuch more intimately but the case is still relatively unauditable there must be something on this case if were auditing this case and were having trouble with the case there must be something else that we are bucking into here what are we running into something else something else and we look around and we find out well now what makes you upset particularly about losing job or something like that what would be upsetting about this and you hear marvel of marvel and wonder of wonders you hearyou expect to hear you know my aged mother would then starve to death you see or something like that and she says well actually its my dog you cant add this up actually she cant either actually its unaddable and you say well what about the dog whats this got to do with the job well you see uh theyd put the dog to sleep if i couldnt feed the dog you see now you might be getting here close someplace and that even looks little bit sensible dont you see that doesnt look quite completely dippy but youve got the idea of human being working like mad and terribly worried about their job and so forth and weve traced it back to dog now ordinarily human beings do not work to support dogs but this one is this one is and my golly we work this around for little while and we suddenly find out that she has lots of trouble all the time and lots of upsets about keeping the dog in an apartment and we may have service facsimile that is simply described as keeping dog see thats probably too mild look at it and i havent given it to you as rough as you would actually find it or as incredible because i want you to understand it not sit there with your jaw dropped see but keeping dogkeeping dog or keeping dog in an apartment some such action as this or keeping dogand how would keeping dog make you right and how would keeping dog make others wrong and we find out that this girl has one computation in existence which makes her right and makes others wrong and it has to do with keeping barking dog in an apartment where itll annoy people and that makes her right and makes others wrong and she feels if she were deprived of that solution her survival would be shattered and this is whats causing her to worry about her job dont you see so she always carefully gets these little sharpbark terriers you see that scraffle and raffle when they walk around on the floors you see and that yip and yap endlessly particularly in the middle of the night sooner or later as youre running this thing shell all of sudden cognite you know i always seem to get very noisy dogs wonder why that is well of course naturally it bothers people more and you run this thing down and you will get some kind of an incident earlylife incident and that sort of thing where somebody insisted that dog be put to sleep or something like this because it was getting old and scrawny and she had to drive it down to the pound and everybody was busy making her wrong and he she was trying to make everybody else wrong dont you see and this thing is all wound up in ball and wonder of wonders we get this thing audited outits all about dogs you see and suddenly because keeping job and handling switchboard was attached to an aberrated service facsimile you see to this degree then her worries and anxieties all have big lie in them you see and theyre all twisted around wrong way to and all of sudden she can operate switchboard much betterdoesnt even have to have stable datum to operate one she just operates switchboard dont you see and she can keep job she doesnt worry about the job and so forth shes relaxed on this line you get this action now ive given you very very simple understandable solution herevery simple very understandable and theyre not quite that simple when found in real life they are more aberrated i gave you more intelligible one because i wanted you to understand there was some connection now as you walk across this in real life they jump usually wider gap than from job to keeping dog see probably be more involved than this they arc across larger spark gap you may find out that it is breaking dishes so you may have some more steps in it you see breaking dishes and this doesnt make any sense at all about keeping dogs or holding jobs but nothing makes any sense anyway shes breaking dishes to be right you see and breaking dishes to make others wrong and this is the service facsimile on which everything else is piling up and oddly enough if shes not permitted to break dishes she knows she cannot survive she may not know what the barometer reads she may not know how wide the street is she may not know lot of other things in life but this she does know that if she ceases to keep the dog or break the dishes or something like that why thats the end of hertotal tertiary line of defense now you may not discover this at once on ease you may not discover this promptly immediately and at once on case you may audit off one two or three apparent service facsimiles that all answer up to the complete description of service facsimile but are actually only leaning on the central service facsimile that is restimulated in present time dont you see but as you take these things off why the central one comes to view now you see now why when you say or imply to now ron you should give some kind of rote procedure by which to isolate this every time youre asking of course to apply logical system to an illogical action i probably could do it and we probably will do it and all of that sort of thing but i actually would much rather you understood what you were doing see id much rather because frankly you can hunt and punch around on ease you can take an old case assessment sheets and folders and 212 and something you know on the ease or the case reports or auditors reports or case histories or something and you could get whole list of thingsanything thats been found on the ease and you can have discussion over these various things and points and you can assess them in various ways and get one or another of them to read and youll find out the pcs interest will hang up someplace on this list theyll be very interested in it far from leaving it they dive right in on it see and heres the pcs interest itll hang up with somatic so forth and now in fooling around with this it is sometimes necessary to reword it you dont have to worry about rewording the command youll get results on cases by running different commands but youll only be running oddball flank material on the service facsimile itself dont you see now the commandsis always how would itwhichever you have foundmakes the pc right and makes others wrong its always that command see its not how would opposing it stepping on it throwing it away or something like that or fighting it make you right see because you havent got the idea of what the service facsimile is see because the condition the final identification is that the service facsimile solution is the pc that solution is the pc so it is something he has its how would it make him right and make others wrong now you can vary it how has it made you right and how has it made others wrong you could even say what would be made wrong by it now were going afield but the pc sometimes springs over and when theyre operating in an aberrated area of this particular character their ability to follow an auditing command deteriorates markedly and they slop thats all right the way you handle that and so forth hes all of suddenpc is answering what and not answering how see you say all right well just give the rest of the whats and well get back to the how you know i mean theyre not very tough you know dont make them wrong and stop them and all this sort of thing let them go because you may be standing in the road of an avalanche at an automaticity see theyll slop on that auditing command do you understand but the auditing command is not ever how has it made you wrong never never never oddly enough itll run but itll run the pc down scale how would doing things to it make you right see oh oh oh youll get some tone arm action see this is whatll fool you youll get little tone arm action itll look okay well let take the case in point we assess father and some genius has just read the rest of the 212 bulletin and found out that it was always opposeyou were supposed to oppose what you found on that so he ran 212 plus r3sc which is pretty good i suppose you can run several other processes in conjunction with it too you could probably have the pc feeling the walls at the same time you ran the process i mean you could do lot of things but anyhowim sorry but that actually happened and the command was how would opposing fatherthis is not quite the right one but dont want to cast too many brickshow would opposing father make you right brother that is not service facsimile opposing father is not service facsimilethats an action see thats just an action now if you assessed it out youve got to try it you got to try it on for size and you got to find out if theres anything to this because it would be if you assessed fatherit just simplyi mean its too idiotically simple father must be solution see it must be huge solution so we say how would father make you right and how would you know father make others wrong you see now you can drag this over into the cow pasture and say well hating father is probably the service facsimile and so forth but actually youre just looking at secondary or tertiary condition of service facsimile youre not looking at service facsimile because this is action see thisd be something which was the result of service facsimile and the first rule iswhat i first gave you in this lectureif the pc doesnt immediately jump into the lake and swim right straight to the whirlpool but tells you oh well fathermake right hmmm doesnt make any sense i call to your attention the pc is still standing on the banknot service facsimile got the idea pc has not swum madly in and got all embroiled in this thing because thats the first thing they want to do hit the service facsimiledrown why because to drown is to survive obviouslythats the characteristic of service facsimile the pc says um i dont think um i dont know itsill have toright i dont know whether thats right or not ill justmake right anddonti dont know if that would make right or not lets see would it make right would it make anybody else wrong i dont know i can answer the question there doesnt seem to be very much wrong wake up there in the auditing chair and take look at whats going on pc is standing on the bank feet not wet whirlpool not approachedequals service facsimile not been found so go on and do something else clever say well thats fine im glad we covered that cheerily cheerily cheerily cheerily cheerily and you gather up your papers and get the hell out of there see pc wont be able to keep out of it that i guarantee you man wont be able to stay out of it you say the service facsimile is burning cats see something weird like this comes up see or being cat you know something like that being catlike how would being catlike make you right oh well thats soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and then of course soandso and soandso you understand theres quite aquite athats quite thing when you start really thinking about it like that you see catlike is soandso and soandso and so on you understand and so on and lot of times been catlike because you see itit uh its catlike you know andand so forth and uh thats the way it is and so on and when you cant get in an auditing question to get the session properly started know that you have hit one now the reason it turns on automaticities is of course that it is automatic unanalyzed solutions and they simply just pour off in niagara when you got real one and youre running one always note in your auditors report automaticity it merely means more answers than the pc can articulate are arriving from the bankconveyor belt stacking up just note down when you find one of those automaticities its guarantee youve hit on service facsimile now this gives us the way it has to be run because it is susceptible to avalanches you cant then run it with the old tr 0 1 2 3 4 see youve got to throw the question into the arena and let the lions fight over it for while you understand and just dont stop it with new question dont stop it with acknowledgments let it sort of run out after while the pc has given you fifteen twenty answers and so forth and seems to look rather blankdoesnt seem to have one now and that sort of thing well you can either give him another question or you can change the thing over to the other side and it does the same thing then so its actually not one auditing question for one auditing answer youre not running it that way youre running it one auditing question for one waterfall but sometimes the pc swaps ends in the middle of it well this is time to stop him either hes busy making others wrong with this being catlike you see and others wrong others wrong others wrong others wrong and itd make right to soandso and soandso and hes just reached the end of the flow and hes turned around and hes on the back flow you can also overrun these things and put the pc into stuckflow sort of drifting anaten youre insisting that more answers must exist you see well hes already at the end of his rope and youre making him run too long on that side so its run very permissively what youre trying to do is get rid of this avalanche and automaticity and get some tone arm action thats your main purpose so how you do that as an auditor is give only enough questions to get the pc going and only enough acknowledgments to acknowledge the fact that you had lot of answers and turn it around whenever it comes toward the end of the rope and turn it around the other way its very simple stuff now trying to keep the pc answering the auditing question is sometimes difficult as i just told you because the pc will skid around on this and disassociate because hes in disassociated area and dont you ever tell that youre very shocked because this pc has given you whole bunch of answers that werent answers to the auditing question now thats expected thats expected see because what this solutionnow lets talk back on the theory of the thing this solution you see is holding back tremendous amount of aberration none of which makes sense so it doesnt asis so there sits this solution see keeping dog you see all right all this stuff is back of it and nothing is going to flow because as long as this person is able to keep dog life is handled jobs are taken care of everything is protected all is right in the worldexcept of course for the painful stomach hatred of dogs and some little marginal fringe worries you know of one kind or another and being broke all the time and not being able to have job or hold job its like trying to solve problem with whopping lie dont you see and boy would you have to get busy to keep this problem solved with this whopping lie so it has to be continuously assertedcontinuously asserted and that solution then is just solution thats all it is and the pc doesnt even have to work on it consciously because the pc has got it all triggered to be worked on all the time anyhow its the immediate answer to anything so life just continues to stack up on this solution and it accumulates mass on this solution and the solution accumulates mass now because the solution now let give you the condition of what kind of solution its got to be its got to be below 20 on the tone scale solutionalways below 20 nothing above 20 see its below 20 solution because it perforce is substitute for an itsa line its substitute for an itsa line the pc started out by feeling he or she could not itsa the object that he or she was trying to make wrong and so dreamed up this solutiondreamed up this solution as final solution and that then is substitute for an itsa line believe it or not well theres girl sitting there and mother has not spoken to her since noon because the fender of the car has been dented and she has this solution well families are good you see makes it unnecessary to observe mother makes it unnecessary to observe the environment makes it unnecessary to participate makes it necessity at all to do anything about it because its all doneits all contained there in the solution and then because you see there is isness occurring on the environment you get an accumulation of mass see mass only accumulates in the absence of itsa so there goes the old shell game so its actually substitute itsa line now because of this of course it then is referred to every time one refers to anything and when it is below 20 on the tone scale solution it of course is propounding thisits propounding this very clearly as aberrated as this sounds to survive it is necessary to succumb and that solution always propounds that one way or the other in some oblique aberrated way survival is made up of numerous number of succumbs how to survive not to have any funthats good way see to cry all the time to appear to be destitute obviously see i mean to these are all manifestations of nonsurvival dont you see survive in order to its necessary to manifest nonsurvival in order to survive its always this kind of an oddball solution see youll get something like not eat see thats quite common by the way service facsimile refusing to eat not eatingcommon service facsimile little children will play this an awful lot of the time and when it gets out of that realm and range and moves into adult life why you have diets they usually dont amount to service facsimile but when they do youve really got mess on your hands its really nice big mess and this must be terribly common because one of the major problems they have in insane asylums is making people eat not eating is one of the final protestshunger strikes throw guys in jail one of the first things they think of is go on hunger strike if they want to make big protest they go on hunger strike so theres very common service facsimile some version of sexno second dynamic i dont care how you have it or how you phrase it its got to be some second dynamic one way or the other see its an incapacity on it its an aberrated practice of it it can go worse than that how to survive you see is to murder children how does that add up well it adds up to the guy all right you see and on the first dynamic how to survive well commit suicide you see in innumerable ways you can commit suicide on many gradients you see be ugly you see be overweight be too thin be this be that be disabled be something be somethingdoesnt much matter what it is you see you might collide with that on the first dynamic on the third dynamic to be antisocial see these are all sure methods of nonsurvival dont you see and yet they are added up as survival computation shoot policemen thirddynamic solution how to survive shoot policemen simple effective and you say yeah but that couldnt be service facsimile in this lifetime because this pc has never shot policeman in this lifetime hahahahaha dont make laugh this pc has always shot policeman every time they see policeman they shoot policeman robbing houses you say well robbing housesthis individualthis couldnt be service facsimile because this person has never robbed house oh well now dont be too sure never passes one but he doesnt rob itthinks about it and so forth well how does he use this service facsimile oh he uses it via the newspapers he always clips out robberies and shows people about robberies and that sort of thing figures out robberies reads nothing but detective stories see androbberyrobbing houses good service facsimile so you see it doesnt even fit in with the guys environment therefore it sometimes is rather hard to trace you get somebody who is in death cell you see having already shot up innumerable policemen and so forth well you know what his service facsimile isyou think you say its obviously shooting policemen i point something out to you hes shot policemen probably wasnt his service facsimile at all his service facsimile is probably never loading guns oryou know service facsimile is being kind to everyone see the exact circumstance of the person doesnt always guarantee you that you have your hands on the service facsimile thats what im trying to point out here because this thing goes underground its not very visible and they very often the most effective service facsimiles are those which are totally hidden until youve come anywhere in their vicinity and then theyre laid in your lap see you dont find service facsimiles above 20 on the tone scale now itd be completely silly then to add up the arc of the lower tone scale like not communicated or something like this and say well his service facsimile is not communicated how would not communicated make you right or not having communicated make you right or not communicating make you right and so forth well this is im afraid little bit too general see you dont use these buttons by their isolated selves because they are insufficiently directional the pc answers them too broadly and all you do in such case is restimulate the service facsimile without labeling it well let give youjust dream one up here dont say its terribly workable who or what would make themselves right by not communicating something like this or tell means of not communicating and make list and assess the list dont you see some odd action of this particular character such button then is useful for the location of service facsimile but is not in itself service facsimile you eventually get on this list hiding pencils and you say well this cant be very damaging but we will run it anyway well its not maybe very damaging but you find out that the reason the pc has always looked so bulky is because theyre always carrying fifteen or twenty gross of pencils cant get into their room at night because of the crates of pencils you know everybody in their vicinity misses pencils all the time never spotted him this is loopy conduct of one kind or another but sometimes it can look so ordinary to youbecause this is this planetthat you sometimes dont put your finger on an obvious service facsimile lets say it isnt being sick but its having chills how would that make you right and make somebody else wrong or something like that you see or having cold or something like this that still could separate out into service facsimile dont you see but it might not be on and it might be on it doesnt matter you you see ive given you bunch of stuff that you may think by this time the service facsimile again is very hard to locate it isnt im just giving you the idea that youve got to look for it youve got to prowl around after this character has given you something that might be it make represent on it be quite frank with the pc dont pussyfoot on this thing theres been too much pussyfooting about already say wes looking fo you service facsimile what is it boy you know subtle what do you think your service facsimile is do list pull the missed withholds and null that listgood reliable method pcwithhold it perhaps and then just the fact that you put it down on pulling the missed withholdand all of sudden he dives into the water swims right over to the middle of the lake dives right into the middle of the whirlpool and says there we are uhhhhhh what am i doing here interest attraction so forth because of course its not volitional solution that is to say he doesnt think up this solution all the time its subawareness solution which goes into automatic action its that buried hes right on the verge of it all the time hes in direct connection with it all the time so you just lay down the faintest link to it and he cant help but travel that link dont you see thats one of the reasons you say that neurosis and psychosis are very very difficult to maintain all you practically have to do is spot them and they start blowing up its very hard to dramatize the exact reason for them why anybody would go through heroic actions to explode psychosis or neurosis or electric shock people or go into brain treatment just because the person is jumping about the floor and screaming or refusing to eat or doing something like this and so onthats not good enough reason that doesnt mean that the psychosis or neurosis is violent you see that only means that it produces violent reactions see it doesnt mean that it is violent at all maybe this girl insane is jumping about the floor because she doesnt like cockroaches and thats the logical explanation of the thing and people fail to note that this is true because there are cockroaches there but shes seeing cockroaches you see so you might have something on this order this becomes very elementary you say what really might be worrying you all the time you make little list and she jumps about the floor and hangs from the chandelier and rolls up in ball and so forth but shell talk to you and she gives you finally list and you assess this list out according to interest which one is she really most interested in and youll find out that its cockroaches shes very interested in these cockroaches that are all over the floor and youd say well how would seeing cockroaches make you right and thats probably the end of her insanity why she probably couldnt maintain it from that point on she wouldnt be well she wouldnt be calmed down or anything like that but shes now going to have hard time maintaining it because shes got connection to it and the thing will discharge see its hard to do now now you got to get volitional about jumping around in the middle of the floor now you got to mock up the cockroaches to put them on the floor dont you see and she just cant make it and that charge just that much charge and its gone that by the way was practically the totalitythe accidental fact there is probably the totality of the freudian recoveriesis contained right in that its just that they would evaluate in some fashion or another like you do with an arc break you see and theyd happen every now and then to strike something that was service fac and the individual would think about it and it would be impossible then to dramatize it but not knowing the mechanics of it it nevertheless would slightly discharge dont you see and its all those false assignments that made their people sick see it was the assignments that werent service facs and that sort of thing so you can learn from that just in passing and dont give guy bunch of phony service facs see let him decide what it is you see dont ever foist one off on anybody youll find thats always good part of the rules if he says it isnt it it isnt it man thats it thats the rules customer is always right because frankly if youve got it he cant stay out of it see thatif you keep that little fact up your sleeve why you can afford to reject any quantity of them you say all right beating dogs and so forth you dont think that is it i had it on the list here it read little bit i dont think that is beating dogs beating dogs beating dog beating dogs beating dogs and so onbeating dogs would it make you right in any way nah would beating dogs make right hm heh wouldnt do much well actually could add it upit could make right to object to bad behavior on the conduct of dogs and make dogs wrong to indulge in bad behavior end of computation see youll find every once in while pc will give you something like that and then theyll say oh yes lets see how would it make wrong now lets see how would bad auditing make right or bad auditing wouldnt make rightitd make wrong of course thats the end of that you pursue that further see but how would getting stuck in an engram make you right and make others wrong wouldnt do it well how would auditing make you right and make others wrong you see how would auditing make you right well itd make right if i got better and itd make the auditor wrong if i didnt end of computation of course thats service fac perfectly logical answer there are further answers behind it vast blast of the ta as it falls down theres nothing going on here particularly so you dont want to hang people with these things because its too easy to find the right ones and they abound man this is one of the most interesting little treasure hunts you ever engaged upon see and you might as well get used to what it is and figure out what it is and put your own itsa line in on it and so forth because youll sure know what it is then see you say here it is man this guy has got this thing which is some kind of horrendous solution of some kind or another and its got all this charge backed up and whenever i audit him with prepcheck why very little ta action or mass turns on with prepcheckmust be service fac this case not very easy to audit has fragile tone arm tone arm gets stuck hardanother condition you seemust be service fac and so on cant get this thing why well lookitobviously if all the discharge youre going to get is confusion running off in the form of chargeif the charge wont run off there must be solution there which prevents the charge from running off and thats all there is to it hes got it solved he doesnt have to look around backs bad and his heads bad and his ribs are bad and he cant sleep at night and hes got ulcers and so forth but he doesnt have to inspect this see say well you start running this down youll find out welldo this little list or something like that or however youre going to run it into or do past data moving in toward this thingyou find out he sleeps on the floor doesnt sleep in bed has bed but he sleeps on the floor well id try that on for size and just say well is there any possibility you do that because it would make you right now youre going to get one of two reactions pprffff well it would make the landlady wrong because she doesnt change the sheets very often and so i sleep on the floor see or the other reaction which is the one youre looking for see is well sleeping on the floor make you right oh yes yes as matter of fact it would so on and long time ago when i was inwhen i was inin boarding school you know we used to have these bedbig high beds and so forth and could pull you out on the floor and ma but that isnt the real reason why this thing was you see i kept sleeping on the floor actually you get more fresh air and so forth and well now look dont be complete knucklehead as an auditor and try to go through some more action see youre just using auditing actions to cut the itsa line you got one running man just sit back and let it run do the easy thing see all you got to do is sit back and let it run the only trouble youll get into is sometimes the pc starts running backtrack on it in hurry and then you should start getting nervous so if you can get in an auditing question on the thing why slide in this lifetime or something like that on the front of the auditing question providing you have asked an auditing question if you havent why try to get it in at the next questionif you get chance to ask the next question got the idea you might not get chance to ask the question at all it may run all the way out and hes now ready for the other side see now the main thing that you gain from all this and the main thing you gather from all this is tone arm action youve got the mass flowing that kept the pc from getting tone arm action and thats your interest in it youre not interested in his social conduct youre interested in his auditing conduct where old medical psychiatry went adrift we neednt go adrift they become so fixated on the subject of rrrright conduct without even being able to define what it is except maybe slaver when the bell rings that these birds are always adjudicating everything on the subject of conduct insanity is brand of conduct neurosis is brand of conductconduct conduct well the unfortunate part of it isthe unfortunate part of it isthat it doesnt catalog it doesnt classify you cant do that see because it just renders everybody open to the charge of being neurotic or psychotic just everybody wide openwhich is one of the more interesting factors and then they can use this politically dont you see and then anybody they dont want around they merely say some of his conduct is aberrated and they can throw him in the local spinbin and chop his brains up for hamburger i dont know what they eat the point im making here is thats highly dangeroushighly dangeroussaying person is insane or sane when your sole basis of adjudication you see is conduct so this doesnt always meet the eye some of the most roaring inanities on this planet are classified as sane behavior now in actual fact youre measuring up not person who is in agreement with this planet but youre measuring up person who has lived very long time so whatever is the service fac is the service fac dont you see its not because he does something peculiar or not because he does something this orwe have list of things i can tell you what its more likely to be than something else but action that is peculiar is only peculiar not compared to the mores of the society in which you find yourself but just compared to the datum of survival see just compare it directly to the datum of survival and its always contrasurvival action which is posing as survival action revolt i dont even know why youd revolt against an earth government theyre all convicts see youre living in an area where there are wardens see actually kind of silly to do anything particular in this particular direction because theyre nuttier than anybody else dont you see they probably need their hands held twice as hard as anybody in the spinbin you know they dont know what theyre doing so what is considered normal on this planet might at any one point be completely batty so the service facsimile comes down to the comparison with the datum of actual survival and the fact that the pc is interested in it and that it releases tone arm action because it must be fixed solution so actually what youre studying are fixed solutions uninspected by the person which are contrasurvival now when you hit all of those man youve hit the jackpot in any case which has fragile tone arm which is liable to stick at the drop of an emeter cord seebang like thatyoure looking at service facsimile you must be there must be fixed solution why because theres charge runs by it so if charge runs by it it must be fixed solution and it gets in the road of auditing so it must be contrasurvival actually it could be fixed survival solution which really was survival solution and youd find it wouldnt even vaguely influence auditing see youd go out and audit the guy and you get tone arm action and hed go on flying and hes got these fixed solutions all over the place hes practically nothing but bundle of fixed solutions youre trying to find the black spot in the middle of the ball of yarn see the black spot in the middle of mountain of white spots the mountain comes down if you find that spot fortunately for you there are several gray spots in its immediate vicinity any one of which can be hit and do the ease some good so its constant prowl on this route you handle one all right fine is this case going to remain stable well thats very doubtful so lets find two lets find three lets make sure we got it see now your tone arm is flying around and your needle by this timethe thing cant stick you find you find one the case will tentatively resume its stuckneedle condition momentarily resume it interesting cant hold it but its drop you know you havent got all of these now you havent got all of them you want and itll still be little this way and the next one you findpshewssssssssssssssew its coming down needle is getting so it cant stand upright because theres nothing to hold it just the weight of the needle causes it to bang against the sides you see you actually have trouble reading your tone arm as youre winning on these when you are really hitting center youre having trouble with that tone arm because you cant find out where to center it your needle is not as nice as it was before its too floppy youre having trouble centering it and you just about get it centered and it moves see and you just about get it centered it flops over the other way your tone arm reading gets very very inaccurate as this really starts to bite you cant quite keep it properly centered its moving too fast too pc just thinks thought see and it goes clank its gone but gee how much charge went off there well we dont know its because youre bleeding you see central reservoir of charge and its flowing in niagara now the other thing it does for you and the reason why this is very beneficial to the casecompletely aside from unblocking thisis service facsimile is always protruded into present time always protruded into present time so any constant ptp that your pc has had will of course produce the service facsimile and that is very good news for you you can produce the service facsimile out of any ptp that has been constant and continual with the pc what did you come into scientology to resolve and hell give you long series of this and that now its very very dangerous to list too many problems on pc you list too many problems on pc and youre going to wind him up in bang thats dangerous call that to your attention listing problemsnot so good see not so good bad show doing an incomplete list of problems will arc break the pc complete list of problems is very often too long and is bit dangerous to the pcs needle and ease condition so how do you find out the problems well you have to take step backwards before you take step forwards see locating the problem that youre trying to solveyou cant let that run forever because thats the exact opposite of an itsa line its whatsit line see problem line is whatsit line and you can freeze your tone arm gorgeously with whatsit line so whatsit list will freeze your tone arm and so forth so it had better be on the basis of friendly discussion which you can leave in an awful hurry and you recognize that youre taking step backwards with this ease making him whatsit which is basically whats bum with these assessments and so forth what problemwhat was your chronic present time problems when you got into scientology and so forth what were these things what were these things you were trying to solve at that particular time now if you hang up this ease too badly you can take that little list and ask for solution for each one of the problems hes given youif youve made listask for some solutions for those problems and you will take the tension off the tone arm so there is cure for this situation but its rather lengthy and involved cure but you may have sitting right therethe solution you see is not problem the solution is not problem but few of these problems can be looked at as pointers to possible solution hes having trouble in certain area now your problem once youve got any idea of his problems is to put your finger on some solution with regard to that problem and that solution will be the fixed solution which gives you the service facsimile now notice that r1c and r2c are designed to strip away solutions decisions and stable data off the casesocalled stable data therefore they are very very easy to run and they produce tone arm action and are the least likely to hang up the tone arm you start asking for whatsits however in r1c wen you say you have had ayouyouve had the idea that all snakes werelived in the tops of houses and so forth now what problems would that solve man cut your throat youve asked the reverse side of r1c and the tone arm is going to go up and stick but notice that your r1c and r2c these itsaline questions and run are designed to strip away charge from the service facsimile area therefore it is very good thing to find out if the pc has been run on r1c and r2c of course they wont have discharged the service facsimile but they may have some data there that they uncovered in looking at all this which you might then sort out and get an idea dont you see so you say while you were being run in the coaudit down there what did you run into that you found very interesting while you were running your ease what did you really run into well i ran into this and that and the other thing and the other thing and the other thing and you make your little bit of list of these types of solutions and zones and areas and youve got yourself an assessment see then run this thing down andwith little further discussion with the pcand youre liable to hit right on it just like that funny part of it is that r3r is almost deadcenter pitch on service facsimile providing it winds up in statable solution now failing not to communicate with eating figs in smyrna i dont think you would find good service facsimile i call that to your attention if it doesnt make sense to you its not likely to make sense to the pc so dont go astray on this because after all the preliminary step of r3r was designed to do an entirely different thing and it may be only fragment of that and it wont be the tone level you found see it wont be that itll be some fragment of it or rewording of it now i funnily enough have found one on an incomplete r3r assessment that two stayed in on the list had to be extended dont you see and one of those was the service facsimile i find that quite interesting in other words if we had completed the list to the final run we wouldnt have found the service facsimile see because it would have been buried back on the line little bit dont you see well this tells you that it doesnt really have to be terribly good assessmentany kind of an assessment youve run something like failed to shootwhat have you failed to shoot or something like this or failed to have been with or somethingand you get list get list of this go on down the line assess the thing out well even if your failed to shoot is kind of lousy level as long as its in not because its been protested or was mistake on your part see pc has protested it so its in you know thats the corny way those assessments go astray pc didnt understand it didnt know what it was so it keeps reading you know if you dont clear anything with the pc while youre assessing the pc you can expect that problem to come up on auditors that are green in your supervising sometimes that can be sort of corny and itll still produce something and youre doing yourself list over alongside of this thing and you didnt even really get chance to complete your list very well and so on but it went out and you finally had level stay in its much more likely to be that level if the pc is interested in it you get the idea its the itempardon meits much more likely to be the item you see than it is the level because the level is too broad and just running it loosens up the bank enough so that you can then do one with greater accuracy because everything on thatas long as you just got something to stay in for fifteen strikes or something like thatyou know one of these arduous lists where everything is alive on the whole list everything is alive on the whole list and youve got ten strikes after each one but one has fifteen strikes in before they all went out you know one of those corny ones and so forth you can actually pick up one of those and the thing that has fifteen strikes was that in because you didnt understand what it was i understand what it is all right all right thats it now were going to list this one see its that crude youll still get somewhere in the vicinity of service fac because it operates just like magnet and that youre ticking away at it draws the pcs attention toward it and as he lists hes even liable to list it non sequitur on the list it doesnt even answer the question but there it is see you want to watch this see because his attention is being pulled to this thing inevitably youre asking him for right answers and he gives you the rightest answer he knows jump off the top of the empire state building thats the solution that solves everything that solves all problems so youre asking him what dont you have affinity for in this lifetime and he finally puts down jumping off the top of the empire state building see hasnt anything to do with what he doesnt have affinity for but itll go on the list you get what im talking about now you see your assessment is greatly assisted greatly assisted by the fact that as long as youre not arc breaking the pc and keeping him on levels that he is protesting and is unhappy about and as long as you dont disregard the pcs interest while assessing the mind gets pulled right over to the service facsimile bang theyll put it down non sequitur theyll put it down dispersed disassociated item and all kinds of wild things happen while youre doing an assessment you want to watch this sort of thing that thing stays on the list and you notice it doesnt even have anything to do with the list sometimes well actually the degree its disassociated from the subject of the list is the most likely clue that its service fac but it just reads on the meter as long as anything else itll stay in youll assess it out long as the pc understands what it is and isnt there because its protest see solution is not very difficult to find if its the solution to life the guy is going to give it to you hes going to handle your session with it see and youll sometimes think youve been an awful knucklehead youve had pc sitting across from you for long time thats been handling all sessions with this something like that so it eventually dawns on you that thats what that is you see doesnt make sense but its sure been present and id keep looking for and running service facsimiles on pc until it looked to like we had notoriously and considerably altered this pcs methods of going at life and until i had wonderfully free needle and nice gorgeously clear ta and id just keep it up now whats the basic benefit i was going to give you one other benefit to the thing it of course is the source of your present time environment so the pc who is always coming to session with ptp that has to be audited before you can get on with the session of course is having his service facsimile kicked out of session so its diagnosis of the existence of service facsimile thats continuous anybody has ptp once in while thats always got big ptp big big you know big big you know ildaldal ohdadadal and we cant be audited today because of soandso and we got to handle this other situation and so on youre just looking at service facsimile what mass is it that is such magnet for trouble on this case there must be something restimulating here in the environment all the time there must be some restimulable item right here all the time and man if you can get rid of that the overrestimulation factor of case vanishes see the overrestimulation vanishes so you have knocked out at one fell swoopbecause restimulation by reason of present time is always about 50 percent of the restimulation present on any case at any given moment that has service facs you see its about 50 percent of the charge on the case youve only got then 50 percent you see that you can restimulate with safety because the tolerance for restimulation you see is lessened by 50 percent all of sudden this character will run like startled gazelle if you can get this service facsimile out of the road because your environmental restimulation has nothing to kick back on now we used to try to solve this by process him faster than the environment can kick him in remember you know process him twentyfive hours during the week keep him away from home and his wife wont kick his head off and when he goes back home hell stay stable you know that kind of thing but we were just hoping wed get the service facsimile before he went back home you understand so if you could reduce that factor out of the case then all the gains the case made in session would stay so theres another bonus see the cases wouldnt drop between sessions see now the amount of attention which the pc has turned in on this service facsimile and its the disabilities which accompany it and so forththe attention that he has on thatalso keep him from looking at his bank i could say that an expert handling of service facsimilesthis is just wild guesswould probably raise the runability of case about hundred to one how easy case would be to audit see if every case has some of this and it only becomes visible when some cases make it impossible to audit see well how easy is case to run well we probably dont know the answer to that question see but we know some cases are impossible to run and those are the ones we have attention on right now so you take care of those for just now will you please thank you
