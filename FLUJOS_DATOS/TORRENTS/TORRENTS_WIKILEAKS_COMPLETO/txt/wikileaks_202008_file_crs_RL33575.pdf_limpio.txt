to address the legacy of pollution from inactive and abandoned hardrock mines iams that degrades the environment throughout the united states particularly in the west the environmental protection agency has estimated that 40 of headwaters in the west have been adversely impacted by acidic and other types of drainage from abandoned sites where gold silver copper lead nd iron ore were mined the core concept underlying the bills is that in order to address the problem of pollution from iam sites it is appropria to encourage cleanup by so called good sama ritan entities to do so the bills proposed to establish process for issuing permits to good samaritans and to provide incentives in the form of reduced liability from environmental laws and less stringent environm ental cleanup

often challenge scope of liability protection at issue is whether and to what extent the liability and other requirements of supe rfund the clean water act and other laws should be waived for good

presented with legislative proposals to address the legacy of pollution from abandoned hardrock mines that degrades the environment throughout the united states particularly in the west in the 109th congress four bills were introduced that sought to encourage cleanup of inactive or abandoned hardrock mining sites by so called good sama ritan entities hr 1266 introduced by representative mark udall s 1848 by senator ken salazar and s 2780 by senator james inhofe and hr 5404 by representative james duncan identical bills introduced at the request of the administration in september 2006 the senate envi ronment and public works committee reported an amended version of s 1848 that reflected number of provisions in the administration bill and other modifi cations srept 109351 the 109th congress took further action on any of the proposals and the following discussion describes provisions of the bills as of december 2006 whether these issues or specific legislation will be considered in the 110th congress is uncertain mining has been conducted throughout the country for nearly 150 years but most occurred before the advent of envir onmental regulation ma ny historic mining operations were abandoned without being adequately reclaimed against future environmental damage ther may be more than 550000 of these sites on public and private lands in the united states there is single inventory of sites and thus the precise number is unknown although mo st sites do not pose environmental problems drainage or runoff from some dis charges including sulfate copper lead arsenic and mercury for example continue to pose threat to both surface water and groundwater the environmental protec tion agency epa has estimated that approximately 40 of headwa ters in rivers and streams in the west have been impacted by discharges from abandoned hard rock mines thus threatening drinking water and agricultural water supplies increasing water treatment costs and limiting fishing and recreation the number of mines that are causing or have potential to cause waterrelated pollution problems is unknown but is generally believed to be small percentage of the total perhaps 35 of all inactive or abandoned iam sites but even so 35 of 550000 possibl sites in total still represents large number of potential sites 16000 to 27000 that concerns many personshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs2 1 another bill in the 109th congress that would have ame nded the clean water act was hr 5071 introduced by representative john salazar like hr 1266 it would have authorized cwa good samaritan permitting process but its scope was much narrower than the other bills it would have established pilot project for remediation of iams in portion of the upper animas river basin in san juan county colorado and thus it is not discussed in this reportthe principal objective indicat ed for each of the bills was to help solve some of the problems of environmental pollution emanating from iam sites the core concept underlying the bills is that in or der to address the problem of pollution from iam sites it is appropriate to encourage cleanup by vol untary entities third parties who have history of polluting at par ticular site or lega l responsibility for its pollution but who step forward to clean up acid mine drainage or other pollution from an abandoned mine th bills proposed in centives in the form of reduced liability from environmental laws such as strict liability for cleanup costs and restoring damaged natural resources and less stringen t environmental standards applicable to cleanup activities propone nts who included mining companies and industry associations maintained that an degree of cleanup is better than inaction or the status quo and they argued that if not addressed in this legislation the issues of liability exposure under envi ronmental law and strict re gulatory standards could stymie voluntary cleanups opponents especially many environmental and conservation advocates acknowledged that cleanup would benefit the environment but they expressed concern that exempti ons and relief such as these bills proposed might be the first step in dismantling key environmental legisla tion because the bills were vague about standards that would apply to good sama ritan cleanup other stakeholders in the debate include states and the federal government all four bills proposed to establish pr ocess for issuing permits to those who would be good samaritans under all four permitting authority would have been vested in epa but could have been delega ted to qualified states and indian tribes the bills would have allowed potential remediating party to obtain permit authorizing it to take steps to improve wa ter quality without bein g required to comply fully with water quality standards that would otherwise apply in addition to environmental benefits an incentive for some good samaritans is that once site is cleaned up many mines would have the pot ential to resume mining operations that could result in economic gains the bills would have established process for identifying what entities and lands are eligible specifying goals of cleanup and conditions for permits and issuing permits all four were limited to hardrock mines gold copper silver and iron ore for example although there are some industry and state stakeholders who favor simila r good samaritan aut hority for cleanup of abandoned coal mines as well s 2780 nd hr 5404 the administration proposal and s 1848 as reported had one provision concerning co mine remediation it is discussed below on page 12 there were differences among all of the bills as discussed below of the four hr 1266 alone was drafted as measure that would amend the clean water act cwa 33 usc 1251 et seq1 in hr 1266 the per mit provision would have been part of the cwas overall regulatory permitting and enforcement mechanism the cwa prohibits the

legislation and raises stronger opposition from groups who prefer narrower approach selected issues in the legislation this report discusses several issues that have drawn attention eligibility for good samaritan pe rmit standards applicable to good samaritan cleanup scope of liability protection tr eatment of revenues from clea nup enforcement and judicial review the appropriate role for states and indian tribes funding terminating permit and sunsetting the permit program this discussion does not address every issue in the bills for example it does not analyze procedures for issuing good samaritan permits nor does it discuss general backgr ound on the problem of inactive and abandoned hardrock mine sites5 eligibility who can get permit the issue of permit eligib ility concerns the unive rse of parties who may undertake iam cleanup under good samarita n permit it has several aspects including whether good samaritans should be limited to governme nt entities or may also include the mining industry and othe rs in the private sector and how the legislation specifies that anyone w ith existing or prior responsibility for environmental pollution at the site is restricted from eligibility for the liability and regulatory relief exemptions pr ovided by good samarita n permit some argue that good samaritan shoul d only be working on behalf of the public welfare meaning that remediation actions must be entirely governmental government it is argued unlike commercial or philanthropic enterprises seeks to balance the needs and desires of societys many competing interests and government agencies are accountable to elected politicians and ultimately to the public according to this view there is concern that if private entities are allowed to get involved in remediation nd profits from the activity are generated the good samaritans motives c ould be less focused on cleanup if the point of the legislation is cleanup eligibility should be limited so th at questions of monetary awards and profit do not arise further in practical terms some argue that the more expansive the range of possible eligible parties allowed under the legi slation especially if the private sector is included the more complicated and controversial the legislation becomes industry groups on the other hand argu that mining companies have the resources knowledge and technology to ssess and remediate iam sites industry believes that an existing company that is not responsible for creating an abandoned site should not be precluded from being good samaritan if such entities are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs5 allowed to participate under good samaritan permit they say fewer sites will be cleaned up because companies will not risk the potential liability of voluntary cleanup see discussion below the more th legislation is br oadened in terms of eligibility the more g ood samaritans will step forward they say the bills offered several di fferent approaches to this issue hr 1266 would have limited the universe of eligible parties to the us government states political subdivisions including municipalities or i ndian tribes it would have barred the federal government from qualifying as g ood samaritan with re spect to iam sites on federal land that is the fe deral government could clean up an iam site on federal land but not under the terms exemptions and waivers of g ood samarita n permit the apparent rationale for this limitation was that the federal government will always by considered to be responsible part on lands that it owns or operates and ownersoperators are not eligible for good samaritan per mits further there is related belief that federal agencies should be co mmitted to cleanup of sites on lands that they own or manage in any case and should not therefore need good samaritan incentives critics argued that these restrictions presented excessive hurdles for cleaning up the large number of abandoned min sites in western states that involve mixed public and private ownership under this bill states would have been treated differently from the federal government th ey would have been allowed to be good samaritans on st ateowned land s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 included an expansive listing of parties eligible for good samaritan permit on the theory that broader list of eligible permittees would include more entities with resour ces and expertise to undertake cleanup under these bills eligibility would have included individuals firms corporations partnerships commercial tities nonprofit groups federa l and state governments political subdivisions of states interstate entities commissions and tribes these bills would not have restricted federal or state governments from qualifying as good samaritans on lands that they own or manage related issue in all of these legisla tive proposals concerns the question of how to ensure that parties with current or prior legal responsibility for the site may not receive good samaritan permits this issue arises from the fact that under current laws person who owns or operates site that is responsible for environmental pollution continues to be responsible for mitigating that pollution all of the bills took the position that an identifiable fina ncially capable owne r or operator should not be eligible for relie f under good samaritan per mit and that existing requirements to clean up according to app licable environmenta l standards should apply to an identified owner or operator however in the case of the majority of abandoned and inactive mines current owner or operator who could assume responsibility for cleanup may not exist or the current owner may be far removed in time or by legal tie from those who created pollution at the site s 2780 and hr 5404 would have barred from eligibility person or entity who had an ownership interest in the iam site or who had had such an interest at any time during or since the creation of the historic mine residue at the site under this bill passive landowners land could be cleaned up but in the administrations view it would not be appropriate to give liability protection to that landowner under s 1848 person who had role in creating the historic mine residue or in creating thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs6 6 for additional information on cercla see crs report rl33426 superfund overview and

the hist oric mine residue would not have been eligible to be good samarita n however innocent landowners bona fide prospective purchasers and anyone other than the current owner who held title during the period when hazardous substances were not disposed of at the site could potentially have been good samaritans hr 1266 did not address the issue of current or prior ownership closely related issue concerns what efforts permit applicants must make to search for responsible owner or operator all of the bills would have required that the permit applicant make reasonable efforts to identify current owners or other legally responsible par ties some stakehol ders have questioned what level of effort should be required to demonstr ate reasonable efforts to identify responsible parties and they hope to see clarification in legi slation doing full search for potentially responsible parties prps for privatel funded cleanup is burdensome and costly they say some also have argued that it would be preferable to put the burden of such search on government because they say government has the resources and tools to do search which can be complicated requiring industry or some other good samaritans for example nonprofit groups to expend resources for owneroperator searches effectively reduces the permitt ees resources for actual cleanup some say however conducting such searches requi res someones resources in any case whether private or public eligibility consideration of cercla lands for good samaritan cleanups related issue concerns whether lands that are currently or potentially listed on the national priorities list npl under cercla should be eligible for good samaritan permit6 cercla authorizes the federal government to respond to sp ills and other releases or threaten ed releases of hazardous subs tances as well as to leaking hazardous waste sites throug h direct action or by requiri ng responsible parties to do so it also established trust fund to support federal response actions since the inception of this program in 1980 epa has catalogued more than 45000 potentially contaminated sites in da tabase called the comprehens ive environmental response compensation and liab ility information system cerclis to ensure that the most serious sites are addressed the law called for epa to assemble the npl subset of the larger cerclis as of july 2006 there were 1244 npl sites including 79 abandoned hardrock mines and mineral processing sites plus 580 more mining and mineral processing sites identified in the larger cerclis database7 placing site on the npl does not necessarily mean that epa will take either shortterm removal action or longterm re medial action to mitigate the hazardous substances nor does it assign cleanup res ponsibility to any specific owner or partyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs7 8 the uranium mills tailing radiation control act of 1978 42 usc 7901 provides for the stabilization and disposal of the waste by products of the extraction and processing of uranium and thorium mining to mitigate the zard of radon diffusion into the environment 9 cercla requires responsible parties to address the environmental harm caused to injured natural resources by paying to restore or replace the damaged resource and paying damages for the lost use of publicly owned resour ce including the costs of performing the associated damage assessmentat the site however if an npl site is scheduled for federal response there will be diligent search for responsible parties whether or not moni from the superfund trust fund will ultimate ly be used to pay for cleanup see discussion of liability below with respect to the good sa maritan legislati on some stakeholders contend that it would be appropriate to include certain iam hardrock mining npl sites as eligible for voluntary cleanups since they might be cleaned up more quickly than under the superfund program which is widely criticized for ex cessive costs bureaucratic processes and delays on the other hand others argue that npl sites should not be eligible for good samaritan cleanup because doing so would likely result in less stringent cleanup standards than superf und cleanup would require in addition if federal superfund resources are likely to pay for the cleanup it would be more efficient for good samaritans resources to assist nonsuperf und lands particularly since hardrock mining sites are in many cas much more expensive to clean up than other npl sites however with the expi ration of the superfund taxing authority on december 31 1995 superfund cleanup funding has become heavily dependent on general revenue appropriations the bills presented different approaches to this issue hr 1266 would have excluded lands identified for remedial action under cercla and lands designated for remedial action under the uranium mill tailings radiation control act8 s 1848 would have excluded sites on the npl s 2780 and hr 5404 would have excluded from eligibility lands that are included on the npl or lands that are the subject of planned or ongoing response or natural resources dama ge enforcement action under cercla9 in addition s 2780 and hr 5404 would have allowed casebycase exceptions from these restrictions to be made if the remedi ation project would accelerate environmental improvements and would not otherwise interfere with any other planned remediati on reasonably likely to occur at the iam site what cleanup standard should apply to good samaritan remediation key element of the good samaritan pr oposals is the concept of providing an incentive to those who voluntarily clean up iam sites by not requiring that their activities meet stringent environment protection standards that would otherwise apply the basic concern was explained by an epa official in house testimony on march 30 2006 under the cwa party may be obligated to obtain discharge permit which requires compliance with water quality sta ndards in streams that are already inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs8 10 benjamin h grumbles assistant administra tor for water us environmental protection agency testimony before the subcommittee

standards regardless of how much cleanup or remediation is done by holding good samaritans accountable to the same cleanup standards as polluters or requiri ng strict compliance with the highest water quality standards we have created strong disincentive to voluntary cleanups unfortunately this has resulted in the perfect being the enemy of the good10 if most stakeholders agree that adjusted standards are appropriate then the issues include what the goals of cleanup are what standards should apply to good samaritan cleanup over what time frame and what constitu tes success report by the center of the american west suggests number of questions to consider in the context of recalibrating standa rds beginning with what is the intention of cleanup if for example the intention is to restore fish to stream is partial cleanup adequate for that failing that what cleanup benchm arks are appropriate would those goals be feasible and economic11 among stakeholder groups there is wi dely held view that remediation project should be required to achieve si gnificant environmen tal improvement over existing conditions most agree that implementation of good samaritan project generally should not require achieving specific numeric effluent limitations for discharges to surface water as would nor mally be required under clean water act permit however legislating definitions that provide sufficient clarity on the standard so that it can be interpreted and understood by all the permit issuer permit applicant and the pub lic is particularly cha llenging the challenge involves stating standard broadly enough that the per mit issuer has flexibility to tailor it to individual sites but with sufficient specificity so that the permittee and the public understand what is required and what level of water qua lity improvement is anticipated there is concern that if the cleanup standard is l oosely defined it could permit poorly conceived projects each of the bills attempted to strike balance between identifying cleanup standard and yet doing so flexibly each took slightly different approach to this issue but they generally included broadl stated goal such as improving water quality several referred to improving water quality to the maximum extent practicable considering resour ces available to the good sama ritan for use at the site hr 1266 for example stated that pe rmit could be issued if the applicant demonstrated with reasonable certainty that the implementation of the remediation plan will meet applicable water quality standards to the maximum extent practicable but in circumstances wo rse than the baseline water conditions taking into consideration the resources available to the remediating party for the proposed activity

of project would be reduction of pollution caused by historic mine residue permit could be issued if the permitting authority determined that the project woul d improve the environment of the mine site to significant degree and would meet pplicable water quality standards to the maximum extent reasonable and practicable under the circumstances s 2780 and hr 5404 stated that the purpose of project would be to mitigate effects of historic mine residue to improve the environment permit could be issued if the project will result in improvement to the environment including water quality in the area of or downstream from the mine site the administration bill also required the permit applicant to minimize any shortterm environmental impacts from the remediation to the maximu m extent practicable in congressional testimony stakeholders expressed range of concerns about how this issue was addressed in legislation but all seemed to recognize that defining significant improvement is difficult environmental groups and states acknowledge that it is not always possi ble to achieve app licable water quality standards but they worry environmentalists especially that if the goal of meeting water quality standards is to tally discarded for good sama ritans it has the effect of accepting that there is realistic hope that standards will ever be met at those sites this concern can be somewhat addressed they say by including maximum extent practicable language12 industry groups on the other hand contend that maximum extent practicable language is too restrictive including such term they assert will lead to delay in getting cleanup started because of protract ed debate about its meaning it is unclear whether any of the bills discussed here fully satisfied these varied concerns especially because none of the b ills included definitions of terms such as maximum extent practicable thus potentially giving considerable discretion to the permitting authority and those responsible for enforcing permits the administration bill for example stated that permit could be issued if the permitting authority determined that the project will result in improvement to the environment leading to the question of what that term mig ht mean 10 improvement 50 90 or some other the national research council observe d in 2004 report on hardrock mines that the goal of iam remediation especially at very large mine sites should perhaps be stated in terms of achieving characteristics of healthy aquatic ecosystem based for example on biological performance goal s such are derived from habitat indices not on achieving specified concentration of contaminant in doing so the nrc said it is important to specifically define what is necessary to achieve protection of the environment and what monitoring inform ation is necessary to evaluate progress13 this approach would complement states existing efforts to attain specific designated uses such as fishing swimming nd drinking for their surface watershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs10 14 jack lyman executive director idaho mini ng association in 2000 senate hearing p 33scope of liability protection proponents of good sa maritan legislati on contend that liability under existing environmental laws is major obstacl to voluntary cleanup of iams citing in particular cercla and the cwa under cercla an entity is liable fo r cleanup costs and natural resource damages resulting from release or threatened release of hazardous substances if that entity falls into any of four categories of potentially responsible parties prps at least two of those categories might appl to the good samar itan who attempts an iam cleanup first such an entity might by virtue of its involvement at the mine be deemed an operator of the fac ility where the release occurred second good samaritan might constitute an arranger someone who arranged for transport of hazardous subs tances from the iam facility to another site good samaritan could face stringent liab ility scheme if designated prp under cercla it is strict does not require negligence and joint and several single liable party among several can be held re sponsible for the entire liability and liability may attach even though the good samaritan does not cau or contribute to the hazardous substance release fina lly good samaritan prp could not choose to deal with only certain aspects of an iams pollution cleaning up only part way ie the easiest or most costeffectiv problems rather cercla requires that cleanups meet all applicable or relevant and appropriate federal and state standards cerclas expansive liab ility scheme was intende d to embody congresss policy decision to adopt polluter pays pproach in the act as is already provided in some other federal envi ronmental statutes aside from its perceived fairness polluter pays holds down the public funding needed for cleanups many stakeholders in the good sa maritan debate argue howev er that holding those who voluntarily clean up iams to the same lia bility rules will by inhibiting cleanup activity only add to government costs mining companies have been the biggest supporters of providing broad liability ex emptions to good samaritans arguing strongly for explicit release from both th cwa and cercla without exemptions according to one industry witness in 2000 we are afraid that number of remediating parties will be fearful of the draconian liability system in cercla and the fact that liability could attach to any person who owned operated or otherwise controlled activities at the sites further this witness said there is guarantee that todays noncercla site wont be cercla site tomorrow making the prospect of being subject to that w strong disincentive to remediation14 the clean water act comes into play chiefly because of its requirement that all pointsource discharges into waters of the united states must be authorized by permit under the act and the likelihood th at good samaritan could be deemed subject to that requirement cwa permits impose liability in two senses that are somewhat different from cercla liability first they contain conditions requiring the permit holder to comply with effluent limitations and water quality standards in streams that are already violating these standards thus there is liability for

it is codified at 40 cfr part 300necessary expense second noncomplian ce with permit cond itions may result in civil and criminal penalties in addition the cwa cont ains an emergency powers authority rarely used under which epa can seek court order requiring such action as may be necessary to remedy an imminent and substantial endangerment but while cercla allows epa to either order prps to clean up or clean up itself and then seek reimbursement from prps the cwa authorizes only the former some have argued that it is unnecessary to include cercla in the legislation because if the good samarita ns remediation activity is covered by cwa permit it would be immune from cercla liability under cercla sections 107j and 10110 these sections bar any person i ncluding epa from recovering response costs or damages when the release was authorized by cwa permit one can easily envision iam remedial actions however that do not call for cwa permits or releases to other environmental media in addition to surface waters negating this argument in those cases separately cercla section 107d exempts from the acts liability scheme those rendering car or advice on cleanup in accordance with the national contingency plan15 under these provisions actions taken under superfund generally must provide protection equivalent to those under environmental laws such as the cwa some argue th at good samaritans ma take advantage of this exemption which is available to priv ate party who is not ot herwise liable at the site and whose actions or omissions are not considered negligent critics of including an exemption from cercla sa that it would raise other questions as well for example it is unclear whether the remediating party would still be shielded from cercla liability after the good samaritan permit expires and not all stakeholders believe that postremediation exemption from liability is appropriate in any case environmental groups urge caution in granting good samaritans exemptions from existing laws as they worry that such exemptions might be the first step in dismantling key environmental legisla tion although the cercla liability scheme already contains many exem ptions lowering the floor for the mining industry is unwise they say because doing so c ould promote opportunities for environmental conditions to worsen stringent liability may have occasional dverse consequences some in those groups say but at the large majority of sites ch consequences are offset by the liability schemes value in driving and achieving cleanup according to this view if congress reaches too broa dly to encourage cleanup of the most easily remedied sites it will put at risk the current liability leverage that leads to cleanup of difficult and expensive mining sites proponents

wetlands permits section 404 of the cwa prohibits the disc harge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters of the united states without permit it is likely that some iam remediation projects would involve dredging or filling activities hr 1266 also explicitly addressed sec tion 401 of the cwa under section 401 applicants for federal permit must obt ain state certifica tion that the project will comply with state water quality sta ndards hr 1266 waived section 401 for good samaritan permit howe ver in somewhat circul ar manner this bill stated that in case where section 401 would otherwise apply th state must concur or permit could be issued fi nally hr 1266 included provi sion requiring that states and indian tribes not be relieved of obligations under cwa section 303 to see that water quality standards are attained some states have been critical of this provision since under that bill the permitting authority could authorize discharge that does not meet water quality standards s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 were broade r in their liability exemptions than hr 1266 s 2780 and hr 5404 conferred on good samaritan permittees categorical exemption from cwa requirements and liabilities avoiding the point made above as to noncovera ge of unlisted sections of the act and added an exemption from cercla moreover the same liability protections were afforded without the need for good samaritan permit for iam remediation pursuant to coal mine reclamation plan approved under the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra on the othe r hand the bill contained an exemption from its liability protection for government use of the emergency authorities in the cwa and cercla or for that matter in any law at all such authorities could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs13 used to compel extra measures by the good samaritan in addition the administration bill exempted actions of permitting authority or any other person under this legislation from compliance with the environmental assessment provisions of the national environmental policy act nepa s 1848 offered the possibility of the broa dest liability protec tions of all it declared that the permittee receives prot ection from liability under the environmental laws listed in the permit and then enumer ated apparently nonexhaustively laws that may be listed there the toxic substances control act tsca solid waste disposal act or the resource conservation and recovery act rcra cwa cercla and state local and tribal environmental laws and ordinances in this bill which laws and which requirements of the laws were exempted would be entirely at the discretion of the permit issuer unlike in s 2780 and hr 5404 while this bill authorized exemptions from tsca and rcra it also stated that good samaritan permittee still must comply with tsca and rcra when treating or disposing of materials removed from the mine site such as hazardous wastes or pcbbearing soils that must be removed offsite some argue that exemption from an extensive list of federal state and local requirements is appropr iate so as to eliminate all uncer tainty about the scope of the bills liability exemption and to give flexibility to the permitting authority others have criticized the potential exemptions as being unnecessarily broad and the reported bill dropped some exem ptions in the bill as introduced the clean air act and safe drinking water act further concern raised by critics is that waiving state local and tribal requirements could ge nerate significant controversy in federal statelocal relations but supporters point ed out that under s 1848 good samaritan permit could not be issued if the state or indian tribe or political subdivision if its requirements were to be wa ived was not permit signat ory s 1848 incorporated two provisions from the administration bill the same exemption from nepa and the same liability protection for iam remediation pursuant to coal reclamation plan under smcra revenues from cleanup can good samaritan make profit at issue is how the legislation addre sses the disposition of any revenues that may result when good sama ritan recovers mineral c ontent from historic mine residue as part of remedia tion project this issue is especially relevant to s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 proposals which contemplated that the mining industry and others in the private sector would be ligible for good sama ritan permit and it is one of the most controvers ial topics in the debate the legislation would have permitted incidental reprocessing or recycling of wastes directly related to cleanup of an iam this would differ however from re mining at iam sites which involves the re opening of an abandoned mine to develop remaining mineral reserves while many stakeholders are greatly interested in opportunities for remining most acknowledge that this larger issue brings into play policy considerations stakeholders congressional committees and statutes beyond those in good samaritan re mediation because of these greater complexitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs14 17 joan card director water quality divi sion arizona

resources july 13 2006 p 4industry agrees with critics that good sama ritan remediation and remining or new mining of virgin ores and minerals should be addre ssed separately17 mining industry stakeholders would lik to be allowed unde r good samaritan permit to engage in practices such as processing ore that remains as waste on an abandoned mine site in order to extract valu able materials if such practices are allowed industry says wast material can be safely removed to ameliorate environmental problems while also reducin g net cleanup costs by the value of the recovered materials saving costs of remediation by others and benefitting the companys economic bottom line processing and recovering minerals and ore in the waste material these groups say may ofte n be the most efficient and least costly means of cleaning up an iam site and the potential for making profit would provide an added incentive to compan ies to become involved in cleanup and accelerate the process of cleaning up abandoned mines on the other hand others including some states and many environmental groups oppose the idea that cleanup might be part of commercial forprofit enterprise even incidentally in their view mineral recovery should be s econdary to reclaiming the site and good sa maritans should not profit from their activities in keeping with the view held by many of these groups that qualifying as good samaritan is inherently only governmental activity any proceeds from the site should be redirected back to remediation of that site to higher standard or to another iam site they say critics worry that mining companies could abuse liability exemptions and reduced cleanup requirements provided unde r the good samaritan permit to escape from liabilities of their own operations by engaging in mineral processing and new mining without complying with applicab environmental ws and standards industry responds that such concerns ar misplaced because in an open permitting process the permit issuer and the pub lic will know precisely what the good samaritan intends to do they agree that new mining activity would require mining permit in accordance with applicable envir onmental laws envi ronmental critics also point out that the practice of processing min waste that remains at site has its own potential environmental complications especi ally when it involves the use of cyanide heap leaching to extract minerals and might simply exchange one environmental problem for another thus language in hr 1266 requiring worsening of baseline water quality cond itions could have beco more significant addressing these issues legislativ ely involves number of complexities especially how to craft good samaritan per mit that provides desired liability and other relief only for the speci fied voluntary cleanup activity but then distinguishes and ceases to provide those protections when economic activity at the site changes from remediation to developm ent and broader remining that might occur hr 1266 was more restrictive than the other bills by requiring that proceeds of recovered materials must be used to defray remedia tion costs at the same site or other iam sites under this bill the good sama ritan permit would have terminated whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs15 activity at the site changed from remediation to development defined in the bill to include mineral exploration processing beneficiation or mining meaning that discharges associated with the site would then have been subject to the standard non good samaritan requi rements of the cwa and ot her environmental laws the remaining bills s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 did not directly address the revenue or profit issue they did not appear to preclude revenuegenerating activity nor did they specify how any proceed s must be used s 1848 stated that good samaritan per mit would only authorize activ ities directly required for remediation of historic mine residue at the site while other activities eg additional mining or processing which could presumab ly generate proceeds or profits could be authorized under otherwise applicable laws including the cwa and other environmental laws advocates of these th ree bills hoped that the revenuegenerating potential that they would allow might attract potential good samaritans s 2780 and hr 5404 similarly provided that good samar itan permit could only authorize activities directly related to the remediation of historic mine residue at or from the site and this legislation explicitly prohibited authorization of new mining activity under good sama ritan permit this legisl ation also required that among other things permit application should describe the proposed remediation including any proposed recycling or incide ntal reprocessing of historic mine residue at the site and how it relates to the reme diation some have suggested that this language could be interp reted as potentially rest ricting opportunities for good samaritans to reprocess mine residue and is thus concern to certain stakeholder groups such as those in the mining industry enforcement and judicial review enforcement number of stakeholders c ontend that different set of enforcement tools is warranted for g ood samaritans who they argue are not polluters and so should not face the possib ility of citizen suits or large financial penalties for their activities many of these stakeholders focus particularly on citizen suits which have long been concern of regulated entities but which are equally vigorously supported by others including environmental groups who view citizen suits as critical tools to enforce federal environmental laws especially in light of what they see as drop in government enforcement at issue is whether activities associated with voluntary cleanup do justify alternative procedures for enforcement and if so what mechanisms are appropriate review of the cwas existing enfor cement authorities typical of federal pollutioncontrol statutes is useful here cwa section 309 is the acts federal enforcement provision authorizing epa to enforce the substantive requirements in the act or permit terms embodying them section 309 gives epa broad array of tools it may on its own issue adminis trative orders or impose administrative penalties or it may go through court filing civil actions for injunctive relief or civil money penalties and criminal ac tions based on negligent or knowing violations or knowing enda ngerment the cwa also authorizes citizen suits in section 505 citizen suit is civil action brought by any person who meetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs16 18 standing is threshold question that asks whether plaintiff is proper person to be seeking judicial determination of the issues he or she raises to satisfy constitutional standing requirements plaintiff must allege personal injury that is fairly traceable to the alleged unlawful conduct by the defendant and that is likely to be redressed by the requested reliefconstitutional standing requirements18 against any person violating effluent standards or limitations under the act or b epa for its failure to perform duty that is nondiscretionary under the cwa in the former instance epa may intervene as matter of right remedies include injunctions and civil penalties finally section 504 empowers epa to d eal with imminent and substantial endangerments to public health nd welfare whether or not any cwa requirements are being violated by seek ing court order requiring the offending polluter to stop the discharge or take ot her necessary action section 504 is rarely invoked possibly because cercla sec tion 106 gives epa similar abatement authority without the need for the agency to go to court the enforcement approaches in the good samaritan bills fell neatly into two groups those in the freestanding bills s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 and those in the bill that would have amended the cwa hr 1266 the freestanding bills perhaps reflectin g the view that good samaritans are not polluters and hence should be subject to sser penalties afforded fewer enforcement tools than those available against violators of cwa permits while cwa permit violations may be addressed by epaimposed administrative penalties and citizen suits good samaritan permit violations under the free standing bills did not appear to address either administr ative penalties or citizen suits s 2780 and hr 5404 allowed the epa administrator choice between only an administrative order to comply or civil action penalties and injunctions s 1848 authorized civil enforcement penalties and injunctions or enforcement by the permitting authority through appropriate administrative or judicial proceedings possibly intended to further embody the view that good samarita n permit violators deserve leniency the caps on daily courtimposed civil pena lties in the bills 10000day in s 1848 5000day in s 2780 and hr 5404 absent willful or wanton conduct were considerably less than that in cwa s ection 309 32500day as adjusted by epa pursuant to the debt collection improveme nt act and unlike the cwa the bills did not authorize criminal penalties effective enforcement of course requires that the enforcer have access to pertinent information like the cwa section 308 s 2780 and hr 5404 explicitly conferred upon the permitting entity right of entry to the premises to inspect and collect information and the pow er to require the permittee to maintain records and conduct monitoring s 1848 contained such provisions although by broadly allowing the permittin g authority to insert into good samarita n permits any conditions deemed appropria it could potentially have achieved the same thinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs17 19 5 usc 701706 20 the supreme court has said from the begi nning our cases have established that judicial review of final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless continuedunder these freestanding bills s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 government enforcement could have been carried out by epa or by state that issued the permit under an epaapproved good sa maritan permit program the enforcement approach in hr 1266 was to use that already in the cwa seemingly rejecting the idea that good sa maritans warrant sp ecial treatment it provided that permittees failure to comply with permit terms relating to water quality would be subject to enforcemen t under cwa section 309 thus this bill brought in enforcement by epa administrative penalty and by criminal penalties approaches in section 309 that were left out of the freestanding bills hr 1266 also made explicit that permit violators would be subject to cwa citizen suits which was not contemplated under th freestanding bills many states and environmental groups believe that the citizen suit enfo rcement tool is useful incentive to encourage compliance with environmental laws and rules on the other hand proponents of the freestanding bills favor different set of enforcement tools that do not include citizen suits on the theory that good samaritan permittee is not polluter because it would have am ended the cwa presumably hr 1266 also partook of the existing record keeping monitoring and inspection authorities in cwa section 308 this bill further allowed government enforcement by epa and seemingly by the states since it expressly contemplated delegation of the permitting program to the states see discussion below finally all of the bills explicitly disclaimed any implication that good samaritan permit abridges the governme nts authority to invoke emergency authorities judicial review at first blush the bills appeared to differentiate by form into freestanding and cwaamending the freestanding bills contained narrow very targeted judicial review provisions the full extent of s 1848s j udicial review provision was that court may set aside the permitting authoritys action in issuing permit or states action in signing one only on clear and convincin g evidence of an abuse of discretion likewise the entirety of s 2780 and hr 5404s judicial review provision was that review of epa issuance or denial of permit may be had in the federal circuit in which the petitioner resides or transacts business directly affected by the issuance or denial and that application for review sh all be within 120 days of such issuance or denial the likelihood is that the many as pects of judicial revi ew of permit issuance and denial left unaddressed by these provi sions would have been governed by the administrative procedure act apa which c ontains procedures that govern federal agency rulemaking19 in addition epa actions othe r than permit issuance or denial presumably would have

1848s provisions for judicial re view of epaissued permits appeared to vest original jurisdiction in the federal district c ourts while those in s 2780 and hr 5404 expressly vested such jurisdiction in the circuit courts to be sure s 1848 did not actually say in which court original jurisdiction would lie for federal judicial review but by default the federalques tion statute appeared to vest jurisdiction in the district courts21 historically federal environmental statutes ve required that review petitions be filed initially in the circuit courts rather than the district courts when congress determines that the period of litigationinduced uncertainty following agency action should be as short as prac ticable possibly for the same reason s 2780 and hr 5404 also mandated that filin g occur within 120 days of permit issuance or denial s 2780 and hr 5404 ppear to have taken the judicial review provisions verbatim from cwa section 509b which include s original circuitcourt review and 120day deadline for review of epa action in issuing or denying any permit under cwa section 402 these freestanding bills authorized ep to delegate permitissuing authority to qualified states or indian tribes see discussion below and all three provided that judicial review of state or tribalissued permits or of permit denial would be vested in state court or in the tribal body that ex ercises judicial functions of an indian tribe hr 1266 contained separate judicial review provisions b ecause it amended cwa section 402 however one presumes that the cwas judicial review provisions governing section 402 would have applied as just noted these provisions in cwa section 509b require that petition for review of permit issuance or denial be filed in circuit court within 120 days in light of the above one could say that substantively if not by form the bills differentiated into s 1848 on the one nd and s 2780 and hr 5404 together with hr 1266 on the other s 2780 and hr 5404 can be grouped with hr 1266 in their common use of the apa standard of review22 and common vesting of original jurisdiction for review of epa issuance and denial of permits in the circuit courts by contrast s 1848 used more defere ntial to government nonapa standard of review clear and convincing evidence of an abuse of discretion in some circumstances and appeared to contemplate legal challenges being filed initially in the district courts supporters of s 1848 ma intained that the provisions of that bill by virtue of encouraging early public input in the permitting pro cess were intended to minimize litigation that could delay cleanupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs19 23 none of the bills appears to allow the ep administrator to delegate his authority to another agency official such as regional administrator 24 j charles fox assistant administrator for water us environmental protection agency in 2000 senate hearing p 17role of states and indian tribes at issue is the role that states and tribes should play in the good samaritan permit process and whether the respons ibility to authorize permits should be delegated from epa to qualified states and tribes each of the bills gave epa the primary responsibility to issue permits and each had provisions requiring that states and tr ibes consent or concur before the permit could be issued s 1848 d some additional provisions requiring that state or indian tribe must be signatory on the epaissued permit under s 1848 if the epaissued permit waived any local environmental requirements the locality would also have to concur and be signatory to the permit likewise if project were on federal land the state or loca lity within which the federa l land is located would have to concur and be signatory all of the bills had procedures for public involvement in th permit process but they differed regarding role for adjacent states that might be affected by an iam remediation project none of the fr eestanding bills s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 explicitly gave adjacent affected states role in that process for example even if discharges from an iam site affected downstream waters in another state none of these bills gave such downstream state any special rights to comment on the permit application this contrasts with the regular process for issuance of npdes permits which presumably would ve applied to g ood samarita n permit under hr 1266 the cwa requires that othe r states whose waters may be affected receive notice of each permit application allows such states to submit written recommendations on the permit and requires written notification if the permit issuer fails to accept such recommendations under all four of these bills epa c ould delegate good sa maritan permitting to qualified states and tribes as is allowed for cwa npdes permits epa has delegated this authority to 45 states and epa issues permits in the remaining states accompanying the delegation authority provisions s 1848 s 2780 and hr 5404 also had several related provisions detailing the process for approval of state or tribes permitting program transfer of pe rmitting authority from epa to the qualified state or tribe oversight by epa epa woul d have retained the right to review and could object to proposed stat or tribal permit and pr ocedures for termination or withdrawal of delegated program23 in the past epa had expressed the view that to ensure national consistency in the application of an innovative appro ach to the environment like the good samaritan proposals it is appropriate to ve epa in the decisionmaking role at the time the agencys view was that epa would be in the best position to establish criteria for example defining terms such as maximum extent practicable24 however as reflected in the administrations proposal that

that only small number of good samaritan permits will be issued and only limited number of states are likely to be involved it ma kes little sense to complicat the permitting process by authorizing delegation to states and tribes states regardless of location or political leanings tend to favor program delegation the position reflected in all four bills the traditional argument in suppor t of delegation is that stat are closer to the actual situation and therefore are more likely to make appropriate indi vidual decisions than can the national government funding beyond pr oviding good samaritans with relief from environmental liab ility and related regulatory requirements some stakeholders say that the other major impediment and an overriding concern to encouraging voluntary cleanups is how to fund those types of activities while single source provides information on remediation costs epa estimated in 2004 th at the cost of remediating all hardrock mines is between 20 and 54 billion and that cercla npl sites account for about 35 billion of this amount however epa also stated that at current funding levels averaging from 100150 million annually by fe deral state and private sources more than 820 of all the cleanup work could be completed in 30 years25 while other resource extraction sectors coa l oil gas forestry on public lands have dedicated feebased fund to s upport site reclamati on and remediation hardrock mining has such funding mech anism abandoned hardrock mines have been cleaned up with assistance from an arra of private state and federal sources26 but stakeholders contend that the larg number of iams that pose environmental pollution problems and that may require cleanup argues for dedicated source of funding the nrc observed in its 2004 re port that without source of secured funding there are serious concerns about how remediation program that is expected to last for decades if not centuries can be successfully implemented27 i n past congresses legislation has been introduced that would establish reclamation fee on hardrock mineral producers and create tr ust fund from those fees to help pay forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33575crs21

based hardrock mineral reclamation fund in past congresses he also introduced bills that combined good samaritan permit provisions w ith fee provisions to support an abandoned mine reclamation fund these bills were hr 504 in the 108th congress and hr 4078 in the 107th congresscleanup of abandoned hardrock mines28 those bills have been highly controversial and none has been enacted the industry has argued for example that fee on hardrock mining would have an adverse effect on pricing of their commodities in international markets however with current record high prices for some commodities such as gold some observers find that this argument has lost some persuasiveness none of the good samar itan bills proposed comprehensive secured mechanism to fund re mediation activities29 but all of them included provisions that addressed one source of cu rrent funding for iam clea nup projects grants under cwa section 319 the cwa authorizes th grants to states for range of activities under the states ep aapproved programs to ma nage nonpoint source water pollution by restoring impaired waters and protecting threat ened and goodquality waters abandoned mine land r eclamation projects that are designed to restore water quality are eligible for section 319 f unding except where funds are used to implement specific requirements in an npdes permit for example section 319 funds cannot be used to build treatment systems required by an npdes permit for an inactive mine but they may be used to fund variety of other remediation activities at the same mine according to epa about 1 million per year in section 319 grants out of total funding that has averaged about 225 million annually in recent years has gone to abandoned min land projects for activities such as education technical assist ance project demonstrati on and groundwater protection all of the bills would have clarified that projects to implement iam remediation are eligible for section 319 grants hr 1266 also had separate provision authorizing epa to make grant unspecified to any remediating party for activity covered by good samaritan permit terminating good samaritan permit another issue is whether the proposed gislation should specify conditions for terminating good samarita n permit to determine when liability relief and regulatory exemptions provided by good samaritan permit would cease under the clean water act npdes permits are authorized for up to five years and thereafter must be renewed thus good samaritan per mit issued under the umbrella of the npdes program as in hr 1266 would likewise be expected to expire in more than five years hr 1266 addressed the issue of permit termination beyond normal expi ration by generally including these factors permit would terminate when remediation

permit would terminate when activity at the site changed from remediation to development meaning that discharges associated with the site would be subject to nongood samaritan requirements of the cwa and other environmental laws because the freestanding bills woul d not have amended the cwa none of these bills had the regular fiveyear ex piration of npdes pe rmits under s 2780 and hr 5404 permit could be terminated if work did not commence within one year of issuance if work were not completed by the date specified in the permit unless extended by the permitting authority or for cause including misrepresentation or violation of per mit s 1848 provided that permit would terminate if work did not commence within 18 months of permit issuance and it required that projects be completed by 10 ears after enactment of the legislation or four years after issuance of the applicable permit whichever was later sunsetting the program beyond the question of whether nd under what circumstances good samaritan per mit should be terminated is the ques tion of whether authorization for the permit program itself shoul d be terminated few st akeholders have addressed this issue stating that s unsetting after specific peri od of time such as 10 years leaves room for congress to extend the legi slation but also ensures that the act will automatically lapse if the program does not succeed others agree that there does need to be time for congress to review the program to assess the need for changes or improvements including specific suns et period would give focus to that need for congressional review they say othe rs may argue however that sunset is unnecessary as congress can review ongoing programs at any time hr 1266 included 10year sunset requirement and ne years after enactment report to congress by epa on good samaritanper mitted activities s 1848 would have sunset the permit prog ram on september 30 2016 and would have required report to congress evaluating the permit program on january 1 2016 the administration proposal had provisions fo r sunsetting the program or report to congress conclusion in congressional testimony in 2006 some witnesses ex
