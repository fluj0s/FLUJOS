pakistan president pervez musharrafs independence day speech bbc news august 14 2002sparking the violence the 2002 elections saw the defeat of the ruling national conference and the emergence of two parties the peoples democratic party pdp and the indian national congress in state politic s development that has raised hopes for progress in settling the regional conflict the infiltration of islamic militants into kashmir oftentimes actively supported by pakistan is wi dely viewed as key contributor to ongoing conflict but many also note the sometimes draconian practices of indian security forces that have alienated many kashmiri citizens and so represent another significant obstacle to peaceful settlement the 2002 polls were important fo r several reasons new delhi sought to ensure that an election was held in which the entire spectrum of kashmiri political opinion was reflected free and fair election with largescale participation may bolster the indian claim that the democratic process had worked and that kashmir is willing and integral part of india it also may blunt both domestic and international criticism of indias handling of the security situation in the stat as well as weaken pakistani claims to the territory large voter turnout was not anticipated after militant separatist groups threatened violence against any and all participants in the elections both candidates and voters alike pakistan made it clear that it does not recognize the legality or legitimacy of kashmir elections and islamabad tinues its calls for plebiscite under auspices describing the kashmir elections as farci cal pakistani president pervez musharraf vowed to continue work to resolve the kashmir dispute and grant selfdetermination to the kashmiri people stating that the struggle for selfdetermination of our kashmiri brothers is sacred trust with us which can never be compromised2 indian officials expected growing levels of violence believing that such violence would be encouraged by pakistan in order to disrupt the elections the rationale for active disruption was traced by some to th domestic political problems of president musharraf who faced strong criticism fro m both religious conservatives and from mainstream political parties indian analysts saw backtracking on his verbal agreement to stop infiltration as way of appeasing both domestic constituencies with the strong performance of islamic fundame ntalist parties in the oct ober 2002 pakistan elections it is expected that there will be increased pressure on president musharraf to actively support separatist gr oups in kashmir the events of september and october 2002 domestically indian efforts to defeat an armed insurrection in the predominantly muslim kashmir valley and to obtain greater political participation in the state have been hindered by the position taken by both rdline muslim and hindu groups hardline kashmiri muslim militant groups refu sed to participate in the elections and threatened to violently disrupt them this threat was made good during the elections especially in the third stage where the state witnessed severa l attacks by militant groups more

to make more significant concessions on the future status of the state the hurriyat d considered participating in the elections but only if its elected officials did not have to take an oath of allegiance to the indian constitution what the hurriyat seeks is series of substantive trip artite talks with the indian and pakistani governments to determine final status for kashmir part of the problem remains the divided nature of the hurriyat the hurriyat leadership also remain under threat from th violent militant groups and most of them while espousing independence from india have bodyguards provided by the indian government as one kashmiri separatist leader shabir shah put it the 23party amalgam had failed to provide unified command for holding talks with the kashmir committee nongovernmental organization seekin g solution to the kashmir problem3 thus an environment of fear coupled with the lack of coherent agenda placed some domestic constraints on the electoral process the us position was outlined by secret ary of state powell during his july 2002 visit to south asia where the secretary stated we are looking to both india and pakistan to take steps that begin to bring peace to the region and to ensure better future fo r the kashmiri people the problems with kashmir cannot be resolved through viol ence but only through healthy political process and vibrant dialogue elections alone however ca nnot resolve the problems between india and pakistan nor can they erase the scars of so many years of strife elections can however be firs t step in broader process that begins to address kashmiri grievances and leads india and pakistan back to dialogue4 the bush administrations stated objectives were to see free and fair election in kashmir unhindered by violence as much as possible followed by renewed diplomatic dialogue between india and pakistan it is w ith this policy that the united states sent team of state department and us embassy officials to jammu and kashmir to meet the hurriyat leadership and reportedly to convi nce them to participate in the elections5 the indian government expressed resentment over the call for fostering kashmiri confidence in the election process as it believed that if terrorist violence was checked it could hold an election where both candidates and voter s are free of intimidation new delhi also ruled out the need for international observers stating that both jour nalists and interested observers were free to go to kashmir in an unofficial capacity and had been doing so for some time6 the united states

launching investigations into the deaths of prisoners and the fate of thousands who have disappeared following their arrest the disba nding of the feared special operations group counterinsurgency police unit the release of political prisoners the opening of dialogue with militant groups and the scrapping of the na tional prevention of terrorism act that has been criticized as abusive of human rights the cmp proposals while fulfilling an election promise to address kashmiri grievances against separatist militants and indian security fo rces alike have come under fire from hindu nationalists and top officials in new delhi many of whom believe that they will only encourage militancy and are contrary to indias interests9 moreover the national status of the congress party requires that it avoid appearing soft on militancy and so may add to the obstacles facing sayeeds government10 from the opposite quarter the commander of leading militant group the hizbul mujahideen called the

release several wellknown political prisoners has spurred heightened debate and accusations du ring november 2002 the jammu and kashmir government freed at least 11 topranking activists of both propakistan and proindependence militant groups after they were granted bail by courts14 the new delhi leadership including prime minister vajpayee nd deputy pm advani expresse d dismay at the moves and urged caution sayeed responded by questioning the political motives of the bjp but in his first official meetings with top na tional officials in early december 2002 sayeed stated that there is complete unders tanding between new delhi and the state government over vital issues relating to kashmir and negotiations with various kashmiri groups15 the pdp is not politically strong in th hindumajority jammu or heavily buddhist ladakh regions of the state for this reason analysts believe sayeed must give attention to placating all constituencies not merely his traditional base in the srinagar area the continued and increased flow of developm ent aid from new delhi to jammu and kashmir is central to this effort and sayeed has vowed to ensure that all regions of the state are treated equally in this regard16 from political perspective the elections strengthened somewhat the indian governments position on kashmir with the people of the state reportedly viewing the results as mostly credible the hurriyat apparently missed chance to demonstrate its claims to being the genuine representative of the kashmiri people the unexpectedly high voter turnout weakened pakistans positi on on kashmir to large extent belying islamabads claim that the elections were farcical with representative government in place there may be stronger push to end militancy in the state as
