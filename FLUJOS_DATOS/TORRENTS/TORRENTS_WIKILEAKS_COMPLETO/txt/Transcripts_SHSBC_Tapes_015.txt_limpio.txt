subject shsbc 15 date 15 mar 2000 002930 0000 from anonymousremailerseecommentheader fzba organization mail2newsnymaliasnet newsgroups altclearingtechnologyaltreligionscientology notknow lecture given on 15 june 1961 okay here we go whats the date fifteen gee whiz 15th of june well its like this i think i better disabuse you of something that at least one auditor was worried about today and that is the fantastic boiloff ability of pcs they just boil off i mean its really bad what is boiloff now i can tell you what it is on the mechanical side of it now i can tell you what it is on the thought side of it and between the two you will now see that you shouldnt worry about it theres reason to worry about boiloff the situation is that you are very prone to worry occasionally when the pc suddenly conks out and you think youre doing something wrong or something of this character i know this because you always comment on it in your auditing reports well now if pc was to boil off for half an hour at crack and you were to get in auditing i would be very happy to know about that see if they were to boil off and you didnt get in any auditing i would be happy to know about that but otherwise forget it huh its like this rising needle i found one auditor in an hgc who was practically hysterical on the subject i mean god almighty the nnnnthe needle rose and ohh deeear somewhere in the world it is raining somewhere in the world it is raining this is the same order of importance and listen i got special screaming urgent telex dispatches on it now this pcs needle is rising so its matter of something to worry about well it was along about this stage of the time and now actually the whole thing has come up again the auditor in this particular case we now discover wouldnt run anything on the pc if it made his needle rise because it made his tone arm go up and that was bad how do you think youre going to get somebody over any bump without their tone arm going up do you know that your case may be behaving so beautifully and not changing any and the thing going up whole tone and down whole tone up and down from 2 or 3 and you say youre just getting along fine and their graph doesnt change and the pc doesnt change and nothing happens to amount to anything now that would be very severe circumstance but would be true on sort of deadthetan case you could get some sort of wobble on the tone arm you could get wobble on the tone arm and it never went up to any extremity and it never went down to any extremity and the person just went on being calm and serene forever you could but gee on these new processes youd really have to work at it you know i dont know quite how youd do this you mighti dont know you might plug in the ashtray instead of the emeter itd be pretty hard to do i dont mean to be sarcastic but itd really be pretty hard to do but nevertheless it could be done look that pcs tone arm is going to go to 7 to 1 to 5 and now youre really going to see something happening i mean over course of three or four sessions youre liable to see reads like this wham wham wham wild and weird reads the tone arm starts around the dial dont you see because as responsibility increases the tone arm falls from the deadbody clear read of the thetandeadthrough 1 down through 7 which your tone arm wont register down through 65 down through 5 down through 4 down through 3 down to 2 down to 1 down to 7 down to 65 down to 5 down to 4 down to 3 down to 2 down to 15 and it could be expected to do all those things in the course of clearing from case who was on the extreme bottom when you picked him up you got it now look if you get worried about rising needle look what happens youre going to say at once well the tone arm mustnt change position because theyre hooked together let point this out that for the tone arm to change position the needle must rise at some time or another its also got to fall at some time or another right so trying to restrain the action of the tone arm or trying to restrain the action of the needle on the part of the auditor is actually an effort to restrain the pc from recovering and yet we hear of it every once in while now boiloff is not in this serious consideration out of your kindness of your hearts you know sometimes you are too kind lot of you are suffering from an overdose of kindness kindness goes an awful long ways and i couldnt live without it and i think itd be wonderful and theres been far too much violence and all these things we understand but kindness can be overvalued you can be kind to somebodyso kind to him that youll kill him supposing you started running pc and the pc objected one way or the other because the pc had somatic and you said to the pc oh well wed better not run that because its hurting you and we changed it and ran another process and then we ran process and it turned on somatic and then we said to the pc im not going to audit you through that because its hurting you you got the idea and by the time wed done that about the third time the pc would spin straight in and you would have been kind to him you would have helped him to death you see so there is fact actually you sometimes get very kind manager or very kind officer who simply winds up getting everybody courtmartialed shot murdered and burned you see they manage it one way or the other because its just totality of kindness with idea of effectiveness see effectiveness gets laid aside and only kindness stands in its stead and when that kind of condition exists some birds doing bad job you see somebodys doing bad job and hes kind and he doesnt mention it and the guys doing bad job and hes kind and he doesnt mention it and then one of two things happens either this fellows accu the targets accumulated ineffectiveness costs the lives of dozen men or the jobs of dozen men or quite unaccountably the fellow whos being so kind finally gets absolutely outraged when he finds the consequences and shoots the guy in his tracks in other words theyre kind right up to the point where they pull out the pistol and drill him in the heart you got the idea and very often youll see kindness under this particular stress and youll see somebody being shot down in flames because theyre being kind i try not to do that i mean an organization short time ago had warning and then got shot and now theyre convinced and i have cable on my desk and all is well and they all of sudden mysteriously have produced out of the blue students pcs see its very mysterious the academy suddenly got full i mean it just happened within fortyeight hours after they received the cable i dont know what they did maybe they went out in the street and found natives it wasnt running this way just fortyeight hours ago but here was kindness now what would have been the right thing to do from kind viewpoint was just to have not said anything about it because it would hurt somebodys feelings and let the organization collapse and let the fellow have big lose and let everybody in the area thats dependent on the organization all of sudden go without service or interest or hope or anything else and you could have just been kind until you would have killed the whole lousy cottonpicking lot you see that well this shows up in auditing as never before if you haul off of process because somebody boils off on it you are hauling off of the process which is running off their overts now whats the matter with pc its his overts thats what all right now theoretically its stuck flowon the mechanical side mechanical side stuck flow flow flows too long in one direction it gets stuck when you trigger that flow or try to flow it little bit longer in the same direction the pc boils off boiloff is stuck flow you can make anybody go unconscious by making them stick flow long enough mechanically but why is this thats an interesting thing that you can merely make guy get stuck flow and boil him off you can boil off almost anybody some guy who was quite alert and so forth you can actually say all right now you put the ashtray on the table thank you you put the ashtray on the table thank you you put the ashtray on the table thank you you put the ashtray on the table it isnt going to show up that way quite as fast as this command all right get the idea of somebody putting the ashtray in your lap get the idea of somebody putting the ashtray in your lap get the idea of somebody putting the ashtray in your thuthuthuthuthuthuthuthu it doesnt seem right you know well hell do it get the idea of putting the ashtray in your lap get the idea of putting zubzubzubzubzubzubzub weve got little red character running around england right now who is running onewayflow process and its making everybody nice and unconscious and shes very happy about it because shes never had any other target in her life but to make people unconscious you get the idea shes found out if you run stuck flow they konk out but theres nothing nothing you see of any importance about this you cant ruin pc but look where did all these stuck flows get parked are they over at graftie manor are they in east grinstead probably just where did they all get parked and as you audit pc dont you suppose this pc has ever had stuck flows on the track well where are they going to go when you audit them off or are they supposed to be delicately taken apart so it doesnt boil off well youre not taking the case apart that delicately so the fellow gets stuck flowrunning off and when he gets stuck flow running off he tends to go woag you got the idea there are stuck flows in the bank and when those stuck flows start coming off your pc woags and that is all you can say about it got it now it happens to be very curious thing but most of the time if pc were to go unconscious apparently and you were to continue to give the auditing command without any acknowledgment on the part of the pc that he was doing it or had done it the pc would do the auditing command if given at about the same frequency or little slower than he was getting it when he was awake because the pc doesnt go unconscious like the little pea in the seven mattresses of the princess he is sitting down underneath all the layers of whatnot being quite alert but he cant keep his eyes open see got the idea and he actually will obey auditing commands why should you stop giving the auditing commands if he doesnt hear you he wont obey them and what have you done nothing but if he did hear them and he did obey them he will come out of the boiloff with great rapidity and ive audited many pcs straight out of boiloff now i found in about 56 something like that that you could do this you could audit pc through boiloff by continuing to give the auditing command while he was boiling off and it is not an implant situation although it looks like it to you he comes right on out through the boiloff of course very often he wont remember having done it and this brings us to what is boiloff boiloff is the accumulated notknow that the pc has run on everybody thats on the mental not mechanicalthe thoughtpostulate level and if the pc has gone aroundwell lets say hes been university professor and lets say that he has insisted absolutely in teaching nothing but the theories of hegel and he has held the fort against all corners on the theory of hegel even to the point where when they discover an eighth planet he proves conclusively that it is utterly impossible for there to be an eighth planet because the perfect number is seven do you know that the discovery of the eighth planet by telescope was utterly and completely denied for long while and the evidence was thrown away of its discovery because according to hegel there could only be seven planets because seven is perfect number now supposing this university professor teaching this also insists that nobody ever look for any truth anywhere oh klow you get this bird million years after the fact or twenty days after the fact or something like that and you audit him and whats he going to do he is going to boil off and i dont care how many ways you try to run the flow hes going to boil off that is all because what is unconsciousness but the intensification of unknowingness and that is all that unconsciousness is is the intensification of unknowingness it is the final mechanism of how not to know unconsciousness is well below death because person very often gets knocked off and goes right on knowing all about it what gives with an anesthetist dont you suppose heres more direct q and thats more easily understood how about this anesthetist you start auditing this anesthetist and she goes blooeeabong why shes running notknow about the operation notknow about the operation they roll in another patient she puts the mask over their face and shoots them the juice or whatever they do these days i think they feed them the needle and the whiff all at the same time and then slap the ether on top of it theyre being thorough these days if they arent permitted to kill them they can certainly put them out so you start running this girl and she saysyou say well weve got little process here which is arc straightwire and were going to run this process arc straightwire and we say all right now recall time you were in communicati shes gone and you say hey tsk tsk kick her in the soles of the feet or something like that the way usedwe used to do dianetically thats all right it works and say i didnt even get to finish the auditing command now come on lets get the auditing command here she says auditing command fumph and you practically will have to hold her up in the auditing chair with broomsticks you know go get the broom and prop them under her head and prop her so shell sit there why shes been running notknow notknow notknow notknow notknow notknow notknow notknow you understand day and night shes been dramatizing notknow with velocity so there we are there is an excess of kindness that winds somebody up in the thorough soup because of course every time she anesthetizes somebody she lets them be less familiar with pain and they will recover much more slowly oh you say pain is good thing yeah i suppose any remedy is good thing after guy has gone completely off completely over the rolly coaster and completely off the end of track and hes lying there in the bushes and theres way to audit him at all and he is suffering well by all means whip out your morphine and give him shot in the gluteus maximus but there isnt any point in doing that if you could be effective you see but its only symptom of ineffectiveness if you cant be effective you can be kind and i suppose that should appear on the tombstone of practically every movement organization government and great man that has bit the dust and seen his goals in flinders if you cant be effective be kind and he didnt try to be effective he just tried to be kind and there he went as matter of fact probably all that happened to the romans and christianity is they were kind ive incidentally gone over lot of these court records about the early christians and the martyrs and its quite interesting quite interesting the courts were trying to be fair and trying to be nice about it and theyd be sitting there in session and all of sudden some wild whirling dervish would scream into the courtroom and say im martyr execute and the judge would say well now boy bailiff would you please find out what the man wants there and this guyd come screaming up to the front of the room throwing his arms around saying im christian and its on the imperial tablets that i am to be executed for being christian now i am martyr so execute because then i will go to heaven and eat pie in the sky from here on out the guy never thought twice hes probably lousy with harp but its been his whole unaesthetic career that he only does those things hes lousy at and they frankly would refuse to do thing to him and theyd kick him out in the street and go on with whatever trial they were going on with and all would calm down and few minutes later the fellow would be bursting into the room and say you are not doing your duty i am christian execute so they executed thirty and in one year in alexandria the homoiousian sect of the christians fighting with the homoousian sect of the christiansand we can only find one difference in their creeds is one spelled its name with an i and one spelled its name without one and in one year they killed one hundred thousand christians quite interesting what might pursue immediately after this the romans were very kind the early christian was very very cruel so now we find out the romans were very cruel and the early christians were very kind but the records dont bear this out now as far as survival is concerned if you want to survive i guess be cruel i suppose thats the most shortterm method of survival but its not any longterm method of survival but being kind and being ineffective of course is fast way to the electric chair it is fast way to insolvency its fast way to bankruptcy of all kinds and descriptions its fast way to the death chamber and the cemetery and more important to us it is fast way to oblivion on the whole trackbeing very kind well we understand that youre having difficulties mr jones we understand youre having difficulties and we will try to help you out mr jones you say were going to have this fence down here and well build this fence for you little bit better so it keeps your cattle in and the more youre kind to mr jones the more things mr jones realizes he can now get away with and all of sudden he moves over too far and you suddenly say to mr jones that pasture you can longer pasture your cattle in and yes i know that means bankruptcy for you mr jones but youve had it and i think this is rather cruel operation weve just done it here at saint hill just done it of course we havent made the man bankrupt but the staff has gotten so impatient and so screamingly angry at this fellow who always wants favors that nobody has ever said to him mr jones why dont you pull up your socks nobody has ever said this you see and as result weve got kind of notknow running in the middle of kindness dont you see because the guy is left unwitting of the fact that hes actually making enemies you see so these people that have been going around saying love love love thy neighbor love love lovei think there have been lot of songs written about it lot of hymns written about it fellow by the name of bach wrote some music about it one time organ player played in some cathedral someplace he couldnt hire musicians so he had to train all of his kids into an orchestra and anyway this fellow used to write boogiewoogie very complicated boogiewoogie that sounds something like spiritual orgasm from new orleans you know and he called it loving sheep or something and of course i figure the abbots of that day were all tone deaf so theyd look at this music and it says sheep amongst the meadow worshiping the lord you see as the title of the script and hed say youd better give my ten bob or whatever they gave him to write song and theyd say well thats very nice and they would buy it you see and didnt know what they were listening to afterwards now you listen to this music and if you dont listen to the titles you know you say boy those guysthose hepcats get little more speeded up theyll almost get dixieland you know i know this is sacrilege sacrilege its sacrilege against the worship of music but lets take look here at the anaten factor that stems from all of these various philosophies all of these oddities until we finally get philosophy that is so gargantuan in its unknowingness that it is its principal philosophy and when that philosophy arose amongst this particular race it stopped philosophy so that today doing what we are doing we seem odd we are thinking and were not supposed to think and if we do anything in the field of philosophy you see what were supposed to do is read immanuel kant and he said everything there was to know on the subject of philosophy you see he writes book to prove that you are immediately disciplined anyway and that the overtmotivator sequence really does exist and then he writes another book immediately afterwards and says youre paid for it you see he writes one book to say that you know thats his two main books and i just noticed the other day there hasnt been philosopher since its quite interesting what did he introduce into philosophy they call him the great chinaman of konigsberg well i dont know i dont call him that the only thing ive got against this runt this intellectual pygmy is just this is just this this one little thing he invented the fact that the highest level of knowingness is to be totally ignorant and you could never find out about it its called transcendentalism and he says anything that is really going on you will never know about so go ahead little stupid blinketyblanks my children and you will realize that anything that you begin to know about you cant know about it so theres nothing you can know about anything anyway so you might as well quit now it is said in much different language but the reason it has to be said in such polysyllabic german compoundfelony language is that in bare terms and in bare statement of fact such as ive just stated its totally unpalatable and yet you want to read all there is to know about transcendentalism and you will find out that that is it it is the great philosophy of notknow it says matter how much you study the physical universe you jerks you aint going to know anything youre just bunch of ignorant bums because all of that is unknowable how do you like that its all unknowable and you know why the mind has not kept pacetechnology in italong with the pace of physics is because it was stopped on the track by the basic theory that you cant know about it anyway its impossible to know about so therefore you cant know about it so ever since that time all theyve been doing is quoting greek philosophers man i had few too many greek tutors to go around quote em aw come off of that you mean you go upwards to twentythree hundred years later youve still got to have these guys haunting you thank you thank you greek tutorthats something you get rid of in very early childhood and you certainly dont keep it through adulthood and you certainly dont keep it for twentythree hundred years because the greek philosophies are very fine and were glad that man thought but the last time i was down in athens i found out what the greek philosophies were all about if you couldnt lick em you could confuse em and they did it with two things philosophy and entertainment and i have seen better nightclub operation in perfectly lousy holeinthewall nobodyeverheardofit nightclub in athens than you would find in the finest theaters of new york city guys just operating for buttons they were really good they were very very good they were very good at it they have saved this all through the centuries they are the original cabaret owners after you get the enemy there and hes conquered you and so forth you show him conclusively that he can be outcreated by turning loose bunch of dancing girls on him that really get his eyes popping and he forgets to conquer they did it to the they did it to race after race they did it to persians and theyve done it to egyptians and theyve done it to romans and theyre still on top pretty interesting its modus operandi for conquest and so is philosophy if you want complete catalog of the greek philosophies take something on the order of the prehav scale and figure out each one totally dramatized and write total philosophy around that level of the prehav scale and say that is it and there is only this and youve got one of the greek philosophies or one of the persian philosophies or one of the egyptian philosophies try it some time just try and look at the level of the prehav scale and figure out what would be philosophy that obscured everything under the sun except this one thingwhat kind of philosophy itd be after youve thought about it for while itll suddenly dawn on you that you are looking at the philosophy of something like rosicrucianism that is it you see or youre looking at the philosophy that was practiced in egypt or youre looking at stoicism just look at effect theres effect on the prehav scale now just figure out what kind of philosophy would you work out that would totally bar out any slightest effect of any character and you wind up with greek stoicism and similarly you can do this with every level of the prehav scale it is reactive scale so of course theres broad appeal any time youre too broke your case has gone to pieces and youve become utterly unprincipled somewhere up the track and you land amongst the wogs always remember that you can dig up piece of the prehav scale and get marble palace with gold roof just figure out where they sit on the prehav scale and dream up philosophy to prove it and if you prove it conclusively that thats where they sit on the prehav scale and this is the very best thing to doahhh theyll make you the governor of the joint as well as the high priest you see most philosophy has deteriorated to some kind of yipyap agreement with what they have already got this is natural impulse because all you had to do was open book of the compound philosophies of the ages that is in the library and you take it down from the library shelf and look for copy of it where book markers have been at work and you will find the most fantastic banalities underscored heres perfect gem of wisdom sitting there but do they underscore that you see oh they will underscore something heavily you see with marks in the margins and notes over here god is love and you say come off of it man and you read on both sides of this it proves conclusively that the guy actually is talking about the fact that religion divides itself up into love and hate and the phrase god is love has gotten into compound sentence and it says in most countries the more inane religions subscribed to by the very weak pronounce the theory god is love whereas anybody on casual inspection could demonstrate that if god is love and yet keeps hitting people with lightning bolts it couldnt possibly be monotheoristic religion and this book marker has read that whole thing and hes gone right into the middle of it and hes underscored god is love and then hes put over in the margin this is certainly true man im telling you ladies and gentlemen your postulates and operations on the whole track really stick in the philosophic line its great compliment to your ability to make postulate stick well anyhow as you come up the line and look all this over you get into an interesting frame of mind about this sort of thing youre liable to get into this kind of frame of mind the truth is subjective phenomenon and only exists as subjective phenomenon and there is broad or agreedupon truth or anything you have the philosophy of the onlyone general semantics see general semantics theyve gotten it down to the fact not only is there truth but there is meaning and nobody can talk to anybody because everybody means something different by everything that is said well they might have trouble talking to people but i tell you i dont so there must be something wrong with their theory all youve got to find is one wild variable on their theory of course and it blows up and thats i dont have any trouble talking to people i dont have any trouble getting them to find out what i mean either and i dont have the least bit of trouble finding out what they mean i may ask them three times and they may practically blow their stacks and figure out that i must be the most stupid guy they have ever met but i eventually find out what they mean see and im not out of communication even if general semanticists are see there are all these levels failed communicate weve got it with us we have one philosophy on the tone scale totally built out of one level on the tone scale 11ism its was brought forward by the fellow of the name of dale carnegie its how to be successful 11 read him if you dont think so man you never saw such stuff and you meet most salesmen that have been supertrained in this and you wind up dodging never answering your phone going nowhere near your mailbox just for fear these people will appear so i think carnegie having accomplished his goal pleasantly kicked the bucket and went on to happier rewards but i think his effort was to stop all selling everywhere must have been because you just try and monkey around with this 11 type of selling try to communicate with noreality try to talk to people by never uttering what you think you cant communicate with people by never uttering what you think theyll get this odd feeling of the unreality of it all now why do they get this feeling of an unreality of it all because youre running notknow on them arent you see youre talking to them and you think this guy ought to be thrown down the nearest well see you think his product would not even make good bonfire and yet you say well yes mr jones yes were very interested inproduct and so on why dont you call later or talk to our general manager about it and so forth what are you doing youre just making yourself more stupid thats all why because youve got notknow overt but believe he will sense this somehow or another hell sense this it sort of comes out of the atmosphere somehow or another it sort of drips off the walls that there is sincerity being accomplished around here so the communication doesnt occur and we get our old arc triangle and where reality is not present notknow is substituted for it tsk tsk tsk so you have definition of unreality god i never thought id get to that and the definition of unreality is substitution of known for an uni mean an unknown for known if you want to create big unreality all you have to do is just substitute an unknown for known the russians do this rather well with communism everybody knew it was cold in russia and that russians were hard to govern and whole bunch of things like this and so they put bunch of unknowns in the line they even got an iron curtain you cant even communicate about with or around the country and people have an odd odd feeling about russia and yet russia is working like mad trying to communicate to everybody well thats interesting isnt it they must be running vast notknow on all of us maybe theres some good things in russia who knows maybe theres some bad things maybe theres something workable in communism who knows because you know desperately in the final analysis that the reading of an entire russian exposition of what the russian is doing is the substitution of series of unknowns for series of knowns they know what their production figures are and you get the weird idea that you dont know youve read them see eighthundred billion pairs of shoes minute are produced in russia you see under our great system and with our great dictator and so forth and you read that figure and some feeling comes over you that somebody has tampered with the statistics so this winds you up actually not just believing that this is false it winds you up with whole series of speculations most of them bad you try to figure out how many pairs of shoes would really be produced in russia per minute lets see there are three russians working and im sure theyre not making shoes and you wind up this way and you finally say well you know theres you conclude only one thing in the face of commie propagandaeventually anybody who can think at alleventually concludes one thing that you dont know anything about it they spread this as big unreality they are the kings of mystery on this planet at the present time they have taken over from religion as being the czars of mystery and thats how they do it you can actually get pretty annoyed with person after while if every time you asked them how they are they say theyre fine and you know damn well that theyve got backache and headache and they feel like hell and you say how are you and the person says i am fine you do several things amongst them is go down the tone scale with regard to this person the person is substituting nonfact for an observable fact you see and you keep getting this unreality thrown at you and eventually the person starts to kind of disappear and this very curious phenomena will occur around person who is doing this to other people one man eventually could not see his wife when she was in the same room hed look straight through her and would see nothing but the wall on the other side now that is onean interesting phenomena it is reproducible in hypnotism you can hypnotize somebody and tell him the table isnt there and hell see straight through the table and see the carpet on the other side of it which was of great mystery and interest and probably formed one of the primary bulks of research of people like charcot and mesmerthese boys they did an awful lot of interesting things theyd make people sense things at distance and do all kinds of things now what is this factor of reality and communication and notknow they just add up to tremendous woag you see and itll demonstrate itself mechanically with boiloff so that everybody gets more and more stupid now in the field of philosophy fellow comes along and with great authority says everybody if they achieved it to the ne plus ultra would finally find out that they couldnt know and oddly enough it had enough effect on this society that i think there are people right here who used to buy it or youve certainly heard it but you didnt buy it very hard but you know lot of people who have bought it you shouldnt research into the mind and you shouldnt do this and you shouldnt do that and you shouldnt think about it because you couldnt know anything about it anyway oh wow what is this see i mean well the least you could do is put some invented knowingness there the way the christians did but to say that it is totally unknowable all of the secrets of the existence are totally unknowable oh my contempt i spit what fabulous conceit the man had to know that it was all unknowable what conceited dog now if theres tremendous notknow associated with person he tends to persist like mad and you get all sorts of oddball aberrations going in the society for instance the monk dharma who existed ten thousand years ago in india has formed the basis of most indian religions and not thing is known about him or what he said isnt that fascinating i mean indian religions are based to marked degree upon the sayings findings and so forth of dharma chinese religions are based on dharma we think it means fate thats how far it goes you look up in the dictionary and youll find dharma has something to do with fate or something of the sort doesnt tell you what it is and you look up in one of these textbooks of one of these johnnycomelately indian hoaxes that they call the great revelations andsubabubaboobaboobaba i think is their last one you look up for theyou look up in this textbook on this and youll find dharma described in very fantastic definition which is long and drawn out actually everything in that textbook by the way is incorrect you read over theall the definitions of the various missions and words and so forth of past philosophies in this new gugug and youll find theyre all defined with big zzzzz curve see actually dharma was the name of monk and that is it and of course he had fantastic influence upon indian philosophy so they began to regard him as fate itself but he is actually loftier name in the philosophies of the east than buddha but nothing is known about him nothing so here you have fabulous notknow dont you and you get terrific persistence of this notknow dont you well now look if it can ride so thoroughly in the philosophies of country or people how do you think it rides along in somebodys reactive mind hm you might say the least known philosopher on the whole track earth immediate track earth current presenttime earth is fellow that we dont even know what his name is we dont even know its fellow got the idea its fate it wasnt fate it was probably somebody who washed his feet in brook and put his begging bowl out where it belonged and laid down the law and said what he thought was right and so forth and yet this fellows been totally devoured in time i happen to know something about this particular character myself but if he can ride that unknown up the track and be the influential background to somebody that we know rather welllaotse see confucius buddha they all go back to this fellow and we dont know anything about it why is he still there its because we dont know anything about him hes held in place by the notknow notknowingness does not result in an obscurement but is known to you as notisness you see so there he is riding on the track like mad expressed in everybodys mind through india through china hes the background of the most broadspread religion of peace that this planet has had and yet we call the background of this planet buddha see the eastern religions we say well buddha or confucius or laotse orsee but actually sitting right back of their shoulders is this dharma and we dont even know its man its fate you got the idea do you see the alterisness so forth well now just take that as an example of what happens in somebodys reactive mind when you get notknow riding along the line to this degree what happens he boils it off thats what happens he runs into the dharma on his track the total notknow that is still totally in place and he starts to go clog woag thud notknow is the extreme manifestationin its most extreme manifestation is unconsciousness notknow in lesser manifestation is death the most extreme manifestation is when person cannot go unconscious and we call that insanity and insanity lies on that band you have death which is simply state of beingness rather than an action it means the fellow is longer inhabiting body but we cant say what his condition was in at the time he left he normally wasnt unconscious and we go down into unconsciousness and were below the ramifications of death and now we go down in below the ramifications of unconsciousness and we find insanity and at that level person is unable completely totally and utterly to notknow it but what is he trying to notknow by this time hes trying to notknow about the fifteenth substitute and you get delusory state that the person cannot notknow and youll find people who are incipiently insane are going around all the time little bit worried about something that might be just around the corner theylets see thuhhh you listen to them just get the common denominator of all of their conversation its the inability to notknow substitute or its the inability to not tolerate notknowing substitute its the abilitytheir sole ability left is just to recognize that there are intolerable notknowingnesses that they cannot escapeand that they lie in wait for them they lie in wait everywhere everywhere and they walk down the street and just outside the circle of the lamplight they dont even dare articulate it you see just outside the circle that the lamp is street lamp is making on the pavement there and you find them all in aalways in constant inarticulate terror about something or you find them in immediate and terrible combat against something that is undesignatable and you find them in state where they have collapsed before the notknowingness of what assails them and youll get them running the whole tone scale about notknowingness but that tone scale occurs after unconsciousness and its tone scaleis notknowingness they go from an inseniserenity about notknowingness you can find total nut whos going around sayinghes just entering the field of nuttiness but itll be something like this well i dont know but it doesnt matter nothing matters really that i dont know and i dont know really but it doesnt matter it doesnt matter and im being very serene the best thing to do is to be calm about it all and i will just go on being calm about all this and so forth and what happens happens and uh so forth and uh i just wont think about it anymore im going to stop thinking about it now thats right and what happens happens and uh i just dont know anything about it so there isnt any reason to perturb myself about it at all because i dont know anything about it you see and therefore i have forgotten it all and im in that pleasant state right now of not even beingnot dwelling on it for moment and i just dont give it another thought so that is the state i am in and that is very nice and i am being very happy and its sensible state to be in you see because there isnt any knowing about it you see so you just might as well be serene about the whole thing and thats why im so serene i never worry you think for moment i am worrying youre very mistaken because it doesnt matter anything to that i dont know about this never enters my mind that i dont know about it in fact i dont even know what i dont know about you run into this person they usually pass for sane person theyre pretty sane compared to the rest of them now you go on down tone scale from that and you get each point of the tone scale about notknow the person is angry about notknowingness but remember itthisin insanity it is always notknowingness about an unknown they dont know what they dont know about you got the idea they have target its interesting you get classification of this dont hang this appellation around somebody because hes simply upset because he cant find his car keys this boy is all right he knows he doesnt know where his car keys are not only that but he also knows that its car keys that he doesnt know about see well thats sane as can be and he can be very misemotional about this thing on the misemotional scale without being insane he might be frantic but hes not insane youre looking at an entirely different phenomenon this person does not know what he is infrantically looking for you got the idea if you can envision somebody who has lost his car keys but doesnt know that he has lost his car keys and is looking for his car keys but doesnt know its his car keys that hes looking for but is just going around just going around looking looking in terrible frantic state of mind looking looking looking looking looking you see them in asylums youll say what are you looking for bud and hell say dont disturb dont disturb i might forget what it is well forget what it is he doesnt know what it is everybodyof course people like freud immediately go klingklonk and try to find out what the man is looking for well of course the man is looking for nothing its simply phenomenon of looking you understand its franticness about it hell be in grief youll see somebody sitting there crying and crying and crying you say what are you crying about well they cant articulate what theyre crying about they dont know what theyre crying about they havent clue what theyre crying about but if you stated it one way or the other theyre crying because they of course havent been able to find out about what they dont know about and that is the way the reactive bank stacks up just tingtingtingtingting right there bingbingbingbingbing theyre crying about not being able to know what theyre crying about you see its total reactivethought device youll find them all up and down the tone scale and characterize every one of them if you want to put together new scale of insanity and make name for yourself amongst psychiatrists go ahead because you just describe the tone scale and describe each one of these states but describe the person being unable to conceive what it is that is in this state that he is upset about envisioning what he would do in those mental reactions you of course wind up with hundred percent and only just this one thing totally fixed on that misemotional state because he cant know or mustnt know or is curious about knowing or mustnt let anybody else know about what he doesnt know about and theres where your knowingness doubles up and theres where you get the guy totally fixed on the track if youve ever worried about whether or not youre potty and going around the bend up the chimney or something of the sort just ask yourself this question do you know what youre going up the chimney about just ask yourself that question you know why am i unhappy tonight what dont i know about tonight well if you can find out about what you dont know about tonight why youre very far from insane insanity is the manifestation of not being able to fellow cant even find out that he is in grief because he cant find out about what he cant find out about see and of course thatthe mere fact that you are able to speculate moves you out of the totaldramatize category just the fact that youd say lets see what am i unhappy about tonightjust the fact that you could say thatyoure not nuts its just as easy as that but of course there isnt anything when person gets into that state there is nothing thereanyhow if you understand these various mechanisms when you look at somebody then they wont baffle you because your bafflement is simply qa with their notknowingness and the reason you get concerned about insanity and that sort of thing and the reason you very often find an auditor going puppy to the root on an insane case and not being able to stop auditing the insane case is because the auditor starts qaing trying to find out what the insane case doesnt know and the auditor gets to try to find out what it is that the insane case doesnt know and the hideousness about it is is factually the insane case doesnt know about dontknow which of course adds up to the doublecompound felony of it all so when you dont know about notknow you dont know whether notknow and what it is and whether or not you notknow it and you dont even know what it is that you dont notknow youre candidateyoure candidate for the spinbin you see there are two things that move it out one of these things is the fact that you can speculate as to what you dont know if you can do that thats sane by the way its very interesting you can introduce to person who is even feeling spinny you know sudden feeling of sanity by just asking them to think of one person who doesnt think theyre insane did you know that its one of the most interesting tricks i ever dreamed up you just say well think of one person that doesnt think youre crazy person will eventually think of his dog or something and turn sane just like that why youve introduced knowingness into his unknowingness and you can introduce just one knowingness into an insane persons perimeter and youll turn them sane you just say look around this room and find something that is really real to you and this person will look all around the room and they may take half an hour to do it and they eventually pick up silver tea pot or something of the sort and say boy this is really real and youll just see them go sane its good for one command thats why it sort of tends to drop out of the lineup but thats terrific trick thats terrific trick both of those both of those you get somebody whos going to blow his brains out and commit suicide and theyre so terrified of all the terrifying things that they dont know whats terrifying about them which is what makes them terrifying if you were to say to them think of one person who thinks youre sane thats evidently total non sequitur to them but theyll think about it at once theyre almost incapable of not thinking about it and you dont hear any more about suicide so you see its an interesting little trick to have in your war bag hm now so much for all that ive given you very long rambling discourse here today and i havent answered any of your questions and i can see that i have slugged you to some degree you look little overwhumped so ill tell you how to unwhump yourselfunwhump yourself were going to start to give the students security check practice well start giving them security check insofar as possible along with their auditing in other words you have to learn how to do security checks and you better learn how to do lots of them of various kinds so if you just spend an hour or something like that day or one page of the joburg day security checking somebody then you can be supervised as to how youre doing the security check and you can be looked over about what youre doing at the same time youre catalyzing the auditing which is going on and those auditors that are running cchs on somebody shouldnt actually be doing security check on them also that security checking should be relegated to this other program and then you will see faster case gains its almost doubleauditor situation but you need experience in doing security checking and you need to do enough security checks that you become familiar with doing security checks and with your familiarity there may suddenly pop up something you feel you dont know about doing security checks and this is the place to find out you dont know because the information is all over the place got it okay sound like good program to you audience yes very good all right so thats my contribution to unwhumping you in addition to that i think youre making pretty good progress i just looked over all of your case reports there doesnt seem to be anybody hanging up here particularly badlyexcept you of course you seem to be doing all right im actually very pleased with the way things are going on the thing but if you dont think that should be the state of affairs dont get into frame of mind that you mustnt tell ron because itll hurt his feelings realize youre just running dontknow on ron okay if you dont think things are running all right for you or your training or something like that and you cant nerve yourself up to say it to an instructor or somethingyou think i ought to know about it something like thatwhy by all means just put dispatch on my lines okay and if you do miraculously find out theres something you dont know that you should know while you are here and so forth and you dont find it out ill think youre stupid thank you
