censed appraiser is not required to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions if such agency determines in writing that such threshold level does not represent threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions6 the current base for residential transactions is 250000 all transactions more than 1 million require certified appraiser as opposed to licensed appraiser the cuomo agreements on march 3 2008 fannie mae announced an ag reement with the attorney general of the state of new york that would estab lish rules for home appraisals that would take effect on january 1 20097 in the agreement the attorney general agreed to cease state investigations of fannie mae if fannie m ae agreed to purchase mortgages only from banks that did not conduct home appraisals inhouse8 similar agreement was reached with freddie mac the other secondary mo rtgage market gse because the gses purchase high percentage of prime mortga ges originated by banks it could be argued that the agreement is facto banking regulation because any bank that conducted in house appraisals would lose access to the rgest source of funds for prime mortgages although the agreement was negotiated with th knowledge of the federal regulator of the gses the office of federal housin g enterprise oversight ofheo9 the ffiec and its member federal financial regulators have ch allenged both the substance of the agreement and the authority of state official to tablish rules for fede rally chartered banks10 the status of the agreements is further complicated by the transformation of ofheo into the federal housing finance agency fhfa and the gse conservatorship it remains to be seen if the agreement between new york and fannie mae will survive the challenge of these federal banking regulators the home valuation code of conduct the cuomo agreement would establish new set of rules for appraising the value of homes referred to as the home valua tion code of conduct hvcc the expressed intent of the agreement is to ensure ppraisal independence nd valuation protection and to establish r equirements governing appraisal lection solicita tion compensation conflicts of interest and corporate independence among other things11 the hvcc callshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22953crs5 for the creation of an independent valuation institute which is intended to be independent despite the agreements provision for 1 funding by fannie mae and 2 potential affiliation with an existing industry group the institute would propose amendments to the code establish consumer hotline and provide appraisers contact if they believed they were being pressured in any way automated valuation models and appraisal management companies some may be concerned about the impact of the hvcc on automated valuation models automated valuation models are computerized va luations based on available information as the name implies it is ofte n possible to get an estimated appraisal from these models without person visiting the inte rior of the home being valued as rough analogy consider information to assist carbuying such as reports by carfax and similar services as long as the vehicles main tenance and accident information is publicly available computer model may provide rough estimate of the cars value however prudent car buyer might still prefer mech anic to personally inspect the car because important information may not be in the public domain similarly automated valuation models attempt to provide rough home va luation based on public information of the home and nearby comparable properties examples of similar home valuations can be found on real estate service webs ites like the auto mechanic in the car example prudent home buyers and mortgage lenders might obtai n an inspection of the home by qualified professional the hvcc expressly rejects preference for automated valuation models section xi states nothing in this code sh all be construed to tablish new requirements or obligations that 1 require lender to obtain property valuation or to use any particular method for propert valuation such as apprai sal or automated valuation model some have expressed concern that the hvcc provides preference for appraisal management companies as the name implies these firms specialize in providing real estate appraisals in some cases the hvcc does provide preference for appraisal management companies compared with some other professionals section iii for example states that appraisal management companies may be designated to arrange compensation for appraisers but that mortgage bankers and real tate brokers may not similarly section v expressly allows for employees of appraisal management companies to select appraisers but does not include real estate brokers
