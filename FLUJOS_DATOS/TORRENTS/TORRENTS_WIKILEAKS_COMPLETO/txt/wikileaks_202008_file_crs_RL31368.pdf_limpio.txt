foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368preventing proliferation of biological weapons us assistance to the former soviet states summary the former soviet and subsequently russian biological weapons program possessed capabilities far in excess of any such program known to have existed elsewhere these capabilities included geneticallyaltered antibioticresistant pathogens and sophisticated delivery systems approximately fifty biological research and production centers brpcs throughout the former soviet union devoted either all or part of their work to the program in the postsoviet era former soviet states drastically reduced and in some cases eliminated funding for these brpcs thousands of bw scientists became unemployed or underemployed and the facilities weapons technology and thousands of strains of pathogens at these brpcs became vulnerable to theft sale or misuse in the mid1990s the united states began engaging brpcs throughout the former soviet union in four kinds of cooperative projects aimed at preventing proliferation of bw capabilities collaborative research projects involve former bw scientists in projects with american scientists and seek to deter former bw scientists from selling their expertise to terrorist groups or proliferating states several us government agencies are involved in collaborative research projects most of which are funded through the international science centers biosafety enhancement projects are intended to make brpcs safe places for collaborating scientists to work in combination collabora tive research and biosafety enhancement projects give us officials routine access to laboratories and facilities that were once used for bw research and production biosecurity projects consolidate and restrict access to pathogens dismantlement projects target excess infrastructure and bw equipment at brpc sites for permanent dismantlement biosafety biosecurity and dismantlement projects are funded through and carried out by dods cooperative threat reduction program us participants in these projects identify several lessons learned in the past few years first it has become clear that the infrastructure of the sovietrussian bw complex was more extensive than most analysts realized when the united states initiated its efforts to prevent proliferation of bw capabilities from former soviet states cooperative projects at some brpcs have helped open doors to other brpcs and since 1995 more than forty brpcs have been involved in cooperative projects with the united states second us participants report that biosafety biosecurity and dismantlement projects require complex negotiations complex engineering work considerable project management support and innovative solutions for problems specific to each brpc consequently they have learned that the united states may need to offer longterm commitment if it wants to complete the effort at the same time the us agencies with bw nonproliferation programs recognize the need to maximize the nonproliferation benefits of us assistance in an environment with limited resources finally us participants have discovered that interpersonal and institutional relationships resulting from these cooperative efforts may play powerful role in preventing proliferation of bw capabilities from former soviet stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368contents introduction 1 the sovietrussian biological weapons program 2 background 2 soviet bw capabilities 3 revelations about the sovietrussian bw program 4 the

consider nuclear chemical and biological weapons to be weapons of mass destruction wmd some argue that biological weapons are not weapons of mass destruction but weapons of mass casualties others point out that some biological weapons can destroy agricultural and environmental targets on massive scale 2 what changed september 11 was not our vulnerability to terrorism but our understanding of it the greatest shock was perhaps not even the sheer loss of life which was staggering but the evil hate and fanaticism behind it to most americans the attack was unthinkable now our nation knows

biological weapons us assistance to the former soviet states introduction the events of september and october 2001 undermined longheld assumptions about us vulnerability and the threat of attack with weapons of mass destruction1 the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon led many to believe that neither respect for human life nor the will to selfpreservation would stop some people from attacking the united states then few letters laced with anthrax caused death terror and disruption and exposed the united states vulnerabilit to biological attack speaking about these events former senator sam nunn stated we lost our sense of invulnerability but as the world is learning we also lost our sense of complacency2 the united states has been concerned about the potential for proliferation of deadly weapons or materials from the former soviet union for more than decade these concerns grew in the latter half of 2001 the 107th congress held several hearings specifically to examine biological weapons programs and the possibility that they might be used against the united states3 testimony often centered on the legacy of the soviet and subsequent russian biological

draws only on unclassified sources so it may not present complete picture of bw capabilities in former soviet states or us efforts to prevent their proliferation the sovietrussian biological weapons program background4 reports indicate that soviet development of biological weapons bw dates back to at least 1928 when the red army ordered soviet scientists to find way to deploy typhus as weapon the soviet bw program expanded in the 1930s there are strong indications that weapons testing involved some prisoners in stalins labor camps as the program further expanded after the war the primary known site for bw testing became vozrozhdeniye island which is located in the aral sea between kazakhstan and uzbekistan negotiations on the 1972 biological weapons convention bwc alerted soviet authorities to western achievements in weaponizing pathogens5 soviet authorities reportedly doubted that other signatories would abandon their development of biological weapons at the same time prominent soviet molecular biologist convinced the soviet leader leonid brezhnev and other soviet authorities that developing genetically altered pathogens and more advanced ways to weaponize them would give the soviet union strategic advantage in the cold war in 1973 the soviet union created biopreparat to pursue this new direction in bw development it was network of approximately forty private biological research and production centers brpcs and reportedly its work remained hidden even from many highranking soviet officials at its peak biopreparat and four military biological institutes reportedly employed approximately 60000 peoplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs3 6 smithson amy toxic archipelago preventing proliferation from the former soviet chemical and biological weapons complexes

designed to attack human targets agricultural targets and environmental targets the bwc classifies bw agents as bacteria toxins viruses or rickettsaie the sovietrussian program experimented with all these the program developed and weaponized geneticallyaltered bacteriological agents such as anthrax plague tularemia glanders and brucellosis that were resistant to heat cold and antibiotics7 they also weaponized several viruses including smallpox which can kill 3040 of an exposed population during an epidemic8 venezuelan equine encephalitus which is unlikely to kill but can incapacitate troops the marburg virus which like the ebola virus is haemorrhagic fever which destroys cells and causes massive internal bleeding9 according to some sources the sovietrussi an program also developed chimera or recombinant weapons such as combination of plague bacteria and the myelin toxin which attacks sheaths protecting nerve fibers10 reports indicate that the sovietrussian bw program also developed weapons to attack plants and animals the antiplant diseases targeted corn wheat potatoes tobacco barley and other crops11 the antianimal diseases included footandmouth disease and african swine fever reports indicate that the soviet bw program maintained the capacity to produce and store millions of liters of pathogens for example the bw production facility at berdsk reportedly housed

the entire population of the united states if effectively dispersed13 the sovietrussian bw complex reportedly also succeeded in refining agents to improve the delivery capacity of biological weapons one ancient way to deliver biological weapons is through the use of infected vectors such as bugs rodents or cadavers14 the sovietrussian bw program reportedly developed an infrastructure that could quickly cultivate millions of parasitic insects to carry disease or attack plant life15 biological weapons can also be delivered through contamination of food and water supplies most experts agree that the most effective way is to contaminate the air with an aerosolized agent that infects people or animals when they inhale it the sovietrussian program reportedly developed highlyeffective techniques to aerosolize agents16 many sources confirm that the sovietrussian bw program refined delivery systems for biological agents by conducting tests on primates at vozrozhdeniye island17 the soviet military reportedly equipped some aircraft and strategic missiles specifically to carry out biological attacks one type of airplane had the capacity to spray biological agents another was designed to carry cluster bombs with cantaloupesized bomblets that could spin and spread disease as they fell from the sky revelations about the sovietrussian bw program in 1979 at least sixtyeight people died when anthrax spores were released from ministry of defense facility in sverdlovsk russia18 although suspicions were raised from 1979 onward the united states did not verify that the deaths

sources20 early in 1992 russias president boris yeltsin publicly acknowledged the existence of an active russian bw program he vowed to end the program but his efforts were reportedly thwarted by some in his military establishment who continued the program in september of 1992 these military officials represented russia in negotiations with the united states and great britain that sought to establish an inspection process to confirm the absence of bw production russia initially consented to us and british inspections at russian bw facilities but then refused to sign the trilateral agreement unless the united states and great britain accepted reciprocal inspections at private pharmaceutical companies in their countries some in russia claimed that the united states and great britain were violating the bwc after inspecting us facilities russian inspectors claimed they found evidence of an american bw program yet russia never gave us and british inspectors access to military brpcs in russia21 in 1992 kanatjan alibekov who has changed his name to ken alibek defected to the united states he had been second in command in the sovietrussian bw program in his debriefings with us officials alibek confirmed and expanded on pasechniks revelations alibek has frequently testified before congress about the sovietrussian bw program and about us efforts to mount defense against biological attacks22 the threat posed by the sovietrussian bw program many observers believe that the legacy of the sovietrussian bw program might pose significant threat both to the russian people and to the security of the united states there are several sources for these concerns23 first experts fear that the contamination at vozrozhdeniye island could pose threat to surrounding areas experts believe that the ground on the island has absorbed biological agents scattered during weapons tests furthermore the aral sea is shrinking and some fear that rodents might soon be able to travel between the island and the mainland possibly spreading disease to population already sickened by environmental degradation and pollution24 natural environments

chemical and biological defense october 17 2001many other brpcs may also be degraded due to widespread environmental pollution and possibly the leakage of some biological weapons agents into the soil second reports indicate that many brpcs in former soviet states are in bad physical condition these brpcs have not been able to maintain advanced biosafety containment laboratories in the postsoviet economic environment experts fear that accidental release of pathogens could occur at many of these sites25 nevertheless some experts believe that despite the degraded condition of many brpcs russia could use the remaining expertise and infrastructure to reactivate an offensive biological weapons program third many experts believe that biological weapons capabilities in former soviet states could be vulnerable to theft or sale26 there are reports that the mafia and warring ethnic factions within russia have tried to obtain biological weapons capabilities27 personnel at brpcs in former soviet states are generally poorly paid which some believe could motivate them to steal and sell dangerous pathogens weapons technologies or instructions related to bw development and production28 seed cultures of pathogens might also be smuggled out of the brpcs the united states does not have complete knowledge of the biological weapons capabilities in the sovietrussian bw complex and therefore may not have vaccines or antibiotics that could provide defense against infection us biodefense efforts have increased since september 11 2001 but many public health officials stress that us preparedness for biological attack is still inadequate in addition according to many experts biological weapons have several characteristics that could make them attractive to terrorist groups and hostile nationstates they can produce mass casualties and incite panic29 it could be difficult to trace the perpetrator of biological attack30 and they could provide an asymmetric means of challenging americas overwhelming conventional and nuclear warfighting strength31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs7 32 miller et germs pp 205 207 209212 228229 280 see also evidence indicates qaeda had russian

attempted to recruit former soviet scientists with bw expertise according to george tenet the director of central intelligence these scientists possess expertise that could confer the advantage of technological surprise on enemies of the united states33 furthermore hostile nations and terrorist groups might offer salaries significantly higher than the scientists current often very low incomes34 according to some observers this problem might be overstated although exact statistics are not available the vast majority of soviet weapons scientists apparently either remained in former soviet states or migrated to the united states and britain the desire of remaining soviet weapons scientists to stay rooted in their home communities near relatives and friends could make it difficult for proliferating groups to lure them elsewhere however carnegie endowment report on nuclear and missile scientists released in april 2001 indicated that although many former weapons scientists once hoped the economic crisis would pass now some of them may migrate because they fear their situation will not improve some scientists also apparently feel that it would be better to be paid to work for proliferating state or substate group than to become involved in organized crime35 in addition bw scientists could still serve the interest of proliferators without traveling or migrating if they provided consultation shared weapons secrets over the internet or stole tiny seed culture of geneticallyaltered pathogen and passed it into the hands of proliferators36 the us response policy objectives for nonproliferation efforts since 1995 the united states has gained access to many brpcs in former soviet states and has sought to prevent proliferation of bw capabilities these efforts are directed toward several policy objectives including increasing transparency at brpcs that once participated in the sovietrussian bw program securing or destroying pathogens and weapons technology

the end of this report the state department the science centers in 1992 the united states japan the european union and russia established the international science and technology center istc to develop approve finance and monitor science and technology projects for peaceful purposes in former soviet states the russian parliame nt initially resisted the establishment of the istc but the center began making grants to nuclear chemical and biological weapons scientists in 199438 similar organization called the science and technology center in ukraine stcu was founded in july 1995 it distributes grants to former weapons scientists in ukraine uzbekistan and georgia the stcu and the istc have taxexempt status and their employees have diplomatic status scientists who receive these grants may continue to pursue their regular jobs but these grants seek to provide them with enough income to reduce their incentive to sell their knowledge to other nations in fy2002 the administration requested and congress appropriated 37 million to the istc and stcu when making grants to former soviet scientists the istc and stcu seek to prevent the misappropriation of funds according to the gao since 1994 the international science and technology center has directly deposited grant payments into project participants individual bank accounts which prevents the institutes from diverting funds for unauthorized purposes39 in addition both centers have the right the responsibility and the power to audit the grants they make40 the science centers provide framework for

assessing research proposals and projects of russian biology institutes and the committee on dualuse technologies export control and materials protection control and accounting are involved in us nonprolifer ation efforts many think tanks and nonprofit organizations also provide grant money outreach and education programs and expertise in support of us government efforts to prevent proliferation of bw capabilities from former soviet states implementation issues the us effort to prevent proliferation from the former soviet biological weapons complex is similar in many respects to its effort to prevent proliferation from the nuclear weapons complex in both cases the weapons complex suffers from degraded security systems that remain from the soviet era58 the degradation of the physical plant at the facilities lack of income for weapons scientists reported struggles between hardliners and reformers in former soviet states and the presumed desire of terrorists and hostile nationstates to obtain the weapons capabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs14 59 mixed jurisdiction is not an issue in kazakhstan or uzbekistan where the united states has negotiated implementing agreements directly with the governments of those statesremaining in both complexes however there are significant differences between the biological weapons and nuclear weapons complexes and these differences give rise to significant differences in us nonproliferation programs absence of us biological weapons complex one key difference between the nuclear and biological nonproliferation programs is the lack of us equivalent to the former soviet biological weapons complex the us bw program closed during the nixon administration whereas scientists in the us nuclear weapons complex were logical counterparts for former soviet nuclear scientists it has taken time to identify and recruit suitable american counterparts for bw scientists furthermore whereas sophisticated understanding of nuclear weapons technology was readily available to guide us efforts to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons from former soviet states us understanding of biological weapons technology was more limited through bw nonproliferation efforts in former soviet states the us has been learning about sovietrussian bw technology and many observers believe that this knowledge has enhanced us national security mixed jurisdiction when addressing concerns with russias nuclear weapons facilities and weapons complex the united states could work almost exclusively with russias ministry of defense or ministry of atomic affairs minatom in contrast many agencies in the soviet government shared jurisdiction over the soviet biological weapons complex in russia today the ministries of agriculture health industry science and technology defense and other agencies claim jurisdiction over various aspects of the bw complex in some cases the united states can develop projects with individual brpcs and individual scientists at the grassroots level without interacting with any russian government agency however mixed jurisdiction can complicate efforts to dismantle facilities or destroy weapons technology the united states must negotiate an implementing agreement with the government agencies that own and control specific facilities and technology before it can act directly to dismantle or destroy property this process is difficult to complete when more than one agency claims jurisdiction59 therefore biosafety biosecurity and dismantlement projects at brpcs are funded indirectly through the istc some argue that this is an inefficient mechanism for managing these kind of projects dualuse technology most of the technology required for develop ment and production of nuclear weapons is unique to the weapons complex but the technology associated with biological weapons is also used in medical research pharmaceutical production and public health work therefore according to some if the united states helps fund nonmilitary research using biological technologies it might risk unintentionally subsidizing bw programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs15 60 gaonsiad00138 61 correspondence with state department official 62 interview with state department officialseveral factors might mitigate the risk posed by the dualuse nature of biological weapons technology first before beginning cooperative projects with the united states brpcs must provide assurance that they will abstain from offensive research or proliferation activities60 second istcs tcu personnel audit most projects third us agencies require us participants to make onsite visits to brpcs to ensure that the projects are meeting their stated objectives in addition the national security council has mandated that all us projects involving former sovietrussian brpcs must be reviewed by the nonprolif eration interagency roundtable coordination of interagency efforts according to government officials the proliferation strategy policy coordinating committee or pcc which is chaired by national security council senior director provides the interagency oversight and policy implementation of all us nonproliferation assistance to the states of the former soviet union this committee has representatives from state defense energy and other concerned agencies this committee has several working groups or subcommittees that are designed to ensure daytoday coordination among programs in different agencies within this structure the nonproliferation interage ncy roundtable npir reports to the proliferation strategy subpcc on biochem proliferation for the past four years the npir has sought to coordinate all us government efforts to prevent bw proliferation from former soviet states the roundtable is chaired by representative of the state department and comprised of representatives of various agencies it reports directly to the national security council the roundtable helps the various agencies prevent duplication of efforts and seeks to ensure that together they address the appropriate priorities at monthly meetings members discuss and coordinate implementation issues such as travel to the fsu or guests arriving from the fsu when reviewing proposals for collaborative research projects the roundtable can reject or mandate revisions in proposals for projects that might reinforce or extend bw capabilities61 the nonproliferation interagency roundtable is adjusting its procedures to keep up with the increasing number of projects it plans to develop comprehensive database to facilitate systematic coordination and monitoring of projects62 measuring the results in april 2000 the general accounting office gao reported that collaborative research projects involving former bw scientists had helped to discourage scientists from cooperating with countries of proliferation concern and terrorist groups whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs16 63

than 30 former soviet biological weapons institutes63 gao also reported that about 1655 former employees of the sovietrussian bw program received funding through the istc in 1999 since that time us biological nonproliferation efforts have expanded as confidence in their effectiveness has grown furthermore these cooperative projects provide the united states with continuous workinglevel access to russias bw sites some us participants state that this cooperation allows for better verification than 2day inspection visits because cooperation involves longterm routine interaction64 some observers contend that the united states benefits from these efforts in other ways besides nonproliferation the research can also address nonweapons related concerns for example using strain of brucellosis from their collection of pathogens former soviet weapons scientists are prepared to help the united states produce more effective vaccine for bison in yellowstone park65 as of march 2002 more than 40 brpcs throughout the former soviet union have engaged in cooperative projects with the united states these projects have helped the united states assess the extent to which these facilities were involved in the development and production of biological weapons capabilities according to state department officials approximately 30 of these were deeply involved in the sovietrussian biological weapons program and therefore are considered to pose significant risk for contributing to proliferation the others were less integrated into the sovietrussian bw complex and therefore pose less of proliferation risk some known brpcs do not participate in us programs others such as the state research center for virology and biotechnology vector in novosibirsk russia and the state research center for applied microbiology srcam in obolensk participate in multiple projects the russian ministry of defense has denied the united states access to four brpcs under its jurisdiction66 furthermore as cooperation has expanded the united states has discovered additional brpcs that once participated in the sovietrussian bw programs some view the interpersonal relationships built between us participants in these efforts and former soviet weapons scientists as significant part of these efforts in addition to cooperating on projects us participants and their counterparts in former soviet states share meals get to know one anothers families and spend leisure time together furthermore some argue that contact with us companies ngos and government agencies has decreased the social and institutional isolationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs17 67 interview with us contractor and with several officials of us government agencies 68 the senate passed s1803 by voice vote on december 20 2001 and the bill was referred to the house committee on international relations as of january 23 2002 69 us central intelligence agency unclassified report to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions 1 january through 30 june 2001 january 2002 the russian foreign ministry continuedof russias biological weapons scientists several people involved in work with former bw institutes and scientists have expressed the view that these interpersonal and institutional relationships are profoundly affecting the decisions weapons scientists are making about how to use their expertise67 issues for congress the security assistance act of 2001 the security assistance act of 2001 s1803 has several sections that are relevant to us policy regarding bw capabilities in former soviet states68 the following discussi on is based on senate action only section 304 entitled international nonproliferation export control training gives the president authority to provide education and training to foreign personnel to enhance their ability to implement export controls that might contribute to nonproli feration activities section 305 extends the soviet scientists immigration act of 1992 and increases the number of scientists that can be relocated under that act from 750 to 950 some people advocate inviting former weapons scientists to come to the united states to work as way of preventing proliferation of weapons expertise they argue that the us economy and us biodefense efforts would benefit from the expertise of these scientists some who oppose this approach argue that it would cost less money to employ scientist in former soviet state than in the united state some also argue that it is in the us national interest to invest in the science and technology sector of former soviet states and support their transitions to market economies the russian federation debt reduction for nonproliferation act subtitle b of the security assistance act of 2001 the russian federation debt reduction for nonproliferation act of 2001 is designed to encourage russia to increase its own budget allocations for nonproliferation programs russia and other former soviet states have supported bw nonproliferation efforts in the past by providing infrastructure staff and funding to organizations such as the istc and stcu they also contribute to cooperative projects by providing funding or inkind resources such as equipment and utilities to the brpcs on the other hand many experts believe that russia and the other former soviet states have sometimes pursued activities that are inconsistent with us nonproliferation goals for example recent cia report charged that during the first half of 2001 russian entities remained significant source of dualuse biotechnology chemicals production technology and equipment for iran69 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs18 69continued disputed the charge stating that russia strictly meets its international obligations to control the export of sensitive trade and technology bellaby mara d russia rips cia report on technology associated press february 7 2002 70 leonard spector emphasized the need for greater interagency coordination of nonproliferation programs in general however speaking of bio weapons he said through wellcoordinated interagency program to create nondefense employment opportunities for former soviet bw scientists the clinton administration successfully engaged number of former soviet bw sites in russia kazakhstan and uzbekistan senate committee on government affairs november 14 2001the russian federation debt reduction for nonproliferation act grants the president the authority to reduce russias soviet era debt to the united states through variety of mechanisms if russia uses the funds that would have been applied to debt service for projects designed to reduce the risk of proliferation from russias nuclear chemical or biological weapons complexes in further effort to shape russias policies on nonproliferation the legislation states that the president cannot implement the debt for nonproliferation swap until russia makes material progress in stemming the flow of sensitive goods technologies material and know how related to the design development and production of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism supporters of this legislation argue that russias debt creates such burden to the state that russia would be unlikely or unable to devote its own funds to nonproliferation projects while servicing its debt furthermore they argue that this legislation might provide russia with an incentive to place higher priority on nonproliferation because it could expect relief from some of its debt others however note that the united states does not hold much of russias debt so any effort to link nonproliferation with debt relief would have to win the support of other nations such as germany who hold larger portion of the debt the nonproliferation assistance coordination act of 2001 the nonproliferation assistance coordination act of 2001 was introduced in late 2001 and incorporated into the security assistance act of 2001 as subtitle c it seeks to address congressional concerns about interagency coordination of all us nonproliferation efforts in the former soviet states it establishes an interagency committee that will monitor us nonproliferation efforts in the former soviet union and coordinate us policy with respect to the implementation of those efforts when considering this legislation the international security proliferation and federal services subcommittee of the senate government affairs committee heard testimony on november 14 2001 that emphasized the potential benefits of improved coordination of nuclear nonproliferation programs in general in contrast some experts stated that interagency efforts to prevent proliferation of biological weapons were wellcoo rdinated70 although few experts have focused on the implementation of the biological weapons programs most who do tend to agree with this assessment the general accounting office reviewed the programs in 2000 and the bushhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs19 71 white house

identified coordination among them as problem funding congress and the bush administration have demonstrated continued and growing support for us efforts to prevent proliferation of biological weapons from former soviet states upon completing detailed review of us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to russia and the other former soviet states the bush administration identified the redirection of biotechnical scientists program as one of four programs to be expanded71 in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 congress approved the presidents request for 17 million for dods efforts in biological weapons proliferati on prevention in russia72 in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill passed after the september 11 attacks congress added another 30 million for the purpose of supporting expansion of the biological weapons redirect and international science and technology centers programs to prevent former soviet biological weapons experts from emigrating to proliferant states and to reconfigure former soviet biological weapons production facilities for peaceful uses73 furthermore in its 2000 report on the bw nonproliferation programs published before the anthrax attacks of october 2001 the gao estimated that the united states would spend around 220 million on bw nonproliferation between 2000 and 2004 most experts agree that this amount may increase now that attention has focused more sharply on the threat of biological weapons proliferation from russia some experts argue that the united states should increase its efforts to stem proliferation from the former soviet union in january 2001 panel headed by lloyd cutler and former senator howard baker found that current nonproliferation programs in the department of energy the department of defense and related agencies have achieved impressive results thus far but their limited mandate and funding fall short of what is required to address adequately the threat74 some also point out that opportunities to redirect former bw scientists to secure dangerous pathogens and to dismantle bw equipment continue to arise as us access to the former sovietrussian bw complex expands furthermore according to several us government officials recent increases in funding for existing programs while welcome has been surpassed by an increasing number of viable project proposals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs20 75 it became clear that any meaningful result required more extended and creative kind of engagement civilian research and development foundation crdf 19982000 program report p 2alternatives for the future us assistance to russias bw program has sought to support the transformation of the sovietrussian bw complex into set of consolidated safe secure and essentially transparent institutions many experts continue to support this objective but now believe that it will take longterm investment rather than short term crisis interventi on75 the number of brpcs known to have been part of the sovietrussian bw infrastructure continues to increase furthermore us experts are debating the best longterm strategies for preventing bw proliferation from former soviet states many american participants in us bw nonproliferation efforts consider that longterm nonproliferation goals might be achieved without sustaining usfunded biosecurity and collaborative research projects for the remaining lifetimes of former bw scientists but some also contend that premature disengagement from brpcs that continue to pose proliferation risk is not acceptable in recent months us government agencies and ngos involved in these efforts have intensified their focus on moving brpcs towards consolidation and self sustainability which many believe is the best way to maximize the nonproliferation benefits that can be achieved by us efforts some overall approaches include drawing new generation of scientists into the brpcs and preparing brpcs for external investment experts argue that separate strategy for disengagement will have to be developed for each brpc because each one poses unique problems which require unique solutions some analysts argue that the united states should not help the brpcs become selfsustaining organizations they argue that market forces will eliminate the brpcs in former soviet states because they cannot compete with other biotechnical research and production centers throughout the world others however counter that without international intervention market forces might unite former weapons scientists with proliferating states and substate groups some observers consider the biological weapons complex in former soviet states to be too isolated and underfunded to safely dismantle itself without us investment such observers contend that the goal is not so much to make the brpcs competitive with other brpcs throughout the world as it is for the united states to successfully compete with proliferating groups and nation states for the bw capabilities that exist at these brpcshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31368crs21 table 1 us programs to assist russia with biological weapons nonproliferation agency program program
