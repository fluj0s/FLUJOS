first year in the presidency were sufficiently unusual that they are not included in the study franklin d roosevelt franklin d roosevelt was inaugurated on march 4 1933 carrying 42 states in his election he received 472 electoral votes compared to 59 votes for herbert hoover on march 5 fdr called the new 73rd congress into special session and set march 9 as the date for its convening roosevelts party commanded majorities of 6036 in the senate and 310122 in the house adjourning on june 15 1933 the first session of the 73rd congress lasted 99 days the nation had been in the grip of the great depression for more than three years when fdr took the presidential oath undoubtedly both roosevelt and congress well understood that relief and recovery for the populace was their primary and urgent task when his proclamation calling congress into special session was issued however purpose for the meeting was specifically indicated or even alluded to generally1 by his own admission his immediate desire was to address the crisis of failing banks but once congress was in session fdr decided to continue the assembly for as long as it suited the mutual purposes of the two branches2 roosevelt reportedly had rough drafts of two presidential proclamations prior to his arrival in washington one called for special session of congress and the other temporarily closed the nations

prepared when congress convened the house had printed copies of the measure and had to rely upon the speaker reading from draft text after 38 minutes of debate the house passed the bill the senate gave approval early in the evening and an hour later the president signed the emergency banking act into law5 simultaneously fdr relying upon the new banking statute6 issued new proclamation continuing his earlier bank holiday declaration7 the spirit of cooperation between the president and congress was established roosevelt planned close and consistent cooperation with congress by working through the regular party leaders both houses were organized to his liking8 moreover he formed crucially important working relationship with representative sam rayburn dtx the chairman of the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce to which much new deal reform legislation was referred during the first session of the 73rd congress rayburn became fdrs special leader in the house and would become speaker seven years later9 recounting the hundred days experience columbia university economist rexford g tugwell one of roosevelts close advisers and member of his pre presidential brains trust commented that at the opening of the 73rd congress fdr realized that for the moment the congress would deny him nothing in view of the plight of the country 10 yet as historian arthur m schlesinger jr has observed the national legislature at this time contained strong independentminded and intelligent men and on occasions itself assumed the legislative initiative11 nonetheless during the hundred days fdr led the executive branch congress and not without significance the electorate congress and the country writes schlesinger were subjected to presidential barrage of ideas and programs unlike anything known to american history12 in approximately three months time of continuous congressional session franklin roosevelt sent fifteen messages to congress guided fifteen major

extraordinary series of reforms in the nations history14 the experience also established in another historians view that the president was the unifying force in lawmaking15 the chief executive was chief legislator agreed political scientist james macgregor burns it was only at the level of the presidential office that party interests the crisscrossing legislative blocs and the bustling bureaucrats were given some measure of integration in meeting national problems16 finally after close analysis of fdrs legislative leadership during his first year as president political scientist sylvia snowiss concluded that the hundred days remains one of the most productive congressional sessions in american history noting the president maintained an extraordinary degree of control and direction over the substance of the program she attributed his success in this regard to picking up crossparty support where available threatening veto in cases where sufficient support was unattainable and compromise considered unacceptable and compromising adroitly when necessary and feasible17 dwight d eisenhower dwight d eisenhower was inaugurated on january 20 1953 carrying 39 states in his election he received 442 electoral votes compared to 89 for adlai stevenson eisenhowers party captured both congressional chambers with majorities of 48471 the minority included one independent in the senate and 221212 in the house the first session of the 83rd congress began on january 3 1953 and adjourned on august 3 having lasted for 213 days the nation found itself faced with lingering war in korea that had gone to stalemate in 1952 and accompanying economic jitters at home charges of corruption and internal communist subversion were leveled at the departing truman administration which some viewed as having perpetuated fdrs control of the white house to total of 20 years these factors plus the appeal of popular war hero as the opposition candidate fostered desire for change within the electorate eisenhower subsequently received the largest popular vote for winning president 13 ibid p 21 14 leuchtenburg franklin d roosevelt and the new deal p 61 15 edgar

under his partys control only at the outset of his administration during its first two years however even the situation in 1953 was not particularly promising by eisenhowers own admission we were obligated to keep pledges i had made in the campaign and to follow through on the recommendations submitted in my state of the union message on the 2nd of february18 this was the basis of his legislative program for his first year as president eisenhower had beaten his partys senate leader robert taft roh for the presidential nomination which had left some bitter feelings furthermore many in his partys congressional leadership were far more conservative than he and due to the long tenure of presidents roosevelt and truman had little familiarity with either the techniques or the need of cooperating with the executive when of common partisanship19 finally as he later recorded in his memoirs he was aware of the precarious hold his party had on the legislature when the eightythird congress assembled on january 3 1953 for its first session the republicans had majority of only eleven votes in the house 221 republicans 210 democrats one independent three of the 435 seats were vacant shift of six republican votes on an issue could cause the democrats if they held solid to prevail in the senate the republican margin consisted of just one man fortyeight republicans assembled on one side of the aisle fortyseven democrats on the other one independent former republican and future democrat wayne morse of oregon would vote with the republicans on few issues20 fortunately for eisenhower he quickly reached cooperative working arrangement with taft as well as most of his partys other congressional leaders furthermore he established white house office of congressional liaisonthe first president to do so formallyunder the direction of his old friend general wilton b persons master of diplomacy and compromise whose staff proved adept at the delicate task of exerting influence without bruising egos on capitol hill21 as for his own tactics eisenhower eschewed public confrontation in favor of shrewd lobbying private negotiation and when necessary behindthescenes pressure22 the president not always happily built voting blocs for his proposals with the result that during 1953 the democrats were needed less than fiftyeight times to succor the administration23

legislative accomplishments as being in many respects very gratifying25 john f kennedy john f kennedy was inaugurated on january 20 1961 carrying 22 states in his election he received 303 electoral votes compared to 219 for richard m nixon kennedys party maintained its hold on both congressional chambers with majorities of 6535 in the senate and 262174 in the house the first session of the 87th congress convened on january 3 1961 and adjourned on september 27 having lasted for 268 days the newly approved 22nd amendment to the constitution left eisenhower ineligible to seek third presidential term in 1960 as result eisenhowers vice president richard m nixon was successful in capturing the mantle as candidate to succeed the incumbent his opponent jack kennedy was secondterm senator from massachusetts according to theodore h white the memorialist of the presidential campaign 1960 was above all year which found americans emersed in vague shapeless unsettling undefinable national concern about their identity26 in this atmosphere kennedy called for new and strong presidential leadership to reverse the nations declining prestige abroad and to reinvigorate the lagging economy at home nixon vigorously defended the record of the eisenhower administration and lauded it as something to build on white offers the following comment on the outcome of the contest in his election john f kennedy was able to persuade enough americans that their vague concerns were justified enough to require change in leadership that might arrest those trends carrying america irresistibly to less noble ends than those for which men believed their fathers had come to this country he could not define nor did he try to define what measures he would take to arrest the disturbing drift that might make other nations greater than america nor did he define those sacrifices that his cheering crowds offered to accept dwight d eisenhower can be seen historically as the man elected to end the korean war which he did franklin d roosevelt can be seen historically as man elected to reorganize and refresh the american economy in the year of its worst collapse these were vivid tangible crises in which

countenance was still unclear if there were any mandate in the election of 1960 it was that the new president prepare for such an obscure crisis 27 kennedy set about responding to the crises he thought were of concern to the american people sending congress 14 separate messages calling for new legislation during his first 10 weeks in office more would follow by the end of the year 33 out of 53 of his major recommendations had received congressional approval but few important presidential measures had been weakened or blocked28 reviewing the year congressional quarterly generally characterized the legislative legacy as impressive in quality as well as quantity however it was also found that this first encounter between democratic president and congress was less than smashing success and by adjournment it was apparent that mr kennedy would face an uphill struggle in 196229 writing for the new republic helen fuller thought kennedy compared with his predecessor and the 86th congress worked miracles with the first session of the 87th in the judgment of many fairminded observers however she pointed out the new presidents legislative victories were the result of considerable strategic effort and coalition building which took its toll the democratic wheels were slowing down when the first session adjourned she wrote thereafter compared with what president kennedy asked for it and what the country needed the record of the 87th congress was far from good30 similar views had been expressed earlier by sidney hyman writing for the progressive magazine31 finally correspondent carroll kilpatrick writing from the perspective of the final year of the kennedy administration was much more critical and saw the chief executive giving ground making important concessions and obtaining far less than half loaf on many measures enacted during 1961 which all represented retreat on the presidents part32 27 ibid p 378 28 james n giglio the presidency of john f

office aboard air force one on november 22 1963 following the assassination of president kennedy earlier the same day at the time johnsons party held sizeable majorities in both the senate and the house he was subsequently elected and inaugurated to full term on january 20 1965 carrying 44 states in his election he received 486 electoral votes compared to 52 votes for barry goldwater johnsons party captured both congressional chambers with majorities of 6832 in the senate and 295140 in the house the first session of the 89th congress began on january 4 1965 and adjourned on october 23 1965 having lasted 293 days the substantial majorities in both chambers were the largest in the 20th century for presidents party except for fdrs early presidency during the 73rd through 75th congresses this advantage enabled lbj to take bold initiatives in new or controversial public policy areas while withstanding possible sizable defection of members of his own party on any one vote johnson had remarkable success with congress in passing major legislation during 1964 through 1965 he was probably surpassed in this regard only by fdr among presidents of the 20th century one study for instance found that nearly 88 of the congressional votes where johnson took clear stand were approved in 1964 his first full year in office following president kennedys assassination in 1965 following his election victory johnsons approval rate increased to 93 these totals far exceed those of johnsons remaining years in the white house as well as presidents kennedy and jimmy carter whose party also controlled both houses of congress33 more important than these quantitative measures however was the qualitative dimension of johnsons legislative initiatives the breadth of their impact on society significance for expanding federal government responsibilities and powers and innovative character were reflected in the war on poverty and the multifaceted great society programs these were designed to combat poverty and inequities among the poor handicapped and underprivileged and to provide direction for the expanding urban areas lbjs proposals also extended to markedly expanding space and transportation programs and to protecting and enhancing the environment specific pieces of major legislation included in 1964 the civil rights act urban mass transportation act economic opportunity

development act and several new conservation and environmental statutes34 johnsons list of achievements in 1965 columnist tom wicker observed that august already read better than the legislative achievements of most twoterm presidents wicker suggested that it would be necessary to go all the way back to woodrow wilsons first year to find congressional session of equal importance35 historian vaughn david bornet credited johnsons early success in large part to his ability to first develop program of legislation then to forge the necessary coalitions to carry the bills and finally to perfect the timing that would be crucial to pacing consistent achievement lyndon johnson according to bornet used his enormous knowledge of the congressional mind to work out practical rewards and punishmentsif those are the right words and his were the decisions that built the congressional liaison staff into such potent force he excelled at knowing the ones in congress who could move bills or stop them and the ones who would follow along36 similarly political scientist mark peterson attributed johnson legislative achievements to knowing not to squander opportunities lbj was the quintessential politician political enthusiast an indefatigable perhaps fanatical player of the game johnson wanted to have things accomplished by what appeared to be consensus and was the most knowledgeable and persuasive member of the congressional liaison team37 there is johnson told biographer doris kerns but one way for president to deal with congress and that is continuously incessantly and without interruption if its going to work the relationship between the president and the congress has got to be almost incestuous president johnson continued has got to know them better than they know themselves and then on the basis of this knowledge hes got to build system that stretches from cradle to the 34 congressional quarterly congressional quarterly almanac 88th cong

at the outset others have suggested was to establish an image in congress as with the public of presidential mastery over congress39 number of other forces also contributed to lyndon johnsons early legislative accomplishments part of the success was due to the two beginnings of his administration the first occurred on november 22 1963 when he succeeded to the presidency upon john f kennedys assassination the second occurred year later when lbj was elected president by landslide proportions kennedy importantly had already helped to pave the way for the enactment of civil rights and social welfare legislation not only by promoting the policies themselves but also by seeking reform of the house committee on rules which had been roadblock to such legislation in the past johnson capitalized on these organizational changes as well as on his predecessors commitment to such causes some of the johnson initiatives moreover harkened to the truman administration which for instance had raised the prospect of the government financing health care for the elderly and poor other proposals such as in space exploration and transportation had precursors in the eisenhower administration still others especially in civil rights had bases of support in all three previous presidencies richard m nixon richard m nixon was inaugurated on january 20 1969 carrying 32 states in his election nixon received 301 electoral votes compared to 191 for hubert humphrey and one vote for independent george wallace the democratic party retained control of the senate with majority of 5743 and the house by 245188 majority the first session of the 91st congress convened on january 3 1969 and adjourned on december 23 1969 having lasted 355 days when richard nixon became president in 1969 he was the first president in over one hundred years since zachary taylor in 1849 the last of the whig presidents to face opposition majorities in both houses of congress at the start of his term40 he had

senator robert f kennedy the frontrunner for the democratic party presidential nomination at the time and martin luther king jr whose murder sparked riots in several major metropolitan areas given these conditions the nixon administration was apparently reluctant to invest its scarce political capital in large number of legislative initiatives particularly controversial and innovative ones instead it focused on relatively few priority items along with judicial nominations throughout 1969 nixon had difficulty establishing effective liaison with congress his legislative efforts were complicated by the fact that at times he had trouble keeping members of his own party in line particularly in the senate republicans opposed him on number of issues at the time congressional quarterly reported that the main issue separating the white house and congress was national priorities moderates and liberals on capitol hill wanted to spend less for defense and more on education health and pollution control than the president had requested41 as consequence richard nixons record with congress during his first year was mixed congressional quarterly found that his success rate on congressional votes where the president took clear stand was 74a rate that was lower than his three immediate predecessors whose party controlled congress in their first years lyndon b johnson 88 in 1964 his first full year after assuming the presidency and 93 in 1965 the year after his election victory john f kennedy 81 in 1961 and dwight d eisenhower 89 in 195342 the first session of the 91st congress the sixth longest in history adjourned with the lowest legislative output in 36 years43 despite meeting for 355 days in 1969 congress approved only 190 bills all of which the president signed this total was the lowest since 1933 when congress approved 93 bills but did so during much shorter session of only 100 days part of the reason for the low amount of legislation in 1969 was the nixon administrations delay in sending its program to capitol hill with many of the proposals not emerging until summer another part of the explanation was congresss slowness in acting on nixons proposals by comparison to its response to lyndon johnsons measures notwithstanding the relatively low productivity rate some major legislative efforts proved successful high priorities for the nixon administration were continuation of its antiballistic missile deployment program approval of the draft lottery system and retention of its plan to ensure minority hiring by contractors on 41 history

congress also enacted sweeping tax reform bill which was much more extensive than what the administration had requested initially44 supreme court vacancies provided president nixon with two appointment opportunities the first to appoint successor to the retiring earl warren as chief justice found somewhat surprisingly easy path through the senate in light of the intense controversy surrounding lyndon johnsons earlier attempt to fill the position by elevating associate justice abe fortas the committee on the judiciary unanimously reported the nomination of warren burger and the senate confirmed it on 743 rollcall vote the second was to replace associate justice fortas who had resigned after criticisms of his extrajudicial behavior and threats of impeachment conflict of interest charges however were raised against president nixons nominee clement haynesworth and the senate rejected the nomination on 5545 rollcall vote45 several authors commenting on nixons relationship with congress have argued that much of the opposition he faced on capitol hill could have been avoided rowland evans jr and robert d novak in their book nixon in the white house the frustration of power contend that despite his own four years in the house of representatives two in the senate and eight years as the senates presiding officer nixon knew remarkably little about the workings of congress and cared less furthermore he had more stomach for facetoface confrontations with members of congress than for those with anyone else46 political scientist mark peterson felt the nixon administrations slowness in assembling the components of its first series of domestic legislative initiatives meant that it forfeited the benefits to be derived from swift action at the beginning of the term peterson also pointed out that critics of nixon charged that he was often unwilling to engage in the usual processes of bargaining associated with domestic politics his avoidance of compromise with opponents on the hill was seen by peterson as reflection of nixons profound dislike of congress sentiment shared by some of his staff from the beginning of his administration nixon chose to pursue confrontational relationship with an institution he felt was unlikely to heed his domestic agenda limited though it was47 michael genovese concurs with the opinion that nixon was never really man of the congress he was never congressional insider didnt spend very many years in either chamber and was never legislative tactician by not producing legislative agenda early and hitting the ground running and attempting to take advantage of the opportunity afforded new presidents in the honeymoon period nixon hit the ground stumbling and was never able to recover the slim opportunity

transition as were kennedy and johnson in fact nixons post election domestic planning was somewhat haphazard he preferred instead to concentrate his energies on foreign policy nixon was not interested in the domestic agenda and did not participate in the early decisions his first hundred days may also have reflected deliberate decision to slow down the domestic process what nixon apparently sought to do was strike balance between those who wanted immediate action and those who cautioned restraint49 jimmy carter jimmy carter was inaugurated on january 20 1977 carrying 23 states in his election he received 297 electoral votes compared to 240 for gerald r ford carters party retained control of the senate with 6238 majority and the house by 289146 majority the first session of the 95th congress convened on january 4 1977 and adjourned on december 15 1977 having lasted 346 days although he defeated an incumbent president carter became chief executive by margin of less than two million votes out of 80 million cast with most of his partys house candidates winning larger share of the popular vote consequently carter was unable to claim mandate for any particular policy initiatives or to take full advantage of the large democratic majorities in both houses of congress he has come to be regarded by most students of the presidency as relatively weak legislative leader who failed to capitalize on certain political advantages to develop clear consistent and assertive legislative agenda illustrative of this view political scientist charles jones has characterized the carter term as the trusteeship presidency jones found that president carter demonstrated limited knowledge about the legislative branch considered the necessity of coalition building and policy compromise unnatural if not unacceptable adopted an antipolitical attitude and failed to surround himself with experienced staff in terms of legislative relations carter himself had federal government service his previous governmental experience being state senator and the governor of georgia50 carter recognized that he reached the white house as an outsider in the first presidential election since

same time won larger share of the popular vote than their nominal party leader they averaged 562 percent of the total poll and led their president by between 4 and 9 percentage points in every region of the country52 similarly mark peterson suggests that the election denied carter clear mandate and the influence of congressional coattails53 the result according to jimmy carters own estimate was brief one week honeymoon with congress54 as an indication of the unharmonious marriage between congress and the president carters success rate on congressional votes where he took clear stand was only 754 in 1977 his first year in office by comparison other recent democratic presidents whose party also controlled both chambers of congress had higher scores early in their administrations55 carter in the opinion of tinsley yarbrough was not only washington outsider but also outside the mainstream of his own political party although his approach appealed to voters liberal democrats in the congress were alarmed that he was rejecting basic democratic positions and embracing conservative causes56 dom bonafede of the national journal writing in november 1977 identified several key reasons for carters troubles with the first session of the 95th congress these included faulty leadership at both ends of pennsylvania avenue ineptness by administration lobbyists inexperience by the carter group rejuvenated congress bent on maintaining its position visavis the white house determination to deflate president who ran against washington an overloaded white house legislative agenda tendency by the

camaraderie that is almost indigenous to congress58 member of carters white house staff has suggested that one of their greatest problems during 1977 was the absence of legislative strategy every bill seemed to receive equal billing and congress had clue to what the administration wanted most59 jimmy carter did however have some notable legislative achievements in 1977 congress agreed to his proposal to establish new department of energy and with some substantial modifications to several environmental protection laws including the clear air act amendments the clean water act and the surface mining control and reclamation act carter was also successful in his housing and urban aid plans with passage of the housing and urban development act of 1977 other legislation increased the minimum wage appreciably from 230 to 335 an hour and cut taxes substantially also at his request presidential reorganization authority which had expired four years earlier was restored60 ronald reagan ronald reagan was inaugurated on january 20 1981 carrying 44 states in his election reagan received 489 electoral votes compared to 49 votes for jimmy carter and votes for independent john anderson reagans party gained control of the senate with majority of 5347 while the democrats retained control of the house with 242192 seats the first session of the 97th congress convened on january 5 1981 and adjourned on december 16 1981 having lasted 347 days reagan entered office with the advantage as political scientist mark peterson points out of having defeated an incumbent president and at the same time having helped to elect many of his fellow partisans to congress reagan was the first republican occupant of the white house since the initial term of dwight eisenhower to benefit from his partys control of at least one house of congress understandably the new republican majority in the senate was eager to use its power to advance the interests of its standardbearer on the other side of the capitol the republican minority had gained 33 seats and was able to join with conservative democrats to give reagan working philosophical majority in the house of representatives as well as

election since 1920 the senate results were even more stunning however since one had predicted such an occurrence charles jones saw the 1980 presidential and congressional elections as representing package deal the reagan victory was decisive there seemed to be nontrivial coattail effects and the policy message was unambiguous even the democrats and liberals detected conservative tide in the nation62 liberal columnist anthony lewis agreed that the 1980 election reflected profound and general turn to conservatism in this country63 there was professor jones reasoned receptive mood for giving the president chance even though to do so was to invite dramatic change remarkably this attitude even carried forward to the partisan speaker of the house of representatives thomas p oneill jr of massachusetts64 although the democratic party remained in the majority in the house it had lost 33 seats in the 1980 election key portion of ronald reagans initial success with congress particularly on innovative or controversial measures as congressional quarterly stressed came from socalled boll weevils mostly southern democrats who endorsed reagans stands their votes were especially important for the defense buildup and supplyside economics programs65 ronald reagans dealings with congress during his first year in office has been likened to fdrs hundred days66 an important factor in his legislative successes in 1981 political scientist nelson w polsby has suggested was that he took pains to court rather than ignore congress as jimmy carter had done four years

has been described as great personal triumph for reagan congressional approval of his plans was due largely to his own efforts and strength reagan himself was the administrations best lobbyist70 jones credited president reagan with playing the central role in his personal triumph which was also greatly assisted by an extraordinarily effective white house political operation strategy was developed and executed for taking advantage of the favorable political conditions71 during his first year he focused attention on certain issues and policies investing his political capital in these items and not spending it on others for instance on such social issues as prayer in the public schools president reagan in the words of the british scholar nigel bowles successfully fused policy prescription with politics his first few months in office marked sudden surge of presidential leadership of congress and country which two years earlier had seemed an impossibility the result was burst of policy change and political success carefully planned and executed which has few parallels in the history of the modern presidency72 reagans success according to bowles resulted from an imaginative legislative strategy supplemented by his own remarkable effective lobbying and the support of an outstanding legislative liaison staff73 by the end of his first year in office others have suggested he had shown that an elderly laidback chief executive could through combination of circumstances and activitiesan apparent electoral mandate the swift initiation of new legislative programme partisan and ideological majorities in congress and the adept massage of public opinioneffect radical change in public policy74 michael j malbin in an august 1981 national journal article attributed reagans

of participating lawmakers and received particularly high grades for his effectiveness in dealing with capitol hill some 93 percent of the respondents rated him very effective with congress reagans most potent asset according to an overwhelming majority of lawmakers responding was his ability to marshal public support for his program76 george h w bush george h w bush was inaugurated on january 20 1989 carrying 40 states in his election he received 426 electoral votes compared to 111 votes for michael dukakis the 101st congress which counted small losses by the presidents party had opposition majorities of 5545 in the senate and 260175 in the house it convened for its first session on january 3 1989 and adjourned on november 22 having lasted 324 days serving eight years as ronald reagans vice president george bush was the presidents faithful assistant and heirthe first chief executive to succeed predecessor of his own party since 1928 and the first sitting vice president to be elected in his own right since 1836 benefitting from both the popularity and the active help of president reagan in his campaign bush promised more of the peace widespread prosperity and nationalism that the reagan administration had brought to the country in electoral triumph he quickly eliminated his opponents early lead and eventually swept the south the rocky mountain jurisdictions the farm belt and every megastate except new york nonetheless he could not significantly advance his partys political fortunes in congress there was pressing urgency for the new president to make great changes in the personnel or policies of his predecessor still he had to establish his own administration and continue if not expand the primary programs of the reagan regime the result was indecisiveness about how to proceed as congressional quarterly noted bush in his first year did not bring the kind of bold agenda and sense of fresh start that usually makes congress more compliant to new presidents will77 relations with congress began cordially with gestures of courtesy and allusions to bipartisan cooperation gradually the perception developed in congress that because the president was unsure about what he wanted he had an uncertain legislative agenda as congressional quarterly commented shortly before the first 75 michael j malbin house democratic reforms

health insurance to home loan ceilings the bush administration has either sent mixed signals about its aims or taken positions that leave so much room for interpretation that many are unsure what the president wants78 part of the presidents problems with congress may have stemmed from what some legislators in his own party perceived to be an inexperienced congressional liaison staff considered out of the loop on important white house decisions this condition served to explain for some why for example the presidents chief of staff and the administrator of the environmental protection agency sent congress contradictory messages concerning pending legislation on cleanburning fuels79 others attributed the problem to the reagan legacy and political expediency the failure of the bush administration to develop any grand overview or national blueprint wrote conservative columnist kevin phillips in october 1989 has been predictable consequence not just of george bushs own compromiseoriented personality but of the inevitable restraints on vice president following several terms of his own party in the white house such presidents he contended do not seek to identify national problems because in doing so they would largely be identifying their own partys failings80 in the first two months of 1990 with the second session of the 101st congress underway several impressionistic assessments of the presidents first year were offered in the pages of fortune magazine he received report card average of b with high mark in foreign policy and an incomplete in budget balancing rather than hitting the ground running bush walkedand ended up turning in fairly strong performance it was thought81 contrastingly the economist editorialized that president bush proposes little and opposes much he was in its assessment president who spends his time avoiding domestic entanglements82 business week contended that 1989 was the kind of first year presidents dream of but rarely achieve while congressional relations were not the only basis for this view the magazine did say that president bush humbled democratic 78 janet hook and chuck alston mixed signals agenda gap

1989 legislative record congressional quarterly concluded that george bush fared worse in congress than any other firstyear president elected in the postwar era in its annual study of voting patterns cq found that bush won only 63 percent of the roll calls on which he took an unambiguous position in 1989 moreover it was noted that bush came to office with limited agenda not blueprint to transform the work of his predecessor so if congress didnt give him much observed cq it was in part because he asked for little84 finally political scientist james pfiffner saw the presidents approach to congress in his first year as being one of compromise not confrontation saying the bush presidency in its first year might be characterized as one of consolidation seeking new balance not confrontation and change consolidation was necessary for three reasons the reagan revolution had worked itself out the continuing huge deficits precluded large scale new programs and the continued democratic control of congress made compromise part of the price of governing85 agreeing with this overview political scientist barbara sinclair wrote facing congress firmly in the control of the opposition party unable credibly to claim policy mandate and constrained by the big deficit bush proposed modest legislative agenda appealing to bipartisanship and constructive compromise the president sought to build bridges to congress particularly the democratic leaders for both sides the best strategy for dealing with the other was cooperation and compromise86 in sum although compromise was the preferred strategy for bush and for congressional democrats it was dictated more by limited resources than by broadranging coincidence of interests consequently deviations from the strategy of compromise were frequent tensions between the imperative to compromise in order to enact legislationto get billand incentives to defect from that strategy characterized relations between

convened its first session on january 5 1993 and adjourned on november 26 having lasted 326 days bill clinton came to the presidency from the governorship of arkansas with federal experience and with

was elected state attorney general in 1977 and became governor in 1979 defeated for reelection in 1980 he returned to the governorship in 1982 and continued to hold the office until his presidential victory clinton biographer david maraniss has written that the new president in the activist tradition of fdr intended to enact an economic package within the first three months then at the end of his hundredday dash he planned to unveil universal health insurance plan that could define his presidency and assure his place in history however this as maraniss explains did not occur the debate over the economic package dragged on through spring 1993 into summer the health care proposal the responsibility of task force chaired by first lady hillary clinton was not ready as promised at the beginning of may and even if the completed drafting of health care legislation had been completed the president and his aides had decided to postpone its introduction starting with clintons first day in office the traditional honeymoon that new presidents usually receive from the press and the public was virtually absent as central issues of public policy were subsumed by minor tempests88 the first of these minor tempests occurred with clintons nominee to the position of attorney general connecticut lawyer zoe baird was withdrawn from consideration on the presidents second day in office after it was disclosed that she and her husband had failed to pay taxes for peruvian couple they had hired as household help clintons white house staff had considered the matter insignificant and not something to thwart the nomination however subsequent public protest to the white house and congress proved otherwise the controversy threatened to recur in early february when it was reported that us district court judge kimba m wood was the new choice for attorney general president clinton quickly indicated that decision on nominee had been made and the judge withdrew her name from consideration after it was disclosed that her baby sitter had been an illegal alien during 88 david maraniss william j clinton in henry f graff ed the presidents reference history 2nd edition new york charles

staff work on behalf of the new president but also were embarrassing for him in view of his campaign pledge that his administration would enforce higher ethical standards than its predecessors another controversy that quickly exploded upon the presidents policy agenda and preoccupied his attention was the status of homosexuals in the armed forces during the election campaign candidate clinton made secret of his plan to lift the existing ban on homosexuals serving in the military but in contest dominated largely by concern about the future of the national economy the issue of gays serving in the armed forces received little attention as presidentelect clinton was solidly on record in favor of controversial policy that had not been explored or debated in the political arena moreover the issue exposed deep division between commander in chief who had never served in the armed forces and the military establishment having run as centrist democrat clinton was now entering the white house advocating one of his partys most liberal policy positions immediately embattled over the issue with congressional conservatives from both political parties president clinton announced compromise at the end of january sixmonth delay in lifting the ban suspension of actions against gay personnel excepting cases of improper conduct and review of the ban by the secretary of defense with view to new policy expressed in draft executive order eventually in midjuly clinton announced policy to be implemented by the department of defense that individuals could neither be barred from joining the armed forces nor discharged solely because of their homosexuality however the controversy surrounding this issue had complicated if not in some aspects frustrated the presidents policy agenda during his first six months in office by the time clinton marked the completion of his hundred days in late april he had successfully installed all of his cabinet members the attorney general being the only problematic appointment legislative victories included congressional budget resolution based on his budget plan and family leave law however his economic stimulus package had been defeated on april 21 controversy again surrounded the clinton administration with the may 19 firing of the white house travel office staff another setback came in early june when the president withdrew the nomination of law professor lani guinier to head the civil rights division of the department of justice she had come under criticism for views expressed in her writing on minority rights just before the congressional recess in august clinton by razorthin votes saw the budget reconciliation legislation containing his tax and spending policies gain approval upon returning in september congress cleared another clinton prioritya national service program for american youth the president with public approval rating at or below 50 set two goals for the remainder of the first session the first of these unveiling his national healthcare reform plan he accomplished on september 22 with nationally televised speech supported by carefully orchestrated publicity to guarantee media coverage however the proposed plan soon attracted attention not only for its promise of universal healthcare coverage but also for its massiveness and complexity crs22 the second goal that president clinton set was securing approval of the north american free trade agreement nafta negotiated during the administration of president george h w bush the agreement was under heavy attack from organized labor moreover the two top leaders of the democrats in the house were also opposed and the speakers support appeared to be far less than enthusiastic by its own counts the clinton administration was at least 100 votes behind in september ultimately the hard work of persuasion paid off on november 17 nafta was given house support on 234200 vote an extraordinary victory for the president as the first session of the 103rd congress moved toward closure the administration was successful in obtaining an extension of unemployment insurance enactment of the brady bill requiring fiveday waiting period for the purchase of handgun and approval of campaign finance reform legislation during the year president clinton did not cast single veto the first time chief executive had abstained from using this authority since 1969 or 1979 assessing president clintons legislative accomplishments during his first year in office burt solomon of national journal writing just before the nafta victory thought that clinton has hit few home runs his budget reconciliation package fell short of the sweeping rearrangements in policy that reagans tax and spending cuts reflected in 1981 the presidents national service program was viewed as far cry from his original proposal but might serve as seed its supporters hope of something more otherwise solomon concluded his legislative record has amounted to signing trio of bills that congress had passed before but president bush had vetoed89 such an assessment implies that the new president perhaps should have been more challenging and demanding of congress political scientist charles jones writing few months later in the journal of the brookings institution explained clintons approach to congress in his initial year in office congress has in recent decades developed capacity and taste for being actively involved in many phases of the policy process the president has shown an extraordinary talent for identifying major issues many of which have long been on the nations agenda and then for building public interest in them and maintaining their priority status though he typically offers plan he also conveys the message that he is willing to bargainquite unlike the less compromising stances of jimmy carter thus those members of congress who have grown accustomed to active policy roles can be satisfied that they retain influence in the new government90 the political realities underlying this working relationship explained political scientist barbara sinclair were that bill clinton won 43 percent of the vote in threeway race he ran behind most winning congressional democrats and his party 89 burt solomon white house notebook in leaning on congress clinton uses carrots instead of sticks national journal vol 25 nov 6 1993 p 2677

unlikely to perceive mandate91 nonetheless congressional democrats especially members of the house who must run for reelection every two years perceived their fate as tied to clintons legislative success democrats were eager to legislate and most supported in broad terms clintons legislative agenda many elements of which stemmed from congressional democratic initiatives inevitably however different constituencies and different institutional vantage points give president and the members of his party in congress different perspectives and often different priorities moreover in this case both lacked the experience of such working relationship clinton had extensive washington experience most congressional democrats had never served with democratic president92 what worked best for clinton and his congressional allies particularly in the difficult efforts to secure the budget reconciliation legislation and obtain approval of nafta was in sinclairs estimate campaign to build public support compromises and deals to win commitments from groups of members and an enormous amount of oneonone lobbying by the president and his principal lieutenants93 generally she concluded the first months of the clinton administration were period of considerable policy accomplishment but frequent public relations woes94 those woes included the problems encountered in finding an acceptable nominee for the position of attorney general and seeking equitable treatment of homosexuals in the armed forces regarding the latter political scientist james pfiffner comments the issue dominated the headlines during clintons first weeks in office as result it was perceived mistakenly as one of the presidents foremost priorities if the budget policy had been ready to go earlier the political controversy would have been over economic priorities for the country and the gay issue would have been put in perspective as one of several items on the clinton agenda second the fight got clinton off to shaky start with the military already wary of commanderinchief who had avoided the draft during the vietnam war finally the public and vocal opposition of senator nunn indicated that the democrats in congress would be willing to challenge the new president on his policy agenda95 91 barbara sinclair trying to govern positively in negative era clinton and the 103rd congress in colin campbell and

also giving support to sinclairs view of what worked best for the president and his congressional allies walker offers the following comment regarding clinton and the failure of his economic stimulus package to gain acceptance he paid too little attention to democratic moderates in the senate and permitted marginal questions like ending the ban on gays in uniform to balloon into damaging controversy he paid even less attention to the republican moderates in congress and allowed the republicans to heal their own deep splits and close ranks against his economic stimulus package this mattered less for the package itself than for the symbolic effect of his first political setback and the sign that the gridlock in washington was set to continue97 in his assessment of the new president pfiffner concludes that clintons record with the 103rd congress was decidedly mixed finding he enjoyed high success rate on the rollcall votes on which he took stand but that generally he did not do as well as he had hoped or many had expected the failure of his health care reform initiative writes pfiffner was major disappointment98 the defeat of the healthcare reform initiative occurred in 1994 but conditions for its demise as sinclair notes were set during president clintons first year it was unveiled in september much later than had been anticipated which seemingly diminished its status somewhat as priority for the new administration the actual legislative proposal moreover was presented to legislators in november when clinton congress and the press were occupied with nafta when the measure came under congressional consideration in 1994 the opposition campaign had raised host of doubts and reduced public support significantly ultimately the administration was criticized for writing toocomplex plan that was too hard to explain and for not responding forcefully enough to its critics99 95 continued washington cq press 1996 p 173 96 martin
