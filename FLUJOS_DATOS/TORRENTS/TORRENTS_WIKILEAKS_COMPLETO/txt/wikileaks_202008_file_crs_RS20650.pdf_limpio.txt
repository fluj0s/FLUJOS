have over 25000 in gross receipts during taxable year and which are not required to report to the federal election commission fec are required to register with the irs within 24 hours of their formation whether they are involved in state local or federal elections second 527 issue advocacy organizations which previously reported neither to the irs nor the fec are required to file regular

forms and annual reports will be made public hr 527 and s 527 in the 107th congress would exempt most state and local 527 organizations from the requirements of pl 106230 background section 527 of the internal revenue code was enacted in 1975 by pl 93625 to clarify the tax treatment of political organizations section 527 covers the tax treatment of all political organizations intended to influence the nomination selection appointment or election of candidate for federal state or local public office whether the organizations are parties pacs or candidate committees prior to the enactment of pl 106230 political activists had formed special 527 organizations which did not have to disclose their activities to either the fec or the irs because they structured their activities so that they neither engaged in express advocacy nor had taxable income the lack of federal oversight of certain 527 organizations political activities attracted those who wanted to participate anonymously in the political process and alarmed those who believed that there should be full disclosure of all political activities pl 106230 was the result of desires to increase public disclosure of nonreporting 527httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20650crs2 1 exempt function is defined in irc 527e2 as influencing or attempting to influenc the selection nomination election or appointment of any individual to any federal state or local public office organizations political activities on july 1 2000 president clinton signed pl 106230 which passed the 106th congress as hr 4762 under prior law it was possible to have 527 organization and not realize that fact this was because there was requirement to report to the irs unless the organization had taxable income and requirement to register with the fec unless the organization engaged in express advocacy the organization could be as informal as separate bank account used to fund candidates campaign under prior law irc 527 treated political organizations as taxexempt for purposes of any federal law referring to tax exempt organizations it provided that as long as their money was used only for exempt function1 purposes 527 organizations were not taxed on contributions of money or property membership dues fees or assessments proceeds from political fundraising or entertainment events proceeds from sales of political campaign materials providing the organization is not in the business of conducting such events or selling such materials and proceeds from conducting bingo games this exempt function income did not have to be reported to the irs political organizations were taxed on investment income capital gains and on any expenditures which are not for political purposes irc 2501a5 provides that transfers of money or other property to political organization are not subject to gift taxes irc 84 provides that if someone transfers appreciated property to 527 organization he is treated as if he had sold the property to the 527 organization for fair market value the transferor has to recognize and pay taxes on any gain summary of changes the new law changed the prior 527 regime first all 527 organizations which expect to have over 25000 in gross receipts during taxable year and which are not required to report to the fec whether they are involved in state local or federal election s are required to register with the irs within 24 hours of their formation the registration statements are subject to public disclosure second 527 issue advocacy organization s which previously reported neither to the irs nor the fec are required to file periodic disclosure statements with the irs these statements are made public third all 527 organizations with gross receipts in excess of 25000 per year are required to file annual reports with the irs the annual reports will be made public registration requirements under prior law political organization was 527 organization with action on its part an organization could be 527 organization or could have 527 organization without even being aware of the fact unless it had taxable generally investment income it did not have to report anything to the irs section 1 of the new law prohibits an organization from being 527 organization unless it notifies the irs electronically and in writing within 24 hours after formation there are three exceptions one for organizations which do not anticipate having more than 25000 of gross receipts per year another for persons which are required to report to the fec under the federal election campaign act feca as political committees and third for taxexempt organizations that conduct 527type activities directly instead of in separate organization the penalty for failure to register is that the organization will be taxed at the maximum corporate tax rate on all gross receipts less certain expenses for the period of the failure the irs has issued form 8871 for organizations to register andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20650crs3 has provided place on its website to register electronically the irs notes in its informational material that the organization will need an employer identification number ein in order to register immediately after enactment of pl 106230 there was question about how to interpret the statutory exception for political committee required to report to the fec and thus exempted from registration with the irs the definition of political committee under 2 usc 4314 is any committee club association or other group of persons which receives contributions aggregating in excess of 1000 during calendar year or which makes expenditure s aggregating in excess of 1000 during calendar year or b any separate segregated fund established under the provisions of section 441bb of this title or c any local committee of political party which receives contributions aggregating in excess of 5000 during calendar year or makes payments exempted from the definition of contribution or expenditure as defined in paragraphs 8 and 9 of this section aggregating in excess of 5000 during calendar year or makes contributions aggregating in excess of 1000 during calendar year or makes expenditures aggregating in excess of 1000 during calendar year political committees only report to the fec if they are involved in express advocacy ie they make statements for or against candidate in federal elections the question involved political committees with multiple funds some took the position that if the political committee had one fund that reported to the fec and others that did not because they only engaged in either issue advocacy or state elections the whole committee including the nondisclosing funds was exempt from registering with the irs others took the position that each separate fund should be viewed as separate 527 organization and if fund did not report to the fec it had to register with the irs in announcement 200072 the irs took the position that the separate accounts which are not registered with the fec must file form 8871 see qa 4 the irs reiterated this position in rev rul 200049 qa 6 the law requires state and local candidate committees federal and state issue advocacy committees and funds that intend to influence an election or the selection nomination or appointment of candidate to public office to register with the irs the information on the form 8871 is to be made public by the irs not later than 5 business days after it receives the notice from the political organization an organization can comply with the public disclosure requirement by furnishing the irs website address to the requester rev rul 200049 disclosure of contributions and expenditures section 2 of the law requires disclosures by political
