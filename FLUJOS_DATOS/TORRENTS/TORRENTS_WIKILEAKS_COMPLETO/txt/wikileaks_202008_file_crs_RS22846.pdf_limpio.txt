judicially developed number of bills introduced in the 110th congress would codify the defi nition of economic substance provide strict liability penalty fo r underpayments resulting from disallowed transactions that lack economic substance and prohibit deduction of interest on those underpayments the proposals would not codify the doctrine itself nor provide standards for courts determination that the doctrine was relevant to particular case codification has been dubbed revenue raiser though there is disagreement as to both the amount that would be raised and the way in which codification would increase revenue proposed legislation the economic substance doctrine is judicial rather than statutory tax doctrine that has been used by the internal revenue serv ice irs and applied by the courts for many years to disallow for tax purposes transactions that technically comply with the internal revenue code the code but produce tax benefits outside of what congress intended1 throughout the years it has remained matte r of judicial interpretation and case law there have been however suggestions that the doctrine should be codified to produce uniformity among the courts in applying th doctrine generally proposals would codify the definition of economic substance rather than codifying the doctrine this codification has been proposed in several bills during the 110th congress although the language in each proposal has been similar the overall subject matter for the bills has been diverse section entitled clarifica tion of economic substa nce doctrine has been included in

substantial purpose other than federal tax purpose for entering into such transaction11 when potential for profit is the basis of the taxpayers position that transaction has economic substance the expectation of profit must be reasonable even when it is deemed reasonable the present value of the expected profit must be compared to the present value of the expected net federa l tax benefit the profit potential must be considered substantial when compared to the tax benefit12 further if the only substantial purpose other than federal tax purposes is reduction in nonfederal taxes there is economic substance if similarities between federal tax law and the other tax law result in correspondi ng reduction in federal taxes that at least equals the reduction in

establish penalty for transactions found lacking in economic subs tance this penalty would be 30 of the understatement in tax th at resulted from disallowance of the transaction15 the penalty would be reduced to 20 in cases where the facts relevant to the tax treatment of the disallowed transaction are adequately disclosed in the return on statement attached to the return16 in contrast to most penalties provided for in th code the proposed penalty is calculated on the tax understatement rather th an on the underpayment17 so taxpayer may be liable for penalty even if that taxp ayer does not have an outstanding tax balance the penalty can only be imposed by the chie f counsel of the irs or by an office of chief counsel branch chief to whom the chief counsel has delegated such authority hereinafter chief c ounsel or delegate18 the authority to compromise all or part of the penalty is similarly limited19 compromise of the penalty is also limited to situations in which the understatement from the non economic substance transaction has been reduced20 the bill requires the individual asserting the penalty to first notify the taxpayer of the intent to assert the penalty21 the taxpayer must also have the opportunity to respond in writing22 while the penalty may be imposed following litigation in which court finds that the economic substance doctrine is relevant and that the transaction lacked economic substance such litigation is not required for assertion of the pena lty the chief counsel or delegate may determine that the economic substance doctrine is relevant and

analysis of proposed legislation clarifying the economic substance doctrine the proposed bill provides definition of economic substance for courts to use when they find that the economic substance doctrine is relevant it makes claim to clarify when the doctrine is relevant instead it codifies definition that settles some differences between courts in terms of what is required to find that transaction has economic substance27 the rationale provided by the court of federal claims in coltec industries v united states28 suggests an additional justification for codifying the definition of economic substance if not the doctrine itself the court said that in determining their tax liabilities taxpayers must be able to rely on clear and unde rstandable rules established by congress if federal tax laws are app lied in an unpredictabl and arbitrary manner albeit by federal judges for the right reasons public confidence in the code and tax enforcement system surely will be further eroded29 codifying the definition of economic substa nce arguably could provide clear and understandable rule there are howeve r phrases and concepts in the proposed definition that may be less than clear if so they may cause uncertainty rather thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22846crs5 30 kolb solidly opposed to codification of economic substance doctrine fed tax day i5 feb 15 2007 comments by fred

grassleyproviding clarification30 some of these are changes in meaningful way31 substantial purpose32 and substantial profit in comparison to tax benefit33 additionally since the courts are left to determine when the economic substance doctrine is relevant there may still be room to apply the codified definiti on in an unpredictable and arbitrary manner the strict liability penalty the current bill proposes 30 penalty on the understatement resulting from transactions that lack economic substance if the transaction was not disclosed some other proposals have t the penalty at 4034 if the transaction is disclosed the penalty would be reduced to 20 however in either case there is provision for abating the penalty based on reas onable cause the penalty is one of strict liability taxpayer reliance on advice from tax professionals is irrelevant even when that advice is based on substantial authority arguably taxpayer s have some protection from the penalty because it can only be imposed by the chief counsel or delegate however since it is left to the courts to deter mine whether the economic substance doctrine is relevant taxpayers are placed in situation in which they may need professional guidance as to whether the doctrine is applicable but cannot rely on that guidance to avoid substantial penalty if court determines th at the doctrine applies and the transaction lacked economic substance further complicating taxpayers quandary is the assertion by the joint committee on taxation that if the tax benefits are clearly consistent with all applicable provisions of the code and the purposes of such provisions it is not in tended that such tax benefits be disallowed if the only reason for such disallowance it that the transaction fails the economic substance doctrine as defined in this provision35 thus taxpayers tax professionals and the c ourts will still be in the position of trying to determine congresss purpose for various provisions of the tax code in some cases there is sufficient legislative history to determine the purpose but in other cases there is not as result taxpayers might avoid legitimate business transactions out of fear of potential penalty36 this could reduce risktaking and innovation in business and possibly lead to decline in productivity and profitability some however believe that the penaltys results will be positive causin g taxpayers to forego entering into noneconomic taxmotivated transacti ons that congress never intended37 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22846crs6 38 see ways and means legislative counsel ex plains

2008 available at httptaxcchgroupcom 41 idtwo sides to the issue clarifying the economic substance doctrine through codification has been persistent provision in legislative proposals in recent congresses though the revenue projections of the current proposal vary38 the proposal is viewed as providing increased revenue for the paygo budget procedures39 it may also reduce government costs by eliminating some abusive tax shelter schemes thus reducing the resources needed to pursue both the promoters and participants in abusive tax shelters others oppose codification of even defi nition of economic substance in part because it may provide the seeds of the next tax shelter problem40 it is the business of tax professionals to examine the code closely to determine how it can best be used to result in the least amount of tax owed new laws aimed at clarifying current law both statutory and case law are apt to be viewed as challenges it seems likely that someone will devise transaction that court might in the past have found to lack economic substance but which meets th criteria for having economic substance under the proposed bill in this case some may argue that codification of the definition may hinder rather than help actions against abusive tax shelters there is also some question about both the cost saving and reve nue raising prospects for the proposal irs chief counsel donald l korb has questioned whether the strict liability penalty would ever be asserted by the irs and has indicated that it would make litigation more complex and eliminate taxpayer s incentive to cooperate with the irs41
