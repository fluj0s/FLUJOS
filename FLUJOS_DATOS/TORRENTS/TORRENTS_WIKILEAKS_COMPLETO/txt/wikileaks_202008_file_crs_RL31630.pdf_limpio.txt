regardless of status are eligible for emergency medicaid at this time there are other federal funds available for the speciﬁc purpose of reimbursing hospitals or states for emergency medical care provided to unauthorized aliens additionally it is extremely diﬃcult to ascertain the amount of money spent for emergency medical care for unauthorized aliens since most hospitals do not ask patients

opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 prwora barred unauthorized liens from receiving most medicaid benefits they are eligible for emergency medicaid services unauthorized aliens are also eligible for emergency medical services provided by the states the medicare prescription drug improve ment and moderniz ation act of 2003 pl 108173 signed into law on december 8 2003 includes provision 1011 to provide reimbursement to stat for emergency care afforded to unauthorized aliens for each fiscal year fy2005fy2008 the provision appropriates 250 million to states to be distributed based on estimates of the number of undocumented aliens residing in the state and on the number of apprehensions for the six states with the highest number of apprehensions this program is similar to one created in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 which had expired in addition the illegal immigrant refo rm and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira authorized reimbursement of public hospitals nd certain nonprofit hospitals for emergency medical assi stance to unauthorized aliens and reimbursement of state and local governments for emergency ambulance services provided aliens injured while crossing us borders while in custody neither program has been funded however in fy1998 congress appr opriated money for pilot program in nogales arizona to attempt to reimburse state and local governments for ambulance services in s concluded from the pilot program that reimbursement for ambulance rvices was not feasible program hr 1515 would provide reimbursement for the costs of emergency medical care and ambulance services furnished to aliens paroled for medical reasons the provisions in prwora which limite d immigrant access to public benefits were the result of the desire that immigrants be selfsufficient and not rely on public resources to meet their needs additi onally proponents did not want the availability of public benefits to constitute an incentive for immigrants to migrate to the united states nonetheless many contend that since the federal government is wholly responsible for establishing immigration polic and for policing the borders to keep out unauthorized aliens the

aliens15 the provision which is to be administered by the attorney general in consultation with the secretary of hhs has not been implemented to date the funding is subject to number of restrictions as follows funding is subject to such amount s as are provided in advance in appropriation acts to date funds have been appropriated funds are available for reimbursement only to the extent that such costs are not otherwise reimbur sed through any other federal program payment can be made with respect to services furnished to anindividual unless the immigration status of the individual has been verified through appropriate pr ocedures established by the secretary of hhs and the attorney general obviously the lack of an appropriation has been the primary impediment to the implementation of this provision howe ver according to hhs and former ins officials the other restrictions would also pose difficulties first it is difficult to determine that other federal f unding exists given the availab ility of other non specific funding sources eg medicaid ds h payments discussed below second and probably more seriously there is procedure for determining the immigration status of hospital

report to congress on the feasibility of expanding the nogales project19 did not recommend expanding or continuing the project si nce the border patrol had to redirect enforcement resources to

health and human services hhs state and local health services and other authorities we do not believe that under current law the hhs has the authority to reimburse states for this activity20 disproportionate share hospital dsh payments although there is medicaid funding for the specific purpose of reimbursing hospitals for the cost of unauthorized alie ns the medicaid statute requires that states make disproportionate share dsh adjus tments to the paymen t rates of certain hospitals treating large numbers of low income and medicaid patients including unauthorized aliens these payments implicitly recognize the disadvantaged situation of hospitals treating large numbe rs of medicaid patient s and other patients with insurance states must define hospitals in their state medicaid plans qualifying as dsh hospitals and the ds h payment formulas however the identification of unauthorized aliens among the medicai d patients and uninsured as component of either the dsh designati on or payment formula is not required and thus there are data on the amount of dsh payments used for unauthorized aliens21 legislation in the 107th congress there were several bills introduced in the 107th congress which would have created grant program to provide additiona l funding to states for emergency health services for unauthorized aliens these programs would have been

cms proposes that providers re quest information on patients citizenship or immigration status prior to discharge but after the patient is identified as selfpay and not medicaid eligible individual level immigration information would be maintained at the hospital and not routinely transmitted to cms as cms would designate contractor to review and determine the number of claims and the percentage of patients qualifying for re imbursement cms c ontends that this approach would minimally increase paperw ork for hospitals as much of the information can be gathered from existing medicaid enrollment forms nothing in the paper suggests that the information s hould be transmitted to the department of homeland security dhs however some are concerned that dhs could use hospital records to locate unauthorized aliens making aliens less likely to seek medical treatment reportedly af ter receiving comments on the proposed implementation plan ie the policy paper cms has revised the policy

the amendment failed by voice vote issues there are several policy issues concerni ng the provision of federal funding for states with large populations of unauthor ized aliens as discussed above the provisions in prwora whic h limited immigrant access to pub lic benefits were the result of desire that immig rants be selfsufficient nd not rely on public resources to meet their needs additionally propone nts did not want the availability of public benefits to constitute an incentive for immigrants to migrate to the united states nonetheless others argue that immigration is solely federal issue the federal government is wholly responsible for establishing immigration policy and for policing the borders to keep out unauthorized aliens thus they argue that the burden to pay for immigrationre lated cost should be born by the federal government not the states additionally some questi on the wisdom of only providing funding to help cover the costs of unauthorized liens when federal funds are provided to states to cover the emergency medical costs of nonimmigrants and legal permanent residents who have been in the country for less than five yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31630crs14 36 the

americans immigrants challenge communities across the country planning vol 63 9 sept 1997 pp 410another issue concerns the lack of re liable data on the number and distribution of unauthorized aliens36 as the 2000 census of the us population is being released preliminary data analyses offer competing population totals that in turn imply that illegal migration soared in the late 1990s nd that estimates of uthorized residents of the united states have been understate d the department of homeland security estimates that there are about 7 million uthorized aliens living in the united states37 in testimony before the house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration and claims je ffrey passel demographic researcher at the urban institute offered an estimate of 8 to 9 million unauthorized residents at the same hearing economists from northeastern university using employment data reported by business establishments as well as 2000 census totals concluded that the unauthorized population may be 11 million38 these discrepancies suggest that assessments of the unauthorized populati on by state may be an inaccurate and problematic basis for distributing grant funds none of these estimates addresses the distribution among states of the unauthorized population however anecdotal reports suggest that unauthorized aliens may be dispersed among many states rather than concentrated in few states as previously presumed39 if this is true program which limits the number of states eligible for additional reimbursement for medical treatment of unauthorized immigrants may exclude smaller states th at have proportionally high numbers of unauthorized aliens in rela tion to their population but not high absolute numbers of unauthorized
