intelligence director nic and national counterterrorism center nctc clinton t brass and curtis w copeland government and finance division october 5 2004 abstract this report examines whether more than 50 general management laws eg the administrative procedure act the inspector general act and the competition in contracting act would cover the nid and the nctc under two scenarios 1 if the entities were established within the eop and 2 if the entities were established as or within independent entities in the executive branch the analysis focuses on the coverage of the selected management laws not on whether the laws are likely to aﬀect or apply to the nid or the nctc also some of the laws allow exemptions or contain other provisions that can aﬀect their coverage in general the report indicates that more of these management laws would appear to cover the nid and nctc if they were created as independent entities in the executive branch than if they were placed within the eop in many cases it was unclear whether the statutes deﬁnitions of covered agencies included entities within the eop the report also indicates that congress if it so desires could indicate that the nid and the nctc would be covered by these management laws by either 1 amending the text of each of the management laws or 2 delineating in the statute creating the entities the particular management laws that should cover themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32592congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl32592 general management laws and

the report provides some background information on the 911 commissions recommendations and recent efforts to restructure the intelligence community background the 911 commission questioned whether the us government and the intelligence community in particular are organized adequately to direct resources and build the intelligence capabilities that the us will need to counter terrorism and to address the broader range of national security challenges in the coming decade the commission recommended among other things that the current position of director of central intelligence should be

commission also recommended the establishment of national co unterterrorism center nctc built on the foundation of the existing terrori st threat integrat ion center ttic breaking the older mold of national government organization this nctc should be center for jo int operational planning and joint intelligence staffed by personnel from the various agencies the head of the nctc should have

position of the director of central intelligence11 on the same day he also issued executive order 13354 which established the nctc over which the director of central intelligence shall have authority direction and control12 on september 8 2004 president bush indicated that the administration sought legislation that would establish the nid position within the executive branch but not within the eop nid and nctc and the coverage of general management laws general management laws questions have been raised regarding number of issues associated with the establishment of the nid and the nctc one set of such questions centers on whether these proposed entities would be c overed by various general management laws broad statutes designed to regulate the activities procedures and administration of all or most executive bran ch agencies in such areas as regulatory and information management financial ma nagement procuremen t and strategic planning earlier in 2004 crs publishe d compendium of these general management laws and companion report on major themes from these laws with possible management policy options13 to determine the coverage of these mana gement laws in relation to the proposed nid and nctc crs examined the scope of the laws under two scenarios if the entities were established 1 within the eop or 2 as or within independent entities in the executive branch in both scenarios crs assumed that the entities would be established by congress this review in cluded more than 50 such laws but did not include laws related to human resource management title 5 of the united states code or intergovernmental re lations eg the intergove rnmental cooperation act table showing coverage of laws table structure and contents table indicating the coverage of each management law in each scenario is included at the end of this report the first column of the table identifies the general management laws and their locations in the table of contents for the previously men tioned compendium of these laws the next three columns provide crss best judgment regarding the coverage of each of the laws if the nid and the nctc were established in the eop that is whether 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32592crs5 14 some laws have provisions in which determ inations of coverage are mixed for example in the eop scenario the clingercohen act of 1996 has some provisions that would not cover the proposed entities but also has provisions in which coverage is not clear conversely in the independent agencies scenar io some provisions of the act would appear to cover the proposed entities but others would not the entities appear to be covered by the law 2 the entities do not appear to be covered by the law or 3 it is not clear if the entities would be covered the next three columns indicate crss best judgment s regarding the coverage of these laws if the nid and nctc were established as independent entities within the executive branch the last column indicates the crs subject matter experts who may be contacted for further inform ation about each of the gene ral management laws for legal issues that relate to definitions of agency t j halstead 77981 and morton rosenberg 77480 in crss american law division are also av ailable for further information and assistance summary of findings in general this analysis indicated that more of these general management ws would appear to cover the nid and the nctc if they were created as or within independent entities in the executive branch than if they were established within the eop in many cases it was unclear whether the statutes definitions of covered agencies included entities within the eop therefore if congress chose to establish the proposed tities the coverage of these management laws would appear to depend on where the entities were established within the eop if the nid and the nctc were established within the eop about half 26 of the ge neral management ws included in this report would appear to cover in whole or in part the proposed entities14 eleven of the laws would not appear to cover the entities within the eop and it was not clear whether they would be covered by 18 of the laws for exampl several of the statutes indicated they covered any department agency or instrumentality of the us government but it was not clear whether this constructi on would include the eop or any of its constituent parts of the 11 laws that did not appear to cover the entities four did not cover the entities because the laws had expired these laws were included in the crs compendium because of continuing c ongressional interest in the subjects in other of these not covered cases the ws eg the inspector general act of 1978 and the federal managers financial integrity act of 1982 specifically list the covered agencies and do not include the eop nor would they include the proposed entities independent entities if the nid and the nctc were established as or within independent entities in the executiv branch more than 75 42 of the general management ws would appear to cover in whole or in part the proposed entities in many cases where it was unclear that particular management law covered an instrumentality or independent entity within the eop it was more clear that the law would cover an independent agency or other entity within the executive branch of the 12 laws that did not appear to cover the entities four would not do so because the laws have expired and others did not appear to cover the entities because they were not included in list of covered agencies in only one case was it unclear whether the management law would apply to an independent entityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32592crs6 15 5 usc 5511 considerations regarding table contents several points are important to consider with regard to the tables contents 1 the analysis focuses on the coverage of the selected management laws with respect to the nid and the nctc not whether the laws are likely to affect or apply to these proposed entities 2 the coverage of some of the laws in these scenarios is unclear 3 congress has previously exempted certain agencies from the coverage of some of the management laws and 4 certain pr ovisions in some of the laws may affect their coverage coverage versus application of the laws this report focuses on whether an entity is covered by statute not on whether the law is likely to affect or apply to the entitys operations for example the paperwork reduction act pra specifically identifies the eop in its definition of covered agency therefore if the nid and the nctc were created as part of the eop we concluded that they would be covered by the pra however if these entities never imposed any paperwork requirements on the public that triggered the pras requirements the act would not affect or apply to their operations similarly the national environmental policy act might cover these entities particularly if they were established as independent entities within the executive branch but they might never take actions that triggered the requirement in the act for an environmental impact statement coverage sometimes unclear crs determined whether the selected management laws would ppear to cover the nid and the nctc in particular scenarios based on the definitions and ot her terms provided in these laws most commonly how the terms agency or executive agency were defined in some cases however determining the coverage of these management laws was difficult as noted previously this difficulty was most common in determining whether certain statutes applied to entities within the eop for example the federal records act covers any independent estab lishment in the executive branch but this term is not defined in the act given the nature and missions of the various offices within the eop ie to help develop nd implement the policies and programs of the president it is not clear whether the nid or the nctc would be considered independent establishments for purposes of the act if established within the eop in some cases the coverage of these management laws might turn on the interpretations of the courts it should also be noted that coverage of the nid and the nctc would not be ensured even in instances where the statutory definiti on either seems broad enough to include the eop or specifically includes the eop within its ambit for example the administrative procedure act apa defines agency to include each authority of the government of the united states wh ether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency15 while this definition could arguably apply to any governmental entity the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia has established that the apa confers agency status on any administrative unit withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32592crs7 16 soucie v david 448 f2d 1067 1073 1971 17 5 usc 552f1 18 meyer v bush 981 f2d 1288 1297 dc cir 1993 19 this standard is likewise applicable to the privacy act which incorporates the definition of agency as used in foia 20 gpra is codified at 5 usc prec 301 306 31 usc 1101 and nt 1105 11151119 prec 9701 97039704 39 usc prec 2001 28012805 if precedent were followed it is possible that the nid and the nctc would be excluded from gpras coverage according to the 911 commission report the nctc would be built on the foundation of the existing terrorist threat inte gration center p 403 which is located in the cia the cia was excluded from gpras coverage by 5 usc 306f according to gpras legislative history the cia was excluded largely because most of its budget is classified and because the gpra plans and repor ts it would prepare would be classified s rep 10358 government performance and results act of 1993 omb reported to congress in 1997 that omb cons ulted with the agency leader ship about this matter and the cia agreed to comply voluntarily with the basic provisions of gpra the government performance and results act report to the president and congress from the director of the office of management and budget may 1997 congress subsequently enacted pl 104293 the intelligence authorization act for fy1997 to require performance reports on intelligence activities requirements and evaluations secs 803 and 808 of pl 104293substantial independent au thority in the exercise of specific functions16 this standard has been of par ticular importance in the context of the freedom of information act foia even though the act specifically includes the eop in its definition of agency17 in meyer v bush for instance the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia determined that the task force on regulatory relief was not subject to foia even thoug h it was located in the eop based on the fact that its duties were advisory in nature and that it was not body with substantial independent authority to direct executive branch officials18 accordingly the determination in the attached chart that the apa and foia wouldappear to cover the nid and the nctc as part of the eop is predicated upon the assumption that these entities would in fact be imbued with substantial independent authority in the exercise of their functions 19 exemptions from coverage as the attached table indicates many of the management laws that crs examined woul d appear to cover the proposed nid and nctc as part of the eop as independent entities or in either situation congress could however exempt one or both of these entities from the coverage of certain laws just as it has done for other entities engaged in sensitive or intelligence related activities for example congress specifically exempted the central intelligence agency cia from requirements of the federal advisory committee act section 4 of 5 usc appendix 1 fro m law and regulations relating to the expenditure of government funds 50 u sc 403jb and from the government performance and results act gpra 5 usc 306f20 some of the management laws also allow other entities to exempt certain agencies or activities from coverage for example gpra allows the office of management and budget omb to exempt agencies with annual outlays of 20 million or less from cer tain requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32592crs8 21 as alternatives see crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium coordinated by clinton t brass or call the crs experts listed in the tablecertain provisions ca n affect coverage for some of the general management laws included in the attached table even though these laws would normally cover the proposed nid and nctc certain provisions could affect this coverage for example the entry for the davisbacon act notes that while the act would appear to cover the nid and the nctc either as part of the eop or as independent entities the president can suspend the act during national emergency also the chief financial officers cfo act of 1990 technically does not cover the eop but 1999 amendment to the act created separate cfo for the eop the president can under this ame ndment determine what authority and functions apply to the cfo for the eop although the table notes several of these provisions it s hould not be relie d upon to highlight all important nuances in the coverage of genera l management laws21 congress could indicate whether management laws cover nid and nctc if congress decided to create the nid and the nctc and wanted to indicate that these entities should be covere d by certain management ws two general approaches would be available 1 amending the text of each of the relevant management laws to indicate that the entities being created s hould be considered covered by these laws or 2 including provision in the statute creating these entities indicating which of the management laws cover them alt hough either of these general approaches would accomplish this objective each has pa rticular advantages and disadvantages amending the management laws in the first approach congress afte r creating the nid and the nctc could consider amending the text of selected general management laws to indicate clearly that they cover the new entities for example the chief financial officers cfo act of 1990 lists the agencies covered by its requirements at 31 usc 901b if congress wanted to have the cfo act cover one or both new entities congress could add the entity or entities to this list and thereby put the complete list of covered agencies at one location in the united states code similar action would be required for each of the statutes that congress considers relevant possible advantage of this approach would be that in comparison to the second alternative it would be easier for an interested party to determine the coverage of specific general management law when specific agencies were delineated however this approach also could have several disadvantages for example making changes in statutory language to dozens of particular statutes woul d likely be significantly more difficult than the alternative approach and more likely to result in jurisdictional issues among congressional committees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32592crs9 identification of management laws in statute creating nidnctc in the second approach congress coul d specifically delineate the particular management laws that should cover the d and the nctc in the statute creating them this listing of management laws could include all such laws that congress considers relevant including those that already would appear to cover the proposed entities in order to clearly establish congressional intent alternatively the listing could focus only on either those statutes that do not appear to cover the new entities or those for which coverage is uncertain in either case the statute creating the entities could state that they shall be considered to be covered by the requirements of with listing of all relevant management laws provided g the federal register ac t and the apa or more specifically the statute could include langua ge defining covered agency or other term depending on the specific management laws by referring to the definitions in the management laws themselves such as the following the nidnctc shall be considered to be covered agency for purposes of the administrative procedure act as fined at 5 usc 5511 add other applicable management laws and code citations some potential advantages of this ge neral approach include relative ease of statutory drafting and fewer jurisdictional issues than with the first approach amending each management law however this approach might make it more difficult for an interested party to determine the coverage of given law particularly for those laws that list the covered agenci because to do so the party would have to find all provisos of inte rest which might be include d in many parts of the united states code for example if the statute creating the nid and the nctc indicated that one or both of the entities should be cove red by the cfo act an interested party attempting to compile list of agencies w ith cfos would have to know to examine not only the cfo act but also the statute creating the new entities evaluating options standardization vs customization when considering whether these genera l management laws should cover the proposed nid and nctc if any or whethe r alternative or ne w managementrelated laws should be enacted congress might c onsider an issue that it has previously confronted when reorganizing or creating agencies whether all or virtually all these management laws shoul d cover all or virtually all agencies or whether each agency should be governed by customized set of these laws some assert that the laws should cover as many agencies as po ssible arguing that less coverage would lessen the laws importance and influen ce and would potentially make it more difficult for congress to hold the presid ent and agencies accountable for their administration others contend that each ag ency is sufficiently different to merit individualized attention and that there s hould be presumpti on of coverage with regard to any specific agency particularly with regard to intelligence agencies or other entities that deal with sensitive or cl assified information for analysis andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32592crs10 discussion of potential advantages and di sadvantages of
