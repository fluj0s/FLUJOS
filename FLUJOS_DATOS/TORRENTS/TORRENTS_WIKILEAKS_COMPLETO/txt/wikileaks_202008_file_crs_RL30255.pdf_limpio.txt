current law provides many incentives to promote saving the goal of these provisions is to increase saving for special purposes such as education or retirement and to increase national saving increased national saving can lead to faster wealth and capital accumulation which can boost future national income an increasingly important retirement saving vehicl is the individual retirement account ira ira savings is encouraged by two mechanismsa carrot approach and stick approach first tax provisions allow individuals to defer taxes on ira contributions and investment earnings or to accumulate investment earnings tax free second withdrawals before the age of 59½ are generally subject to 10 penalty tax in addition to regular taxes there are two types of iras the traditional ira and the roth ira the traditional ira allows for the taxdeferred accumulation of investment earnings and some individuals are eligible to make taxdeductible contributions to their traditional iras while other individuals are not some or all distributions from traditional iras are taxed at retirement in contrast contributions to roth iras are not tax deductible but distributions from roth iras are not taxed on withdrawal in retirement expanded contribution limits were adopted in 2001 but were scheduled to expire after 2010 the pension protection act of 2006 made those increases permanent in november 2006 the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform proposed changes to iras the panels plan would create save for retirement accounts sras to replace traditional and roth iras in recent budgets president bush proposed consolidating the traditional and roth iras into single retirement savings acc ount rsa both the rsa and sra would be modeled on the roth ira implementation of these proposals could increase retirement saving and could reduce administrative costs neither conventional economic theory nor the empirical evidence on savings effects tends to support the argument that increased ira contributions are primarily new savings rothstyle accounts are less likely to induce new private savings than are traditional ones since both the rsa and sra are modeled on roth iras neither appears likely to appreciably increase national saving furthermore with income limits on owning rsas and sras as well as the higher contribution limit for sras it is likely that tax expenditures would increase especially beyond the typical budget five or 10year horizon thus exacerbating future budget pressures additionally these proposals would predominantly benefit higherincome individuals and families who are the ones most likely to save without the added incentive this report will be updated as legislative developments warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30255g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158

retirement income security social security employerprovided pensions and private savings coverage by social security is nearly universal but its benefits are limited and many workers reach retirement with small pensions and little savings over the past few decades congress and the president have offered tax incentives to encourage businesses to offer pensions and workers to save the joint committee on taxation estimates that tax incentives to encourage retirement saving could cost the us treasury 735 billion between 2008 and 2012 an increasingly important retirement saving vehicl is the individual retirement account ira iras were created by erisa the employee retirement income security act of 1974 pl 93 406 which was signed into law by president fo rd on labor day erisa was passed to protect the interests of pension plan participants and pension beneficiaries iras were originally designed to give individuals not covered by an employer pension plan chance to save in tax advantaged retirement account since erisa was passed in 1974 the law has been amended several times to change the tax treatment of iras and create new types of iras currently nearly everyone is eligible to contribute to at least one type of ira ira savings is encouraged by two mechanismsa carrot and stick approach first tax provisions allow individuals to defer taxes on ira contributions and investment earnings or to accumulate investment earnings tax free effectively raising the rate of return on ira contributions second nonqualified withdrawals before the age of 59½ are subject to 10 penalty tax in addition to regular taxes several times in during his administration president bush had proposed major change to iras under the presidents proposal all iras would be combined into single rothstyle ira called retirement savings accounts rsas with an annual contribution limit of 5000 and income limits the president also proposed lifetime savings account lsa with 2000 limit this report provides background information on iras including description of current law and the tax benefits of iras in addition the effects of iras on saving and other national objectives is discussed

changed several times see the appendix for brief history of iras the current rules were set in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 for 2008 both the traditional and roth iras have an annual contribution limit of 5000 which will be adjusted to inflation in 500 blocks after 2008 individuals 50 years or older may make additional annual catchup contributions of 1000

401ks the individual must receive the distribution by april 1 following the calendar year in which the owners reaches 70½ the amount that is required to be distributed 2 qualified distribution is

expectancy for example an unmarried 71 year old with an ira balance of 26500 would be required to take minimum distribution of 1000 with the precipitous decline in the stock market in 2008 congress was concerned that many elderly retirees would be disadvantaged because they would be required to withdraw retirement monies by selling stocks when the market is do wn furthermore basing the distribution amount on the account balance as of the end of the previ ous year could mean that the distribution is larger proportion of the actual balance at the time of the distribution consequently congress passed the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 pl 110458 which provides for oneyear waiver of the required minimum distribution rules for calendar year 2009 the minimum distribution rules however only require that ira owners move certain proportion of their ira balance from taxadvantaged investment account to taxable investment account and pay the appropriate taxes on the distribution which had been deferred moreover since the market will presumably recover paying taxes at time when asset values are low could be beneficial compared to normal circumstances because it will defer taxes to the future when asset values rise g22g138g161g561g5g152g151g156g142g154g158g142g151g140g142g156g561g152g143g561g11g20g3g156g561 the main tax advantages of traditional ira are the deductibility of contributions for some individuals and the tax deferment of investment returns on ira assets the advantages are due to 1 taxdeferred compounding of interest and 2 the possibility of postponing tax liability from time when income is high and the individual is in high tax bracket to time when income may be lower and the individual is in lower tax bracket however there is guarantee that income will be lower after retirement than before or that the tax brackets will be the same after retirement as before contributions to roth ira are taxable but the returns earned on roth ira assets are not taxable consequently in this important respect roth iras are like taxexempt bond very highincome individuals and families however are not eligible to establish and contribute to roth ira losses on both traditional and roth ira investments can be included on an individuals tax return 3 the loss however can only be included if the individual itemizes and after all the amounts in the ira have been distributed with the total distributions being less than total nondeductible contributions

treatment of frontloaded deductible traditional ira and backloaded roth ira can be equivalent under certain circumstances assuming that tax rates are the same at the time of contribution and

deduction is offset in present value terms by the payment of taxes on withdrawal here is an illustration suppose an in dividual had earned 100 before taxes to invest in an ira and faces tax rate of 25 with deductible traditional ira the individual could invest the 100 earn 10 return and have 110 after one year at 25 tax rate the individual would receive an 8250 aftertax distribution from his or her ira4 if the individual instead chose roth ira he or she would first pay taxes on the 100 equal to 25 and contribute 75 to the roth ira after one year and 10 retu rn on investment the individual would receive an 8250 distribution from his or her roth ira 75 in principal and 750 return on investment neither of which would be taxed in this example the aftertax distributions from each type of ira are

three ways in which these tax treatments can differ if tax rates vary over time if the dollar ceilings are the same and if premature with drawals are made there are also differences in the timing of tax benefits that have some implications for individual behavior as well as revenue costs

the same tax rate applies to the individual at the time of contribution and the time of withdrawal in the case of frontloaded iras taking the same example as before assume that the individuals tax rate at the time of contribution is 25 but is 15 at the time of withdrawal the individual with the roth ira would still receive distribution in the amount of 8250 after one year the individual contributing to the deductible traditional ira would still have 110 in pretax principal and interest after one year but would be taxed at the 15 rate with an aftertax ira distribution of 9350 6 in this case the deductible traditional frontloaded ira has better tax advantages than the roth ira the reverse could be true if the individual faces higher tax rate at the time of withdrawal than at the time of contribution g5g152g151g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561 the contribution limits for traditional and roth iras are the same for individuals contributing at the limit however the backloaded roth ira is more generous than both deductible and nondeductible traditional iras suppose the contribution limit is 4000 the limit for 2005 the interest rate is 8 and the tax rate is 25 if the individual has 4000 after tax for onetime 4 by deducting the 100 the individual does not have to pay 25 in taxes in the year the contribution is made to the ira however this 25 will be paid as taxes year later when the individual withdraws the funds from the ira this is essentially equivalent to borrowing 25 from the government at 0 annual interest rate and investing the loan in the financial markets 5 the tax treatment is different from those who are not eligible for either deductible traditional ira or roth ira this individual would contribute the aftertax 75 to an ira earn return of 750 which will be taxed at the 25 tax rate the aftertax ira distribution will be 8062 6 this is essentially equivalent to the individual borrowing 25 from the government the taxes not paid because of deductibility investing the money and paying the government back 15 the individual is borrowing at 40 interest rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30255g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158

generally before retirement age9 this issue is important because it affects both the willingness of individuals to commit funds to an account that might be needed before retirement and the willingness to withdraw funds already committed to an account the frontloaded deductible traditional ira provides steep tax burdens for early year withdrawals which decline dramatically over time because the penalty applies to both principal and interest without the penalty the effective tax rate is always zero for example with 25 tax rate and an 8 rate of return an individual taking nonqualified distribution from 7 the individual could spend this 1000 but it is assumed in this example that he saves this amount in taxable investment account that earns the nominal yield of 8 this 1000 loan is eventually paid back to the government because the original deductible 4000 the investment principal is taxed at the 25 tax rate when it is withdrawn 8 the ranking of roth ira and deductible traditional ir depends on the tax rate the individual faces when the money is withdrawn from the account however qualified distributions from both roth iras and deductible traditional iras will always be greater than from nondeductible traditional ira if the rate of return is positive 9 qualified withdrawal from an ira is either withdrawal taken after age 59½ or penaltyfree withdrawal prior to retirement for special purposes these special purposes include using the distribution for unreimbursed medical expenses buying or building first home and highereducation expenses

the 8 nominal return because of the 10 penalty tax in other words an individual would have effectively lost 64 of the original investment the effective tax burden in this case would be 18010 after three years the effective tax burden would be 63 and 38 after five years after about seven years the tax burden would be the same as an investment made in taxable account 25 thereafter tax benefits would occur with the effective tax burden falling to 20 after 10 years 10 after 20 years and 6 after 30 years these tax benefits would occur because taxes would be deferred and the value of the deferral would exceed the penalty the case of the backloaded roth ira is much more complicated first consider the case where all such iras are withdrawn in this case the effective tax burdens would be smaller in the early years although premature withdrawals are subject to both regular tax and penalty the taxes apply only to the earnings which are initially very small in the first year the effective tax rate would be the sum of the ordinary tax rate 25 and the penalty 10 or 35 because of deferral the effective tax rate would slowly decline 33 after three years 32 after five years 28 after 10 years in this case it would take 14 years to earn the same return that would have been earned in taxable account at 25 tax rate 11 partial premature withdrawals from roth iras on the other hand would be treated more generously as they would be considered to be return of principal until all original contributions were recovered the dollar consequences of the 10 penalty tax on nonqualified distributions are shown in the final two columns of table 3 after one year taxable investment account would yield higher dollar amount than nonqualified distribution from any type of ira the deductible traditional ira would incur loss after one yearnot only w ould the net distribution be less than that for other types of iras it would be less than the original 4000 investment since the investment earnings from roth ira would be subject to both regular and penalty taxes the distribution would be the same as for nondeductible traditional ira after 20 years the value of the tax deferral of the deductible traditional ira would exceed the tax penalty so the net distribution would be greater than that from taxable investment account 15326 versus 12829 the nonqualified distribution from roth ira and nondeductible traditional ira would be 13518 after 20 yearsgreater than the return from taxable investment account but less than nonqualified distribution from deductible traditional ira these differences suggest that individuals should be much more willing to put funds that might be needed in the next year or two for an emergency in backloaded roth account than in front loaded deductible traditional account since the penalties relative to regular savings account are much smaller these differences also suggest that funds might be more easily withdrawn from roth iras in the early years even with penalties this feature of the backloaded roth ira makes these taxfavored accounts much closer substitutes for shortterm savings not intended for retirement it could eventually become more costly to make premature withdrawals from backloaded accounts than from frontloaded accounts consider for example withdrawal in the year before eligibility at age 59½ of all funds that had been in the account for long time for frontloaded 10 the effective tax burden is the ratio of what the individual lost compared to what they would have gained without the penalty tax to what they would have gained in the absence of the 10 penalty tax 11 these patterns are affected by the tax rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30255g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158

the previous section will lower public saving by reducing the budget surplus or increasing the budget deficit conventional economic theory and empirical analysis do not offer unambiguous evidence that these tax incentives have increased personal or national saving16 from theoretical perspective the effect of tax reduction on savings is ambiguous because of offsetting income and substitution effects the increased rate of return may cause individuals to substitute future consumption for current consumption and save more substitution effect but at the same time the higher rate of return will allow individuals to save less and still obtain their target amount of savings an income effect the overall consequence for savings depends on the relative magnitude of these two effects empirical evidence on the relationship of the rate of return to the saving rate is mixed but indicates mostly small effects of uncertain direction recent evidence of the uncertainty of increasing savings with higher rate of return is the juxtaposition of high returns in the stock market in the mid to late 1990s with dramatic reduction in the personal savings rate this fall in the savings rate in the face of high returns provides some evidence that expanded tax incentives for iras will not be successful in increasing savings rates the increasing individual contributions to iras may simply have resulted from shifting existing assets into iras or diverting savings which would otherwise have occurred into iras iras are unlikely to increase savings because most tax benefits were provided to individuals who contributed the maximum amount which eliminates any substitution effect for these individuals the effect on savings is unambiguously negative with one exception in the case of the front loaded deductible traditional ira savings could increase to offset part of the upfront tax deduction but only if individuals recognize that their ira accounts will involve tax liability upon withdrawal the share of iras that were new savings would depend on the tax ratewith 28 tax rate one would expect that 28 would be saved for this reason with 15 tax rate 15 would be saved for this reason this effect does not occur with backloaded roth ira or nondeductible traditional ira thus conventional economic analysis suggests that private savings would be more likely to increase with frontloaded rather than backloaded ira despite this conventional analysis some economists have argued that ira contributions were largely new savings theoretical arguments have been made that iras increase savings because of psychological mental accounting or advertising reasons individuals may need the attraction 16 for more complete discussion of the savings literature see jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing

accounts that are restricted to discipline themselves to maintain retirement funds or they may need the impetus of an advertising campaign to remind them to save there has also been some empirical evidence presented to suggest that iras increase savings this evidence consists of 1 some simple observations that individuals who invested in iras did not reduce their nonira assets and 2 statistical estimate by venti and wise that showed that ira contributions were primarily new savings 17 the fact that individuals with iras do not decrease their other assets does not prove that ira contributions were new savings it may simply an that individuals who were planning to save in any case chose the taxfavored ira mechanism the venti and wise estimate has been criticized on theoretical grounds and an empirical study by gale and scholz using similar data found evidence of savings effect 18 study by joines and manegold comparing savings behavior of those newly eligible for iras and those already eligible for iras found evidence of an overall effect on savings although increases were found for some individuals and decreases for others study by attanasio and deleire using this approach also found little evidence of an overall savings effect19 and while one must be careful in making observations from single episode there was overall increase in the savings rate during the period that iras were universally available despite large contributions into iras similarly the household savings rate continued and actually accelerated its decline after the expansion of iras in 1997 it is important to recognize that this debate on the effects of iras on savings concerned the effects of frontloaded deductible iras many of the arguments that suggest iras would increase savings do not apply to backloaded roth iras for example backloaded iras do not involve the future tax liability that in conventional analysis should cause people to save for it indeed based on conventional economic theory there are two reasons that the introduction of backloaded roth iras may decrease savings first those who are newly eligible for the benefits should in theory reduce their savings because these individuals are higherincome individuals who are more likely to save at the limit the closer substitutability of roth iras with savings for other purposes would also increase the possibility that ira contributions up to the limit could be made from existing savings secondly those who are currently eligible for iras who are switching funds from frontloaded traditional ir as or who are now choosing backloaded roth iras as substitute for frontloaded ones should reduce their savings because they are reducing their future tax liabilities also many of the psychological arguments made for iras increasing savings do not apply to the backloaded ira there is large initial tax break associated with these provisions and the funds are less likely to be locked up in the first few years because the penalty applying to early 17 this material has been presented by steven venti and david wise in several papers see for example have iras increased us savings quarterly journal of economics vol 105 3

illiquid or tied up because of the possibility of withdrawing them penaltyfree for special purposes including medical expenses overall the existing body of economic theory and empirical research does not make convincing case that the expansion of individual retirement accounts particularly the backloaded accounts which were included in the 1997 legislation will increase savings

individuals who are more likely to save the benefits of iras for highincome individuals are limited however compared to many other savings incentives because of the dollar and income limits nevertheless the benefits of iras when universally allowed tended to go to higherincome individuals in 1986 82 of ira ductions were taken by the upper third of individuals filing tax returns based on adjusted gross income since these higherincome individuals had higher marginal tax rates their share of the tax savings would also be larger in addition when universal iras were available from 19811986 they were nevertheless not that popular in 1986 only 15 of tax returns reported contributions to iras participation rates were lower in the bottom and middle of the income di stribution only 2 of taxpayers in the bottom third of tax returns and only 9 of individuals in the middle third contributed to iras participation rose with income 33 of the upper third contributed 54 of taxpayers in the top 10 contributed and 70 of taxpayers in the top 1 contributed ownership of iras has increased substantially since 1986 however in 2004 the investment company institute estimates that 40 of us households owned an ira 20 not surprisingly households that own iras have higher income and more wealth than households not owning iras although there are income limits on the deductibility of ira contributions disproportionate share of the tax benefits accrue to upperincome taxpayers in 2003 tax returns reporting 75000 or more in adjusted gross income accounted for 235 of all taxable returns while only 45 of these higherincome returns reported taxdeductible ira contribution they accounted for 40 of all reported deductible ira contributions overall as one might expect the expansion of iras tends to benefit higherincome individuals although the benefits are constrained for veryhighincome individuals because of the contribution and income limits an expansion in contribution limits as occurred in 2003 would be more focused however on higherincome indivi duals who are more likely to be contributing at the limit and more likely to take full advantage of higher limits

accounts treatment on withdrawal will also be more complex since some are fully taxable some partially taxable and some not taxable at all another administrative complexity that arises is the possibility of penaltyfree withdrawals prior to retirement for special purposes these special purposes include using the distribution for unreimbursed medical expenses buying or building first home and highereducation expenses each special purpose has separate conditions placed on the distribution for example the first timehomebuyer early distribution is limited to 10000 and the medical expenses early distribution can occur only if unreimbursed medi cal expenses exceed 75 of adjusted gross income 21

individuals now have choice between frontloaded deductible traditional ira and backloaded roth ira an earlier section discussed the relative tax benefits of the alternatives to the individual this section discusses the relative advantages and disadvantages to these different approaches in achieving national policy objectives these objectives include reducing the federal budget deficit and federal debt increasing national savings and increasing retirement savings from budgetary standpoint the shortrun estimated cost of the frontloaded deductible traditional ira will better reflect the eventual longrun budgetary costs of iras than does the backloaded roth ira roth iras have probabl made it harder to meet longrun budgetary goals because the budget cost is incurred in the future as the nontaxed account earnings grow and budget targets do not take into account the outyear costs that is the costs beyond the five or 10 year budget window this issue can be important if the longterm objective is balancing the budget or generating surpluses achieving this goal can be compromised if the costs of iras are rising in addition if distributional tables are based on cash flow measures as in the case of the joint tax committee distributional estimates more realistic picture of the contribution of ira provisions to the total distributional effect of the tax package will emerge with the frontloaded ira the deductible traditional ira is more likely to result in more private savings than the roth ira from the perspective of either conventional economic theory or the psychological theories advanced by some in fact roth iras may not ve contributed to private savings of course traditional ira also has revenue cost which offsets any positive private savings effect the ultimate impact of traditional iras on national saving depends on the relative magnitudes of the revenue costs and the private saving effect while the ira tax incentives may not have appreciably increased national savings they have probably increased retirement savings by individuals 22 the severe penalties for early withdrawals increase the likelihood these funds will be available at retirement the increase in retirement savings is becoming more important as the oldstyle defined benefit pension plans are either 21 the tax rules are explained in the 100page guide for preparing 2004 tax returns

contribution plans such as 401k plans there are however some policy advantages of roth iras the roth ira avoids one planning problem associated with deductible traditional iras individuals may fail to recognize the tax burden associated with accumulated ira assets if this is the case the deductible ira would leave them with less aftertax assets in retireme nt than they had planned problem that would not arise with the roth ira where taxes are paid at retirement another possible advantage of roth iras is that the effective tax rate is always known zero unlike the frontloaded ira where the effective tax rate depends on the tax rate today vs the tax rate in retirement g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 in the fy2009 budget proposal the president proposed consolidating the traditional and roth iras into single retirement savings accoun t rsa the rsa would be modeled on the roth ira the annual contribution limit would be 5000 which would be indexed to inflation individuals may contribute up to the maximum amount regardless of their adjusted gross income contributions would not be tax deductible but investment earnings would accumulate tax free and qualified distributions would not be taxable nonqualified distributions exceeding the value of contributions would be subject to regular income taxes and 10 penalty tax the president also proposed creating lifetime savings accounts lsas with an annual contribution limit of 5000 which would be similar to rsas but could be withdrawn penaltyfree at any time this proposal was also contained in the fy2006 budg et proposal the fy2007 budget proposal and fy2008 budget proposal although in the latter case the limit was reduced to 2000 the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform proposed similar changes this plan would create save for retirement accounts sras to replace traditional and roth iras contributions up to 10000 annually could be made regardless of adjusted gross income the contribution limit would be indexed to inflation contributions would not be tax deductible but investment earnings would accumulate tax free early distribution exceeding the value of contributions would be subject to regular and penalty taxes the advisory panel also proposed the creation of save for family accounts sfas to replace existing education and medical savings accounts this proposal would allow every taxpayer to contribute up to 10000 each year to an sfa on an aftertax basis the earnings would accumulate tax free in the same way as in the current roth ira taxfree withdrawals would be allowed at anytime for qualified educational and medical costs or to purchase primary residence in addition taxpayers would be able to withdraw up to 1000 tax free each year for any purpose nonqualified distributions in excess of the 1000 limit would be subject to income taxes and 10 penalty tax similar to the penalty paid on nonqualified distributions from the current roth ira for the same reasons that apply to roth ir as none of these proposals would appreciably increase national saving furthermore it is unlikely that these proposals would appreciably increase retirement saving the lsa and sfa are probably more attractive savings vehicles for workers than the retirement savings accounts rsas and sras because they have the same tax advantages as the retirement accounts but can be accessed penaltyfree before retirement since less than third of us families report that retirement is the most important reason for saving it

accounts before saving in the retirement accounts23 with income limits on owning any of these accounts it also seems likely that considerable amount of existing savings would be transferred to these accounts consequently tax expenditures would increase especially beyond the typical budget five or 10year horizon this could dramatically increase future budget pressu res the congressional budget office estimated that the presidents fy2008 savings proposal would reduce federal revenues by about 3 billion between 2008 and 201724 revenues would initially rise as funds are moved from taxdeductible accounts to rsas and lsas after 2010 however revenues would fall somewhat as withdrawals from rsas and lsas go untaxed another study pr ojects that the longrun revenue costs could reach 30 to 50 billion per year25 although 60 of us families saved in 2000 there are income disparities 30 of the poorest 20 of families saved while over 80 of the richest 10 of families saved26 these proposals would predominantly benefit higherincome individuals and families who are the ones likely to save g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g156g561 the initial purpose of iras in 1974 was to extend the tax advantages allowed to employees with pension plans to individuals with pension coverage the major focus of iras today is generally to encourage savings especially for retirement if the main objective of individual retirement accounts is to encourage private and national savings the analysis in this study suggests that this objective has not been achieved moreover the backloaded roth approach is less likely to induce savings than the traditional form of iras however iras have undoubtedly increased longerterm saving for retirement but the ability to withdraw amounts for purposes other than retirement somewhat dilutes this focus on preparing for retirement the recent and planned expansions in the ira limit may make the provisions more likely to provide marginal incentive but will also direct the benefits towards higherincome individuals iras have often been differentiated from other tax benefits for capital income as the plan focused on moderate income or middle class individuals the ira has been successful to the extent that more of the benefits are targeted to moderateincome individuals than is the case for many other tax benefits for capital eg capital gains tax reductions nevertheless data on participation and usage of iras suggest that the benefits still accrue primarily to higherincome individuals based on conventional economic theory and the

limits increased to 2000 as general savings incentive in 1986 iras were restricted for higherincome individuals already covered by employer pension plans as part of the general base broadening needed to reach the distributional and revenue neutrality goals of the tax reform act of 1986 those covered by employer plans with incomes less than 50000 for married individuals and 35000 for single individuals were not eligible there was 10000 phaseout range ie 40000 to 50000 where partial benefits were allowed deductible contributions were limited to 2000 or total earnings whichever was less contributions could also be made for nonworking spouse but total contributions for married couple could not exceed total earnings individuals above the income limits could make nondeductible contributions and take advantage of tax deferral on investment earnings in the 101 st congress 19891990 several proposals to restore ira benefits were made the super ira the iraplus and the family savings account fsa the superira proposal suggested by senator bentsen and approved by the senate finance committee in 1989 s 1750 would have allowed one half of ira contributions to be deducted and would have eliminated penalties for speci purpose withdrawals for first time home purchase education and catastrophic medical expe nses the ira proposal was advanced as an alternative to the capital gains tax benefits proposed on the house side the iraplus proposal s 1771 sponsored by senators packwood roth and others proposed an ira with the tax benefits granted in different fashion from the traditional ira rather than allowing deduction for contributions and taxing all withdrawals similar to the treatment of pension this approach simply eliminated the tax on earnings like taxexempt bond this type of ira is commonly referred to as backloaded ira the iraplus would also be limited to 2000 contribution per year amounts in current iras could have been rolled over and would not have been subject to tax on earnings only on original contributions there were also special purpose withdrawals with fiveyear holding period the administrations proposal in 1990 for family savings accounts fsas also used back loaded approach with contributions allowed up to 2500 tax would have been imposed on withdrawals if held for seven years and penalty only tax on earnings if held for three years there was also penalty if funds were withdrawn to purchase home those with incomes below 60000 100000 and 120000 single head of household joint would have been eligible in 1991 s 612 senators bentsen roth and others would have restored deductible iras and also allowed an option for nondeductible or backloaded special ira tax would have been applied if funds had been held for five years and penalties would have applied if used for special purpose withdrawals in 1992 the president proposed new ira termed fira flexible individual retirement account which would have allowed individuals to establish

for funds held for seven years also in 1992 the house passed limited provision in hr 4210 to allow penaltyfree withdrawals from existing iras for special purposes the senate finance committee proposed for the same bill an option to choose between backloaded iras and frontloaded ones with fiveyear period for the backloaded plans to be tax free and allowing special purpose withdrawals this provision was included in conference but the bill was vetoed by the president for unrelated reasons similar proposal was included in hr 11 the urban aid bill but only allowed iras to be expanded to those earning 120000 for married couples and 80000 for individuals this was senate floor amendment that modified finance committee provision that bill was also vetoed by the president for other reasons the contract with america and the 1995 budget reconciliation proposal included proposed ira expansions similar to the 1997 proposals discussed below but this package was not adopted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 allowed penaltyfree withdrawals from iras for medical costs in 1997 the president proposed to increase the adjusted gross income limits for the current iras to 100000 for married couples with phase out beginning at 80000 and to 70000 for individuals with phase out beginning at 50000 part of this expansion would have occurred in 19971999 joint phase out between 70000 and 90000 and single phaseout between 45000 and 65000 such proposal would have extended individual retirement account eligibility to the vast majority of taxpayers taxpayers would have had the option of choosing instead special nondeductible iras with taxes applying if the funds are held in the account for at least five years the 10 penalty would not have been due for withdrawals during that period for postsecondary education firsthome purchase or unemployment spells of 12 weeks or more existing deductible iras could have been rolled over into nondeductible accounts with the payment of tax on withdrawals the houseproposed revisions were generally the same as those proposed in the house republican contract with america and included in the 1995 budget reconciliation proposal and as those reported out of the ways and means committee this change would have allowed individuals to contribute up to 2000 to nondeductible or backloaded ira regardless of income termed the american dream savings ads account the backloaded ira did not provide tax deduction up front and did not impose taxes on qualified withdrawals the 2000 would have been indexed for inflation after 1998 this provision would have been in addition to deductible iras but would have replaced the current nondeductible accounts earnings on withdrawals would not have been be taxed if held for at least five years and used for qualified purposes withdrawals after age 59½ left in the estate attributable to being disabled or withdrawn for down payment on first home 10 early withdrawal penalty would have conti nued to apply to nonqualified withdrawals but withdrawals to pay for highereducation expenses wo uld not have been subject to the penalty tax minimum distribution requirements would have applied taxes and penalties would not have applied until the original contribution was recovered and all iras would be aggregated for this purpose

into the nondeductible iras without penalty prior to 1999 amounts rolled over must have been included in income in equal increments over four years the senate 1997 version would have raised the income limits on deductible iras from 50000 to 60000 for single returns and 80000 to 100000 for joint returns by 2004 these limits would have been phased in 30000 to 40000 for single and 50000 to 60000 for joint in 19981989 35000 to 45000 for single and 60000 to 70000 for joint 20002001 40000 to 50000 for single and 70000 to 80000 for joint in 20022003 individuals whose spouses were participants in an employer plan would have been eligible regardless of the income limit this proposal would also have introduced backloaded accounts as substitute for nondeductible accounts individuals would have had to reduce the contributions to these accounts by the amounts deductible from frontloaded accounts these accounts were called ira plus accounts the rules regarding withdrawals and penalties were similar to those in the house bill except that withdrawals without penalty were also allowed for longterm unemployment there were income limits for backloaded iras the final bill followed the senate version with some alterations to the phase outs the provision allowing exemption from withdrawal penalt ies for longterm unemployment was dropped the senate version of taxpayer refund nd relief act of 1999 would have increased contribution limits to 5000 increased income limits for deductible iras and eliminated income limits for roth iras the house bills provisions were much more limited roth ira limits would have been increased the final bill more cl osely followed the senate version although the income limits for roth iras were to have been increased with change for deductible iras the president vetoed the tax cut because of its large revenue cost several bills including ira provisions saw some legislative action in 2000 but not one was enacted the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra gradually increases the contribution limits to iras ira limits increased to 3000 in 20022004 to 4000 in 2005 2007 and 5000 in 2008 the limits will then be indexed for inflation in 500 increments limits for catchup contributions by individuals over 50 years of age were 500 in 20022005 and will be 1000 in 2006 nonrefundable tax credit for contributions to qualified retirement plan including iras beginning at 50 but phasing down is allowed for lowerincome individuals many of the provisions in egtrra will expire in 2010 but the pension protection act of 2006 made those expansions permanent g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 thomas l hungerford specialist in public finance thungerfordcrslocgov
