from kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu to mannpsuedu subject re fyi date sat 21 apr 2007 082412 0600 mdt replyto trenbertucaredu cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk ben santer santer1llnlgov hi phil i am sure you know that this is not about the science it is an attack to undermine the science in some way in that regard i dont think you can ignore it all as mike suggests as one option but the response should try to somehow label these guys and lazy and incompetent and unable to do the huge amount of work it takes to construct such database indeed technology and data handling capabilities have evolved and not everything was saved so my feeble suggestion is to indeed cast aspersions on their motives and throw in some counter rhetoric labeling them as lazy with nothng better to do seems like good thing to do how about i tried to get some data from mcintyre from his 1990 paper but i was unable because he doesnt have such paper because he has not done any constructive work there is basis for retracting paper given in keenans message one may have to offer correction that particular sentence was not correct if it claimed something that indeed was not so but some old instrumental data are like paleo data and can only be used with caution as the metadata do not exist it doesnt mean they are worthless and can not be used offering to make correction to few words in paper in trivial manner will undermine his case kevin hi phil this is all too predictable this crowd of charlatans is always looking for one thing they can harp on where people w little knowledge of the facts might be able to be convinced that there is controversy they cant take on the whole of the science so they look for one little thing they can say is wrong and thus generalize that the science is entirely compromised of course as nicely shown in the spm every landmass is independently warming and much as the models predict so they can harp all they want on one chinese data set it couldnt possibly change the big picture let alone even the trends for china the so they are simply hoping to blow this up to something that looks like legitimate controversy the last thing you want to do is help them by feeding the fire best thing is to ignore them completely they longer have their friends in power here in the us and the media has become entirely unsympathetic to the rants of the contrarians at least in the usthe wall street journal editorial page are about the only place they can broadcast their disinformation so in other words for contrarians the environment appears to have become very unfavorable for development i would advise wang the same way keenan may or may not be bluffing but if he tries this i believe that british law would make it easy for wang to win defamation suit against him the burden is much tougher in the states mike phil jones wrote kevin have look at this web site i see youre away the websites can wait but scroll down to the letter below from keenan the last sentence httpwwwclimateauditorgp1471comments and httpwwwclimateauditorgp1479more1479 one is about data from paper 17 years ago jones et 1990 also there is this email below sent to weichyung wang who was one of the coauthors on the 1990 paper weichyung is in china and may not yet have seen this when hes back in albany ive suggested he talks to someone there it is all malicious ive ccd this to ben and mike as well to get any thoughts from their experiences if it gets worse i will bring susan in as well but im talking to some people at uea first susan has enough to do with getting the ar4 wg1 volume out on the 1990 paper i have put the locations and the data for the rural stations used in the paper on the cru website all the language is about not being able to send them the station data used for the grids as used in 1990 i dont have this information as we have much more data now much more in australia and china than then and probably more stations in western ussr are as well as for the other request i dont have the information on the sources of all the sites used in the crutem3 database we are adding in new datasets regularly all of nz from jim renwick recently but we dont keep source code for each station almost all sites have multiple sources and only few sites have single sources i know things roughly by country and could reconstruct it but it would take while ghcn and ncar dont have source codes either it does all come from the nmss well mostly but some from scientists lot of the issues are in various papers but they never read these also certainly use talking to them in geneva all week david parker and tom peterson will be there i can live with the web site abuse but the keenan letter knocked back bit i seem to be the marked man now cheers phil from dj keenan dougkeenaninformathorg to weichyung wang wangclimatecestmalbanyedu cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject retraction request date fri 20 apr 2007 133115 0100 xmailer microsoft outlook express 60029003028 xueaspamscore 00 xueaspamlevel xueaspamflag dear dr wang regarding the chinese meteorological data analyzed by wang et grl 1990 and jones et nature 1990 it now seems clear that there are severe problems in particular the data was obtained from 84 meteorological stations that can be classified as follows 49 have histories 08 have inconsistent histories 18 have substantial relocations 02 have singleyear relocations 07 have relocations furthermore some of the relocations are very distantover 20 km others are to greatly different environments as illustrated here httpwwwclimateauditorgp1323comment102970 the above contradicts the published claim to have considered the histories of the stations especially for the 49 stations that have histories yet the claim is crucial for the research conclusions i emailed you about this on april 11th i also phoned you on april 13th you said that you were in meeting and would get back to i have received response i ask you to retract your grl paper in full and to retract the claims made in nature about the chinese data if you do not do so i intend to publicly submit an allegation of research misconduct to your
