prel pter pk af subject gop denies agreement to transfer beradar to afghanistan lahore high court intervenes islamabad 00000461 0012 of 003 classified by anne w patterson for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary on february 26 the lahore high court reportedly barred the government of pakistan gop from extraditing mullah beradar and four other afghan taliban leaders pending hearing on march 15 to which both the federal government and concerned provincial governments have been summoned the lhcs ruling comes on the heels of february 25 petition filed by khalid khawaja the chief coordinator of the defense human rights commission challenging the unlawful8 detention of the afghan taliban leaders the same day of khawajas petition the press had reported that president karzais office had released statement noting that the gop had agreed to hand over mullah beradar and other taliban to afghan authorities during february 24 tripartite meeting with fbi director robert mueller and afghan interior minister atmar hanif pakistan minister of interior rehman malik made commitment of the gop handing over to afghanistan the afghan taliban leaders in question but agreed to study the issue the pakistani delegation asked for the deportation of baloch separatists including bramdagh bugti malik confirmed to ambassador on february 26 that the gop in fact has made such assurances of beradars transfer end summary the lhc steps intervenes in beradar case 2 c the lahore high court lhc on february 26 reportedly issued an order barring the extradition of mullah beradar and four other individuals named in february 25 petition brought forward by khalid khawaja challenging their detention khawaja the chief coordinator of the defense human rights commission filed petition dated february 25 in the lhc calling on the government of pakistan to treat the detained afghan taliban accordance with law in the interest of justice equity and conscience8 and asks that it refuse any transfer of the individuals named in the petition khawaja heavily cited various media reports about beradars capture as evidence supporting his petition note khawaja is currently defending the five americans arrested in sargodha and is known to be proextremist activist and lawyer end note 3 u khawaja claims that the detention of the taliban afghan in pakistani custody is against the law violating article 4 10 and 11 of the constitution he argues that the individuals have not been brought before any court that they have not been provided with the grounds for their arrest and that they have not had access to counsel of their choice khawaja further charges that the raid by the us agencies and investigation by them is against the provisions of the constitution and humiliation of the sovereignty of the state8 4 u in the petition khawaja asks the lhc to restrain the gop from handing over or escorting the detenusaccusedto america afghanistan or any other country as they are to be tried if need be under law of the land8 khawaja further pleads that the detainees be produced before the courts that any investigation of the detainees should be done independently of the fbi or any other foreign intelligence agency8 that the fbi and other american officials be restrained from interfering in pakistans affairs and that the grounds for the arrest of the individuals in question be produced gop assurances at tripartite of beradar transfer 5 c the beradar arrest was raised at february 24 tripartite meeting of fbi director robert mueller minister rehman malik of the pakistan ministry of interior and minister atmar hanif of the afghan ministry of interior in islamabad there was agreement from either side about the transfer of wanted persons 6 c in the meeting malik provided list of pakistans most wanted to atmar and requested the same from atmar malik named one of the most wanted known baloch separatist bramdagh bugti and asked atmar to assist in locating the individual and returning him to pakistan malik also stated islamabad 00000461 0022 of 003 that both countries had expressed interest in passing prisoner lists naming the nationals of one country being detained by the other country atmar said his government did not know where the baloch separatists were located and would need more information from the gop to find them 7 c atmar highlighted that three afghan taliban leaders including mullah beradar had been recently detained in pakistan and advised that afghanistan would be interested in developing dialogue to have these three deported malik noted that these detainees currently were not pending in the courts but the he would seek additional information on the matter atmar further advised that pursuant to discussions between pakistan isi and afghan nds 38 afghans were to be deportedrepatriated in the near future but these afghans had not been sent back to afghanistan 8 c the two ministers agreed that in regards to prisoners the countries needed to draft an agreement to exchange prisoners malik agreed to provide prisoner list to atmar listing the 38 3 in regards to the most wanted lists the ministers agreed to share intelligence at the upcoming focal point meeting on the most wanted atmar invited the fbi to participate in these discussions and work with both countries on the efforts to locate the most wanted persons director mueller accepted the invitation and pledged the fbis full support 9 c director mueller strongly suggested that as the two countries moved forward the prisoner and most wanted lists should not be made public he urged both minister atmar and minister malik to restrain from comments to the press advice which was apparently ignored the names on the lists could be key to sensitive investigations and making the names public might jeopardize investigations the fbi director explained malik denies gop agreement to transfer beradar 10 c given all the confusing press reporting ambassador contacted minster rehman malik in dubai on february 26 to ask if there was anything conveyed to the afghans about deporting taliban apart from the discussion in the trilateral meeting in which she ambassador eikenberry and many others had participated malik firmly denied that there had been any agreement to extradite or deport mullah beradar or any of the other taliban leaders 11 c malik claimed atmar had jumped the gun to the press with his suggestion that some agreement had been reached malik said he had told the press that pakistan would consider request to deport beradar and the others if they in fact received such request malik said pakistan had its own procedures to follow and they had to be sure beradar hadnt committed any crimes in pakistan malik said he had talked to general pasha ambassador pressed him on this point and malik claimed he would not have failed to coordinate with everyone in his government 12 c ambassador asked interior secretary deputy minister qamar zaman the same question on february 26 he was fairly certain that the only exchange on this issue was the one conducted in the february 24 tripartite meeting he speculated that minister atmar might have been under pressure from his local press to put positive spin on the meeting 13 c comment the tripartite meeting was follow up to the earlier may 2009 meeting in washington it made progress on number of fronts which will be reported septel but the issue of wanted persons dominated the press play after the meeting rehman malik was at pains to convince us that deal had been made with the afghans 14 c comment contd as most of our readers know the presence of baloch separatists bramdagh bugti in afghanistan has long been neuralgic one with the gop particularly with the gop military accordingly post believes øthat we should watch out for consideration of some type of exchange of berader with bugti but we do not believe that the pakistani islamabad 00000461 0032 of 003 government especially those who control beraders fatekayani and pashawould willingly lose control of such huge potential propaganda pawn in beradar while bugti may be core issue at some political level the truths berader could tell about isi not to mention host of other pakistani notables likely outweigh any potential wins in bringing bugti to pakistani justice 15 c comment contd to state the obvious the consistent press leaks in the media about american intelligence operations in the us have lots of unexpected consequences most obviously press leaks enabled the highly unpredictable and antiamerican lahore high court to issue judgment decrying the presence of us intelligence agents in the berader case end comment patterson
