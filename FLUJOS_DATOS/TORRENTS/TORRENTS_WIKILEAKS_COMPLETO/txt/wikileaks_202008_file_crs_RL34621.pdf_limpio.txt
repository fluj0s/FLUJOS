stine resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621capturing co2 from coalfired power plants challenges for comprehensive strategy summary any comprehensive approach to subs tantially reduce greenhouse gases must address the worlds dependenc on coal for quarter of its energy demand including almost half of its electric ity demand to maintain coal in the worlds energy mix in carbonconstrained future would require development of technology to capture and store its carbon dioxide emissions this situation suggests to some that any greenhouse gas reduction prog ram be delayed until such carbon capture technology has been demonstrated however technol ogical innovation and the demands of carbon control re gime are interlinked technology policy is substitute for environmental policy and must be developed in concert with it much of the debate about devel oping and commercializing carbon capture technology has focused on the role of research development and deployment technologypush mechanisms however for technology to be fully commercialized it must also meet market demand demand created either through price mechanism or regulatory requirement d emandpull mechanisms any conceivable carbon capture t echnology for coalfired powerplants will increase the cost of electricity generation from affected plants because of efficiency losses therefore few companies are likely to install such technology until they are required to either by regulation or by carbon price regu lated industries may find their regulators reluctant to accept the risks and cost of installing technology that is not required the department of energy doe s invested millions of dollars since 1997 in carbon capture technology research nd development rd and the question remains whether it has been too much too little or about the right amount in addition to appropriating funds each year for the doe program congress supported rd investment through provisions for an guarantees and tax credits congress also authorized significant expansion of carbon capture nd sequestration ccs spending at doe in the energy i ndependence and security act of 2007 legislation has also been introduced in the 110th congress that would authorize spending for carbon capture technology velopment other legislation introduced invokes the symbolism of the manhattan project of the 1940s and the apollo program of the 1960s to frame proposals for largescale energy policy initiatives that include developing ccs tec hnology however commercia lization of technology and integration of technology into the privat market were not goals of either the manhattan project or apollo program finally it should be noted that the stat us quo for coal with respect to climate change legislation isnt necessarily the same as business as usual the financial markets and regulatory authorities appear to be hedging their bets on the outcomes of any federal legislation with respect to greenhouse gas reductions and becoming increasingly unwilling to accept the risk of coalfired power plant with or without carbon capture capacity the lack of regula tory scheme presents numerous risks to any research and development effort desi gned to develop carbon capture technology ultimately it also presents risk to the future of coalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621contents introduction coal and

coalfired power plants challenges for comprehensive strategy introduction coal and greenhouse gas emissions the world meets 25 of its primary energy demand with coal number projected to increase steadily over the next 25 years overall coal is responsible for about 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions1 with respect to carbon dioxide co2 the most prevalent greenhouse gas coal combustion was responsible for 41 of the worlds co2 emissions in 2005 11 billion metric tons2 coal is particularly important for electricity supply in 2005 coal was responsible for about 46 of the world s power generation including 50 of the electricity generated in the united states 89 of the electricity generated in china and 81 of the electric ity generated in india3 coalfired power generation is estimated to increase 23 annually through 2030 with re sulting co2 emissions estimated to increase from 79 billion metric tons per year to 139 billion metric tons per year for example during 2006 it is estimated that china added over 90 gigawatts gw of new coalfired ge nerating capacity potentially adding an additional 500 million tric tons of co2 to the atmosphere annually4 developing means to control coald erived greenhouse gas emissions is an imperative if serious reductions in worldwide emissions are to occur in the foreseeable future developing technol ogy to accomplish this task in an environmentally economically and operationally acceptable manner has been an ongoing interest of the federal government and energy companies for decade but commercial device to capture and store these emissions is currently available for largescale coalfired power plantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621crs2 5 for general discussion of carbon capt ure and sequestration see crs report rl33801 carbon

emerging policy issues and crs report rl34316 pipelines for carbon dioxide co2 control network needs and cost uncertainties by paul w parfomak and peter folgerarguably the most economic and technolog

component of ccs system can be the dominant costv ariable and the component that could be improved most dramatically by further t echnological advancemen t as indicated in table 1 capture costs could be 510 times the cost of storage breakthrough technologies that substantially reduce the cost of capturing co2 from existing or new power plants for example by 50 or more would immediately reshape the economics of ccs moreover technological breakthroughs would change the economics of ccs irrespective of regulatory framework that emerges and governs how co2 is transported away from the pow er plant

capture and sequestration as major greenhouse gas abatement option november 2007 p 11 note capture and storage costs are very sitespecific these estimates reflect the magnitude of difference between capture and storage costs actual sitespecific costs could vary substantially from these estimates estimates do not include any transportation costs in contrast the cost of transporting co2 and sequestering it underground is likely less dependent on technological breakth roughs than on other factors such as the costs of construction materials and labor in the case of pipelines for co2 transport the degree of geologic charact erization required to permit sequestration the requirements for measuring monitoring and verifyingpermanent co 2 storage the costs of acquiring surface and subsurface rights to store co2 costs of insurance and longterm liability and other variables driving the cost of transportation and sequestration6 that is not to say that the transpor tation and storage components of ccs are independent of cost and timin g depending on the degree of public acceptance of ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621crs3 largescale ccs enterprise the transporta tion and sequestration costs could be very large and it may take years to reach agreement on the regulatory framework that would guide longterm co2 sequestration but the vari ables driving cost and timing for the transportation and storage of co2 are less amenable to technological solution this report examines the current effort to develop technology that would capture co2 first the paper outlines the current status of carbon capture technology second the paper examines the role of g overnment in developing that technology both in terms of creating market for carbon capture technology and encouraging development of the technology finally the paper concludes with discussion of implications of capture technolog for climate change legislation background what is carbon capture technology and what is its status major reductions in coalfired co2 emissions would require either pre combustion combustion modification or pos tcombustion devices to capture the co2 because there is currently over 300 gw of coalfired electric generating capacity in the united states and about 600 gw in china retrofittable post combustion capture device could have substantial market depending on the specifics of any climate change program the following discussion provides brief summary of technology under development th at may be available in the nearterm it is not an exhaustive survey of the t echnological initiatives currently underway in this area but illustrative of the range of activity funding for current government research and development activities to improve these technologies and move them to commercialization are discussed later postcombustion co2 capture postcombustion co2 capture involves treating the burner exhaust gases immediately before they enter the stack the advantage of this approach is that it would allow retrofit at existing fac ilities that can accommodate the necessary capturing hardware and ancillary equipment in this sense it is like retrofitting post combustion sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox or particulate control on an existing facility simplified illustration of this process is provided in figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621crs4

introduction to co2 capture and sequestration technology utility engineering may 2008 p 3 source scottish centre for carbon storage figu re available at h ttp wwwgeosedacuk sccscapturepostcombustionhtml postcombustion processes capture the co2 from the exhaust gas through the use of distillation membranes or absorp tion physical or chemical the most widelyused capture technology is the ch emical absorption process using amines typically monoethanolamine mea availa ble for industrial applications pilot plant research on using ammonia also an mine as the chemical solvent is currently underway with demonstrati on plants nnounced these approaches to carbon capture are discussed below numerous other so lventbased postcom bustion processes are in the benchscale stage7 monoethanolamine mea the mea co2 carbon capture process is the most proven and tested capture process ava ilable the basic design common to most solventbased processes i nvolves passing the exhaust gases through an absorber where the mea interacts with the co2 and absorbs it the now co2rich mea is then pumped to stripper also called rege nerator which uses steam to separate the co2 from the mea water is removed from the resulting co2 which is compressed while the regenerated mea is purged of any contaminants such as ammonium sulfate and recirculated back to the absorber the process can be optimized to remove 9095 of the co2 from the flue gas8 although proven on an industrial scale it has not been applied to the typically larger volumes of flue gas streams created by coalfired powerplants the technology has three main drawbacks that would ma ke current use on coalfired powerplant quite costly first is the need to divert steam away from its primary use generating electricity to be used instead for stripping co2 from mea second related problem is the energy required to compress the co2 after its captured needed for transport through pipelines which wers overall powerplant efficiency and increases generating costs recent st udy by the massachusetts institute of technology mit estimated the efficiency losses from the installation of mea from figure 1 simplified illust

an existing plant9 this loss of efficiency comes in addition to the necessary capital and operations and maintenance cost of the equipment and r eagents for new construction the increase in electricity generating cost on leveliz ed basis would be 6070 depending on the boiler technology10 in the case of retrofit plants where the capital costs were fully amortized the mea capture process would increase generating costs on levelized basis by about 22025011 third drawback is degradation of th amine through either overheating over 205 degrees fahrenheit f in the absorber or through oxidation from oxygen introduced in the wash water chemical slurry or flue gas that reacts with the mea for example residual so2 in the flue gas will react with the mea to form ammonium sulfate that must be purged from the system12 this could be serious problem for existing plants that do not have highly efficient flue gas desulfurization fgd or selective catalytic reduction s cr devices or none requiring either upgrading of existing fgd and scr equipment or installation of them in addition to the mea process chilled ammonia alstom an approach to mitigating the oxidation problem identified above is to use an ammoniabased solvent rather than mea ammonia is an amine that absorbs co2 at slower rate than mea in chilled ammonia process the flue gas temperat ure is reduced from about 130 degrees f to about 3560 degrees f this lower temperat ure has two benefits 1 it condenses the residual water in the flue gas which minimizes the volume of flue gas entering the absorber and 2 it causes pollutants in the flue gas such as so2 to drop out reducing the need for substantial upg rading of upstream control devices13 using slurry of ammonium carbonate and ammoni um bicarbonate the solvent absorbs more than 90 of the co2 in the flue gas the resulting co2rich ammonia is regenerated and the co2 is stripped from the ammonia mix ture under pressure 300 pounds per square inch psi compared with 15 psi using mea reducing the energy necessary to compress the co2 for transportation generally around 1500 psi14 the chilled ammonia process is proprie tary process owned by alstom in

capture from existing coalfired facilitie s does not involve chilling the flue gas before it enters the absorber using higher flue gas temperatures increases the co2 absorption rate in the absorber

syngas is cleaned of conventional pollutants so2 particulates and sent to shift reactor which uses steam and catalyst to produce co2 and hydrogen because the gases are under substantial pressure with high co2 content physical solvent can separate out the co2 the advantage of physical solvent is that the co2 can be freed and the solvent regenerated by reducing the pressure process that is substantially less energyintensive than having to heat the gas as in an mea stripper source scottish centre for carbon storage figu re available at h ttp wwwgeosedacuk sccscaptureprecombustionhtml from the capture process the co2 is further compressed for transportation or storage and the hydrogen is directed through gas and steam cycles to produce electricity mit estimates the efficiency loss

of the flue gas exiting the boiler the more concentrated the co2 is when it exits the boiler the less energy and cost is required later to prepare it for transport or storag the most developed approach involves combusting the coal with nearly pure oxygen 95 instead of air resulting in flue gas consisting mainly of highly concentrated co2 and water vapor using existing technology the oxygen would be provide d by an airseparation unit an energy intensive process that would be the primary source of reduced efficiency the details of this oxyfuel process are still being refined but generally from the boiler the exhaust gas is cleaned of conventional pollutants so2 nox and particulates and some of the gases recycled to the boiler to control the higher temperature resulting from coal combustion with pure oxygen the rest of the gas stream is sent for further purification and compression in prepar ation for transport andor storage23 depending on sitespecific conditions oxyfuel could

demandpull mechanism economists note that the driving force behind the development of new and improved technologies is the profit motive however market forces will provide insufficient incentives to develop climatefriendly technologies if the market prices of energy inputs do not fully reflect their social cost inclusive of environmental consequences even if energy prices reflect all production costs without an explicit greenhouse gas policy firms have incentive to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions per beyond the motivation to economize on energy costs for example utility would happily find way to generate the same amount of electricity with less fuel but without policy that makes carbon dioxide emissions costly it would not care specifically about the carbon content of its fuel mix in choosing between say coal and natural gas for firms to have the desire to innovate cheaper and better ways to reduce emissions and not merely inputs they mu st bear additional financial costs for emissions34 much of the focus of debate on deve loping carbon capture technology has been on research development and demonstration rdd needs however for technology to be fully co mmercialized it must

enhanced environmental diligence process february 2008 p 1will increase the cost of electricity generation from affected plants with increase in efficiency therefore widespread commercializa tion of such technology is unlikely until it is required either by regulation or by carbon price indeed regulated industries ma find their regulators reluctan t to accept the risks and cost of installing technology that is not required by legislation this sentiment was reflected in recent decision by the virginia state corporation commission in denying an application by appalachian power company apco for rate adjustment to construct an igcc facility the company asserted that the value of th is project is directly related to 1 potential future legal requirements for carbon capture and sequestration and 2 the proposed igcc plants potential ability to comply cost effectively with any such requirements both of these fact ors however are unknown at this time and do not overcome the other infirmities in the application the legal necessity of and the capability of costeffective carbon capture and sequestration in this particular igcc plant at this time has not been sufficiently established to render apcos application reasonable or prude nt under the virginia statute we must follow35 at the same time there is reluctance to i nvest in technology that is not required the unresolved nature of greenhouse gas regu lation is affecting investment in any coalfired generation36 the risk involved in investin g in coalfired generation absent anticipated greenhouse gas regulations is outlined in the carbon principles announced by three wall street banks citi jp morgan chase and morgan stanley in february 2008 as stated in their paper the absence of comprehensive federal action on climate change creates unknown financial risks for those building and financing new fossil fuel generation resources the financial institutions that have signed the principles recognize that federal co2 control legislation is being considered and is likely to be adopted during the service life of many ne w power plants it is prudent to take concrete actions today that help develope rs investors and financiers to identify analyze reduce and mitigate climate risks37 similarly lack of regulatory scheme presents numerous risks to any rdd effort designed to develop carbon capture technology unlike

focused on new construction such as th new source performance standard under section 111 of the clean air act41 could be used to phase in deployment of carbon capture technology nd prevent more coalfired facilities from being constructed without carbon capture or ensure they would be at least ready for carbon capture later at the same time carbon tax or capandtrade program could be initiated to begin sending market signal to companies that further controls will be necessary in the future if they decide to continue operating coalfired facilities creating demand through re gulatory

states that nsps should reflect the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which taking into account the cost of achieving such reductions and any nonair quality health and nvironmental impact and ergy requirements the administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated45 in promulgating its first utility so2 nsps in

stringent so2 controls which opened up market for retrofits of existing coalfired facilities inaddition to the nsps focus on new facilities indeed most of the growth in fgd installations during the early and mid1970s was in retrofits taylor estimates that between 1973 and 1976 72 of the f gd market was in retrofits 49 by 1977 there were 14 vendors offering fulls cale commercial fgd installation50 however despite this growth only 10 of the new coalfired facilities constructed between 1973 nd 1976 had fgd installations in addition the early performance of these devices was not brilliant51 in 1974 american electric power aep spearheaded an ad campaign to have epa reject fgd devices as too unreliable too impractical for electric utility use in favor of tall stacks supplementary controls and lowsulfur western coal52 this effort was ultimately unsuccessful as the congress chose to modify the nsps requirements for coalfired electric generators in 1977 by adding percentage reduction requirement as promulgated in 1979 the revised so2 nsps retained the 1971 performance standard but added requirement for 7090 reduction in emissions depending on the sulfur content of the coal53 at the time this requirement could be met only through use of an fgd device the effect of the scrubber requirement is clear from the data provided in figure 7 based on their

development of technology through creating market should not suggest that the government was limited to that role or that the process was smooth or seamless on the latter point shattuck et summarize the early years of fgd development as follows the standards of performance for new sources are technologyforcing and for the utility industry they forced the development of technology that had never been installed on facilities the size of utility plants that technology had to be developed and number of installations completed in short period of time the us epa continued to force t echnology through the promulgation of successive regulations the development of the equipment was not an easy process what may have appeared to be the simple application of an equipment item from one industry to another often rned out to be fraught with unforeseen challenges55 the example indi cates that technologyforcing re gulations can be effective in pulling technology into the market even when there remains some operational difficulties for that technology the diffe rence for carbon capture technology is that for longterm widespread development ne w infrastructure of pipelines and storage sites may be necessary in addition to ffective carbon capture technology in the shortterm suitable alternatives such as enhanced oil recovery needs and insitu geologic storage may be available to support early commercialization projects without the need for an integrated tran sport and storage system likewise with economics more favorable for new facilities than for retrofits concentrating on using

deployment regulatory approach such as nsps may represent first step as suggested by the so2 nsps example above creating demand through price signal carbon taxes allowance pricing and auctions much of the current discussion of deve loping marketpull mechanism for new carbon capture technology has focused on cr eating price for carbon emissions the literature suggests that this is an im portant component for developing new technology perhaps more important even th an research and deve lopment as stated by the congressional budget office cbo analyses that consider the costs and be nefits of both carbon pricing and rd all come to the same qualitative conclusion nearterm pricing of carbon emissions is an element of costeffective policy approach that result holds even though studies make different assumptions about the availability of alternative energy technologies the amount of crowding out caused by federal subsidies and the form of the policy target maximizing net benefits versus minimizing the cost of reaching target56 two basic approaches can be employed in the case of marketbased greenhouse gas control program carbon ta x and capandtrade program the carbon tax would create longterm pri ce signal to stimulate innovation and development of new technology this pri ce signal could be strengthened if the carbon tax were escalated over the long r either by statutorily determined percentage or by an index such as th producer price index carbon taxs basic approach to controlling greenhouse gas emi ssions is to supply the marketplace with stable consistent price si gnal signal that would also inform innovators as to the cost performance targets th ey should seek in developi ng alternative technologies designed appropriately there would be little danger of the price spikes or market volatility that can occur in the early stages of tradeable permit program57 capandtrade program creates price signal for new technology through market price for carbon permits called allowances an allowance is limited authorization to emit one metric ton of carbon di oxide equivalent co2e in cap andtrade system these allowances are issued by the government and either allocated or auctioned to affected companies who may use them to comply with the cap sell them to other companies on the market or bank them for future use or sale the resulting market transactions

university of cambridge electricity policy research gro up may 2007 pp 36 shortsqueeze is situation where the price of stock or co mmodity rises and investors who sold short believing the price was going to fall rush to buy it to cover their short position and cut their losses emissions however can be both uncertain and volatile58 in addition low allowance price may be insufficient to encourage technology development and refinement for example the 1990 acid rain control program ffectively ended the development of fgd for retrofit purposes by setting an emission cap that resulted in low allowance prices and that could be met through the use of lowsulfur coal noting that only 10 of phase 1 facilities chose fgd to comply with its requirements taylor et state the 1990 caaa however alt hough initially predicted to increase demand for fgd systems eroded the market poten tial for both dry and wet fgd system applications at existing power plants when the so2 allowance trading market returned lowsulfur coal to its importance in so2 control as result research in dry fgd technology declined signif icantly in this case the flexibility provided by the 1990 acid rain regulations discouraged inventive activity in technologies that might have had broader markets under the traditional commandandcontrol regimes in place prior to 199059 footnotes from original text omitted capandtrade program need not have such result for example to more effectively promote carbon capture technol ogy the price signal under greenhouse gas reduction program could be strengthened by requiring the periodic auctioning of substantial portion of available allowances rather than giving them away at cost the so2 program allocated virtually all of its allowance at cost to affected companies auctioning substantial porti on of available allowances could create powerful price signal and provide incen tives for deploying new technology if structured properly60 the program could create price floor to facilitate investment in new technology via reserve price in th allowance auction process in addition the stability of that price signal could be strengthened by choosing to auction allowances on frequent basis ensuring availability of allowances close to the time of expected demand and making any pot ential shortsqueezing of the secondary market more

united states invest in energy research development and demonstration activ ities at the same level of commitment as it invested in the past during the manha ttan project and the apollo program as analogues to the development of technologies to reduce co2 emissions and thwart longterm climate change the manhattan project and apollo program are imperfect at best they both had shortterm goals their success or failure was easily measured and perhaps most importantly th ey did not depend on the successful commercialization of tec hnology and its adoption by the private sector nevertheless

comparisons to co2 capture rd at doe current doe spending on ccs technology development d iscussed above is far below levels of funding for the manhattan project and apollo program and for the energy technology rd programs at their peak spending in the late 1970s and early 1980s the development of co2 capture technology is of course only one component of all federal spending on global climate change mitigati on however the total nnual federal expenditures on climate change including basic research are still far less than the manhattan project and apollo program although similar to doe energy tec hnology development programs during their peak spending period87 for comparison the fy2008 budget and fy2009 budget request for does energy technology rd is approximately 3 billion per year see figure 10 even if spending on co2 capture technology were increased dramatically to manhattan project or apollo program levels it is not clear whether the goal of developing commercially ployable technology would be realized as mentioned above commercializati on of technology and integration of technology into the private market were not goals of either the manhattan project or apollo program for the manhattan project it did not matter wh at the cost was in one sense if consequence of failing to build nuclear weapon was to lose the war for co2 capture the primary goal is to develop

omitted one of the primary reasons commonly cited for the failure of the sfc was the collapse of crude oil prices during the 1980s although other factors contributed89 without stable and predictable pri ce for the commodity that the sfc was attempting to produce in specific mandated quantities the structure of the sfc was unable to cope with market changes the failure of the federal governments ffort to create synthetic fuels industry yields valuable lessons about the role of government in technology innovation the synthetic fuels program was establis hed without sufficient flexibility to meet changes in market conditions such as th price of fuel public unwillingness to endure the environmental costs of some of the largescale projects was an added complication an emphasis on production targets was an added complication an emphasis on production targets reduced research and program flexibility rapid turnover among sfcs highlevel officials slowed administrative actions the synthetic fuels program did demonstr ate however that largescale synthetic energy projects could be build and operated within specified technical parameters90 citations from original text omitted it may be argued that the demise of does futuregen program as originally conceived see box above was partly attri butable to the projects inflexibility in dealing with changing market conditions in this case the rise in materials and construction costs and the doubling of future gens original pri ce estimate however the analogy between futuregen and the sfc is limited although the sfc failed in part because of collapsing oil prices the costs of the sfc program could be measured against the benefits of produc ing oil for futuregen the value of co2 avoided ie the benefit provided by the t echnology was not even calculable for comparison to the costs of building the plant because there is real global price for co2 the market conditions that contributed to the downfall of the sfc however could be very different from the market conditions that would arise following the creation of price for co2 emissions the stability and predictability of the price signal would depend on the mechanism carbon tax allowance pricing or auctions mechanism that allowed for longt erm price signal for carbon would likely benefit co2 capture technology rd programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621crs32 91 carolyn fischer climate change poli cy choices and technical innovation resources for the future climate issue brief 20 june 2000 p 9implications for climate change legislation any comprehensive approach to reduc ing greenhouse gases substantially must address the worlds dependenc on coal for quarter of its energy demand including almost half of its electric ity demand to maintain coal as key component in the worlds energy mix in carbonconstraine d future would require developing technology to capture and store its co2 emissions this situation suggests to some that any greenhouse gas reduction progra m be delayed until such carbon capture technology has been demonstrated ho wever technological innovation and the demands of carbon control regime are inte rlinked therefore technology policy is substitute for environmental policy and must be developed in concert with it91 this linkage raises issues for legisl ators attempting to craft greenhouse gas reduction legislation for th demandpull side of the equation the issue revolves around how to create the appropriate market for emerging carbon capture technologies table 3 compares four different price signals across five different criteria that influence their eff ectiveness in promoting technology magnitude what size of price signal or stringency of the regulation is imposed initially direction what influences the directi on up or down of the price signal or stringency of the regulation over time timing how quickly is the price or regulation imposed and strengthened stability how stable is the price or regulation over time duration how long is the price or regulation imposed on affected companies in general the criteria suggest that regu lation is the surest method of forcing the development of technology price is not necessarily direct consideration in decisionmaking however regulation is also the most limiting technologies more or less stringent than the standard w ould have limited domes tic market although foreign opportunities may be available and developmen t could be frozen if the standards are not reviewed and strengthen ed periodically in contrast allowance prices would provide the most equivocal signal particularly if they are allocated free to participants experience has shown allowance prices to be subject to volatility with swings both up and down the experience with the so2 capandtrade program suggests the incentive can be improved with bonus allowances however the eligibility criteria used could be perceived as the government attempting to pick winner httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621

with reserve price provide strong market based price signals carbon tax is the most stable price signal providing clear and transparent signal of the value of any method of greenhouse gas reductions substa ntial auctioning of allowances also places price on carbon emissions price that can be strengthened by incorporating reserve price into the structure of the auction however each of these signals ultimate ly depends on the environmental goal envisioned and the specifics of the cont rol program 1 the stringency of the reduction requirement 2 the timing of desired reductions 3 the techniques allowed to achieve compliance the interp lay of these factors informs the technology community about the urgency of the need for carbon capture technology the price signal informs the community what costp erformance parameters are appropriate for the emerging carbon market the nature of that price signal regulatory market stability informs the community of the confidence it can have that it is not wasting capital on white elephant or on project that the market does not want or need the issues for technologypush mechanis ms are broader and include not only the specifics of any reduction program and resulting price signal but also international considerations and the in terplay between carbon capture technology storage and the potential need for co2 transport groups as diverse as the pew center the electric power research institute doe and mit have suggested roadmaps and other schemes for prepar ing carbon capture technology for pending greenhouse gas reduction program92 generally all of these approaches agree on the need for demonstrationsize 200 300 mw projects to sort out technical performance and cost effectiveness and identify potential environmental and safety concerns the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 reflected congress desire for more inte grated demonstration projects and does restructured approach to futuregen purpor tedly provides incentives for integrating capture technology on igcc plants of 300 mw or greater finally it should be noted that the stat us quo for coal with respect to climate change legislation isnt necessarily the sa as business as usual the financial markets and regulatory authorities appear to be hedging their bets on the outcomes of any federal legislati on with respect to greenhouse gas reductions and are becoming increasingly unwilling to accept the risk of coalfired power plant with or without carbon capture capacity this so rt of limbo for coalfired powerplants is reinforced by the mit study which make s strong case against subsidizing new construction allowed for igcc under the epact2005 without carbon capture because of the unattractive costs of retrofitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34621crs35 93 mit the future of coal pp 9899coal plants will not be cheap to retrofit for co2 capture our analysis confirms that the costs to retrofit an airdriven scpc supercritical pulverized coal plant for significant co2 capture say 90 will be greater than the costs to retrofit an igcc plant however the modifications needed to retrofit an igcc plant for appreciable ccs are extensive and not ma tter of simply adding single simple and inexpensive process step to an existing igcc plant consequently igcc plants without ccs that receive assistance under the 2005 energy act will be more costly to retrofit and less likely to do so the concept of capture ready igcc or pulverized coal plant is as yet unproven and unlikely to be fruitful the energy act envisions capture ready to apply to gasification technology citation omitted retrofitting igcc plants or for that matter pulverized coal plants to incorporate ccs technology involves substantial additional investments and si gnificant penalty to the efficiency and net electricity output of the plant as result we are unconvinced that such financial assistance to conventional igcc plants without ccs is wise93 emphasis in original as noted earlier lack of regulato ry scheme or carbon price presents numerous risks to any research and devel opment effort designed to develop carbon capture technology ultimately it also pr esents risk to the future of coal
