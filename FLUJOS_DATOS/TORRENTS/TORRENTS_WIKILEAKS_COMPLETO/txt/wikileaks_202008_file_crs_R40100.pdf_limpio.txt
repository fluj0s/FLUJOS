has progressed increasing concern has been raised about how us reduction program would interact with those of other countries in global context where currently some countries have legally binding policies to reduce greenhouse gas emission and other countries do notie differentiated global carbon policiesthe potential exists that countries imposing carbon control policies will find themselves at competitive disadvantage visàvis countries without comparable policies the risks accompanying establishment of carbon control policies in the absence of similar policies among competing nations have been central to debates on whether the united states should enact greenhouse gas legislation specifically concerns have been raised that if the united states adopts carbon control policy industries th at must control their emissions or that find their feedstock or energy bills rising because of costs passedthrough by suppliers may be less competitive and may lose global market share and jobs to competitors in countries lacking comparable carbon policies in addition this potential shift in production could result in some of the us carbon reductions being counteracted by increased production in less regulated countries commonly known as carbon leakage there are three basic approaches which are not mutually exclusive to assist greenhouse gas intensive tradeexposed industries 1 directly supporting domestic industries 2 penalizing foreign competitors and 3 developing alternative sectoral approaches importantly these are presumably transitional actions pending some international agreement that levels the playing field each approach has its own focus support for dom estic industries embodied in most legislative proposals is focused on preserving the industrys current competitive position and jobs and may depending on the details help transition that industry to the future it does not directly promote an international agreement trade measures levied against foreign competitors another approach being proposed may provide stick for international negotiation but the primary focus is on protecting greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries from unfair competition producers in countries not imposing comparable carbon control policies finally the sectoral approach represents range of options focused on integrating developing countries industrial base into mutually acceptable international framework that provides level playing field for all participants whether any of these approaches would have any appreciable effect on carbon leakage is unclear the design of an assistance programthe goals eligible participants implementation and enforcementwould be difficult to define in manner that satisfies all parties there is every incentive for any industry facing cost increase from carbon policies to claim that its competitive position could be diminished thereby justifying special consideration by the government the government would be in the difficult position of picking winners and losers sometimes without access to important but proprietary data httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40100g515g5g138g155g139g152g151g561g14g142g138g148g138

being diluted by increased production in more carbon intensive countries commonly known as carbon leakage 1 in response to these concerns several proposals introduced in congress would attempt to mitigate the effect of carbon policies on affected us industry proposed mitigating actions include for example providing assistance to greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries or imposing tariffs on certain greenhouse gasintensive goods imported into the country from countries not implementing comparable carbon policies this report examines the dynamics of this issue in three parts 1 exploration of the nature of the problem with respect to international climate change policy potential environmental effects and potential economic effects 2 identification of range of possible

its impact on the countrys competitiveness and its comprehensiveness with respect to developing countries who currently have binding reduction targets2 these three considerations the three cs are interlinked especially the international aspects of competitiveness and comprehensiveness that international agreement addresses the international competitiveness and comprehensiveness issues has led to major debate in the congress about whether to include unilateral trade provisions targeted subsidies or other provisions in any domestic greenhouse gas reduction scheme to address them it should be emphasized that this debate results from the lack of comprehensive international agreement to mandate strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the most effective and efficient solution both economically and environmentally would be comprehensive agreement climate change is global problem ultimately requiring global solution any unilateral solution considered necessary would probably be temporary and transitional in nature as stated by the australian government in its green paper on reducing carbon emissions the first best solution to address the competitive concerns of eite emissionsintensive tradeexposed industries3 would be to develop comprehensive global agreement under which all major emitters have binding carbon constraints effective sectoral agreements for eite industries would also address these concerns for industries covered by such agreements however in the absence of these developments assisting eite industries in response to the introduction of the scheme may be warranted on environmental grounds and because it may smooth the transition of the economy 4 however it is not clear when such an agreement will be concluded and whether it would be acceptable to the united states international working groups set up under the bali action plan to develop postkyoto agreement are schedul ed to present their results at the copenhagen meeting of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc cop15 and the meet ing of the parties to the kyoto protocol scheduled for november 30 december 11 2009 successful conclusion to these ongoing efforts leading up to that conference could render this issue moot

differentiated carbon policies and their resulting impacts on greenhouse gas emissions the phenomenon is much more complicated involving differences in countries economies such as labor costs and exchanges rates and trade flows among them 5 thus carbon leakage like the job leakage issues discussed later is an 2 for further discussion of the evolution of us climate change policy see crs report

are enacted the focus here is on minimizing carbon leakage resulting specifically from differentiated carbon policies in the context of analyzing the effect of differentiated carbon policies carbon leakage is two fold problem the first is the possibility that introduction of carbon control regime in country ahead of the introduction of comparable policy in competing countries could result in the production of greenhouse gasintensive products diminishing in the country attempting to control emissions and increasing in competing countries with carbon controls basically countries with carbon controls risk losing global market share to competing countries without controls this would counteract the net reductions achieved by the country attempting to address climate change and reward economically the countries that were not the second problem is longerterm possibility that future investments by greenhouse gas intensive industries could be channeled to countries with or less stringent carbon controls circumventing carbon reduction needs and potentially locking in obsolete technology this relocation and construction of new facilities without carbon control could make future reductions more difficult and expensive studies of potential carbon leakage resulting from strategies to reduce greenhouse gases have produced range of estimates the only attempt to estimate the leakage impact of proposed us legislation is the environmental protection agencys epa analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 s 2191 in the 110 th congress6 not surprisingly leakage estimate for the year 2050 is highly dependent on assumptions about the us economy international actions to reduce emissions and us reduction strategies7 epa found that if non annex i countries8 were to adopt greenhouse gas reduction target beginning in 2025 that holds their emissions at 2015 levels through 2034 and then further reduce their emissions to 2000 levels thereafter then emission leakage would occur under the proposed legislation this result emphasizes the above point that the most effective solution to the leakage problem would be longterm agreement to incorporate developing countries into an international accord on greenhouse gas emissions epa also conducted sensitivity analysis assuming greenhouse gas reductions by nonannex 1 countries through 2050 under this scenario leakage of us reductions were estimated at about 11 in 2030 and 89 in 2050 9 epa notes that part of the reason for the somewhat modest leakage rates estimated by the model is the significant demand by annex i countries for international credits from nonannex i countries reducing their emissions 6 us environmental protection agency office of atmospheric program epa analysis of

demand for aluminum and other commodities that has allowed manufacturers to pass on costs and remain profitable the short timeframe 20052007 that makes it difficult to discern potential longterm

be rather abstract term for which any precise meaning can be elusive as with carbon leakage competitiveness is co ntinuing phenomenon with companies becoming more or less competitive according to host of factors including productivity market demand resource costs labor costs exchange rates and the like as stated by the australian government in its green paper on carbon reduction schemes changes in the cost structures of entities and industries are not unusual and occur continuously in marketbased economy nor is it unusual for government policy to change cost structures for example the adoption of high quality occupational health and safety standards have affected the profitability of australias labourintensive traded industries making it more difficult for them to compete with foreign producers that are subject to lower standards assistance is not usually provided to offset the impact of domestic policies on traded industries as those policies reflect the priorities and values of the government and community more generally 12 most industries face competitive market sometimes international in scope both in terms of producers of the same products and producers of substitute products also in some cases an industry may face fairly elastic demand for its product thus most industries are price sensitive and therefore any increase in manufacturing costs as by carbon emission reduction requirement hurts the competitiveness of firm this complex situation is further complicated for energyintensive industries as competitors within the same industry may experience different energy price increases particularly for electric power depending on their individual energy needs and power arrangements for example an aluminum plant receiving power from hydro electric facility may not be affected the same way as similar plant whose power contract is with coalfired power supplier such differences among individual companies could have several potential impacts first as noted above it may affect the competitive balance of specific domestic facilities second investment decisions by industries could be affected particularly with respect to technology new more efficient technology is emerging for some processes the combination of high but volatile price signals being sent from the energy markets and potential ones from carbon policy could speed their development if commercialized new technology could reduce the impact of any carbon policy and indeed could improve competitiveness analysis in sufficient sector specific detail to examine this possibility or to develop proxies to explore the possibilities for industry technology over the next 40 years are beyond the scope of this report 11 terry barker and igor bashmakov ipcc wg3 2007 chapter 11 mitigation

primary factors 1 the greenhouse gas intensity of companys products which influences the companys profitability and the products cost 2 the companys ability to pass on any increased costs to consumers without losing market share or profitability and 3 the companys ability to mitigate carbon emissions reducing the impact of the carbon policy on its operations and profitability13 each of these factors involves web of sitespecific interactions g9g155g142g142g151g145g152g158g156g142g556g9g138g156g561g11g151g157g142g151g156g146g157g162g561 an industrys greenhousegas intensity factor is foundation both of any direct greenhouse gas emissions produced by the manufacturing proces s of the product eg pfcs from aluminum production co 2 from cement manufacture and of any indirect greenhouse gas emissions produced by the inputs to the manufacturing process eg electricity natural gas much of the discussion of greenhouse gasintensive industries is in fact discussion of energyintensive industries however as noted above this is an imperfect indicator as different plants will have different energy sources and thus different indirect greenhouse gas emissions in addition such focus ignores the 320 million metric tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions that us industrial processes emit directly that the impact of carbon policy on product prices employment and profitability is dependent on its greenhouse gas intensity is seemingly straightforward however the measurement of such intensity may not be metrics that could be used to determine carbon intensity include employment per unit of emissions value added by the production activities per unit of emissions or revenue generated by the activity per unit of emissions 14 each indicator differs in level of transparency variability over time and within sectors and emphasis on scheduling of capital structure and labor needs choosing an indicator or combination of indicators that all parties believe fairly represent the industries of concern would be challenging as suggested above industries can be greenhouse gasintensive from either the process they employ direct emissions or the energy fed into the process from outside indirect emissions or both the greenhouse gas intensity can be measured in terms of its impact on product price company profitability or labor most studies of greenhouse gasintensive industries actually focus on energyintensive industries table 2 provides data on the energyintensiveness of an illustrative set of manufacturing industries two metrics are displayed the first measures the importance of energy costs to the total value of the industrys products the second measures the importance of energy costs per person employed by the industry 13 carbon trust the

production figure 2 provides illustrative data from the united kingdom uk on the value chain of an integrated steel production process through its various steps using basic oxygen furnace bof to make its raw steel in bof iron ore is reduced to semifinished steel which is subsequently hot rolled and then further refined into specific finished products semifinished steel production is the most carbonintensive and electricityintensive step in integrated raw steel production in contrast the value produced at this step is relatively low compared with the emissions this ratio called the product value at stake v as means that the step would incur high co 2 cost increases relative to product value the extent to which these costs are spread across the subsequent production steps would lower the overall cost impact on final production15 this suggests that the primary competitiveness issu with bof is with the semifinish step of raw steel production this is illustrated in the figure by comparing the difference between the total cost increase solid line and the semifinished steel increase dashed line the relatively small increment of increase created by the downstream processes compared with semifinished steel production suggests the dominant effect of co 2induced cost increases from semifinished steel production on downstream production cost increases16 figur 2 v alue chain

combine crude steel making with hot rolling to avoid additional energy consumption in repeated heating cycles the more plant combines production steps the less the overall cost effect of carbon policy17 also the link between the bof and hot rolling plant may make relocation more difficult although if it occurs the affected community would lose both the bof and the hot rolling plant also as suggested by figure 1 the processes are not completely substitutable even if the crude steel is for example the use of electric arc furnaces is constrained by the availability of scrap steel

carbon policies is similarly differentiated the ability of companies to pass through costs from carbon policies primarily depends on three factors 1 the priceresponsiveness of demand for the product 2 market structure and dynamics that include the number of competitors and amount of regulation and stateownership and 3 the international scope of the competition particularly with respect to differentiated carbon policies 18 for example the electricity sector can generally pass on its costs to consumers because electricity demand is relatively priceinelastic the market structure is significantly regulated and there is very limited international competition from countries with carbon policies chlorine produced with very electricityintensive process is hazardous substance that could raise serious transport issues potentially reducing the ability to substitute foreign production for domestic production in contrast other sectors such as raw steel are in very competitive markets with significant international trade exposure although during periods of high demand for steel and other primary metals prices have risen substantially

consumers indicates that companies can raise prices in response to increased costs without substantial response by consumers to reduce use of the product or seek substitute elastic price behavior by consumers means they are sensitive to price increases and will seek to either reduce demand for product or seek substitute companies facing an elastic demand for their products because of available substitutes would have more difficult time passing on any cost increases resulting from carbon policies in contrast companies facing an inelastic demand for their products would have more flexibility in addressing the same cost increases based on review of the literature and their own estimating methodology sato and neuhoff estimated the short and long run effects of price changes on demand for

increases to consumers likewise industries where few companies have concentrated market power to influence prices may have an enhanced ability to pass through costs through their ability to influence prices to illustrate the degree of concentration in various parts of the manufacturing sector table 3 provides two indicators of market concentration across an illustrative sample of the us

by table 3 the broader industrial categories 3digit naics would suggest that market concentration is not major issue with respect to passthrough ability however as suggested by the previous discussion of greenhouse gas intensity disaggregating sector can reveal more complex situation for example the naics 3digit chemical category suggests little concentration in that sector however sampling of subcategories indicate several that are at least moderately concentrated there is similar situation for primary metals if the categories were disaggregated further to include categories such as glass container manufacturing 327213 or electrometallurgical ferroalloy product manufac turing 331112 more pockets of concentration would be found thus companies can be more able to pass through costs in some of their products than in others therefore unless eligibility requirements for any government assistance are sufficiently detailed to direct aid only to those categories that can not raise prices the government risks providing support for companies that dont need it of course the potential ability of companies to passthrough cost increases can be muted by international competition as discussed

on world markets if the price of its product is dictated by world supply and demand then its ability to raise prices may be constrained this situation could result in the sector deciding to reduce domestic production in the short term and moving factories overseas in the long run one measure of trade exposure is the penetration of imports as share of total us demand for product because it indicates the availability of foreign substitutes for that product 21 table 4 provides the 2006 import share of demand for variety of activities because of the aggregation issue identified above this is only rough indicator of sectors that could have difficulty passing on cost increases because of international competition as indicated several greenhouse gas intensive sectors have significant import penetration including primary metals nonferrous and ferrous basic chemicals and finished products that use these commodities including electronics machinery and transportation other

the reference case assumes that improvements in the energy intensity or processes in some subsectors eg aluminum food cement will avoid some 470 megatons of future emissions these improvements are not assured and still must be captured without supportive regulatory structures some of these improvements may not be made or the emission will be offshored to other economies with us domestic ghg

approaches to assisting greenhousegasintensive tradeexposed industries 1 assist domestic industry 2 penalize foreign competitors and 3 develop alternative sectoral approaches it should be noted that these categories are not mutually exclusive all three could be used either in combination for given industry or separately as appropriate to given industrys characteristics and needs

economic effects of carbon policies depending on the carbon scheme approach capandtrade carbon tax regulations etc the assistance could be in the form of 1 free allocation of allowances capandtrade program 2 tax credits carbon tax or 3 cash payments any approach to the extent that many carbon regimes include substantial support for research and development rd this approach is already inco rporated in the overall debate federal support for rd also could be considered as one approach to the objective of encouraging smooth transition to lesscarbonintensive industry this discussion

capandtrade program is based on two premises first set amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activities can be assimilated by the ecological system without undue harm thus the goal of the program is to put ceiling or cap on the total emissions of greenhouse gases second market in pollution licenses between polluters is the most costeffective means of achieving given reduction this market in pollution licenses or allowances each of which is equal to 1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent is signed so that owners of allowances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for future use or sale allowances may be allocated free by the federal government to affected entities or other parties or auctioned by the government for variety of purposes creating an allowance system is similar to creating new currency the allowance has value that can be converted to cash via market clearing mechanism such as an exchange thus allocating allowances for free is essentially the same as distributing money or assistance to affected parties 24 carbon playing field international competition and us climate policy design 2008 p 8

under capandtrade scheme can be achieved under carbon tax regime instead of providing industries with free allowances tax credit program would provide tax credits to them for industries with substantial direct greenhouse gas emissions the tax credit approach would be very straightforward as both the eligible emissions and the carbon tax would be well known unlike free allowances where the precise value of the allotment can only be estimated beforehand for industries with substantial indirect emissions the process would be more involved as the eligible emissions for credit would have to be estimated an estimate that would depend on industry source of energy and process involved like free allocation system the system could be phased out over time in order to encourage smooth transition to less carbonintensive industry g5g138g156g145g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g156g561 third approach to assisting greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industry is straightforward transfer of funds from the government to the companies such an approach offers the most flexibility in terms of how much to offe r and guidance on its use the payments could be restrictive and focused on specific issues such as research development and demonstration of technologies to more expansive concerns such as keeping the company whole in terms of shareholder value or other metrics funds for the transfer could come from either general revenues carbon taxes allowance auctions or combination of sources

direct although potentially complex means of addressing the trade issue would be to penalize foreign competitors who produce and export carbon intensive goods without having to meet comparable carbon policies affecting produc ers in the importing country generally with respect to climate change trade issues the relief being sought is in the form of border adjustment that raises the cost basis for the competing goods potentially to level that reflects the carbon control costs borne by the importing nations goods25 because this is in effect expanding the reach of regulation to foreign countries implementation issues are far more complicated than the domesticbased options discussed above the overall objective of border adjustment would be to encourage negotiation by the united states of binding multilateral and bilateral agreements and to level the playing field with countries that have not taken action comparable to proposed us action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the two forms of border adjustments being discussed most are 1 countervailing duties and 2 international reserve allowances the primary difference between them is that the first levies conventional tariffs on imports to level the playing field while the second imposes shadow allowance requirement on imports to create facto tariff either could be difficult to implement as stated by the australian government in its green paper for imported goods effective border adjustments would be very difficult to implement transparently this is because adjustment woul d require accurate tracking of all inputs used in the production of landed good to determine both the amount of embedded emissions in 25 for background on trade remedies see crs report rl32371 trade remedies primer by vivian c jones

the inputs for example it would be highly complex to determine the emissions and carbon cost embedded in an imported finished aluminum product access to reliable and robust data from other jurisdictions is not straightforward and the complexity of the task is significantly increased when multiple jurisdictions contribute to the production of the good 26

subsidized imported products imposed as an additional import duty on the subsidized imported good countervailing duty can prevent imported goods from being sold in the domestic market at prices less than similar products produced domestically under this approach the lack of comparable carbon policies by foreign countries would be considered subsidy by the united states and countervailing duty based on the embedded carbon in their imported good would be levied 27 under carbon tax scheme the tax would be based on the carbon tax and embedded carbon under capandtrade program the tax would be based on an average allowance price and embedded carbon however imposition of countervailing duties based on the embedded carbon in imports would raise complex issues of law under the wto28

relief is an international reserve allowance ira requirementessentially capandtrade scheme focused on imports of greenhouse gasintensive products with each ira equal to one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent basically the ira requirement would require that in order for greenhouse gas intensive products from countries with insufficient carbon policies to enter the united states they must be accompanied by prescribed amount of international reserve allowances based on greenhouse gas emissions generated in the production of the products the import requirement would enter into effect after reasonable time had passed for negotiations on an acceptable greenhouse gas reduction program generally proposed legislation would require the environmental protection agency epa to calculate an annual ira requirement for each category of covered goods from covered country it would make this determination based on best available information and publish the requirements before the beginning of each compliance year also epa would be required to establish method for calculating the required number of iras for each category of covered goods from covered foreign country the method is to apply to covered goods manufactured and processed in single country and to require submission of iras on perunit basis for each category of covered goods from covered country in addition epa would have to establish separate procedures for determining applicable ira requirements for goods that are primary products and are manufactured or processed in more than one covered country epa would have to revise these various ira requirements annually 26 department of climate change commonwealth of australia carbon pollution reduction scheme green paper july 2008 p 300 27 for more information on this

options to address emissions from individual industrial sectors29 they can be confined to domestic industries or be international in scope they can be voluntary or mandatory they can be incorporated into capandtrade schemes or function outside of such schemes as either an alternative reduction program mandatory or an exemption voluntary for purposes of this paper the discussion of sectoral approaches will be limited to mandatory and voluntary schemes that address the trade impacts of carbon policies for example at the conference of parties cop held at bali in december 2007 the international iron and steel institute iisi issued paper calling for carbon intensity cap on steel the carbon intensity of steel would be determined on perton basis as the embedded carbon in steel divided by its weight30 the foundation of this sectoral approach would be the collection of carbon dioxide data by steel plants in major steel producing countries the data collected would be used to develop intensitybased benchmarks for the industry iisi argues that using this comprehensive intensitybased approach to emissions from steel production will allow production normalised co2 emission comparisons between regions that are not possible today as stated by iisi by including all the major steel producing countries world wide competition will longer be harmed in an industry where over 40 of products are already traded internationally 31 this approach has been endorsed by the american iron and steel institute whose press release states the approach is also supported by iisi members in both the developed and developing countries including china32 it has also been reported by the financial times that the approach is 29 for review of options see richard baron et sectoral approaches to

intensity mechanism could be used for several industries for which foreign competition and emissions leakage are serious concerns obviously many parameters and specifics would have to be negotiated to determine whether such an approach would be effective in addressing the concerns identified here the basic structure of sectoral approach depends on the overall purpose it is designed to achieve for example voluntary scheme could have the characteristics of an exemption with penalty for failing to make progress toward achieving the overall purpose of the program however the program would probably only affect direct emissions industry would still have to respond to any cost impacts from indirect emissions other voluntary schemes could make participation voluntary but once company agrees the scheme would be mandatory for that company this is how many approaches to encour aging participation by developing countries are designed the current clean development mechanism cdm reflects this line of thinking for mandatory scheme the linkages between it and the broader program would be key to accomplishing the overall purposes of the program because this paper limits its discussion to international approaches the strength of sectoral approach is that it would at least start the process of incorporating developing countries into global approach to climate change despite the wide variety of sectoral approaches proposed there are some commonalities among them the first is transparency of important parameters also called benchmarks including definition and boundary of affected sectors agreed upon performance metrics and indicators and identification of best practices as stated by the centre for european policy studies ceps task force without such data collected bottomup by industry and verified by an independent third party there is justification for sectoral pproaches only verified data can ensure that industry commitments whether voluntary unilateral or negotiated with government lead to real and measurable reductions beyond businessasusual scenario34 the second is the sharing and dissemination of best practices within sector to increase efficiency and transfer of technology the third is mechanisms to encourage incorporatio n of installations in developing countries into the overall scheme mechanisms include technical assistance technology transfer

programthe goals eligible participants implementation and enforcementwould be difficult to define in manner that satisfies all parties there is every incentive for any industry facing cost increase from carbon policies to claim that its competitive position could be diminished thereby justifying special consideration by the government the government would be in the difficult position of picking

simple answer however there have been variety of purposes and objectives suggested for proposals to assist tradeexposed greenhouse gasintensive industries they include 1 promote negotiation of an international agreement 2 prevent the leakage of carbon emissions from countries with carbon policies to those without them 3 remove barrier to enacting domestic legislation 4 assist industry in making smooth transition to lesscarbonintensive future 5 level the competitive playing field that carbon policies may upset and 6 prevent or mitigate potential job losses from carbon policies these are discussed below g18g155g152g150g152g157g146g151g144g561g138g151g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g561 as suggested earlier the problems arising from differentiation would not exist if there were an international agreement on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions that placed all significant greenhouse gas emitting countries under coherent regulatory regime this criterion raises numerous questions about what would constitute fair agreement or comparable obligations by developing countries however it represents the longterm solution to the trade and climate change issue in the case of sectoral approaches this is their primary purpose less so for domestic assistance options on more practical level the need to promote an international agreement also reflects the strictures of the wto if border adjustment is being considered since border adjustment may well violate the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt measure that is successfully challenged on this ground would need to be justified under gatt exception while gatt article xx contains an exception for measures relating to the conservation of

assisting domestic production is to prevent carbon leakage such goal is environmental not economic indeed addressing carbon leakage would likely drive up the cost of compliance with any carbon reduction program as stated by the australian governments green paper if australia was solely concerned about minimizing the domestic cost of meeting reduction in emissions it would be unconcerned about carbon leakage however given the global nature of the climate change problem the potential for carbon leakage provides rationale to use policy to influence the locational decisions of emissionsintensive industries on environmental grounds 36 for border adjustments avoiding carbon leakage would also be the primary rationale for qualifying for an exception under ga tt as suggested above the ability to separate and quantify the effects of differentiated carbon policies and the mitigating effects of any policy response would be difficult there are guarantees that any proposed solution would prevent carbon leakage or that any assistance would prevent the migration of production and jobs abroad trade is multifaceted and complex series of interactions

favor of sector approaches domestic assistance or tariffs for greenhousegas intensive tradeexposed industries however this is somewhat vague notion as it is not clear what or how much assistance would level the playing field and at what costs to other parts of the economy as stated by the australian government it is difficult to determine how much eite emissionsintensive tradeexposed assistance would be needed to prevent carbon leakage some have argued that there is direct relationship between loss in profitability and carbon leakage and that government intervention could be warranted to restore the profitability of eite entities to levels that would have occurred without carbon constraint in the extreme case and all other things constant this would imply assistance at direct dollarfordollar rate for the impact of the carbon price under such an approach the government would continue to provide assistance even if other factors substantially incr eased the profitability of eite entities the level of assistance to eite industries over time must also be balanced against the impact on nonassisted sectors in particular the design of the eiteassistance policy needs to take into account the fact that declining national emission cap combined with growing national economy implies that the burden or cost of achieving given national reduction in emissions would increase over time this suggests that the degree of eite assistance may need to be adjusted over time to ensure the sustainability of the eite policy otherwise eite assistance would constitute growing share of shrinking quantity of national emissions leading to higher costs for the rest of the economy 39 this need for balance in any assistance is echoed by other studies the peterson institute for international economics and the world resources institute suggest that focusing on the competitive concern of carbon intensive industries is fairly narrow interpretation of us competitiveness40 following the rationale of the australian governments green paper the two institutions make three arguments for caution in designing assistance for greenhouse gas intensive industries 1 move to more carbonconstrained economy requires fundamental shift that requires strong regulatory environment to promote 2 assistance to greenhouse gas intensive tradeexposed industries comes at cost to the

if one accepts the need for transition to lesscarbonintensive future assistance to greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries could be justified to the extent it promotes such transition with less economic pain as stated by the australian government the second reason after avoiding carbon leakage for assisting tradeexposed industries is that it may smooth the transition of the economy towards one that embodies price on carbon given the significant differences between the emissions profiles of industries carbon price could have markedly greater impact on some industries than on others government could place priority on providing transitional assistance to those entities and industries that would be most severely affected by the introduction of the scheme this would involve giving priority towards assisting existing industries particularly those with significant sunk capital investments few opportunities to reduce their emissions profiles and limited capacity to pass through the carbon cost 42 this purpose reinforces the need for balance between the desire to level the playing field as suggested above with the need to achieve the overall environmental goal that

eligible for assistance the previous discussion suggests that greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries could be the most competitively disadvantaged by carbon policies that increase costs those increased costs could be imposed directly if the reduction program included industrial emissions under its regime andor indirectly th rough increases in immediate products those industries consume in the making of their products such as energy three criteria stand out for determining the potential eligibility of an industry subindustry or company for assistance is the sector or product greenhouse gasintensive under some metric profit value added employment is the sectors viability strongly tied to greenhouse gasintensive process would the sectors competitive situation be substantially upset by carbon policies through its inability to pass on costs related to them under fragmented international regime would the sector be exposed to competition from companies in countries not anticipated to respon d for some time with significant carbon policies of their own does the sector have only limited ability to costeffectively reduce its emissions or obtain compliance through another means at least in the shortterm does this situation present significant downside risk economically in terms of lost production and jobs and environmentally in terms of carbon leakage what the steel example discussed earlier suggests is that products that are greenhouse gas intensive with relatively low value added such as crude steel are potentially most at risk of significant cost increases if in addition high greenhouse gasintensive low addedvalue products are fairly homogeneous and can be readily bought in international markets domestic manufacturers of them such as raw steel producers may be pricetakers on world markets with limited ability to pass through carbonrelated costs parts of several industry sectors may fall into this category including cement lime some basic chemicals and primary metals such as primary aluminum along with some glass and paper products however the steel example illustrates that defining greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries will not be straightforward process as trade exposure carbon costs and pricing dynamics may differ within sector under some assistance options developing eligibility crit eria could put the government in the position of picking winners and losers and creating the potential for drawnout and litigious process overall the discussion suggests that determining i ndustry eligibility would not be straightforward and would require drawing lines and making fine distinctions issues requiring resolution would include 1 the level of disaggregation to use in termining eligibility 2 the metric that would be used to determine eligibility and 3 the entity and data that would do the determining all of these determinations would be controversial

greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries and increasing the burden of carbon policy compliance on other parts of the economy assistance would increase the overall cost of compliance in hope of achieving smoother economic transition to lowcarbon future however determining the appropriate amount would be controversial and contentious issues include how much should be allocated and in what form tariffs domestic assistance sectoral approach etc how much should the assistance be tailored to individual sectors subsectors or facilities what metrics and baselines should be used to make these decisions g6g158g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g3g156g156g146g156g157g138g151g140g142g561g558g561g10g152g160g561g14g152g151g144g501g561 if longterm substantial greenhouse gas reduction is desired all sectors would have to participate in the reductions at some point the longer participation by one sector is delayed the higher the costs on the participating sectors however the ability of greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries to join reduction program may vary substantially depending on research and development results compliance strategies by industries providing important feedstocks to their processes and general economic conditions and demand for their products issues include how differentiated should the timing of the assistance be by sector subsector or facility how should any adjustments to assistance over time be determined under what conditions should the assistance be terminated

each option faces significant implementation and enforcement issues fragmentation is key characteristic of greenhouse gas intensive tradeexposed industries in terms of their greenhouse gas intensiveness their trade exposure and their sector economics this situation would put substantial demands on the implementing body with respect to data needs and methodologies data and methodologies would need to be robust nough to justify determinations including any wto challenges in the case of border adjustments and to enforce any requirements on domestic or foreign producers finally enforcement would require some definition of success or failure issues raised include how will the necessary data be collected and quality assured how will international cooperation be encouraged both

these options are substantialparticularly for trade and sectoral approaches at the current time there would be clear tradeoff between the precision of trade or sectoral approach and the ability of the government to implement it the international scope of these two approaches multiplies the data challenges presented by at least an order of magnitude over domesticonly program the challenge for data collection in developing countries may be such that the government is forced to employ methodology rather than empiricism to construct data setsa process that would make wto challenge in the case of trade approaches almost certainty sectoral approach may be able to solicit assistance from those countries if they feel the approach is fair to them and that improved efficiency and technology will improve their economic situation in contrast the sanctions approach of the trade schemes may not encourage such countries to cooperate in the scheme

lack of comprehensive international climate change treaty unilaterally can be an uncertain enterprise the approaches outlined here face daunting needs in terms of crafting coherent program to achieve multiple goals there is high probability of unintended consequences fr om any of these approaches trade and economics involve dynamic processes that can respond to public policy in unanticipated ways for example trade sanctions based on primary goods such as steel and aluminum could have undesirable impacts on domestic downstream industries an incr ease in the cost of raw steel or aluminum could drive up the costs of domestically manufactured finished products such as automobiles and encourage foreign countries to export more finished products to the united states indeed country could redirect its exports from primary goods to finished goods to avoid the trade sanctions for example south korea which exports both raw steel and automobiles could focus its industrial policy toward automobile exports and away from raw steel exports thus downstream companies that use greenhouse gasintensive goods could have their competitiveness undermined by attempts to protect greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries this consequence is less likely with domestic assistance or an international sectoral approach another potential unintended consequence of trad approach is that foreign countries with more stringent carbon polices than those proposed in the united states could turn the tables the european union eu has already agreed to more stringent reduction program to 2020 than the united states seems likely to adopt even if us trade program did not target the eu because of the comparable provisions it is conceivable that the eu might target the united states there is also risk that domestic subsidies could lead to unintended outcomes for example company receiving assistance might choose to use that money for something other than modernizing or operating targeted carbonintensive facilities instead it might decide that the overall competitiveness of plant does not merit any modernization and choose to close the facility or reduce its production regardless of

means of assistance for countries under the kyoto protocol for phases 1 and 2 of the european unions eu emissions trading scheme ets member countries have almost exclusively allocated allowances at cost and overallocated in favor of industries in competitive markets compared with the electric power sector likewise the australian governments green paper recommends free allocation of allowances under its proposed cap andtrade program to assist greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries finally new zealand has announced that it intends to use free allocation as its means of assisting its industries primary advantage of free allocation system is that it doesnt necessarily exempt greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries from the capand trade program thus costeffective reductions may still be made lowering overall cost of the program compared with an approach that exempts them completely also incorporating their emissions in the cap from the beginning helps industries become familiar with the workings of the carbon market and how to develop leastcost strategies to comply with increasingly stringent reductions and likely reductions in free allocations this could assist in determining how long any assistance should be in effect and with the smooth transition objective identified above also as the euets experience suggests attempting to add exempted industries in piecemeal process can be difficult task putting them under the cap from the beginning makes the direction of greenhouse gas emission policy for industry clear this is not to say that designing free allocation system would be simple as suggested previously there are at least two major points of contention in the design of such an approach 1 what percentage of the total available allowances should be allocated free to greenhouse gas intensive tradeexposed industries and 2 what methodology and metrics should be used to apportion the free allowances among the various industries and subindustries the first point of contention highlights the zerosum game that is allowance allocations under capandtrade program allowances given free to greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries cannot be given to other heavily impacted industries such as electric utilities or sold by the government at auction to fund other government objectives or tax reform resolution of this tradeoff would determine how much relief greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries would receive for example the australians governments green paper recommends up to 30 of available allowances be allocated free to greenhouse gasintensive tradedexposed industries this would be allocated under twotier system where heavily greenhouse gasintensive industries on revenue basis would receive free allowances to cover 90 of their emissions while somewhat lesser greenhouse gasintensive industries would receive 60 46 variety of metrics and options are available for resolving the second point of contention free allowance allocations could be weighted in manner to encourage increased domestic production of greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed goods and to discourage offshoring of that production eg an output based allocation ch methodology would help meet objectives such as reduced carbon leakage and reduced job losses another example would be to protect 46 department of climate change commonwealth of

paper the australian government recommends metric based on greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue stating measure of emissions per unit of revenue would be the most transparent and comparable indicator of the materiality of the carbon cost impact across different traded industries47 from an economic standpoint an important disadvantage of free allocation is that allowances allocated free are allowances the government cannot auction and from which there are proceeds to address other concerns economic studies have found that if revenues received from an auctionbased allocation system are used in the most economically efficient manner the overall costs imposed on the economy by capandtrade program could be reduced substantially 48 economists maintain that the most economically efficient application of auction revenues would be as an offset for reductions made in taxes on desirable activities such as employment or personal income 49 likewise the auction revenues could be used to support other public polices such as research and development or relief to lowincome families50 to the extent allowances are allocated free to greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries these other options are excluded second disadvantage is that the difficulty in determining an appropriate apportionment of allowances opens the possibility of windfall profits by some industries or subindustries the amount necessary to compensate industries varies by industry51 in addition the allowance price will also vary over time and may not strictly track costs thus the chances that some industries could be overcompensated is significant52 this issue has been raised with the euets and is of continuing concern there53 final disadvantage of free allocation is that it might not achieve some of the purposes outlined above particularly if allowances are apportioned according to historic production companies may simply pocket the allowances and still lower production or move offshore this can be avoided if the apportionment is based on output likewise the option may have effect on the crafting of an acceptable international agreement 47 department of climate change commonwealth of

effect to free allocation under capandtrade system the primary advantage of carbon tax credit option is that most carbon tax proposals assume real time emissions monitoring or derivative calculations based on realtime fuel consumption real time allocation as opposed to allotments based on historical emissions would naturally respond to changes in production and derivative job gainslosses there would be little chance for windfall profits assuming accurate emissions monitoring the primary disadvantage of carbon tax credit is that depending on how it is designed greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries receiving the credits could have little incentive to make greenhouse gas reductions on their own the precision available in allocating tax credits removes carbon price as factor in production and planning this problem could be addressed by phaseout schedule tailored to encourage commercialization of more carbon efficient technology and processes although trying to tailor such phaseout to each industry or subindustrys specific situation could be complicated and contentious g5g138g156g145g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g156g561 the primary advantage of cash payments is transparency particularly with free allowance allocations under capandtrade program there is some veil over exactly how much is being given to individual sectors subsectors or companies with cash payments it can be made clear who is getting what and how much the allocations could be matter of public record making public and congressional oversight more straightforward likewise any phasing out of the assistance over time would be clear the disadvantage of cash payments is possible imprecision in allocations under capand trade program cash payments would be based on estimates of allowance prices and would have to be reconciled with the actual price at some point such as the end of the year that estimates would be off is likely providing affected facilities with either short term nocost loan if too high or shortterm added expense if too low more precision is likely under carbon tax regime however arguably cash payment program would be redundant under carbon tax scheme as tax credit could also be transparent and little would be gained by having the government collect the money only to return it particularly in the case of direct emissions

assistance the duty on imports would allow the domestic carbon program to be implemented in the most costeffective manner without the distorting effects of targeted domestic assistance while protecting greenhouse gas intensive tradeexposed industries from being unfairly targeted by foreign competitors not undergoing transition to lesscarbon intensive economy whether it would level the playing field with respect to international trade or encourage foreign countries to pass carbon policies of their own is more debatable for example avoiding carbon leakage with trade approach may neither enco urage major developing countries like china and india to commit to carbon targets nor greatly influence their overall exports as suggested by american enterprise institute aei center for regulatory and market studies in recent report as means of coercing china this strategy would face long odds first why would china and india by adopting domestic ghg controls handicap all of their global trade merely to avoid sanctions on quite small part of their economies less than 1 percent of chinese steel production is sold to america in form that would make it liable to sanctions for aluminum the number is only 3 percent it is 2 percent for paper and less than 1 percent for both basic chemicals and cement second one country adopting trade sanctions or few countries doing so will merely change the geographic pattern of trade flows without having much impact on the total demand for chinese energyintensive goods us sanctions on china would cause countries with lowcarbon steel aluminum or other industries to increase their exports to the us and increase their own imports from china it is implausible to suggest that this threat would compel chin to adopt ghg controls that would remotely resemble the severity of those being proposed in americafootnote omitted 56 the international scope of the border adjustment approach and the complex nature of trade makes design of program difficult terms including comparable action similar products and embedded carbon would have to be defined in manner that avoids arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination between exporting countries in order to comply with wto requirements and methodologies developed to give meaning to them then price per ton of embedded carbon would have to be determined assuming carbon tax scheme domestically this price would be obvious in an international reserve allowance system under capandtrade scheme the price would have to be linked in some manner to prevailing allowance prices the definitions and methodologies needed to impl ement border adjustment have different webs of complexity for example how close should comparable action be to identical if country achieves the same percentage reduction without any comprehensive program is that comparable what if that program achieves the same results as the united states but exempts greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries if country achieves more stringent reduction levels than the united states does the united states concede the right for them to impose border adjustment against it when does comparable action have to occur how should country of origin be determined how is similar product determined to what category subcategory or productspecific level will determinations be made how broad should the scope of the program be how will necessary international trade and carbon data be 56 lee lane and david montgomery political institutions and greenhouse gas controls november 2008 p 11

determine an ap propriate scheme for industry these metrics are not mutually exclusive different industries could employ different metrics depending on the specifics of that sectors processes the most common metric being discussed for sectoralbased approach is an outputbased performance standard an outputbased performance standard measures success by the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of output also called carbon intensity target this approach does not limit total emissions like an emissions cap and therefore is seen by its proponents as being more acceptable to developing countries who may see an emissions cap as restricting their right to development obviously performance standard requires an agreedupon standard or benchmark for participating companies to achieve benchmark allows participants to compare their performance against an industry standard optima l technology or best practice benchmarks can be developed at different levels of aggregation and by

performance with each other and identify needed improvements to the extent benchmarking57 is used on more aggregated level including different processes all similar products etc the ability to improve individual plants or processes may be lost58 in strictly voluntary scheme benchmarking could be means to determine best practice and target technical assistance however it would not necessarily result in reductions if other factors such as low energy prices make achieving best practice not cost effective and the company refused to join the effort in addition while technicalbased benchmarks are useful tool to determine the current status of best practices within an industry it provides little guidance on the speed and magnitude of future technological advancements under strictly voluntary system achieving the benchmark could become the end of the effortan end short of the ultimate goals of the program in mandatory system or voluntary system that becomes mandatory upon acceptance carrots and sticks could be used to encourage industry to move toward the benchmark work by vanderborght baron et provides one illustration of how this might work 59 as indicated by figure 5 companies operating at carbon intensity levels above the present industry average pink line that could be determined globally or differentiated by country would be quickly and increasingly penalized red area while companies operating below the average would receive modest and declining reward blue area based on assessments of future advancements the baseline could be extended in the longterm additional carrots could be made available to companies that adopt innovative processes that achieve this longterm goal green area the appropriate sticks and carrots would depend on how the program is integrated

5 however technical benchmarks whether for voluntary or mandatory program have drawbacks most notably around their need for data five identified by baron et are as follows benchmarking is timeconsuming dataintensive activity all the more so as various conditions may need to be accounted for in an international approach there is risk of inflation in the number of benchmarks as operators will argue special circumstances that all require special treatment in some cases benchmarking may require disclosing data that companies judge proprietary or of strategic importance this may be handled through careful choice of performance indicators used in the benchmark it is useful tool to describe an industry status here and now but as it is based on todays technologies and practice it provides little guidance on what level mitigation can be achieved in the future as in some cases technology is yet to be invented can benchmark then be used as forward looking method the use of an average industry benchmark as reference to allocate effort will immediately define winners and losers ie installations that perform better or worse than the chosen benchmark target while the effect on their cost would be fair reflection of the cost associated with co2 emissions it may be difficult to agree to unless the benchmark is set as future target as illustrated in figure 5 there is an

mitigation potential and its real cost because of these data needs other possible performance standards have been proposed such as industrial average carbon intensity over time the standard would be strengthened at an agreed upon rate toward the most efficient company or companies trading program could be created between companies with companies with intensities greater than the industry average buying necessary allowances from companies with intensit ies less than the industry average essentially the system would constitute separate capandtrade program based on carbon intensity rates rather than cap based on annual emissions while such an approach would mitigate some of the data needs of technically based benchmark issues such as level of aggregation for averages would remain

assist the transfer of technology and expertise is usually included in proposal particularly the more voluntary the approach is60 these mechanisms may also include assistance to domestic companies that are inefficient producers to bring them up to the agreedupon performance standard for example the dutch domestic sectoral approach to improve industrial energy efficiencies includes financial and

indicated each focuses on different objectives with respect to achieving the more comprehe nsive solution to trade issuespromoting an international agreementthe range presented by the three approaches is clear and distinct support for domestic industries the approach most commonly included in legislative proposals is not focused on this objective it is focused on preserving the industrys current competitive position and jobs and may depending on the details help transition that industry to the future trade measures for foreign competitors another approach commonly included in legislative proposals may provide stick for international negotiation but the primary focus is on protecting greenhouse gasintensive tradeexposed industries from unfair competition while the country awaits an international agreement finally the sectoral approach represents range of options focused on integrating developing countries industrial bases into mutually acceptable international framework that provides level playing field for all participants whether any of these approaches would have appreciable effects on carbon leakage is unclear 63 richard baron et sectoral approaches to greenhouse gas

reducing greenhouse gas emissions contain provisions to address the traderelated issues presented here two of the most common options are 1 subsidies for affected industries through allocation of free allowances within capandtrade policies and 2 border adjustments through an international reserve allowance program in addition to these domestic options the bali action plan includes sectoral approaches as options for the next phase of the ky oto protocol other alternatives are also likely to be debated free allocation of allowances to greenhousegas intensive tradeexposed industries is more narrowly focused on assisting domestic industries maintain their current competitiveness in the face of domestic greenhouse gas reduction program it has the virtue of relative simplicity compared with the other approaches and options but greater guarantee of success companies may choose to accept the assistance and not make the necessary improvements to existing facilities to remain competitive in the increasi ngly carbonconstrained future there are metrics and benchmarks that could be used to allocate free allowances carbon intensity outputbased metrics that can reduce these problems but introduce complexity in terms of increased data needs and methodological considerations the allocation also comes at the cost of making the program more expensive for the other participants the international reserve allowance scheme is complex system focused on leveling the playing field for domestic producers against competitors whose countries are not implementing comparable greenhouse gas reductions the international scope of the option and the complex nature of trade makes design of program difficult terms including comparable action similar products and embedded carbon would have to be defined in manner that avoids arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination between exporting countries in order to comply with wto requirements and methodologies developed to give meaning to them annual assessments of countries actions would have to be made and new baselines set then price per ton of embedded carbon would have to be determined the use of allowances instead of money removes the transparency of countervailing duty and makes tracking the impact of the scheme on other parts of the economy difficult to determine finally it is unclear how the affected trading partners would respond economically environmentally or politically this might encourage one to move to the sectoral approach as potentially more effective it is focused on achieving an international agreement that would make the playing field at least acceptable to all parties however there is blueprint currently that parties agree is the basis for developing such an approach it is possible that the 2009 copenhagen conference will resolve the fundamentals for such an approach but what sort of contingencies one should consider in the meanwhile or in the face of failure is unclear finally it is the details of any of these options that would ultimately determine their effectiveness in achieving the various objectives the potential options are almost endless for example if domestic assistance approach is chosen allocation options include production output historic emissions company profits or revenues and tech nology or best practices benchmarks duration options for such an approach would include anticipated technology or best practices advancements or best currently available consummation of an international agreement or some criterion related to the economic health of the sector or industry options for data collection include publicly available data from the departments of energy andor commerce legislatively mandated requirement for the collection of data from companies wishing to receive assistance or government estimates based on best available data or modeling in any case the task would be daunting for any of the approaches

implementation and enforcementwould be difficult to define in manner that satisfies all parties there is every incentive for any industry facing cost increase from carbon policies to claim that its competitive position could be diminished thereby justifying special consideration by the government the government would be in the difficult position of picking winners and losers sometimes without
