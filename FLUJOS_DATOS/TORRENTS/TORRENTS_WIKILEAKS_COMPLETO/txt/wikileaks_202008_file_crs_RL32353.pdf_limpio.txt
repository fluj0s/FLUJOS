divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32353minimum wage overtime pay and child labor inventory of proposals in the 108th congress to amend the fair labor standards act summary the fair labor standards act flsa 29 usc 201219 is the basic federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay child labor and related issues enacted in 1938 it has been modified throug h the years to take into account changing workplace trends and to meet new worker and employer concerns the act has undergone general amendmen t on eight separate occasions 1949 1955 1961 1966 1974 1977 1989 and 1996 in addition to numerous more specific legislated changes it has also been the subject of continuing administrative rulemaking by the department of bor dol and has been the focus of extensive litigation that has impacted the manner in which the act is applied the flsa is divided roughly into three parts corresponding to its subject areas minimum wage section 6 overtime pay section 7 and child labor section 12 these are accompanied by body of statutor exemptions or exceptions section 13 definitions appear in section 3 other s ections deal with ad ministration penalties and related matters nothing in the act requires that congress revisit the statute amendment has tended to respond to change in the value of the minimum wage as the level of the wage floor has eroded throug h inflationary pressure congress has revisited the flsa and while addressing the wage rate it has also often re vised coverage patterns and modified overtime pay and other requirements child labor by and large but with exceptions has been primarily the respons ibility of the secretary of labor operating within general guidelines laid down by congress until recently legislation to amend the flsa had been freestanding the product of extended hearings in 1996 that pattern shifted the 1996 flsa amendments were adopted as floor am endment to broad proposal dealing with business and related tax issues as result some have come to view as tradition linkage of labor standards enhancement with sometimes unrelated benefits for employers others argue that there is inherent reason to tie flsa amendments to benefits for employers in the 108th congress further changes were proposed with respect to the flsa some to increase worker protections nd others arguably to reduce them most of these proposals have been narrowly focuse d

statut the flsa was enacted in 1938 it was not an especially new concept questi ons about minimum wages overtime pay child labor and related issues had been central part of am erican and world labor policy concerns for at least half century but only in the wake of the great depression 1929 ff was congress able to forge co mprehensive federal measure that would withstand judicial review while respecting the differing interests of employers and workers structure of the fair labor standards act the flsa is divided roughly into th ree parts minimum wage section 6 overtime pay section 7 nd child labor section 12 these are accompanied by body of statutory exemptions or excepti ons section 13 definitions appear in section 3 other sections deal with ad ministration penalties and related

westport conn greenwood pr ess 1997 p xvii nordlund is referring here specifically to the minimum wage but that same conclusion might arguably be drawn with respect to overtime pay and to child labordisabilities regularly tipped em ployees and others in ddition special treatment for certain small businesses has been written into the statute1 in general the overtime requirements of the act now set 40 hours as the standard workweek thereafter worker must be compensated at not less than 1½ times workers regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 per week daily hours standard is provided in the act thus llowing for flexible scheduling within the 40 hour standard as with the acts min imum wage requirement exceptions from the overtime standard have been built into the statute these exceptions are technical and complex but allow employers va riety of options beyond the general requirements of the act2 efforts to restrict or to regulate child labor date from the 19th century after series of federal initiatives uniformly deemed unconstitutional language dealing with child labor was incorporated within th original flsa of 1938 beyond several broad and general child labor provisions the act leaves wide discretion in standard setting to the secretary of labor who exercises that authority through the rulemaking process but periodically c ongress has intervened to deal directly with particular aspect of child labor law3 focus of the legislative process because wagehour and child labor legi slation has been on the congressional agenda intermittently through more th an six decades its consideration has developed along more or less standard lin but with certain recent variations speaking generally labor st andards laws have been opposed by employers and supported by workers economists can be found of all sides of the issue with little consensus with respect to impact4 the arguments pro and voiced during the first three decades of the 20th century remain vogue little seems to have changed packaging of wagehour meas ures can be critical from the original act of 1938 through the 1989 flsa amendments such legislation was frees tanding while it might deal with overtime pay or child bor or minimum wage or immediately related subjects singularly or as pa rt of package it normally did not include broader taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32353crs3 or unrelated business matters however in 1996 the 104th congress various flsa amendments were added to an industryor iented tax package as floor amendment as the debate over the minimum wage developed in the 106th and 107th congresses the issue of linkage came to be viewed as traditional thus some now argue that an increase in the minimum wage for workers must be combined with tax breaks for employers that the former should not move forward without the latter others argue that there is reason to tie minimum wage standards or changes in overtime pay and child labor policy to benefits for employers that they stand independently as issues of econo mic justice and worker protection almost every element of the flsa can be contentious each proposed change can and often does bring forth advocates pro and to argue the justice andor economic impact of proffere d legislation the approach taken whether freestanding measure or package whether of purely labor st andards or linked to business concerns can by offering dive rse legislative choices either create an incentive for enactment or provide reason for opposing any action at all further support for or opposition to labor standards laws has often been philosophical the issues however are also essentially econo mic who wins who loses and who pays an inventory of legislative proposals in the 108th congress legislative proposals dealing with the
