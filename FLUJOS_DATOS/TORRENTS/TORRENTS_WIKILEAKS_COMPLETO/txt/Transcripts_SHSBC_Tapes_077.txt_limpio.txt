shsbc 77 rudiments lecture given on 31 october 1961 thank you okay and this is audience october 31st saint hill special briefing course october 31st 1961 all right now you have come to grips with clearing since ive talked to you last in very definite and broad way and i want you to do this with your pc at the very next session before the session is started do dynamic assessment just for the dynamic do dynamic assessment for the dynamic before your next session i simply want dynamic assessment now if you dont know how to do dynamic assessment that is very simple you just ask the pc how he feels about the various dynamics and you take the one that reacts the most or the change of needle pattern from the remaining dynamics and then you tell which dynamic fell the most on your pc now theres few bits and pieces of news with regard to processing and you are posing the problem in very heavy way of broad rapid clearing and we have been using some class ii types of technology in order to clean out circuits that interpose and so forth in clearing and so on now you know that it would be very difficult to audit anybody unless you had some security checks squared away on this person i think you will agree with that with the experience you have had here isnt that true thatd be very rather difficult if you never did security check on pc to expect him to go anywhere now you see the goal will disappear rather easily the terminal will disappear rather easily so that assessment becomes rather difficult but remember that you are running goal and terminal and in view of the fact that you are running goal and terminal on the pc whether youre run fling it by prehav scale or some other process matter what youre doing with the goal or terminal it can disappear these two can disappear as easily during the run as they can disappear during the assessment so you see goalsterminal run then must be handled with the rudiments in just as you have to have the rudiments in in order to assess them does that make good sense to you all right now those things which are closest to present time often have greater influence upon the preclear than the whole track now where is the boundary this life is more important than other lives in the pcs eyes only not from the standpoint of his aberrations his past lives have far greater aberrative value because of course theyre more hidden but in the pcs eyes this life of course has much greater importance than any past life so you have at once situation where the person who is sitting there being processed by you is completely convinced that anything that is wrong with him has happened to him in this lifetime well this is one of the things thats wrong with him that he considers that he could get this aberrated in just half century or less you see now thats silly theres really nothing happened to anybody in this lifetime compared to what has happened to them over thousands and thousands of lifetimes you see so youre processing somebody who believes that this lifetime is more important than past lifetimes when in actual fact this lifetime is not at all important as far as auditing is concerned as far as the basic seat of aberration as far as his reactive bank is concerned it all has its fundamentals in his past track before this lifetime ever began all right now lets take that little bit further what has happened in the last twentyfour hours is more important to him than has happened in the last month lets just look at that again now of course what has happened to him in the last twentyfour hours is not more important to him than has happened in the last month but the pc thinks it is well here we go again you see its the same equation working out now in little more finite piece of time all right according to the pcs viewpoint what has happened to him in the session is more important than what has happened to him in the day lets get it down you know not this lifetime past lives but lets move it down to now to this day is more important than this month therefore to the pc what has happened in the vicinity in the immediate vicinity of this auditing session or in it is more important than what has happened in this day thats what the pc thinks so of course you get tremendous reaction on the part of the pc from an arc break and he thinks this is the thing right now this is what is wrong with him it isnt what is wrong with him at all its probably those fifteen thousand prisoners he had executed way back when you see and he made them sit in chair you see he made them sit in chair and he executed them with electrodes which look remarkably like emeter cans something on this order dont you see so he has an arc break and he will tell you it is the arc break which is holding up his auditing when as matter of fact its the fifteen thousand prisoners but because of this value you cannot audit across the top of the arc break easily you cant do it because his mind is fixated on the moment of time nearest to present time he fixates on this superficially and analytically so that has to be pulled before you can get to anything else and its something on the order of little tiny gate made out of strips of flimsy tin or bits of dennison crepe paper and the pc says this huge enormous iron gate which is spiked counterbalanced and which weighs seventyfive million tons called an arc break is the gate that is interposed between and getting on in this session see thats what he says thats what he thinks all right it isnt true it isnt true this arc break actually as far as his future life is concerned is made out of dennison crepe paper but it looks awfully big now as this arc break floats back into the past gradually drifts back into the past it gets to be yesterdays session it is not so important you see it gets to be last months session great value it gets to be last years session well you have to dig like mad to find it well why is this because of progression of time the analytical mind fixes closest to all of the havingness youve got all this havingness around here you see present time has got all the havingness in it therefore those things which are closest to the havingness are of course more valid than those things which arent close to the havingness he longer has camelot see but he does have modern england so what happens close to modern england of course thats close to the havingness so thats fine you see but camelot he never can get that back thats gone of course it really has value as he looks at it it has great aberrative value but it has analytical value so there is this basic disagreement always occurring in an auditing session what is wrong with the pc is in the yesterlives and what the pc says is wrong with him is right here and now now if you treat what is wrong with him right here and now with bulldozers and heavy axes and dynamite as though the gate which is closed in your face is made out of iron is of enormous tonnage is tremendous barrier if you treat it in this fashion if you slug away at it as though it is iron the pc will think so too you can validate the pc into outrudiments you can work on him and you very often will be right but in the process of working on him too hard you can actually blow rudiments out you start removing rudiments ineptly you start slugging them around and you get the pt problem out and the arc break in and then you get the room out because its the havingness around which the bad incident occurred dont you see and the room goes out and of course withhold goes in but by this time youve cleaned up the pt problem and the arc break but now you have the room out and the withholds are out now if we were to go back over the rudiments again and check them we would find this to be the case but in order to get on with it and have an orderly progress of rudiments we run of course the rudiments consecutively and never cross them again so we dont notice this other point an auditor has to judge this way he has to make judgment he has to say is it going to do more damage to get the rudiments in than to audit with them out now that is sort of sort of wild one because its up against this perfection is that the best auditing and the best gains always occur against rudiments in and goals run is very very difficult to achieve with rudiments out all right thats thats the ideal isnt it the ideal is all rudiments in during the entirety of the run right now how about crudely putting the rudiments in you can actually put the rudiments in with such ardor you can attack this gate the pc has got closed against auditing in his bank with such ferocity with such battering rams with bulldozers and dynamite and so forth that he becomes utterly convinced one way or the other that the rudiments are way out and that its all pretty hopeless proposition and you throw the rudiments further out than you throw them in can condition exist whereby the handling of rudiments worsen the run can condition so exist yes and this is the discovery which we make here and its an interesting discovery there are two or three i will detail to you here and that is that any auditing of terminal other than the goals terminal of the pc can increase the density of the bank and the resistance of the preclear it doesnt happen hundred percent but it happens enough to make one very wary any auditing of terminal which is not the goals terminal of the preclear can result in difficulties tone arm rises it gets sticky it goes up the pc gets very uncomfortable the pc becomes very arc breaky the pc gets very very upset the rudiments are very very hard to keep in why why because in not auditing his goal and his goals terminal you are of course liable to be auditing other terminals and these increase the density of the bank so that the pc becomes more arc breaky by auditing certain rudiments than if you left them alone see how this could be its one of these one of these horrors its one of these superimpasses its one that requires judgment on the part of the auditor well ill give you an idea the pcs goals terminal is willow wand lets take something nobody has for sure and so the pc runs willow wand and you can do all sorts of weird things with this willow wand you can run concepts on it and brackets on it and you can run it backwards and upside down and nothing very grim happens on the willow wand see this can run you see but in the rudiments he has present time problem with his boss so we say well get an idea now of getting even with your boss get an idea of your boss getting even with you thank you thats fine get an idea of getting even with your boss your boss getting even were auditing the pt problem you see and were going to clear up boss the boss is not willow wand and the harder we try to get it in the less it goes in because the pcs attention is distracted off of his goals terminal every time we say the word boss he goes flink boom boss boss boss wow boss well us willow wands see so off it goes and the bank gets stiffer heavier all right were going to have an arc break were going to run this arc break in see this is going to be real good well the person has an arc break with the auditor and has had arc breaks with past auditors and were all set now and well say well what has an auditor failed to do and what have you not been able to say to an auditor and we go on this way and we go on and we go on and we go on and every time we say the word auditor the pcs bank says well us willow wands thank you his attention is being pulled out of session out of session out of session out of session dont you see so the arc break eventually disappears without the tone arm going down youve stiffened the bank up dont you see now we had it stiffened up on the ptp now it gets stiffer on the arc break and now you say do you have any withholds from over here see you know you know withholds from and all of sudden all of sudden us willow wands and the bank again doesnt go down nothing deflates here nothing happens so having gotten the rudiments in quote unquote in this particular instance all we have succeeded in doing is getting nonregistry of the meter by stiffening the bank up past registry you see how this could happen well its happened here lately to several cases ive been steering you along the line ive been steering you close to the edge in few places and out of the last weekorsos auditing these facts have emerged that some of the cases present in the last week or so being audited very few of them only something on the order of about 20 percent but thats good enough would have done much better thank you if the auditor had never touched rudiment because the auditor was getting them in by attracting the pcs attention violently off the goals terminal with resultant rise of tone arm in other words the rudiments werent being put in the meter was sudden just being beaten into nonregistry so finally all rudiments are out but not registering and rudiments can go out and not register if the tone arm is very high and the needle is very sticky you should realize that as part of your auditing kit try it sometime assess somebody very carefully and get terminal lets say its hyperbolid see and then very carefully for very long time in auditing avoid ever letting him put his attention on hyperbolid and very carefully put his attention on everything else but hyperbolid and youll wind up at the end of this particular run with about 20 percent or something like that of the cases so run with high tone arm and sticky needle the rudiments have just all been violently driven out how have they been driven out well the pc is actually experiencing scarcity of auditing thats one of the reasons he feels he isnt being audited so that would be one reason and the other more important reason is the persons terminal is not getting the attention it thinks it deserves which is total attention you see how this could all add up then to miserable sort of situation so if in the process of putting rudiments in the tone arm starts up its very good thing to look very pleased as though youve just gotten the rudiments all in beautifully give two more questions give the rest of the rudiments rapidly and look very pleased needle falls off the pin on withholds you get the idea look very pleased about it all even heave sigh of relief if you want to make liar out of yourself but the sigh of relief would actually amount to the fact that youve actually gotten him out of that particular embayed position without running him aground completely hes just partially aground and then run whatever youre running and for heavens sakes make sure that what youre running has something to do with the goal or the terminal of the pc and his bank will soften right up and itll all come out all right but if you keep at it if you keep at it pound pound pound pound pound pound pound pound and that tone arm isnt coming down and the needle is getting too stiff to read youre just heading for trouble you can just park the case just like that oh im can tell you all this because it has been subjected to considerable test and nobody here was being used as guinea pig it just turned up as gratuitous fact it just turned up and took off its hat and said i am sturgeon and we said well how do you do thats the truth of it now terminals arrived at through dynamic assessment full dynamic assessment were apparently not too far off goals terminals so old dynamic assessment runs were not too bad but any vast concentration on the case where the auditor simply picks the terminal out of midair and makes the case concentrate on it is liable to bring about in enough percentage of cases to make you worry about it on all cases any time it gets up above 20 percent well its liable to happen to you at any time so just avoid it we recognize clearly that the goal and terminal of the pc properly run will get the case further than any other single process now remember now as we say this that rudiments are just process they are four or five processes thats what rudiments are they are just processes now if those processes take the pcs attention off his goal or terminal to too great an extent you suffer from this other liability the rudiments will go out faster than they go in and thats what ive been talking about on such case you will get further actually by auditing with the rudiments out rather than audit with the rudiments further out now it isnt true that case makes gain with the rudiments out the gain is very tiny there is some gain with the rudiments out it is very slow its quite microscopic but it is gain it is gain and that little tiny gain of course is better than negative gain see itd be better to audit toward tiny gain than to thoroughly messedup case see the better choice now this is invitation to assess people with the rudiments out it is invitation to run people with the rudiments out im just pointing out to you that under these circumstances that when assessment is driving the tone arm up pardon when rudiments for assessment just drive the tone arm up and make the needle sluggish when rudiments for the original runs on the case just drive the tone arm up and make the needle sluggish youre much better off saying well how do you feel about the room good is it all right if i audit you fine do we have any arc break good do you have any withholds oh fine good so forth oh yeah present time problem you havent you dont have any present time problem oh thats good thats fine fine thats wonderful all right now were going to run this process and it has to do with willow wand or in assessment in assessment there is another dodge you pick up the pc when the rudiments are most likely to be in and assess him at those times when the rudiments are likely to be in and dont assess him during times when they are likely to be out doesnt that sound weird you say to the pc how do you feel and the pc says oh i dunno im not too good and so forth and you say well well have session tomorrow you see you actually could do this you recognize that you could do this you say well what time of the day do you feel best and the fellow says i feel pretty good around three oclock usually afternoons he thinks this over well yeah usually afternoons i feel pretty good after lunch i feel pretty fine and you say well thats fine thats good now were going to have our assessments here were going to assess for thirtyfive minutes immediately after lunch thatd be way to get the rudiments in wouldnt it so it wouldnt be impossible even if the rudiments appeared to be out you would get someplace this way by picking only times when the pc was in good shape now youre laughing about this now but you actually will encounter this in your auditing and i can see that sooner or later youre going to use this on somebody well why all this why did they go out well i should give you this very important datum this extremely important datum you understand the datum i just gave you as important was that taking the pcs attention off his goals terminal could result in stiffening or massifying or solidifying of the bank as registered on the tone arm and needle of the pc and therefore it is liability to run any other terminal than his goals terminal all right heres the other one the pcs goal if run by itself on twoway or more flow should bring down the tone arm and that is wonderful thing to know that is wonderful thing to know youve got the pcs goal and terminal you cant get the rudiments in everything youre trying to run for some reason or other causes the tone arm just to go higher and causes the needle to be stickier and it goes along with an arc breaky pc and youre trying to run the goals terminal but you dont seem to be getting anyplace at all you know on 5way bracket or theres something messed up about the command or maybe the level isnt right or youve overrun level this was an old problem in clearing was overrunning level and getting the tone arm so high and getting the needle so stuck you couldnt reassess now i can give you method which should under ordinary circumstances since i havent done it to enough people to tell you broadly that itll do it to all cases i myself believe at this time that itll probably will undoubtedly do it to all cases but i cant tell you that from actual fact i can only tell you my observation up to this moment that running at least twoway flow on the exact goal of the pc phrased in some action wording would cause the prehav scale or stiffening of the bank or rudiments stiffening of the bank to come right off quite marvelous you see high tone arm you see high tone arm stick needle you dont know whats gone wrong your assessments might have been out on prehav scale you might have overrun something it might not have been proper command you might have been running with the rudiments too far out there might have been level which was left unflat and then you went on to another level and this goofed it there might be something wrong here and you cant quite find out what it is you apparently have this to fall back on you can phrase up the pcs goal you its given you have to have his goal already you can phrase it up so that it can be run just as itself and that is all you just run the goal it has to be action phrasing however you cant just chant lets say the pcs goal was dont want to go home you cant just say dont want to go home home dont want to go you know that would not be proper command phrasing you would have to say how or what or something like that what would you have to do to go home see something like that you see what would go what would wanting to go home involve some such phrase but its better to have it in twoway flow and youd say what would make you want to go home what would make another want to go home now theres very good one see what would make you want to go home what would make another one want to go home what would you have to do any such phrasing how could you go what would this involve any such phrasing woven around leaving the goal more or less exactly worded and intact will give you brandnew lease on life now you can you can discharge it all down you get back to where you were and youve now got needle that you can assess you got pc who isnt arc breaky and you now feel happy about the thing and you can go on auditing and find out what is wrong this is to get him back into the realm of the living so you see thats valuable thing to know if that fails you well youve always got suicide you could propose that to the pc that would solve his problems r245 by its various various other techniques so dont think that you just have this one technique to fall back on now thats valuable thing to know that you can probably desensitize the situation that is to say you can resensitize the meter by running the goal the goal run all by itself apparently produces some interesting interesting phenomena apparently goal can be run all by itself now let give you further ramification on this we find the pcs goal and the pc has goal of well lets say it was under circumstances to let the auditor have my terminal lets just corn it up but lets say that that was the pcs goal under circumstances to let the auditor have my terminal now of course youd recognize clearly in black and white letters of fire that under gods quantity of expert terminalfinding over the next three weeks were you going to have much of show because your pc is always going to have the rudiments out the pcs always going to have it mucked up one way or the other obviously with goal like that you see that clearly to never let an auditor get anywhere near my terminal or some such goal thats his the lifetime hes i mean its goal for the last trillion years see he knew he was leading up to this lifetime or something so he had his goal all set well you could turn around and run it and all you do is run the goal thats all youve got you havent got terminal so you just run the goal until you can got the goal kind of tamed down little bit and you can find the terminal now cute huh in fact this is so good that i dont know that it wouldnt become standard procedure to run the goal before you looked for the terminal because itd be very fast assessment if you did i dont know that it would become standard procedure but im just giving you warning having made discovery of this particular magnitude with what you can do with goal why you can be prepared for anything you can do something with goal and if i find you can do something with goal why i guarantee you that we will do something more with goal you see all right so there is method of shortcircuiting it now ive given you very weird and corny type of goal to never under any circumstances over my dead body to let the auditor have my terminal see thats very corny isnt it how about goal like this how about goal like this to remain totally undiscovered well isnt that the same goal isnt that the identical goal now how long are you going to sweat over that one before you get smart and remember this lecture im going to invite your attention to the pcs goal as indicative of his behavior in processing you look at the pcs goal ill predict his behavior in processing and i wont be hair off any time ive been looking down your throats on this now for weeks matter of fact i just i once angled in toward pcs goal because of his behavior in assessment he was just laughing minute ago there i did i said well lets lets sort that out from that angle because we couldnt get anything to stay in nothing ever would stay in on this goal and of course the thing was practically nobody is ever to find anything on you see that was the goal and it was very hard to find and this pc by the way was being assessed continually with the rudiments wildly out they were always out well lookahere it was after the fact youve got the goal so now you can understand why it was hard to get the assessment but remember youre doing youre doing the assessment before youve got the goal you you dont have this datum yet do you valuable as the datum would be to know the person the best way the most easily the easiest sessions you would ever run would be those sessions in which you were trying to find the goal that you already knew what it was thatd be very easy session to conduct the goal is to hit the audit hit an auditor over the head with an emeter you see and you know that so every time he reaches over for the emeter and so forth you put his arm back in the chair and you theres surprise involved with it dont you see but we sweat along over this goal for long time and we are considerably annoyed all during the assessment because at the least provocation the pc picks up the emeter and hits us over the head with it and we think this is getting in the road of the assessment you might say that the pc sitting there is the assessment so if we knew it in advance the pc would never give us any trouble but we dont know it in advance but lets use this idea we go down long list of goals on the pc routine 3 is just done routine 3 you understand there isnt big changes occurring here im just showing you some of the mechanics back of all this and we do an assessment we get our rudiiments in we get them in very well we make sure that sec check has been done on the pc we make sure everything is grooved in and everything is very neat and everything is very nice and we go down and we get the goals list and we get the thing all assessed out and we wind up with the pcs goal all right thats the way we should do it is there any way to make it any easier on us well thats for sure theres ways to make it easier on us as we look this thing over we should do goals list rather relaxedly we shouldnt attack the pc and extract his goals list from him something on the order of highwayman taking the gold off the night mail see this is kind of wrong approach we can weight this thing up with importance you see we can make this so terribly important we can make it under such strain we can put so much attention on these dennison crepe paper doors of the rudiments you see that he begins to think these things are castle high oh god nobody could ever oh i hope i dont i hope i dont have present i hope i hope i dont have present time probllem before this session because of course i wont get any place in the session and well have to spend the whole session on present time problem and i hope i dont have present time problem and lets see how can i keep from having an arc break with the auditor lets see if i get an arc break with the auditor then the auditor wont be able to find my goal and terminal and and the session will be good so lets see i guess matter what the auditor does i wont pay any attention i think that would be good idea now lets see room room well that room always makes nervous sososo the best thing for to do is just not look at it the whole session see the pc is helping you out see ah now lets see i have present time problem and im not going to say anything much to the auditor or not going to hear anything very much that he says and then ill get arc break and and then i wont notice the room so thatll stay in and withholds withholds do i have any withholds do i have any withholds at all lets see do i do i do i is there anything i havent told anybody lets see lets see now i guess i dont have any withholds but but on the other hand on the other hand he might find out the first third of my life somebody might get into that quarter of my life and maybe at the time of withholds maybe if i just sort of clench the cans convulsively when he starts asking about withholds well get across that one all right now ive got the rudiments in we will have session youd be surprised what goes on the pc pc tries to help you out all he can i just ran an assist little while ago by the way on quentin it had been carefully buried nanny had told him it was all better now and he was now well and you know i couldnt get single somatic out of him this little kid runs like like baby carriage you know hed fallen out of bed on his head somatics this character impossible because usually all i have to do is say bing bing bang thud put your attention on this that boom and it blows and thats about the end of that but in this place somatic somatic so i trace it back and i find out how hes been reassured while hes in state of near concussion that it doesnt hurt now somebodys installed somatic shutoff so i had to search this over and it took moment or two and i said well has anybody said anything about this you mentioned this to anybody nobody but soandso and they said it didnt hurt now and i said all right well do you recall when that was and where it was all right thats fine got that all straightened out okay now lets go through this whole thing again somatics you know bang right in there thud and he was running so dont think that im saying you dont have to have rudiments in here was somatic shutoff and here was somebody auditing before at the moment of the accident he had another auditor and he was still as far as the accident is concerned you see still totally fixated see on person that was supposed to be helping him out at that time so as long as that person was standing there in the incident the incident was shut off well of course rudiments are in essence an effort to be the pcs auditor and if you can become the pcs auditor through putting the rudiments in of course the pc runs wonderfully the somatics go on all kinds of things happen various phenomena occur pc goes rapidly through the bank the rudiments are out benefits occur less to the degree that the pc doesnt have an auditor you see i mean its direct proportion proposition the more he has an auditor the more confidence he has in an auditor and so forth why the more will occur in the session beneficial to the pc its direct proportion so dont let discount in your mind the importance of getting rudiments in ive just told you that there are times when its better to leave them slightly out than to drive them out with clubs i think we need new phrase about there lets just call them muzzled rudiments muzzled rudiments you know you say rumthumthumthumthumthum all right now were going to run this process and bang here goes your session you see youve gone through the form of model session and if one or two questions didnt release the needle you leave it alone you dont run any process on the pc you would do that at times when the tone arm was high and the needle sluggish during the last session that you gave the pc of course the pc comes in of course any pc of mine comes in with high tone arm and sluggish needle and they left the last session with low tone arm and loose needle i curl my long nonextant black moustache and i say well i dont mean to inquire into your private life but what have you been doing they usually tell and the needle goes down thud see needle goes loose tone arm goes down they go into session now in essence however if theyre not going to and if this phenomena is not going to occur by reason of everything being out you youre better off auditing them with rudiments out than trying to slug the rudiments in do you see thats the only point of judgment im trying to make with you muzzled rudiments if you notice that every time you try to get the rudiments in the pc becomes more arc breaky than before you might decide that its marvelous idea to do certainly one thing to sort of muzzle down the rudiments toughen up security checking on the pc you see thats not rudiment security checking is security checking see if hes going to be so chopped up and messed up and arc breaky hes probably got withholds like crazy so throw that over into the department of security checking and if his tone arm and needle are not responding to any process known to man or beast if youre lucky enough to have his goal run it you just run it and the whole thing will soften up itll bypass everything else thats happening to the pc because this is the single more important thing than present time you have something more important than present time so therefore it overrides the top of rudiments and so forth so is the terminal more important than present time but less so than the goal the terminal is not quite as important as the goal and the goal is the softer road see there can be several terminals to one goal you can run terminal flat for that goal and then have to find another terminal for that goal see and maybe have to find another terminal for that goal before you get rid of the goal but goal thats just one goal zoom when its out when youve got it audited out then it is out and that is it these are all points of adjudication what do you do in auditing and very finished auditor an auditor who really knows his business can handle pc well goes on the basis of fundamentals he sees what is happening with the case he knows what he wants to have happen with the case and he just throws aside all barriers which interpose on his having that happen with the case i gave you very crude example but very easily understandable one well all right im trying to give little boy an assist somatics well i dont try to sack into his past life and do this and do that and the other thing i just figure out well what woowoo this boy has somatics and he should have somatics and nobody has run this thing and must have been something in the environment at the time and sure we find somatic shutoff somatic shutoff knock it out there goes the rest of it would it have ever come out into the clear if id just run the process yes yes i could have run the thing and run the thing and run the thing and all of sudden he would have remembered the person telling him this and it would have blown anyhow and i would have come out the other end and it would have been the difference between about twohour session and fifteenminute session the way i did it was fifteenminute session you can always cut corners by knowing your business you understand that an auditor can almost always get there in some knuckleheaded fashion skill does just this it makes time difference in auditing it can make an enormous time difference in auditing it can be something on the order of five hundred to one see it can be fivehundred hours for one hour see pc gets this session auditor really understands this gets good grip on it has little bit of luck couple of horseshoes in one pocket and rabbits foot in the other pocket and some shamrocks stuck in his lapel just hits it you know bing and he said is it soandso and the pc says yes its soandso and he does soandso and zoom and thats it and that clears all that up and thats the end of that and somebody else runs the cchs and then follows through cchs and he runs present time problem intensive one way or the other and gets that out of the road he runs all existing security checks fifteen security checks more that he himself has thought up and so on and somewhere in this mass of stuff why he hits the exact thing that the pc was on and it happens more or less at that point because the pc is softened up you get the idea you could get there you can always get there you know but riding what tortoise sometimes now it isnt just basically that you always have to get there faster as matter of fact getting there swiftly is sometimes an economic liability and in society of this particular character getting there too fast and getting there too slow can be looked on alike as undesirable they would have you strung up in short order im afraid if you went out on the roads and you saw somebody sick and you said god bless you my and it he instantly was well and you looked around throwing these godblesses in all directions and so on well theyd say that fellow down there in judea its about time we hang somebody else man theyd hang you thats for sure furthermore itd be economically very difficult negotiations economic negotiations before you said god bless you you see would take more time than the cure and this would all be rather silly and of course im joking now about this but the economics of the situation do influence the length of time in auditing i just dont want them to influence the length of time in auditing the way they did in psychoanalysis almost the total end product of psychoanalysis is how long can you get somebody to be analyzed hasnt anything to do with what you do with the person in analysis its how long can you go because the longer it goes the better your paycheck is and the more weeks youre sure of it so theres an optimum that the society will accept in terms of speed economically now of course im just joking on that point but there is another point its how much change can pc accept over what period of time and you just start talking to this pc youre having too hard time with on the subject of clear and youre liable to find out that its just totally unacceptable proposition because he looks on it as rapid proposition and you talk to him about rapid clearing hes all set to tell you that he wants to be cleared this session well thats interesting because youll see some pcs putting it down session after session after session that the session goal they put down is to be clear well thats dandy were awfully glad they put that down as session goal nobodys criticizing it wouldnt say anything about it except for this it should occur to you as the auditor once in while not to question the goal but to discuss the subject with the pc with your eye on the needle now you shouldnt take up the pcs goals too arduously as did he reach them or didnt he and his goals are his goals and they are his goals for the session and you take up the sessions goals at session end and find out if he made them or didnt make them but if all the pc ever said was to be clear to be clear to be clear to be clear we wouldnt question the goal but sooner or later wed find out what was he talking about what was he talking about and youll find some tremendous variability they he doesnt really know what hes talking about now not that you would do this in session very often he definitely does know what hes talking about but not that you would do this in session but you could do this in session you could say all right this session we are going to try to make this goal of yours to be clear and were going to make it in this session and this of course to somebody thats reading at 65 and stuck up and so forth it wont necessarily violate his reality but itll violate his speedofprogress factor the idea of sitting down in this session in one condition and coming out at the other condition without any time allowed for adjustment healing feeling whether or not the water is cold doing all of these things you see and youre liable to get youre just liable to shake up the meter just just horribly im not saying you should do that im just saying the consequence of doing it on some pcs who have this as goal speed speed the speed with which you clear the pc is sometimes unacceptable to the pc and you very often will find pc planting his heels in but what has got its heels in and this is very important to you his goal has got its heels in thats whats got its heels in examine case from the aspect of its goal examine the goal from its aspect from the aspect of what dynamic it is an overt against and youll find out something about pcs youll find out how pc got goal in this solid he had this goal it was perfectly honest goal perhaps and it was it was perfectly good goal and he went along but nobody wanted this goal because it didnt fit with certain dynamics and they invalidated it and he reasserted it and they invalidated it and he reasserted it and they invalidated it and he reasserted it and they invalidated it and he didnt assert it very much and then he reasserted it and then they really invalidated it and after that he skipped it and it kind of crops up now and then he thinks about it you know sort of well sort of fairytale thing i mean nobody really believes in it you know it doesnt amount to much just something you and when you first pick it up youll find out it behaves like an overt pcs goal even though it is goal and it is perfectly honest goal nevertheless behaves like an overt and you can run it as an overt and thats why it works to run it two ways its running overts its the most remarkable thing you ever cared to run into all right lets take the goal to climb mountain highly unlikely goal on some pc but we will take it that way to climb mountain all right to climb mountain very good and you say you cant figure out that this would do anything to anything very much and you say what would this do to group and by golly the pc will come out with long chain of overts it is an overt against group to climb mountain you wouldnt think so at first glance but of course the goal wouldnt be stuck to this degree if it hadnt been invalidated if it hadnt been an overt see it was treated as an overt so it becomes one naturally its been objected to so often that its easily invalidated and this is how goal or terminal goes out on the pc any goal that was not mass goal of the race or line of the pc but not you know just actually not an axiom any goal that isnt an axiom is out of agreement to some degree and therefore has been invalidated very often by other members of the groups with which the pc has been associated has been invalidated on other dynamics and having been invalidated on other dynamics becomes fruitful source of invalidation now hes used it to invalidate eventually and people invalidate it so you say to this pc youre doing goals assessment on the pc and you say to climb mountain to climb mountain climb mountain did you ever go in for mountain climbing and the pc says oh huh and you say well your goal here to climb mountain did you ever go in for any mountain climbing and the pc says well not particularly i thought itd be very nice to climb mountain sometimes and you say well dont you find mountain climbing awfully tiring ah its not being done much these days you know did you know that did you know that airplanes now fly much higher than everest did you know that and you say lets take up this goal now to climb mountain it doesnt register now we get the rudiments in and get the arc break off and the thing registers again now whats whats the phenomena connected with this its just that the goal has been invalidated very often and has been used for the purpose of invalidation of certain groups of people and so is fruitful source of invalidation and you just sort of breathe on this goal lightly you see and it apparently folds up actually this is misnomer it simply disappears from view and it disappears from consciousness but it sure doesnt disappear from the reactive bank its in there plowing and chewing and mashing going on like mad you see down underneath the cover but you can actually can get it off of the meter by invalidation and because the terminal is an outgrowth of the goal it of course could be similarly invalidated well these things are easily submerged so the rudiments go out there disappears the goal and terminal you could go forever actually we have you can pull thousand fifteenhundred goals or terminals off of pc when the original ones are invalidated mm oh ill tell you one an hgc didnt take the pcs goals list pc laboriously writes out goals list so an hgc didnt take the pcs goals list but wrote the pc new goals list down for the pc taking it off by the meter that was it that was enough i dont know how long they assessed and it wasnt length in that particular instance they did complete misassessment the goal they found couldnt possibly have stayed in the terminal they found couldnt possibly have stayed in they ran it they got nowhere it was complete mess fortunately we found the list we found the list and found out about this and got this straight and so forth and it was just matter of i dont know five six hours just five or six hours there it was the pcs goal occurred on the original handwritten personally written list but didnt occur on later lists that any goal had been invalidated you see by not accepting just the pcs list of goals the goal the pcs goal disappeared it disappeared because when the pc was asked to list the goals again she didnt list it she omitted her goal interesting isnt it hahaha boy ill tell you finding goals and terminals is walking tightrope now are there any processes that you can run well ive given you one theres this goals process thats very good several brackets of the goals process two brackets or something like that its marvelous but there must be some other processes must be some other processes that you can run oh yeah well theres hatful of them ive just done safety table which i think you already have should have been issued it was last thursdays bulletin if it hasnt been issued to class it should be but its safety table safe processes thats all now this particular problem is what can you audit and it lays down this rule i have gotten enough information now so that i can write up problems intensive and will talk and give comprehensive lecture on the subject of everything about problems intensive all the form and so forth im redoing the form and so on but it follows like this that you can always ask generalized security check question contains the word you and it contains the word someone or anyone you can always ask that type of question you someone anyone you know have you ever robbed bank well fine not much of terminal bank have you ever have you ever sunk any boats these are not as good security check question as have you ever robbed anything have you ever sunk anything see the further you can get the question away from particularized or even what we used to call generalized terminal why the better off you are you say has there been any commotion before that problem was there any commotion before you had that problem when did you have that problem well what activity was going on then see you didnt name anybody you dont direct the pcs attention directly onto past terminals if you can possibly help it now understand you can get away with it you can get away with quite bit of this im just showing you that its poor practice and you should realize that it has liabilities and it has limitations so it is better security check question have you ever robbed whats the wheres the rest of it well just leave that to the pcs imagination his mind will go over onto something see see that im just doing the reductio ad absurdum actually this is being too careful see have you ever robbed the pc says well theres the next you know his mind connects on the proper terminal or whatever he has robbed you see all right this that thats nearly perfect but too extreme have you ever robbed anything or have you ever robbed anyone ah thats good see yeah thats all right thats quite acceptable you can play that around and do lot with this have you ever robbed your father oh that is utterly and completely unacceptable as security check question i finally got all of the bars down now and got this thing shaken out and seen where it lives and i know all about this thing and that is just not acceptable as security check question you understand what i mean what does this amount to have you ever robbed your father thank you have you ever robbed your father thank you have you ever robbed your father thank you have you ever robbed your father thank you have you ever robbed your father thank you have you ever robbed your father thank you well whats happening here attention on terminal father attention on terminal father attention on terminal father attention on terminal father this would be little bit safer but also little bit corny have you ever robbed any member of your family see at least his attention can flick around without you crushing it down against father hed be better off that would be the better thing to do you understand that youve got wide latitude here and you can get away with an awful lot im just giving you the perfections of it thats all im being pedantic in the extreme you can run through security check question you can actually assess lists of people and you can find out who drops the most and run practically repetitive command on the person of what theyve done to them you can do all this sort of thing and you just get away with it left and right as long as its security check because ow is the only thing thatll run against terminal its the ow that excuses it you can always run overt withhold as long as overts and withholds exist dont run overt withhold where overts or withholds exist that sounds awfully mechanically something but why why do i add the additional provision well this is strictly and entirely because if overts and withholds exist youre still putting the persons attention on another terminal than the persons goals terminal and youre going to get some kind of repercussion therefore when pc runs out of overts and withholds against certain person in the past he would get arc breaky why did you ever have pc do this yeah but theyre but i dont have any more i didnt do anything more i i mean i have i uh hes sensible now that his attention is being crowded newly over onto that terminal you got it washed up before but now newly youre crowding it onto that terminal thats bad show so security checking is the best way to run overt withhold and generalized sort of question is having to do with the action not the terminal is much better than any other type question and you get some sloppy pronoun type of terminal well thats not not perfect but its quite acceptable have you ever robbed anyone now you understand that you can throw questions in along the line but you should realize actually that you are just to some degree getting away with something its violation of this other so you are youre youre just getting away with something all right you take prior confusion well take up prior confusion in another lecture and beat it to death but you take prior confusion the person says well was there any excitement before when was the first time you noticed you had that problem oh yeah well thats good was there any excitement occurred just before that thats fine now oh yes well you had fight with your sister all right now what did you do to your sister there all right did you have any withholds from her was there anybody else you had any withholds from oh yes you had withhold from your sister good is there anybody else you had any withholds from then any more and so forth oh all right thats fine thats good did you do anything else in that particular period did you do anything to anybody else was there anything of this little earlier did you have any unkind thoughts any earlier about anything or anybody and so forth and youre just running unkind thoughts criticalness withholds overts you know just just reach around the basketful and just clean up the confusion you see just plug away at it and so on thats almost perfect youll find out the present time problem will blow the somatics will blow the persons illness will blow youll find out the arc breaks blow and so forth and it opens up the door to brandnew type of rudiment its security check type of rudiment you clean up your rudiments by security check and find out you can get away with it much better you dont have those at this particular instant theyre still in development it is based on this other lineup see the prior confusion to get rid of the outrudiment well it doesnt violate the goals terminal and it doesnt leave the pc sitting out in the middle of nowhere but let give you just this this other fact ive talked about it quite bit and ive been asked here question of what exactly makes the bank stiffen up by taking its attention off the goals terminal what exactly now ive said that the terminal asserts itself its one of the builtin mechanisms of the terminal that if it is ignored it gets apparent this is one of the mechanisms of the thing this is still however not answering this question because frankly i dont know frankly i can give you the generality and i can give you the basic law that makes it occur but the exact mechanics of how this is done actually practically practically it just staggers you trying to figure these things out exactly how would the pc with his left hand make his bank go stiffer and heavier and more solid and so forth so that he notices it on the right hand you see its always this mystery about how does the pc do it with his left hand in order to feel it with his right hand and just exactly what goes on here well the exact mechanics of the thing electronically and so forth i could not tell you at this time i donnt know but i can tell you this that you neednt worry about hidden standards anymore because all the basis of all circuitry are to be found on the goals list of the pc the basis of the pcs circuits are in his goals and the type of circuit he will have of various kinds will be found on his goals list so that you get his main goal youll find out one line of circuits and when you go down and assess another goal youll find another whole series of circuits after youve gotten rid of the first goal youll find another whole series of circuits obeying this other goal and we have the basis of circuits for any given individual and isnt it interesting that its different for every other individual so dont and there are couple of billion of them alive at the present moment right here on this planet so dont blame too excessively for not having noticed they were all the same mechanism before but i have just more or less scouted this out at the moment if person has hidden standard type of circuit that is immediately in action running the goal bypasses it and if he has several types of circuits they will be found somewhere on his goals list and you will get to those as you clear him as you get rid of the terminals and the goals why the next layer will unpeel and of course those that are most active may come last but they will surrender the most easily well what what is the goal of the pc well youll find this the first goal that you find on the pc remember youre going to find other goals on the pc too after youve gotten rid of the first goal it has to get out of the road but the first goal of the pc will describe the most available series of circuits and one of the things you do for the pc when you first find his goal is you actually do blow up some of his circuits so actually the best way to get at hidden standards is to clear the pc interesting isnt it but you clear him with his goal and if you bring his goal into the command his circuits will clear up which is whats new here youre getting commands now that include the pcs goals as part of the command which we will also talk about at some other time but its quite amusing if you recognize that the center this is possibility you see that the pc has goal never to give the auditor terminal they actually will respond as circuit which goes into action in the presence of an auditor and then which blanks out the pcs memory of anything if the auditor asks for the terminal see im just saying supposing this were the main goal of the pc just giving you piece of idiocy which is nobody ever had that goal you get how that would be hes got circuit set up so that you say now what is your terminal and immediately this thing goes into an occlusion makes him stupid and doesnt answer and he says huh you know all right thats his goal his goal expresses itself in circuit form so you get circuitry goals never to make money anywhere see thats his goal lets say its never to make any money at any time anywhere every time he sees himself in danger of making any money little voice talks to him and tells him thats the wrong thing to do he just comes close to making some money and little voice says well thats very bad thats very bad thing you know much more advantageous to sell it than buy it at this particular time you see and he gets caught in the stock market crash and hes always in financial disasters you ask this person who has goal like that if he was in any financial disasters oh yes yes lots of them well now do you have any little voice that tells you what to do in order to make money oh well its funny you ask this but i always have hunch well how does this hunch express itself well i get burning in the under my jaw here you know it sort of comes to life you know and i just know all right you run the persons goal you find the persons goal and run it couple of ways and so forth and this somatic will go kepshwt and there goes the circuit so were down to were in reaching distance of straight ways to blow circuits anyway so we have made considerable gain here in the past couple of weeks while youve been agonizing around but ive decided to treat you all nicely ive decided to be very good to you and so forth and as far as possible at the moment i have you running directly in the direction of clear pointed and fired and its some possibility that some of you in the next few hundred years might as youre auditing might accidentally slip you know and disconnect the emeter so the needle will float and something on that order im not going to threaten you with being clear you dont have to be clear if you dont want to be really you can go on being aberrated if you want to be and so forth the only thing i will say is if you if you insist utterly on remaining totally aberrated and so forth you have approached period when youve got to be very careful youve got to be very very very careful and try not to do any of the auditing commands because if you do just few of them its liable to happen and so im not threatening you and i dont want to beef up your banks and so forth or anything like that but im very happy to im very happy by the way with the general run of cases for the first time in many many many many many weeks first time this year actually first happy where im very happy with all the cases which are running theres couple of little question marks hanging over the left ear of couple of cases present but thats all working out and its all going very smoothly but i think you must somehow or another accidentally have applied some of the information youve been getting on the bulletins for that and for that i thank you i thank you very much so i hope that i hope you have very successful run of it and i do i want to see some clears here in the very near future so you too could sacrifice yourself toward this ambition or goal okay thank you
