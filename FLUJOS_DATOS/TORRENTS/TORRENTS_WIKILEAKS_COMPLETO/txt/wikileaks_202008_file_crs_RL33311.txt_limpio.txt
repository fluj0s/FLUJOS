updated february 22 2008 gary guenther analyst in public finance government and finance division federal tax treatment of health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed current law and issues for congress summary current federal tax law allows selfemployed individuals to deduct from their gross income the entire amount of their spending on health insurance for themselves and their spouses and dependents this report explains how these expenditures are treated under the federal tax code reviews the legislative history of the deduction assesses its effectiveness as policy tool for expanding access to health care for the selfemployed describes proposals in the 110th congress to modify the deduction and discusses policy issues it raises it will be updated to reflect significant legislative action under section 162l of the internal revenue code irc selfemployed individuals may deduct the entire amount of their payments for health insurance for themselves and immediate family members selfemployed individual is defined as sole proprietor working partner in partnership or an employee of subchapter s corporation who owns over 2 of the firms stock use of the deduction is governed by several rules first it may not exceed an eligible taxpayers net earned income from the trade or business in which the health plan was established less the deductions for 50 of the selfemployment tax and contributions to certain pension plans second the deduction may not be claimed for any period when selfemployed individual is eligible to participate in health plan offered by an employer or by spouses employer third the expenditures eligible for the deduction may not also be added to the medical expenses eligible for the itemized deduction under irc section 213 finally selfemployed individuals must include their expenditures eligible for the deduction in the income base for the self employment tax the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed has advantages and disadvantages on the one hand it is relatively easy for the irs to administer and for selfemployed taxpayers to claim and establishes greater parity between the tax treatment of health insurance for the selfemployed and the taxation of employer contributions to employee health plans on the other hand the deduction provides the greatest tax benefit for the same insurance policy to those who arguably need it the least selfemployed individuals with the highest incomes at least two bills in the 110th congress hr 3660 and s 2239 would eliminate one of the remaining obstacles to the equal tax treatment of health insurance purchased by the selfemployed and the taxation of health insurance obtained by employed individuals from their employers the obstacle lies in significant difference between the payroll taxes paid by wage earners and those paid by the self employed health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed are included in the income base for the taxes whereas employer contributions to employee health plans are not hr 3660 and s 2239 would allow the selfemployed to treat these expenditures as deductible business expense exempting them from the self

treatment of health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed current law and issues for congress current federal tax law makes it possible for selfemployed individuals to deduct the entire amount they spend on health insurance for themselves and their spouses and dependents this treatment is similar to the exclusion for employer contributions to the health plans of wage earners with one noteworthy exception employer contributions are exempt from payroll taxes eg medicare and social security taxes but health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed are not deemed deductible business expense and thus are subject to the selfemployment payroll tax companion bills in the house and senate in the 110th congress would allow selfemployed taxpayers to exclude those expenditures from the income base for the tax this report examines the current tax treatment of these expenditures the legislative history of the deduction its effectiveness as policy tool for improving access to health care for the selfemployed proposals in the 110th congress to alter the deduction and the main policy issues it raises current law and coverage under section 162l of the internal revenue code irc selfemployed individuals are allowed to deduct the entire amount of their spending for health insurance for themselves and their immediate family members selfemployed individual is defined as sole proprietor working partner in partnership or an employee of subchapter s corporation who owns over 2 of the firms stock1 the deduction is claimed abovetheline which means it may be claimed even if self employed individual does not itemize deductions on his or her income tax return some selfemployed individuals hire employees to assist with their trade or business any selfemployed individual who offers health benefits to employees may deduct the cost of those benefits as an ordinary and necessary business expense but 1 subchapter s corporations pay corporate income tax instead their items of income and loss deductions and credits are passed on to shareholders who must report them on their own income tax returns to qualify for subchapter s status firm may have more than 100 shareholders all of whom must be citizens or residents of the united states may issue only one class of stock and must be domestic corporation organized under the laws of any state or us territory crs2 he or she may not include the cost of these benefits in any deduction claimed under irc section 162l use of the deduction is subject to several limitations first the deduction may not exceed selfemployed taxpayers net earned income from the trade or business in which the health plan was purchased less the deductions for 50 of the self employment tax and contributions to certain pension plans eg keogh plans or simplified employee pension plans for the selfemployed2 if selfemployed taxpayer earns income from more than one business or trade he or she may not sum the profits and losses from those businesses to determine the net income ceiling for the deduction second the deduction may not be claimed for any month when self employed individual is eligible to participate in health plan offered by an employer or spouses employer third the expenditures eligible for the deduction may not also be included in the medical expenses eligible for the itemized deduction under irc section 213 though health insurance expenditures that cannot be deducted under irc section 162l may be included in these medical expenses3 finally health insurance spending by selfemployed individuals is not deemed business expense which means that those expenditures are part of the income base for the self employment tax of 153 in addition selfemployed individuals may add their payments for longterm care insurance to the health insurance expenditures eligible for the deduction but the deductible amount of longterm care insurance premiums is limited by the age of the individual at the close of the tax year and the limits are indexed for inflation in 2008 the deductible amounts range from 310 for those age 40 and under to 3850 for those age 71 and over besides purchasing health insurance policy in the nongroup market and claiming the deduction selfemployed individual has two options for obtaining health insurance coverage that offer more tax advantages than the deduction they may open health savings account hsa which serves as taxexempt vehicle for paying medical and dental expenses not covered by insurance or not otherwise reimbursable4 an individual can open an hsa and make contributions to it only if he or she is covered by qualified highdeductible health insurance plan and other plan including medicare with few exceptions in 2008 qualified plans must carry deductible of at least 1100 for individual coverage with an out ofpocket limit of 5600 and 2200 for family coverage with an outofpocket 2 all selfemployed individuals must pay the selfemployment seca tax whose purpose is to provide social security and medicare benefits to such individuals the tax whose current rate is 153 is assessed on selfemployment income which is defined as the net earnings from selfemployment in reality it consists of two separate taxes 124 social security tax and 29 medicare tax employees pay the same taxes but they split the tax evenly with their employers 3 taxpayers claiming the itemized deduction for medical expenses may deduct all such expenses that exceed 75 of adjusted gross income 4 for more details on hsas see crs report rl33257 health savings accounts overview of rules for 2008 by bob lyke crs3 limit of 11200 total contributions to an hsa in 2008 are limited to the lesser of the deductible or 2900 for individual plans and the lesser of the deductible or 5800 for family plans employer contributions are exempt from income and employment taxes and account owners may claim deduction for contributions they make selfemployed individuals may not contribute to an hsa on pretax basis unlike employees who contribute to such an account through an employers cafeteria plan and they must include their contributions in the income base used to determine the selfemployment tax withdrawals to pay for medical expenses are not subject to taxation unused balances may be carried over without limit to the following year with tax penalty selfemployed individuals may also open archer medical savings accounts msas though the total number of such accounts nationwide is currently capped at 750000 they are similar in design to hsas but more restrictive in the rules for contributions holders of msas are allowed to own hsas and transfer their msa balances to the new accounts it is not known how many selfemployed individuals are covered by msas and hsas an estimated 141 million nonelderly individuals were selfemployed in 2006 the most recent year for which data on us health insurance coverage by employment status are available of this total population 97 million had private health insurance 09 million received public health insurance mainly medicaid and 38 million were uninsured5 about 72 of the selfemployed with private health insurance or 70 million in 2006 were covered through plans offered by current or former employer or spouses employer the remaining 27 million or 19 of the selfemployed population with private health insurance purchased it on their own according to the internal revenue service irs selfemployed taxpayers filed 39 million claims for the deduction for total amount of 196 billion in 2005 see table 16 individuals with adjusted gross incomes from 50000 to under 500000 accounted for 58 of those claims the revenue cost of the deduction was an estimated 43 billion in fy20077 this cost represents the tax revenue that would have been collected if there were deduction and selfemployed taxpayers instead had added their health insurance expenditures to the expenses eligible for the

washington 2007 table 1 p 37 1991 legislative history of the health insurance deduction for the selfemployed the tax deduction for health insurance purchased by selfemployed individuals entered the federal tax code as temporary provision of the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 initially it was limited to 25 of qualified expenditures and was scheduled to expire at the end of 1989 although the act specified that congress was to assess the deductions effectiveness before it expired such study was completed congress made several significant changes in the rules governing the deductions use before it considered legislation to extend the deduction beyond 1989 the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of 1988 tamra pl 100647 added the limitation that the deduction cannot exceed selfemployed taxpayers earned income from the trade or business in which the health insurance policy was established tamra also added the requirement that the deduction be included in crs5 selfemployed taxpayers income base for the computation of the selfemployment tax string of laws enacted in the early 1990s extended the deduction for brief periods the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 extended the deduction through september 30 1990 and made it available to certain subchapter s corporation shareholders the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 extended the deduction through december 31 1991 the tax extension act of 1991 pl 102227 extended it through june 30 1992 and the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 extended the deduction through december 31 1993 for reasons that evidently had nothing to do with the effects of the deduction congress allowed it to expire at the end of 1993 and did not extend it in 1994 but bill adopted in april 1995 pl 1047 permanently extended the deduction retroactive to january 1 1994 it also increased the deductible share of health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed to 30 starting in 1995 and continuing thereafter the 104th congress turned its attention to the deduction again in 1996 when it passed the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl 10491 among other things the act established timetable for raising the deductible share of health insurance expenditures from 30 in 1996 to 80 in 2006 and thereafter hipaa also permitted selfemployed taxpayers to include in the spending eligible for the deduction any payments they make for qualified longterm care insurance as of january 1 1997 imposed annual limits on the amount of long term care insurance premiums that could be deducted and indexed these limits for inflation the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 pl 105277 accelerated the timetable for removing one of the differences between the tax treatment of employerprovided health insurance and the taxation of health insurance purchased by the selfemployed by raising the deductible share of health insurance spending by the latter to 100 beginning in 2003 and thereafter effectiveness of the deduction one way to evaluate the effectiveness of the deduction is to determine whether it has achieved its intended purpose congress was seeking to achieve at least two policy objectives in enacting the deduction as part of tra86 one was to provide the selfemployed with tax benefit for health insurance comparable to the exclusion for employee health benefits the other objective was to foster substantial expansion of health insurance coverage among selfemployed individuals8 to what extent have these objectives been achieved 8 us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the tax reform act of 1986 jcs1087 washington gpo 1987 p 815 crs6 the deduction reduces the aftertax cost of health insurance for selfemployed individual by factor equal to his or her marginal income tax rate for example selfemployed individual in the 35 tax bracket realizes 35 reduction in the after tax cost of health plan by claiming the deduction all other things being equal reduction in the aftertax cost of this insurance can be expected to lead to an increase in the coverage rate among the selfemployed the extent of the gain would hinge on how sensitive their demand for health insurance is to changes in its cost there is some evidence that the demand for health insurance among single selfemployed individuals is responsive to declines in this price9 yet unlike tax credit for the purchase of health insurance which would be of equal value to everyone who claims it the deduction is of lesser value to those with lower incomes and of greater value to those with higher incomes for the same health insurance plan this is because the tax benefit from deduction depends on taxpayers marginal tax rate for taxpayer in the 35 bracket 100 deduction reduces his or her tax liability by 35 but for taxpayer in the 10 bracket the same deduction yields reduction in tax liability of 10 to the extent that health insurance coverage among the selfemployed varies with household income the deduction reinforces this linkage does the deduction create level playing field between wage earners and the selfemployed in the tax benefits they receive for the purchase of health insurance yes and on the one hand the deduction has the same direct effect on the after tax cost of health insurance as the exclusion for employer contributions to employee health plans both lower that cost by factor equal to an individuals marginal tax rate on the other hand the expenses eligible for the deduction are subject to the selfemployment tax whereas employer contributions to employee health plans are exempt from payroll taxes this difference means that the aftertax cost of health plan is 153 higher for covered selfemployed individual than for covered wage earner on truly level playing field selfemployed individuals would be able to exclude their payments for health insurance from the income base used to determine the selfemployment tax it should also be noted that the federal tax code does not provide level playing for every taxpayer who purchases health insurance there is preferential treatment for health insurance bought by the unemployed or individuals whose employers do not offer health benefits other than the itemized deduction for medical expenditures is there any evidence that the deduction has caused an expansion in health insurance coverage among the selfemployed such an effect seemed to materialize in the first few years after the deduction was enacted in 1985 the year before the 9 1994 study by the economists jonathan gruber and james poterba of the impact of the deduction on the demand for health insurance by the selfemployed found that 1 increase in the aftertax cost of this insurance lowered the likelihood that single selfemployed person will be insured by 18 percentage points see jonathan gruber and james poterba tax incentives and the decision to purchase health insurance evidence from the self employed quarterly journal of economics vol 109 3 august 1994 p 727 crs7 deduction was enacted 69 of the selfemployed were covered through private health plans both plans they purchased individually and plans offered by former employers but in 1987 the first full year in which the deduction could be claimed the share climbed to 76 it is possible that much of that rise in coverage was due to the advent of the deduction still coverage has trended downward ever since it was 69 in 2006 the most recent year for which data are available10 in addition the share of the selfemployed population with individually purchased private health insurance was significantly lower in 2006 19 than in 1991 29 these declines raise the possibility that whatever initial boost the deduction may have imparted to the demand for health insurance by the selfemployed has been more than offset by certain other factors powerful countervailing force has been increases in the cost of health care which is the main driver of trends in the cost of health insurance in recent decades the cost of health care has risen much faster than overall inflation11 this is not to suggest that the deduction longer influences selfemployed individuals decision to purchase health insurance given that the deduction reduces the aftertax cost of health insurance health insurance coverage among the self employed since the late 1980s probably would have been notably lower if the deduction had not been available at the same time there is some evidence that the use of health care by the self employed is not as tethered to health insurance coverage as one might expect 2001 study by craig perry and harvey rosen of the role of health insurance in the use of medical services by the selfemployed found that the selfemployed had the same utilization rates for medical services in 1996 as wageearners despite the fact that they the selfemployed were substantially less likely to be insured12 more specifically perry and rosen found statistically significant differences between employees and the selfemployed in hospital admissions hospital stays dental checkups and optometrist visits while the selfemployed had higher utilization rates for alternative care and chiropractor visits the authors concluded that the self employed were able to finance access to health care from sources other than insurance such as their own assets or loans their findings call into question one of the justifications made for the deduction during the debate over adopting it 10 the source for these figures is the annual social and economic supplement ases to the current population survey cps conducted monthly by the census bureau for the bureau of labor statistics although the cps covers about 50000 households the ases is survey of about 78000 households that is done in march of each year respondents to the ases are asked to answer variety of questions about the health insurance coverage in the previous year of every member of household see the bureaus website at httpwwwcensusgovhlthinsoverview 11 for us urban consumers this cost rose at an average annual rate of 54 between january 1987 and january 2006 by contrast the overall rate of inflation for the same set of consumers in that period was 31 the price index used to measure the rate of inflation for health care is the consumer price index for medical care services used by all urban consumers 198284100 overall inflation is measured by the consumer price index for all items used by these consumers 12 see craig william perry and harvey s rosen insurance and the utilization of medical services among the selfemployed working paper 8490 national bureau of economic research cambridge ma september 2001 p 26 crs8 namely that it was needed to raise health insurance coverage among the self employed thereby giving them the same access to health care as wage earners covered by employer health plans legislation in the 110th congress to modify the deduction many bills to create new tax subsidies for health insurance have been introduced in the 110th congress some of them would benefit the selfemployed case in point is the proposals eg hr 914 and s 1875 to establish refundable tax credit for individuals who purchase health insurance on their own depending on its design such credit could lead to more extensive health insurance coverage among selfemployed individuals as well as the population at large key consideration is the effective rate of the credit if it is large enough to lower the aftertax cost of health insurance more than the deduction does then selfemployed individual would be better off claiming the credit simple example illustrates this point suppose selfemployed individual in the 15 tax bracket buys health insurance policy for 3000 would he or she be better off with 50 refundable tax credit for that purchase or deduction of 3000 with the credit the aftertax cost of the policy would be 1500 but with the deduction the aftertax cost of the policy would rise to 2550 and the individual would receive the credit even if he or she has federal income tax liability at least two bills in the current congress would modify the deduction to get rid of remaining difference between the tax treatment of health insurance purchased by the selfemployed and the tax treatment of employer contributions to employee health insurance the difference lies in the disparate reach of the medicare and social security taxes paid by wage earners on the one hand and by the selfemployed on the other hand health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed are subject to the taxes whereas employer contributions to employee health plans are not proposals by senator bingaman s 2239 and representatives herger kind schwartz and few others hr 3660 would exempt these expenditures from the selfemployment tax by allowing the selfemployed to treat them as deductible business expense it is not known what the revenue cost of the proposed exemption would be nonetheless this cost could be an important consideration in future congressional deliberations over whether to adopt such an exemption policy issues related to the deduction the tax deduction for health insurance expenditures by the selfemployed has several advantages it is relatively simple for the irs to administer and for self employed individuals to claim in addition the deduction contributes to an expansion in health insurance coverage among the selfemployed and their immediate families by lowering the aftertax cost of health insurance many economists regard lack of health insurance as market failure because of the negative externalities associated with being uninsured the uninsured are more likely than the insured to spread communicable diseases and the cost of uncompensated care received by the crs9 uninsured is passed on to taxpayers through higher taxes and to insured patients through higher prices for medical care13 the deduction also establishes substantial degree of parity between the tax treatment of health insurance purchased by the self employed and the taxation of health benefits obtained by employees from their employers yet the deduction also has some disadvantages some of which have implications for the debate in the current congress over the use of tax subsidies to shrink the size of the domestic uninsured population first the deduction leads to insurance outcomes that many regard as unfair or unseemly this is because its value to selfemployed individuals who claim it depends on their marginal tax rates under the tax systems progressive rate structure deduction of 1 is of greater value to someone with relatively high income as much as 035 than to someone with relatively low income as little as nothing although disposable income plays major role in decisions about whether to buy health insurance or how much coverage to buy the deduction delivers the smallest marginal benefit to those who arguably are in greatest need of public assistance in order to be insured one policy option for avoiding such result is to enact refundable tax credit for the purchase of health insurance that phases out over some range of relatively high incomes such credit would deliver the largest marginal benefit to those most in need of assistance and the smallest or marginal benefit to those least in need of assistance second the deduction cannot compensate for or replicate the significant advantages of receiving health insurance through an employer those advantages stem from certain critical differences between the group and nongroup or individual health insurance markets on the whole wage earners who receive health benefits through their employers participate in the group market while selfemployed individuals who purchase health insurance from private insurers participate in the nongroup market group health plans generally cater to the health care needs of relatively large groups of people who are drawn together for purposes other than obtaining insurance such as employment the plans are managed by sponsors eg an employer who negotiate directly with insurers on behalf of the insured members by contrast individual health plans generally are tailored to the health care needs of the individuals seeking coverage insurers set premiums and benefits in the group market mainly on the basis of key characteristics of the particular groups seeking coverage especially their recent claims history demographic composition and geographic location premiums tend to reflect an insurers assessment of the expected cost of claims for medical services by the average member of group or risk pool by contrast insurers set premiums and benefits in the individual market mainly through practice known as medical underwriting each applicant usually undergoes thorough medical examination to assess his or her risk for developing variety of serious health problems once the assessment is completed an insurer then decides whether or not to offer policy what coverage to provide if it offers policy and the cost of that coverage within the requirements imposed by state law 13 jonathan gruber public finance and public policy new york worth publishers 2005 p 401 crs10 the differences between the two markets translate into more stable pricing and lower premiums in the group market than in the nongroup market14 premiums tend to be lower for comparable coverage in the group market for several reasons group insurance offers economies of scale in administrative functions such as billing marketing and claims processing that cannot be duplicated in individual insurance in addition relatively large employers can use their employment size to negotiate deals with insurers that provide more generous benefits with lower costsharing requirements than individuals could obtain on their own there is simple or easy way to modify the deduction so that selfemployed individuals could enjoy the advantages of employersponsored health plans to the same extent as wage earners such an outcome would require an overhaul of the us health insurance market that would allow any adult not eligible for public health insurance eg medicare or medicaid regardless of his or her employment and health status to join any group health plan on the same terms as those available through similar plans offered by large employers third like the exclusion for employer contributions to employee health plans the deduction has the potential to foster inefficient uses of medical care such an outcome is the result of market failure peculiar to insurance markets known as moral hazard in the case of health insurance moral hazard refers to the impact of insurance on the demand for medical services health insurance gives covered individuals powerful incentive to consume too much health care because the insurance allows them to pay only fraction of its cost through deductibles or co payments as result they could use medical services until their marginal benefit equals their outofpocket cost and for someone with comprehensive firstdollar coverage that cost can be nothing widespread use of health care whose marginal benefit is less than its true marginal cost entails social welfare loss neither the exclusion nor the deduction are capped without an upper limit on coverage wage earners and the selfemployed are more likely to purchase generous health insurance coverage than they would if they were required to pay in aftertax dollars for coverage beyond the cost of typical individual or family policy in the regions where they reside indeed conventional economic theory predicts that offering substantial subsidies for health insurance coverage will result in the purchase of more insurance than individuals would choose without the subsidies15 this extra coverage is more likely to activate the substantial costs of moral hazard than coverage that requires individuals to pay for most of the cost of routine medical procedures and fully insures only large medical expenses16 capping the deduction at an amount tied to average premiums in the nongroup market for individual or family plans is one way to curtail whatever welfare loss arises from overly generous health insurance coverage for example the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform recommended in its final report that the exclusion for employer 14 crs report rl32237 health insurance primer by bernadette fernandez 15 kathleen mcgarry public policy and the us health insurance market direct and indirect provision of insurance national tax journal december 2002 p 795 16 gruber public finance and public policy p 409 crs11 provided health insurance be limited to 11500 for families and 5000 for individuals in 2006 these amounts were the projected average health insurance premiums that year17 and fourth the deduction does nothing to remedy lack of horizontal equity in the tax treatment of spending on health insurance under current tax law the unemployed and those whose employers do not provide health benefits receive abovetheline deduction for their expenditures on health insurance several proposals in the 110th congress eg hr 227 would eliminate this inequity 17 presidents advisory panel on
