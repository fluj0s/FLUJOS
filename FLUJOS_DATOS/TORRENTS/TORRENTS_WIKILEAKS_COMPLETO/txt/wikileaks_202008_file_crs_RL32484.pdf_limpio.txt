intermediate product ie portion of final product or some good or service needed to produce final product that was once produced domesticallyis not new phenomenon nor is it one that is economically distinct from other types of imports in terms of its basic economic consequences steadily rising level of trade in intermediate products is one of the salient characteristics of us trade and world trade for the last 30 years it has been estimated that as much as third of the growth of world trade since 1970 has been the result of such outsourcing worldwide while foreign outsourcing may seem different from traditional notions of trade in that it involves exchange of productive resource capital or labor rather than an exchange of final good and service the ultimate economic outcome is exactly the same net increase in economic efficiency through the elimination of economic inefficiencies that occur when countries use only the productive resources found within their borders this gain is not likely to be achieved how ever without causing costly disruptions for the particular workers and sectors tied to the nowimported good foreign outsourcing trade in general and trade deficits tend to change the composition of total output and the composition of total employment but it is unlikely that economywide they lead to any change in the overall level of either in some areas of the economy output falls and jobs are destroyed but in other areas output is increased and jobs are created there are two complementary reasons for this first the federal reserve using monetary policy can set the overall level of spending in the economy to level consistent with full employment with aggregate spending at the right level full employment is possible with or without outsourcing trade deficits or trade in general second according to basic economic principles any increase in the demand for an import will also lead to adjustments in the foreign exchange market that will induce an equal increase in the demand for the countrys exports of goods or assets the positive stimulus to employment of the increased export of goods is direct that of the increased export of assets is indirect but both tend to create jobs in other parts of the economy indirect evidence of this inherent twoway nature of trade and that increased outsourcing over the last 30 years has not likely led to significant net diversion of employment or output abroad is found in the relatively stable patterns of employment and output between the domestic parent and foreign affiliates of us multinational corporations in addition there is evidence of sizable foreign outsourcing to and job creation in the united states the destructive aspects of foreign outsourcing are costly and distressing to those whose jobs are lost to increased imports therefore matters of efficiency and equity are intertwined and one of the principal challenges for policymakers in the face of foreign outsourcing and trade in general is to find ways to ameliorate the associated harm without sacrificing the economywide gains that such trade generates compensation for loss and adjustment assistance is thought by economists

outsourcingthe importing of some intermediate product ie portion of final product or some good or service needed to produce final product that was once produced domesticallyis not new phenomenon nor is it one that is economically distinct from other types of imports in terms of its basic economic impact steadily rising level of trade in intermediate products is one of the salient characteristics of us trade and world trade for the last 30 years lower transportation costs improved international communication and the reduction of government barriers to trade have helped propel the transformation to an ever more internationally fragmented production process in many industries an obvious example of this is the automobile matter what the nameplate the raw materials are produced in many different places and parts are manufactured all over the world for final assembly often but not always in the destination country it has been estimated that as much as third of the growth of world trade since 1970 has been the result of such outsourcing worldwide 1 in the united states large shares of both exports and imports are intermediate products in the recent years just the capital goods category by itself has accounted for about 50 of nonagricultural goods exports and around 30 of nonpetroleum goods imports and the greatest change for the united states has occurred on the import side using capital goods as an example again in 1970 such exports were about 40 of total exports while imports had share of only 11 2 outsourcing may seem different from traditional notions of trade in that it involves exchange of productive resource capital or labor rather than an exchange of final good and service but it can be analyzed within the same framework as increased importing of final product or increased trade in general the central economic question to be answered is whether increased foreign outsourcing increases or decreases overall economic wellbeing to answer that question will certainly require an accounting of the deleterious effects of foreign outsourcing on domestic workers and industries who once produced the now outsourced product but it will also require an accounting of the gains to domestic consumers of the now imported product as well as any induced benefits to exporting industries if benefits exceed costs then measures to constrain outsourcing will tend to reduce overall economic wellbeing but even if it is clearly net gain foreign outsourcing brings into conflict the goals of increasing economic efficiency and maintaining an equitable distribution of those gains this intertwining of economic efficiency and distributional equity will mean that policymakers may find it difficult to take advantage of the increase in economic efficiency that foreign outsourcing affords without also establishing policies to assure equitable treatment of those whose jobs are lost and whose lives are disrupted by this market churning force what economic analysis also highlights is the inherent twoway nature of trade including foreign outsourcing something is given up and something is gained more imports tend to beget more exports if there are economic reasons for us firms to outsource abroad there are likely similar reasons for foreign firms to outsource to the united states jobs are created and destroyed what is produced and what is traded for will not be determined just by relative wages but rather the relative efficiency in the production of traded products low wages will likely attract certain types of production

productivity there will be many things that can be produced more efficiently in highwage economies such as the united states over time an economys relative advantages may change but there need be general deterioration in what it gains from trade perhaps foreign outsourcing is now more noticed b ecause it is occurring with rising frequency in the service sector and adversely effecting strata of the labor force that heretofore was more insulated than goods producing industries from the pressures of international competition but the nature of the process is the same whether it is trade between individuals regions or countries or trade of final goods or services or trade of intermediate goods and services increased economic wellbeing results from producing what one does best and trading for the rest in this economic framework it follows that for the nation trade is ultimately not about competition rather it is process of mutually beneficial exchange as noted above and developed more fully below the overall macroeconomic impact of foreign outsourcing will be net effect involving negative and positive impulses that create and destroy jobs unfortunately there are public data series that allows ready tallying of the net impact of foreign oursourcing on the economy 3 therefore beyond the predictions of economic theory analysis of this phenomenon must use indirect evidence since foreign outsourcing has already occurred on relatively large scale in the goodsproducing sector of the us economy this report takes the approach that this experience will be the best predictor of the economic effects of outsourcings spread to the service sector further it is assumed that the tools of economic analysis used to isolate and evaluate these past economic effects are appropriate for judging the probable economic effects of current and future outsourcing wherever in the economy they might occur g14g152g156g157g561g12g152g139g156g501g561 foreign outsourcing destroys jobs in those parts of the economy that once produced the now imported product but economic analysis tells us that due to offsetting employment effects in other parts of the economy foreign outsourcing or imports in general is unlikely to cause net loss of jobs economywide steady churning of labor markets is normal characteristic of dynamic market economy like the united states foreign outsourcing and increased imports can contribute to that churning and in doing that can be expected to change the composition of total output and the composition of total employment but they do not necessarily permanently reduce the level of either there are two complementary reasons for the re lative steadiness of total employment and output in the face of foreign outsourcing and other disruptive market forces first the federal reserve using monetary policy can set the overall level of spending in the economy to level consistent 3 beginning in 2004 the bureau of labor statistics has collected data on job loss do to transfer of work outside of the united states these data are measure of gross job loss and have shown that through early 2005 such layoffs have occurred on very minor scale of 3000 to 5000 workers per quarter that represents about 20 of the total layoffs in each quarter and an extremely small share of the us total labor force of over 140 million workers for these data see united states department of labor bureau of labor statistics extended mass layoffs various issues for further discussion of layoffs see crs report rl30799 unemployment through layoffs and offshore

well run monetary policy will minimize the incidence and duration of such episodes and help keep the total level of employment high in most years with or without outsourcing trade deficits or trade in general to give some perspective on the relation between job loss and total employment as well as the potential significance of foreign outsourcing in this dynamic process consider that in any quarter of 2000 at the peak of the last economic expans ion with total employment at about 111 million gross job losses tallied between 85 and 90 million nevertheless the economy at that time was operating at the lowest rate of unemployment in 40 years over the whole course of that expansion gross job loss actually rose as the unemployment rate steadily fell but with adequate economywide spending it was possible to create job gains that more than offset job losses in the somewhat more tepid labor market conditions of the current economic expansion gross job losses per quarter between 2002 and 2005 have averaged around 74 millioncompared with gross job gains in this period that have averaged about 78 million per quarter and as result led to rise in total employment during the 20022005 period in either time period gross job losses occurred on scale well beyond what is currently attributed to foreign outsourcing5 second against the economic backdrop of adequate aggregate spending any increase in the purchase of imports will tend to generate an equal increase in the sale of the countrys exports of goods or assets this outcome follows from the fundamental economic requirement that imports must be paid for and exports are the only means for making that payment the export sold does not have to be currently produced good or service it can also be the sale of an asset such as deposits in bank account shares of stock bonds or real property but in the end when tallied across transactions in goods and assets nations trade is always in balance in the sense that any imbalance in goods trade must be offset by compensating imbalance in asset trade both types of export sales will have positive effect on domestic output and employment countering across the whole economy the negative effect of increased imports in short the us deficit in trade is offset by the surplus in capital flows consider for example situation where service once provided domestically is now imported from country such as india since foreign suppliers do not spend dollars the us importer will have to buy the foreign currency needed from its foreign exchange market or pay in dollars and let the foreign supplier buy local currency from its foreign exchange market either way to generate the foreign exchange the united states must export something it can sell us goods or services or it can sell us assets ie bank deposits stocks bonds real property etc the positive stimulus of the increased export of goods is direct when foreigners purchase us goods us output and employment rise to offset the loss of service jobs to india if exports increase less than the amount needed to offset jobs lost the united states then must in effect borrow the money needed to pay for the increased imports through the sale of an asset the stimulus from an increased export of assets is indirect because the sale of an asset is equivalent to an increase in 4 economies always have some amount of unemployment each economy will tend to have natural rate of unemployment around which the actual unemployment rate fluctuates this natural rate will also represent the rate at which the economy is effectively at full employment b ecause lower rate of unemployment would not be sustainable due to the inducement of higher rate of inflation the natu ral rate is not zero because at any point in time there will be some people who are changing jobs and other people who normal market forces have temporarily displaced more fluid the economys labor markets the lower its natural rate of unemp loyment is likely to be for most of the last 30 years the united states economys natural rate was judged to be in the 55 to 60 range since the mid1990s the natural rate has likely fallen to the 45 to 50 range most often an appropriate level of aggregate spending is that consistent with employment at the natural rate 5 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics business employment dynamics various issues

domestic interest rates stimulating interestsensitive activities such as spending on consumer durables and residential construction and raising output and employment in these sectors6 therefore whatever negative effects increased imports have on output7 and employment are offset by the positive economic effects of increased exports of goods or assets8 the composition of output and employment will change in response to these changed demands but so long as the federal reserve can maintain aggregate spending at the an appropriate level total output and employment will not change as already highlighted above the ultimate steadiness of total employment in the face of increased imports does not mean that there are not likely to be important shortrun disruptions as displaced workers adjust to the new market conditions and th manner of that adjustment is likely to be an area of pivotal importance to workers and policymakers given the typical high incidence of intermediate products in export and import flows we will probably find that outsourcing into and out of the united states both rise as trade increases but this is not necessary condition because while all foreign outsourcing are imports not all imports are foreign outsourcing we might import an intermediate product and pay for it by exporting final product the general impact on employment and output are the same in either case however g7g159g146g141g142g151g140g142g561g143g155g152g150g561g23g495g21g495g561g15g158g149g157g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g150g153g138g151g146g142g156g561 multinational companies mncs account for very large share of the us economy in 2001 the mncs domestic parents produced about 25 of us gross domestic product gdp and employed over 23 million workers or about 20 of the nonbank work force mncs are even more important in us international trade bein g involved in nearly 60 of total goods exports and about 40 of total goods imports because of their central economic role if rising level of international trade and foreign outsourcing were diverting large number of domestic jobs overseas it would be evident in the pattern of employment between the mncs domestic parents and foreign affiliates large scale diversion of employment has occurred however 9 for the period that stretches from 1977 through 1993 mnc employment declined in both parents and foreign affiliates and the rate of decline was faster in the latter from 1994 to 2001 mnc employment rose in both the parents and the foreign affiliates this time employment in the affiliates grew slightly faster but not so much faster as to indicate any major shift be mindful 6 of course asset sales represent borrowing to sustain current domestic spending by transferring to foreigners claim on some amount of the future output of the united states the repayment of the loan will manifest as future trade surplus and net outflow of us exports of goods and services and thereby lead to reduction of future domestic spending below what it otherwise would be 7 the focus of this discussion is the circumstance when an import is direct substitute for domestic output imports however are not always substitutes for domestic output an impor t can be seen by consumers as distinct product and primarily generate an increase in total demand rather than substitute for some domestic product an imported good can be an essential component n ecessary for the expansion of domestic output an import can satisfy domestic demand that can not be readily supplied by domestic producers due to capacity constraints and imports from one country can be substitute for imports formerly obtained from another country 8 export related jobs generally pay on average 7 to 13 higher wages than jobs in inputcompeting industries so most often better jobs are being created than those that are being destroyed however the new jobs are not necessarily going to be filled by those w hose jobs were

unrelated to outsourcing and may not reduce us employment reasons for this would include expanding foreign markets not easily serviced by exports faster economic growth abroad or lower productivity in the foreign affiliate that the parents in this time period were also increasing their output share suggests that the differences in the rates of employment growth largely reflected slower productivity growth in the affiliates10 the natural twoway nature of trade suggests that for complete view of trades employment effects we also consider the behavior of foreign mncs in the united states us company can destroy jobs by diverting production abroad but foreign company can create jobs by diverting production to the united states economic reasoning tells us that if it is more efficient to produce some products abroad it is also likely that it is more efficient to produce other products in the united states therefore we might expect there to be outsourcing into and out of the us economy what we observe is that over the 19772001 period employment in the us by foreign mncs grew by 47 million exceeding the 28 million increase in employment in the foreign affiliates of us mncs 11 again employment shifts can occur for reasons other than outsourcing but if outsourcing is phenomenon of some significance for foreign and domestic companies then these data could indicate that the united states was more likely to be the destination than the departure point for foreign outsourcing

spending on plant and equipment between the united states and other economies could also be an indirect indicator of pattern of diversion of capacity and jobs to foreign locations if because of lower labor costs or other factors foreign locations are increasingly the preferred site for the production of many goods and services then we might expect that there would also be pronounced tendency for american companies to expand productive capacity abroad so as to take advantage of these situations for reasons similar to those outlined above foreign investment does not have to lead to diversion of domestic employment but if foreign outsourcing by us companies was occurring on large scale there might also be skewing of foreign investment fl ows in the same direction the evidence in this regard points to pattern of balance not net diversion to foreign locations while the image of the american company destroying jobs by closing its domestic operations in favor of some offshore location comes quickly to mind for many people it is an incomplete image of what has been occurring in the us economy for many years now more accurate image and one wholly consistent with the typical twoway nature of international economic exchange is one that also includes large inflows of foreign investment into the united states these types of investment flows are termed direct investment and their level and direction are tallied by the us commerce department each year 12 the data reveal that over the course of the 10 see robert lawrence globalization and trilateral labor markets new york the trilateral

investment in the rest of the world by 885 billion while foreign investors increased their direct investment into this country by 926 billion the similar size of these flows suggests that in this time period to the extent that such flows correlate with foreign outsourcing into and out of the united states this country had been as likely to be the destination of foreign outsourcing as it is the departure point in the current economic expansion during the period of 20022004 for which data are currently available the pattern has changed somewhat with the united states increasing its direct investment in the rest of the world by about 400 billion whereas foreign investors increased their direct investment in the united states by about 200 billion but as the expansion continues inbound direct investment will probably increase relative to outbound direct investment in part because growth in the united states is expected to outpace that in the rest of the world in addition data for capital expenditures by us multinational companies show that the shares of such spending between the parent and the foreign affiliates have been relatively steady suggesting increase in preference for foreign over domestic locations for expansion of production capacity 13

cited study by forrester resources projects that 33 million us sector jobs will have moved offshore by 2015 yet jacob kirkegaard of the institute for international economics iie has done close examination of the employment trends since 1999 in those occupations deemed at risk of moving offshore in the forester study some of the findings of the iie study are as follows the vast majority of the jobs lost from 2000 to 2002 in the at risk occupational categories were in the manufacturing sector and losses were therefore more likely the consequence of recession and productivity advance than foreign outsourcing the majority of those occupations affected by foreign outsourcing pay less than the average us wage and are as likely to face elimination through technological advance as outsourcing the it occupations that have seen declines are concentrated in lowskill occupations high paying it occupations have generally expanded since 1999 more than 70000 computer programers have lost their jobs since 1999 but more than 115000 higher paid software engineers have gotten jobs since 1999 these findings again suggest that to the extent that foreign outsourcing has affected these at risk occupations it is part of twoway process involving job destruction and job creation and that the jobs created may be better jobs than those destroyed therefore while some are hurt it is not clear that the overall impact is negative one 14 13 direct investment is part of the net international invest position of the united states and the data are available from us department of commerce

outsourcing that accompanies it is the belief that it must put downward pressure on the wages of domestic workers outsourcing is commonly seen as process driven by the search by companies for low wage environments that ultimately places american workers in effective competition with vast pool of lowerwage foreign labor and exerts downward pressure on worker wages this competition it is argued will result in the socalled race to the bottom between domestic and foreign workers for many the reality of the deleterious effect of trade on wages was given credence by the observed slowdown in the growth of real wage s and the widening wage inequality between skilled and lessskilled workers that occurred concurrently with the growth of trade over the last 25 years further there are credible economic reasons that increased trade and foreign outsourcing could have an adverse effect on the distribution of income the adverse distributional effect could manifest itself as deterioration of the position of labor relative to capital and falling average wage or as deterioration of the position of one class of labor less skilled relative to another more skilled and increased inequality of wages the effect of trade on wages in the us economy has been the focus of numerous studies over the last 10 years and the conclusions that may be drawn from these efforts are as follows as regards the slow growth of the average real wage from the mid1970s to the late 1990s increased trade is not seen as being the cause of that sluggish performance rather the identified reason was slow productivity growth labors share of the economic pie was not getting smaller the economic pie just was not growing as fast 15 that the level of wages is most often reflective of the level of worker productivity also explains why higher wage american workers are not necessarily at disadvantage to lower wage foreign workers the critical comparison is of unit labor costs not of the level of wages the high productivity that is the basis of high wage means that unit labor costs can be lower in the highwage economy than in the lowwage economy because productivity in low wage economies is commensurately low as well as regards trade and increased wage inequality the research indicates that trade was contributing factor but minor one accounting for perhaps 10 to 20 of the observed increase in wage inequality it would seem then that from the standpoint of the economy as whole trade with lowwage economies has not triggered race to the bottom likely important reason for the small effect of trade on wages for the us economy was that trade with lowwage countries was still relatively small amounting to less than 5 of gdp in 2005 in fact among us trade partners the average wage level in manufacturing relative to the us manufacturing wage level grew from 60 in 1975 to 76 of the us level in 2000 16 this 15 this conclusion is also confirmed by the absence of any deterioration in labors share of national income which has remained at about 70 throughout the postworld war ii era 16 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics perspective on us and foreign compensation costs in

economies have with open trade and steady economic growth become highwage economies as the once poor have moved up the income ladder they have also withdrawn from the production of goods that use lowskill and lowwage labor intensively and these products are then imported from the newer emerging economies china has picked up this task as other east asian economies have withdrawn and in turn as these economies did when japan shifted away from this type of production so us trade with lowwage economies is not rising to significant degree rather it is shifting location economies of scale are also factor that likely he lps hold up industrial wages in the face of low wage foreign competition scale effects are thought to be significant force in many industries and when present would tend to increase worker productivity and decrease unit labor costs it is also possible that the increase of competition itself spurs companies to higher levels of efficiency that also lowers unit labor costs and helps preserve higher wage level another reason for the small impact of trade on wages in the united states is that as the once lowwage economies transform to highwage economies two events occur one they tend to produce less of the goods typically produced by low wage workers and two they tend to increase there demand for the products produced by lowwage workers the two effects exert upward pressure on the wages of these workers including any producing similar products in the united states this outcome is consistent with the evidence that for the united states the relative price of unskilled laborintensive import competing goods rose in the 1980s and 1990s 17 of course it cannot be ruled out that if trade with relatively lowwage economies does grow in importance the negative effects on us worker wages of such trade would grow in significance yet there is probably an upper bound to this effect for it is possible that in the future with only relatively moderate differences between home and foreign production costs complete specialization would occur that is the united states would longer produce much of what is imported from lowwage foreign economies since the united states would then longer have industries that use lowwage labor intensively there would be downward pressure on domestic wages caused by such trade to the extent that this pattern of trade allows for fuller realization of economies of scale and lowers product pri ces domestic workers real wages could be increased the change in the location of us imports from lowwage economies noted above suggests that sizable amount of such specialization may have already occurred reviewing the period 1994 through 2003 the council of economic advisors concludes that for united states the increase in share of total us imports accounted for by imports of goods from china has been largely offset by decrease in the share of g oods imports from other pacific rim countries the value of imports from both sources has increased considerably still many of the export jobs in nonchina asia are migrating to china so the distributional effects of this change fell on workers in china and the pacific rim economies rather than workers in the united states18 also we know that industries that export pay wa ges that are on average higher wages than industries that compete with imports therefore as rising level of trade and outsourcing creates 17 jagdish bhagwati and vivek dehejia freer trade and wagesis marx striking again in jagdish bhagwati and marvin kosters eds trade and wagesleveling wages down washington aei press 1995 pp 3675 18 this also suggests any restriction placed on chinas imports to the united states would not increase domestic output rather it would increase the output of the pacific rim

the central economic question to be answered in regard to foreign outsourcing or increased international trade in general is not its particular impacts on employment or wages those effects are not to be ignored but they are symptoms of larger process the answer economic analysis attempts to provide is whether that larger process ultimately makes the united states richer or poorer as economic growth abroad expands the number of competitive sources of production will substituting foreign for domestic output generate gains from trade and raise overall economic wellbeing whether such foreign outsourcing is occurring in the service producing sector or the goods producing sector there will be the same array of possible positive and negative effects on the economy because importing must be accompanied by exporting the possible effects on the economy can be grouped into two general categories economic effects related to exporting and economic effects related to importing

outsourcing can in theory be positive or negative in most circumstances however the strong expectation of economists is that gains outweigh losses and that trades disruptive reshuffling of the economys productive resources does ultimately result in an increase in overall economic wellbeing19 that increased trade whether for intermediate or final products will likely raise economic wellbeing is confirmed by the preponderance of evidence20 the gains from trade are however most often net gain because some will be hurt by this process trade like other market forces generates increased wealth through process of creativedestruction which entails what is most often disruptive reshuffling of workers and capital new opportunities for enrichment are created and resources are drawn towards them but other activities that are less efficient are destroyed and resources are pulled away from them because there are net gains it is also in principle possible for the losers to be compensated and still leave the winners better off than they were prior to the increased trade in practice however there may be reason to question how equitable the compensation forthcoming is it is likely that general acceptability of increased trade will hinge on this equity issue in most instances the crux of debates about trade are not about the value of trade to the overall economy but over who will receive the benefits and who will bear the costs of trade if us worker without his employers knowledge were ab to subcontract outsource his work to foreign worker for fraction of his own wage he would likely do so while still earning his full wage the use of his freed time in other endeav ors would make him better off his employer and the ultimate consumers of the final product bear the cost in the form of lower profits and higher product prices than would be the case if the most efficient way of production was used directly of course if his employer learned of the relative efficiency advantage of the foreign worker she would most likely contract directly with that foreign worker outsource and lay off the domestic employee the gains and costs of trade are still the same as in the first circumstance but now they have been redistributed to the benefit of the domestic employer and her customers and to the detriment of the displaced employee economics cannot tell us which distributional outcome is preferred but it does tell us that outsourcing the task increases overall economic wellbeing equity concerns notwithstanding the expectation of enrichment though trade has propelled successive rounds of trade liberalization in the postwar era process the united states has consistently played leadership role in sustaining trade has expanded rapidly as has economic wellbeing of most trading nations and the increase in wellbeing is found to increase with countrys degree of opennessthe more open to trade the greater the gain 21 the gains from trade are mutual occurring even if the trading partners have an absolute advantage or disadvantage in the production of all traded goods and services as such country does not compete with its trading partners it engages in mutually beneficial exchange with them increased foreign outsourcing is symptom of these expanded opportunities for trade and mutual enrichment as the united states has benefitted from increased trade and outsourcing associated with the postwar industrial resurgence of euro pe and japan so would it likely benefit through 19 the gains from trade can emerge from comparative advantage economies of scale

phenomenon however while at any point in time an increase in trade outsourcing increases economic wellbeing over time the size of the gain could rise or fall as the relative economic circumstances of trading partners change therefore it can be telling of the economys international trade performance and its view of how it is faring from increased trade to consider whether there has been any longterm trend in the nations share of the gains from trade more specifically this is question about whether over time the us economys terms of trade has tended to rise or fall as economic growth has occurred in the rest of the world and foreign outsourcing has grown in significance the terms of trade is ratio of average export price to average import price and as such is measure of the export cost of acquiring imports an increase in this ratioan improving terms of trademeans that any given volume of export sales will now exchange for larger volume of imports indicating an increase in the gains from trade rising trend would indicate that countrys trade performance has improved relative to other trading countries reaping an increasing share of the gains from trade and real income benefits for the economy similarly decrease in the ratio of export prices to import pricesdeteriorating terms of traderaises the export cost of acquiring imports and reduces the gains from trade falling trend would be indicative of deteriorating trade performance decreasing share of the gains from trade and decrements to real income 22 over time it is likely that economic growth at hom and abroad will tend to show either bias towards the production of goods country exports or bias towards production of the goods country imports if export biased there is more then proportionate increase in the worldwide supply of goods that compete with us exports inducing deterioration of the us terms of trade over time to the benefit of our trading part ners in contrast if growth in the rest of the world is import biased there is more than proportionate increase in the worldwide supply of the goods the us imports inducing an improvement in the us terms of trade over time to the detriment of our trading partners increased foreign outsourcing is clearly manifestation of economic growth in the rest of the world and in recent years this has included the expanded participation of lower income developing economies in the internationally fragmented production processes that now propel large and growing share of international trade as was discussed in the introduction section of 22 deteriorating terms of trade does not mean that trade overall is harmful and that we would be better off without trade it has merely become less beneficial in most circ umstances there will be absolute decline in real income rather the rate of growth of income will be slower than it otherwise would have been also the terms of trade will not fully reflect the gains from trade that come from the realization of economies of scale this is of some significance for trade between mature economies that have similar factor proportions ie the united states europe japan and canada and has most likely steadily risen in importance for such economies this can be taken as at least partial offset to any loss in the gains from trade indicated by fa lling terms of trade nevertheless movement in the terms of trade would still be indicative of changes in the gains from trade coming from rising trade with low wage economies that would still have very different resource endowments ie relatively

that is occurring with steadily rising incidence in goods producing industries for the last three decades at the peak of the last business cycle in 2000 it is likely that very large share of total us nonagricultural merchandise trade exports plus imports is of some form of intermediate product and represents some form of foreign outsourcing23 has this increase in foreign outsourcing affected the us economys terms of trade has there been any tendency for the us share of the gains fro m trade rise or fall as result of outsourcing relative to its peak in the mid1960s the terms of trade declined at about 10 per year through 1980 but while significant this fall was moderate in scale this deterioration most likely reflects the recovery and return to competitive posture of the many highincome economies from the devastation of world war ii these are largely economies that have resource endowments similar to that of the united states and who with economic recovery from the war could be expected to increasingly compete against us exports in world markets this growth was certainly export biased and accordingly has pushed down the average price of us exports since the 1980s the us terms of trade has fluctu ated but overall has not shown trend up or down up in the early 1980s down in the late 1980s and early 1990s and then up again through the late 1990s to the present it is of course in this more recent trendless period that the use of foreign outsourcing was steadily climbing and the period when trade with lowincome lowwage economies was also on the rise yet the trendless path of the us terms of trade over this period suggests that these events were not inducing any significant persistent effect on the economys gains from trade growth in the rest of the worl d and the outsourcing that went with it in this period was on balance without bias towards the goods the united states exports or imports at this point there does not seem to be strong reason to expect the spread of outsourcing to the service sector to change this outcome

the idea of the product cycle provides useful way of understanding how an economys gains from trade over time emerges from continually changing industrial landscape and how foreign outsourcing may influence that outcome it has been long observed by economists that the production of many tradable products will move from country to country over the life of the product 24 innovations have their greatest value and are more likely to occur in highwage economies for the reason that labor in these countries is relatively scarce and costly and innovations most often offer means to economize on this expensive resource in the early life of product production occurs on small scale using relatively high skill workers the relatively high price of the new product will also offer relatively high returns to the specialized capital stock needed to produce the new product at this stage the factor endowments of highincome countries such as the united states will make them the most efficient location for production as the product matures with expanding foreign and domestic sales settled technology the capability 23 due to lack of comprehensive data series the size of trade in intermediate goods is judged from data on merchandise trade by enduse category which does identify trade in capital goods and industrial supplies because other types of intermediate products such as automotive parts and components are not picked up in these two categories it is most likely that such an estimate will understate the scale of trade in intermediate products see table b104 in economic report of

become possible and more efficient to produce the product or significant portions of the product on mass scale using relatively low wage labor at this stage in the products life it is likely that production will be pulled toward economies that have resource endowments relatively rich in lowwage labor such as china foreign outsourcing therefore can be seen as manifestation of this process of technological diffusion to other economies this process is not only relevant to the production of goods as portion or all of the production of service lends itself to standardization and international exchange the incentives to capture efficiency gains by moving the site of production towards lower wage economies will increase in the framework of the product cycle the united states is most likely to be operating at the innovation stage of this cycle therefore to significant degree its gains from trade will be determined by the dynamic balance between the economys rate of innovation and the rate of technological diffusion while not necessary outcome the rate of innovation will likely be correlated with the growth of new ideas for products and processes in the united states and the rate of technical diffusion correlated with the gr owth of cost reducing incentives afforded by foreign outsourcing unless the economy can generate pace of innovation to match the pace of diffusion its terms of trade will fall and its share of the gains from trade will decline such decline would not be an argument for not engagi ng in trade as that would reduce the gains from trade altogether but it would be an erosion of economic wellbeing and explain perception by some that the economy is getting less out of trade then it once did as observed above there has been trend decline in the terms of trade over the last twenty years it can be argued that the advance of globalization has accelerated the rate of diffusion the seeming rise in foreign outsourcing is symptom of that acceleration and the spread of outsourcing to services is the most recent manifestation of this process what this suggests is that preserving or increasing the economys gains from trade in the face of globalization will require an acceleration of the pace of innovation in goods and service producing activities while market forces may respond positively to the incentives for innovation offered by expanding trade case can be made that this is an area subject to substantial market failure and because of that the optimal amount of innovation will not be forthcoming the creation of innovations is largely process of generating new ideas to the extent that new ideas lead to profitable outcomes and those profits can be secured by private enterprise the market economy will generate new ideas and foster technological change an inherent attribute of ideas however is that they are nonrival as in my using the idea does not preclude someone else from using it further ideas will often have the attribute of limited excludability meaning the owner of the idea will find it difficult or impossible to charge fee for its use these attributes will likely cause divergence of private benefit and social benefit in the idea production process what the creator of the idea can expect to gain will be less than what the overall economy can expect to gain in this situation less than the socially desirable level of idea generation will occur in this circumstance public policy can improve on the free market outcome if it can foster more idea production

consistently run trade surplus in services25 that surplus stood at 58 billion in 2005 and it can be expected to grow in response to faster economic growth abroad and significantly more favorable exchange rate than has prevailed in recent years for example global insight projects us services trade surplus of over 120 billion by 2008 occurring along with steady rise in the level exports and imports of us trade in services26 in the business professional and technical services subcomponent of us services trade an area where outsourcing could be expected to be most likely the us had exports of nearly 62 billion against imports of about 23 billion yi elding surplus in 2004 of about 39 billion up from about 16 billion in 2000 this pattern of trade makes clear the twoway nature of services trade and that if the incidence of foreign outsourcing in both directions is proportional to the size of export and import flows then the us is likely to have more often been the destination rather than the departure point for the foreign outsourcing of services this would also suggest that the united states has large economic stake in the rising level of services trade employment data for the service sector also suggest significant economic viability unlike the hard hit goods producing sector where recession and laggard recovery have since 2000 caused substantial employment losses employment in serv ice producing industries held up far better in that sector employment fell only about 10 in the 2001 recession and in contrast to the goods producing sector has increased employment since then so that by early 2005 the level exceeded the previous peak 27 it is also clear however that until recently services had not faced the degree of international competition that has prevailed in the goodsproducing sectors the need for more personto person interaction and the relatively high cost of international communication made many services difficult to trade now however because of the increasing ease quality and ever lower cost of international communication afforded by information technology advances the possibilities for the trade of services have greatly expanded and in response the level of international competition in services is rising fast in this expanding arena for trade it is likely that the united states being the worlds largest producer of services will have comparative advantage in many areas of service production but not all areas and not in all aspects of the production of any given service therefore more foreign competition is likely to change the structure of many services industries we can expect to see substantial increase in the share of what was once done inhouse being outsourced and becoming service import as firms exploit more and more the efficiency advantages afforded by foreign production of many standardized tasks likely many other tasks will be outsourced to the united states again trade and foreign outsourcing in services will as it seems to have been in the wider economy likely be twoway process what the service sector can expect from increased foreign outsourcing has already been experienced by the manufacturing sector over the last 30 years that sector has certainly been greatly transformed nevertheless manufacturing has maintained healthy presence in the us 25 services trade data can be found in us department of

between 1990 and 2000 despite an unfavorable exchange rate during most of this period since 2000 the manufacturing sector has struggled with falling output and employment however most of the negative effects the us manufacturing sector has endured particularly since 2000 are seen by economists to be the consequence of economic forces other than foreign outsourcing and rising level of trade of greatest significance are changes in consumer expenditure patterns that place rising importance on the consumption of services relative to goods change common to most industrial econom ies rapidly rising productivity something unambiguously good for the overall economy and the burden of trade deficits on goods producing industries distinct from the rising level of trade 28

outsourcing is international trade in somewhat different guise like other market forces it causes disruptions that are costly to some but its ultimate effect on the economy is the same as any type of tradean increase in overall economic wellbeing because foreign outsourcing has already occurred on large scale in the goods producing sectors of the economy over the last 30 years its impacts are reasonably evident and seem to confirm this judgement what often seems to be missing in popular concern over foreign outsourcing is an appreciation for the mutual or twoway nature of the process the us economy outsources to foreign economies and foreign economies outsource to the us economy jobs are created and destroyed and overall economic welfare increases through this exchange if foreign outsourcing on balance raises economic wellbeing policies aimed at arresting that activity would have net economic cost there are however other avenues for policy response that most economists think could be generally beneficial one avenue is to work to expand overseas markets through further removal of foreign trade barriers against american exports second avenue would be to use policy to boost the benefits of trade by correcting deficiencies in the economys ability to create new products and processes that could become attractive exports third avenue is to use economic policy to remove any unwarranted bias against the economys tradable goods sector caused by an elevation of the incentives toward foreign outsourcing that arise from the economic forces generating the trade deficit fourth avenue would be to use 28 see crs report rl32350 deindustrialization of the us economy the roles of trade productivity and recession by craig k elwell and crs report rl32179 manufacturing trends

the phenomenon by imposing barriers to such exchanges will prevent the nation from fully realizing the economic gains from trade and therefore must reduce economic welfare economics has long taught that protection of importcompeting industries with tariffs subsidies or other devices to shelter domestic activity from international co mpetition leads to an overallocation of the nations scarce resources in the protected sectors and an underallocation of resources in the unprotected tradable goods industries standard eco nomic theory indicates that reducing the flow of imports will also reduce the flow of exports because fewer exports are needed to pay for fewer imports clearly the exporting sector must as the protected importcompeting outsource competing activities gain but more important the overall economy that consumed the imported goods would suffer because the more efficient production processavailable through international tradewould not be used to the optimal degree this would increase the price and reduce the array of goods available to the consumer from what they would otherwise be therefore economic analysis indicates that the ultimate cost of the trade barrier is not transfer of wellbeing between sectors but permanent net loss to the whole economy arising from the barriers distortion toward the less efficient use of the economys scarce resources these costs would be magnified if the trading partners disadvantaged by these actions retaliated against us exports there is ample evidence that the economic cost of protection is high the us international trade commission has estimated the economywide cost of existing us trade barriers to be about 124 billion and this is probably conservative estimate because it is difficult to fully account for the costs associated with lost product variety and productivity therefore the full cost of protection is thought by economists to likely be significantly higher than that estimate 29 study by hufbauer and eliott found that across 21 industries the economic cost per protected job ranged from 100000 to more than 1million and averaged about 170000 in each case the cost of protection was far higher than the protected workers average annual earnings and far higher than what any likely worker adjustment program would cost 30 2004 study of eight industrial nations including the united states provides estimates of the economic cost of existing trade barriers31 it was found that despite considerable lowering of trade barriers during the period after world war ii sizable barriers still existed in 1999 it was also found that removal of the remaining trade barriers among these eight countries would lead to an increase in global gdp of more than 500 billion in 1997 dollars or 21 of global gdp the gain to the united states alone was estimated to be about 77 billion in 1997 dollars or about 1 of gdp highlighting the greater gain associated with multilateral lowering of trade barriers 29 see us international trade commission the effects of significant us import restraints publication 3201washington 1999 30 see gary clyde hufbauer and kimberly ann eliott measuring the costs

countries if each removed their trade barriers unilaterally in this circumstance the gdp increase for the united states is pared to 30 billion or 04 of gdp in general the welfare gains to the united states are smaller then those of the other eight countries this is thought to occur for three reasons 1 us trade barriers were already lower than those in the other countries 2 trade represents comparatively smaller share of economic activity in the us economy and 3 because of the very large size of the us market there are increases in import prices causing some deterioration of the terms of trade and an associated decrement to economic welfare the argument may be made that some form of protection is needed to counter the unfair trade practices of some trading partners such practices do occur and in those instances some form of retaliatory policy may be appropriate 32 but it is very unlikely that such unfair trade practices are the principal force driving the ongoing expansion of world trade and the associated growth of foreign outsourcing if most unfair trade practices were gone tomorrow it is likely that trade would still be rapidly rising and that most of it s associated pressures and problems would still be with us more credible explanation is that the expansion of world trade is propelled by the prospect of economic enrichment and enabled by an increasingly open world trading system that allows each nation to use its resource endowments in more efficient ways it is differences in those endowments and how they are used that makes trade mutually beneficial yet it is often those differences that give rise to perceptions of unfairness what is an acceptable or unacceptable practice will not be considered here but is probably unreasonable to expect our trading partners to be identical to the united states in their economic and social practices from an economic perspective it makes sense that the level of labor and environmental standards would be correlated with nations level of income at their current stage of development many poor countries with very low levels of productivity simply can not afford the economic and social practices and institutions of rich economy like the united states with economic growth which trade helps achieve they may be able to this is certainly the path that todays rich nations followed 33 the clear direction of us trade policy in the postworld war ii era has been to reduce trade barriers not erect them and it is widely recognized that this process has been beneficial to the united states and the world economy with that gain will likely also come more foreign outsourcing but we can reasonably expect that outsourcing to the united states would also rise as exporting opportunities improve along with importing opportunities given that existing foreign barriers are most often higher than existing us barriers removing those barriers is likely to have relatively stronger beneficial effect on the united states particularly since many of the remaining barriers are against trade in services an area where the united states is likely to be very competitive 32 for discussion of the options available see crs report rl32371 trade remedies primer by vivian c jones 33 some industries or at least components of some industries are vital to national security and possibly may need to be insulated from the vicissitudes of international market forces this determination is best made on casebycase basis since the claim is made by many who do not meet national security criteria such criteria may also vary from case to case

deficits do not cause net loss of output or employment for the overall economy but they do shift the composition of output and employment and that shift in composition will have an adverse effect on some domestic industries that produce tradable goods or services this bias could tend to raise the incidence of foreign outsourcing the us trade deficit has risen more or less steadily since 1992 in 2005 it had grown to record size of 805 billion and was equivalent to 64 of gdp trade deficits are macroeconomic phenomenon that reflects shortfall of domestic saving relative to the domestic investment that needs to be financed this is precisely the same thing as the economy spending beyond current output this imbalance can be reconciled by net inflow of foreign capital that acts to augment the flow of saving available and allows the higher level of investment to occur the capital inflow pushes up the exchange rate which induces like sized net inflow of goods and servicesa trade deficit the rising exchange rate has induced this net inflow of goods by making imports more attractive to domestic buyers and the economys exports less attractive to foreign buyers domestic exporting and import competing industries will find themselves somewhat worse off as result in the current context jobcreating export industries will do less of that and rising tide of imports will mean more outsourcing is occurring34 this is distributional effect however for as some sectors lose others gain the capital inflow that is the necessary counterpart of trade deficit serves to increase the flow of saving available to the economy and has favorable effects on output and employment in activities typically financed by saving flows such as business investment and residential construction therefore removing this bias against the tradable goods sectors should be judged against the benefit to the overall economy of the capital inflow that animates this process most recently the trade deficits of the 19932000 period allowed the us economy to undertake rates of investment that otherwise could not have occurred the payoff is faster economic growth in the 1980s however large us trade deficits were used to support public and private consumption and arose in part from public policies that increased the federal budget deficit in this case there is payoff from faster growth it also raises the issue of whether the public policies involved were on balance good or bad at present an expanding economy along with large federal budget deficits may be recipe for perpetuating large trade deficits more along the lines of the 1980s experience then that of the 1990s if smaller trade deficit is judged the appropriate goal economic policy can be used to reach it if it is also judged prudent not to achieve this reduction at the expense of domestic investment then the economys rate of saving will have to be raised this is the same thing as saying the economys rate of consumption will have to be reduced economic policys ability to affect the private saving rate is problematic but macroeconomic policy can certainly change the public saving rate government budget deficits are subtraction from the nations saving and budget surpluses are an addition to the nations saving therefore policies that move the budget away from deficit and toward surplus other things unchanged will tend to reduce the trade deficit this will occur of course as depreciating exchange rate works to change the composition of domestic output stimulates export sales and dampens import spending and in the process likely 34 the exchange rate induced bias is likely to be particularly relevant when the decision to produce at home or abroad is not constrained by the need for large scale capital investments that are less likely to be influenced by the more near term effects of the exchange rate and hinges largely on relative labor costs

presence of market failure in idea production can be corrected by an appropriate amount of public support for the idea creation process such support could include public funding of research and development rd both basic scientific research where the prospect of market failure is the greatest and enterprisespecific research public funding for investment in human capital 36 particularly education in the sciences and engineering and public support for mechanisms to establish and enforce property rights such as patent and copyright administration the intent would be that these actions would boost the economys ability to create new products and better jobs and produce more appealing counterweight to the destructive effects of technological diffusion and increased imports and foreign outsourcing as jobs are destroyed by foreign outsourcing in one part of the economy it is hoped that the boost to the idea production process would improve the attractiveness of us exports on the world market leading to an acceleration of the flow of exports and foreign outsourcing into the united states and boosting the rate of creation of better jobs in other parts of the economy of course these are activities that the us government supports now 37 but the open question is whether such support is well targeted and undertaken at an adequate scale this is not an easy question to answer as regards spending on rd by private firms there is considerable amount of economic evidence that the social rate of return to rd for variety of research projects often greatly exceeds the private rate of return suggesting that too little research is being undertaken at optimal scale research projects would be undertaken to the point where the social rate of return has been pushed down to the level of private return by some estimates the level of investment undertaken by firms could be as little as 25 of the level what is economically optimal 38 can economic policy entice firms to increase their rd spending the patent system is one manifestation of governments attempt encourage inventive behavior by providing property rights over new ideas this is well developed set of laws in the united states and it is 35 the trade deficit would be reduced if foreign lenders curtailed their accumulation of us assets in this case however there would be increase in us saving so in this circumstance the adjustment must occur through higher domestic interest rates and lower domestic investment the favorable effect of the smaller trade deficit on trade sensitive sectors would be counterbalanced by the adverse effect on domestic interest sensitive sectors the dollar depreciation seen since early 2002 is most likely being driven by shift away from dollar denominated assets by foreign investors because the ec onomy is now operating with considerable slack the adverse effects of this capital outflow have been negligible for fuller discussion see crs report rl31032 the us trade deficit causes

much more rd there is the prospect that improvement in the establishment and enforcement of property rights internationally could have positive effect on domestic rd activity the functioning of the patent system however likely involves an economic tradeoff there is an economic gain from inducing more rd by companies but the knowledge that is produced will not be widely disseminated for the term of the patent given the cumulative nature of knowledge production this restriction on the flow of knowledge will nd to slow the rate of production of knowledge generally another policy device that attempts to coax more rd out of business firms is the rd tax credit 39 while the evidence indicates that the research tax credit does raise rd spending by firms many economists have significant doubts about how well the tax credit does at targeting and inducing rd projects with large social benefits why not use direct grants by government to firms to undertake rd projects that offer large social benefits relative to private return the information requirements for operation of an efficient grant program are likely well beyond what government could hope to muster th economic risk is that program of direct grants would by distorting the patten of investment and by encouraging rentseeking behavior generate more inefficiency than efficiency the dollar spending levels by industry and government have increased but as percent of gdp industrys share has risen and that of government has fallen since the 1980s it is government spending on rd that largely provides support to basic research this is an area in which the incidence of market failure in idea production is probably the greatest basic research is currently supported through the budgets of many government agencies including the national science foundation national institutes of health nasa the department of energys office of science and the department of defense much of the actual research is done at major universities across the country 40 one policy issue for basic research is determining the appropriate level of government funding the rate of accumulation of technical knowledge is likely to rise with the level of resources devoted to it but the speculative nature of basic research makes it all but impossible to judge what the economically optimal size of governme nt spending on such research would be the absolute level of inflationadjusted government spending on basic research has increased from about 14 billion in 1953 to about 39 billion in 2004 the intensity of governmentfunded basic research however has fallen decreasing from about 07 of gdp in 1953 to about 02 of gdp in 2004 international evidence has shown that there is positive correlation of the intensity of governmentfunded basic research and economic growth nevertheless the understanding of linkage between basic research and economic growth is not well specified making it difficult to predict the precise payoff in economic growth from given increase in spending on basic research this in turn makes it difficult to say what the optimal level of such spending should be second policy issue with governmentfunded basic research is the mix of that funding across areas of scientific inquiry the share of government research spending in healthrelated areas has risen steadily for the last 30 years and has increased dramatically over the last 10 years funding for lifesciences now accounts for 60 of the governments basic research expenditures in 39 see crs report rl31181 research and experimentation tax credit

physical sciences has not risen over the last 30 years and accounts for only 10 of the governments budget for basic research some argue that this disparity in funding is inconsistent with the often interdisciplinary nature of major innovations and is movement away from the balanced basic research portfolio that is most likely to yield the maximum longrun return this argument is not that research funds should be reallocated away from health areas but rather that there should be more balanced increase across all areas of basic research

industrial economies have developed policies to provide some degree of support for those displaced by recession or the ever present churning of market forces including trade because equity goals are as likely to be of as much concern to citizens and policymakers as are efficiency goals an economic response of foreign outsourcing can not be easily separated from consideration how those hurt in this process will be treated to the economist the policy challenge is to craft initiatives that equitably compensate and assist those who are displaced while also securing the efficiency gains from increased trade at the most general level the economist would argue for transfer of some of the gains from trade from the winners to the losers because increased trade generates benefits in excess of costs such transfer can in principle compensate those hurt by trade and still leave the wider economy better off then it would be without trade and outsourcing finding and implementing policies to effect such transfer remains an area of controversy it can be argued that in the united states and other industrial economies the postworld war ii economic order was built upon an explicit or implicit social bargain workers would accept the periodic disruptions associated with the market economys cyclical and destructive traits that are inherent to its rapid creation of wealth and rising economic wellbeing if those disruptions were cushioned by government provision of various types of economic support to see them through these rough spots public support rather than workers themselves buying insurance against the risk of job loss is thought the preferred method because the market failure caused by the problem of adverse selection will prevent the private market from providing an adequate level of coverage 41 while the social policies may have changed in form and extent over the years these worker support policies remain an integral piece of the modern industrial economy42 the level of economic support an unemployed or displaced worker receives can be seen as form of social insurance against the risk of job loss and its associated costs that fluctuating and ever churning market economy exposes workers to43 the argument can be made that if the velocity of market churning has increased in re cent years due to the combined or individual effects of rapidly rising level of international trade accelerating productivity advance or more 41 for further discussion of the issue of public versus private provision of unemployment insurance see crs report rl32194 job loss causes

market and the risk of unemployment that each worker faces have also increased some argue that higher level of risk would warrant higher level of economic support this does seem to be the case among

levels of government support expenditures44 in addition to the level of support consideration of the form of that support particularly the incentives for quick reemployment may be important in this
