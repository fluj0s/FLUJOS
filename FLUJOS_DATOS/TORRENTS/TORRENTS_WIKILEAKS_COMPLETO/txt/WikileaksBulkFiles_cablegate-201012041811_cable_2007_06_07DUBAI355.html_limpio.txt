said uae support for the us effort remained firm but asked what is plan b should the current us approach not stabilize iraq senator lieberman quoted the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as saying plan b is to make plan work alternative approaches new elections in iraq 4s asked by the senator for his advice on steps to move the situation in iraq forward mbr commented that he has little confidence in iraqi pm maliki and believes his loyalties lie elsewhere ie iran mbr suggested the way ahead would be improved by new elections which he believes would now yield better leader who is loyal to iraq senator lieberman noted he thought that maliki and his allies would oppose new elections the problem of alsadr 5s mbr said that at the moment muqtada alsadr is the single most powerful person in iraq the us should act against him ie arrest and imprison him asked if new elections might not yield alsadr victory mbr made clear he thought sunnis would now turn out in large numbers and that alsadr would not be able to win were the election fair comment reflecting commonlyheld thinking by uae seniors he clearly implied that almaliki had been elected through rigging in the last iraqi vote end comment progress in anbar province look to the tribes 6c commenting on the improved security situation in western iraq mbr voiced strong support for closer cooperation with the tribal sheikhs as has been proven if the tribal leaders can be coopted to work with the us they have the ability to defeat or suppress alqaeda he stressed the importance of working with the tribes without regard to

nuclear program is only to help meet domestic energy needs quipping how much can we believe what the iranians say is another question mbr seemed perplexed about the work of the iaea inspectors and believed that they could provide an objective view of the program senator lieberman reminded mbr that iran has blocked the inspectors and they have only been able to conclude that iran will have the capacity to produce enriched uranium on sufficient scale to either generate power or create nuclear weapon within the next three to eight years negotiations the best course of action 9c mbr and the senator briefly discussed the recent meeting in baghdad between the us and iran mbr saw this as very positive move recommending negotiations as the best way forward with iran he said that threatening iran encourages the iranian leaders to be defiant iranians are proud and the current extremist leadership would not only endure but benefit from an attack by the us such attacks would ensure the continuing power of the current government note presumable by rallying all iranians behind it in the face of foreign enemy 10c senator lieberman commented would maintain the stick even while it considered the carrot and that the two carrier battle groups now in the gulf were sending message to iran mbr responded that everyone in the region knows the us is powerful and can fight two wars simultaneously he said that part of the problem is the way you the us talk after making demand you the us should take two steps back before your next action everyone in the region needs to avoid the dangerous cycle of action and reaction the israelipalestinian problem has worsened because actions are followed immediately by reactions without thought 11s brigadier mohammad alqemzi who heads state security in dubai added that the iranians are traditionally great game players he said that the us should play the game of negotiation and diplomacy to contain iran rather than engaging in hostilities
