our willingness to reconsider our earlier decisions has been particularly true in constitutional cases because in such cases correction through legislative acti on is practically impossible seminole tribe of fla v continuedadherence to precedent is fundament principle of jurisprudence that promotes certainty in the law and uniformity in the treatment of litigants and thereby prevents arbitrariness5 the obligation to follow precedent be gins with necessity and contrary necessity marks its outer limit with cardozo we recognize that judicial system could do societys work if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it indeed the very concept of the rule of law underlying our own constitution requires such continuity over time that respect for precedent is by definition indispensable6 stare decisis is not constitutional command as justice frankfurter wrote stare decisis is principle of policy and not mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision7 the doctrine reflects policy judgment that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right8 safety valve is deemed necessary however in some instances it becomes important to the court to correct an earlier interpretation that it views as erroneous or longer viable although most justices agree that error correction should be the exception to the rule defining the circ umstances under which decision should be overruled is difficult task an inconsistent approach by the court in resolving the tension between the opposing goals of conti nuity and error correction can itself create uncertainty and unpredictability the court often explains that it is less reluctant to overrule decision that involves constitutional interp retation rather than inte rpretation of statute in cases involving the federal constitution where correction through legislative action is practically impossible this court has often overruled its earlier decisions the court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning recognizing that the proce ss of trial and error so fruitful in the physical sciences is appropriate also in the judicial function9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33172crs3 9 continued florida 517 us 44 63 1996 the converse of c ourse is that the court gives great weight to stare decisis in the area of statutory

13 casey 505 us at 85455 14 it is not often that the court calls the cont ending sides of national controversy to end their national division by accepting common mandate rooted in the constitution it has continuednonetheless when justifying an overrulin g the court usually looks for something in addition to its belief that case was wrongly decided although adherence to precedent is not rigidly required in co nstitutional cases any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification10 special justification can be one or mo re of several differe nt considerations and how strong justification the court re quires can vary with the importance of the precedent as well as with the importance the court attaches to overruling it the decision whether to adhere to constitutional decision is complex and difficult one that must account for variet of often competin g considerations11 in reexamining constitutional precedent the c ourt looks to series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling prior case12 the court has looked to the following general considerations in overruling precedent we may ask whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply in defying practical workability swift co v wickham 382 us 111 116 1965 whether the rule is subject to the kind of reliance that would lend special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation eg united states v title ins trust co 265 us 472 486 1924 whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule more than remnant of abandoned doctrine see patterson v mclean credit union 491 us 164 173174 1989 or whether facts have so changed or come to be seen so differently as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification eg burnet supra at 412

that it overrule its landmark abortion decision roe v wade 15 the court looked to the following factors we may inquire whether roes central rule has been found unworkable whether the rules limitation on state power could be removed without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society governed by it whether th laws growth in the intervening years has left roes central rule doctrinal anachr onism discounted by society and whether roes premises of fact have so far changed in the ensuing two decades as to render its central holding somehow irrelevant or unjustifiable in dealing with the issue it addressed16 finding none of these factors present the casey majority saw basis for overruling roe in their view roe had not proven unworkabl there was reliance of sort an entire generation has come of age free to assume roes concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society and to make reproductive decisions17 erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy had undermined roes central holding because roes holding was viewed as consistent with other personal liberty decisions reliance on roes precedent was viewed as unlikely to lead to erroneous decisions and although time had overtaken some of roes factual assumptions chan ged circumstances had undermined roes central holding18 the casey court emphasized that deci sion to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above th belief that prior case was wrongly decided19 basic change in the law upon gro und firmer than change in our membership invites the popular misconception that this ins titution is little different from the two political branches of government misconception could do more lasting injury to this court and to

education 195422 in west coast hotel the court overruled its 1923 decision in adkins v childrens hospital 23 which had invalidated state minimum wage law for adult women west coast hotel was not narrow ruling but rather in effect reversed the whole line of lochner decisions premised on acceptance of laissezfaire ec onomics and relying on employers liberty of contract to restrict social welfare legislation24 the nations experience during the great depression had changed perceptions between adkins and west coast hotel as the court put it reconsideration was imperative due in part to the economic conditions which have superv ened and in the light of which the reasonableness of the exercise of the protective power of the state must be considered25 although also grounding its decision in due process doctrin and in correcting what it viewed as an erroneous interpretation in adkins the court took judicial notice of the unparalleled demands for relief which arose during the recent period of depression and concluded that state could legislate to prevent the exploitation of class of workers who were relatively defenseless nd who might become dependent upon the community for support26 in brown v board of education the court arguably forced social change more than it responded to it27 the court abandoned its interpretation of the equal protection clause as allowing separate butequal treatment of the races and held that racial segregation in the public schools was i nherently unequal28 the court justified its changed interpretation by chan ging its conclusion about the stigmatizing effects of segregation whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of plessy v ferguson this finding that racial segregation stigmatizes minority

west coast hotel each rested on facts or an understanding of facts chan ged from those which furnished the claimed justifications for the earlier constitutiona l resolutions because each case was comprehensible as the courts response to facts that the country could understand the decisions were also defensible not merely as the victories of one doctrinal school over another by dint of numbers but as applications of constitutional principle to facts as they had not been seen by the court before31 divisive social issue was also impli cated in 2003 when the court overruling 1986 decisi on struck dow n state law that prohibited private consensual homosexual sodomy lawrence v texas 32 unlike brown and west coast hotel did not purport to rest on changed facts or ch anged understanding of facts rather the court in lawrence asserted that the court in bowers v hardwick33 had misread its own precedent and had too narrowly defined the liberty interest at stake the court justified its departure from stare decisis by concluding that the foundations of bowers had been eroded by subsequent decisions34 that the weakened precedent of bowers had been subjected to substantial and continuing criticism35 and that there had been individual or societal reliance of the sort that could counsel against overturning its holding36 dissenting justice scalia challenged these conclusions and suggested that roe satisfies these conditions to at least the same degree as bowers 37httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33172crs7 38 penry v lynaugh 492 us 302 1989 39 stanford v kentucky 492 us 361 1989

these decisions shed little light on general principles governing departures fromstare decisis however because they were controlled by the unique language of the eighth amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment 42 basically the court determin ed that although execution of the mentally retarded or of juveniles had not been unusual in 1989 it had become so by 2002 and 2005 respectively43 often especially if major social issue such as abortion or racial segregation is at issue societys understanding of th precedent is not implicated and the court may change and narrow

abandoned somewhat analogous tax immun ity distinction between governmental and proprietary functions47 the other side of the coin of course is that if decision has proved workable in practice and if its theoretical underpinni ngs have not been eroded justices may be unwilling to overrule it despite disagreement on the merits for example in refusing to overrule its landmark decision in miranda v arizona 48 the court in dickerson v united states49 pointed to the fact that miranda warnings had become embedded in routine police practice to th point where the warnings have become part of our national culture50 chief justice rehnquists opinion for the court stated that principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling miranda whether or not we would agree with miranda s reasoning and its resulting rule were we addressing the issue in the first instance51 reliance interests can sometimes tip the scales against overruling in declining to overrule 25yearold precedent interp reting the commerce clause as prohibiting state from collecting use taxes on outo fstate mail order businesses that do not have physical presence within the state the court stated that the rule

property and contract rights cases where reliance inte rests are involved from cases such as the present one involving procedur and evidentiary rules and pointed to the fact that booth and gathers were decided by the narrowest of margins over spirited dissents56 making more of an effort to pay homage to stare decisis the court in adarand constructors v pena57 asserted that correcting error can itself sometimes be special circumstance that justifies ove rruling precedent that occasion arises justice oconnor asserted for the court when the preceden t at issue was departure from intrinsically sounder and wellesta blished principles when the court cannot adhere to our most recent decisi on without colliding with an accepted and established doctrine58 the decision that adarand overruled metro broadcasting inc v fcc 59 had held in effect that congress had greater leeway than the states in adopting remedial racial prefer ences this interpretation the adarand court asserted undermined important principles blished in line of cases dating back over 50 years60 the theory that departure from welles tablished doctrine renders precedent subject to overruling was not new with adarand rather the adarand opinion found support in several earlier decisions sa id to rest on the same principle in united states v dixon 509 us 688 1993 we overruled the case of grady v corbin 495 us 508

put greater emphasis on the precedents departure from wellestablishe d doctrine and less emphasi s any other justifications for overruling62 both dixon and adarand overruled relatively recent decisions as justice oconnor pointed out in her concurring opinion in adarand quick overruling of precedent that departed from its antecedents does not depart from the fabric of the law but rather restores it and also minimizes the opportunity for reliance that could deter overruling63 although the newness of precedent is sometimes seen as reducing its immunity from overruling the oldness of precedent does not always prevent its overruling for example the court in erie railroad v tomkins64 overruled swift v tyson 65 decision then almost 100 years old on the basis that its recognition of federal common law was unc onstitutional and had led to undesirable results in commercial activities there are numerous other instances of the courts overruling of hoary precedent66 indeed the older precedent is the more possibility there is that its doctrinal underpinni ngs will have been eroded th rough developments in the law67 age of precedent can provide the opport unity for its reinforcement as well as for its erosion precedent that has become integrated into the fabric of the law is more likely to have engendered reliance interests and its overruling may

valid ity of statutes purporting to enforce the fourteenth amendmentdamage the ideal of the rule of law68 under this theory espoused in the courts opinion in casey stronger arguments should be re quired to overrule precedent that embodies the courts reliance on the constitu tion to settle na tional controversy when the court does act in this way its decision requires an equally rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that later decision overruling the first was anything but surrender to political pressure and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the court staked its authority in the first instance so to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to reexamine watershed decision would subvert the courts legitimacy beyond any serious question69 one of the reasons that there is so little consistency in the courts approach to overruling decisions is that individual ju stices individually balance their normative views on how the constitutional pr ovision at issue should be interpreted and their perceptions of the practical need s to submerge those views for the sake of certain social or institutional values such as stability continuity or consensus70 there are number of implications not the least of which is the fact that anindividual justice may strike different balance between stare decisis and error correction depending upon what the issue is and how strongly that justice feels about the error side of the balance and of course individual justices occasionally change their minds as to the workability of precedents 71 also justices judicial philosophy can affect the balance an originalist presumably would favor error correction over preservation of precedent regardless of how well established that precedent is justice thomas recently advocated this approach in construing the public use limitation of the takings clause todays decision is simply the latest in string of our cases construing the public use clause to be virtual nullity without the slightest nod to its original meaning in my view the public use clause originally understood is ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33172crs12 72 kelo v city of new london 125 s ct 2655 2678 2005

our case law has drifted far from the or iginal understanding of the commerce clause in future case we ought to temper our commerce clause jurisprudence in manner that both makes sense of our recent

laissezfaire the one being as unrealistic as the other as indefensible and probably as fleetingmeaningful limit on the governments eminent domain power our cases have strayed from the clauses original meaning and i would reconsider them72 justice thomas has also questioned th holding of 1798 case limiting application of the ex post facto clause to punitive legislation73 it is not just originalists who sometimes question long lines of authority for example different groups of four dissenting justices have long challenged the courts interpretation of the eleven th amendment set forth in 1890 in hans v louisiana 74 and reinforced in number of the courts federalism decisions over the last several decades as barring federa l court jurisdiction over suits brought by citizens against their own state the amendment by its terms applies only to suits brought against state by citizens of another state but the court has interpreted the provision as representing broader reco gnition of the principle of sovereign immunity justice brennan joined by three other justices in 1985 urged reconsideration because i believe that the doctrine rest s on flawed premises misguided history and an untenable vision of the needs of the federal system it purports to protect i believe that the court should take adva ntage of the opportunity provided by this case to reexamine the doctrines historic and jurisprudential foundations such an inquiry would reveal that the court has taken wrong turn75 on the current court justices stevens s outer ginsburg and br eyer have continued this argument despite the fact that the court majority has continued to apply and extend the sovereign immunity principle reflected by hans 76 for years justices brennan and marsha ll voted against imposition of the death penalty on the basis of their views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33172crs13 77 see eg coker v georgia 433 us 584 600 1977 justices brennan and

unusual punishment despite the accretion of precedents by which the court accepted capital punishment as constitutiona l and justice blackmun later came to hold the same view77 how does one measure the impact of stare decisis on the courts decision making one extensive study of the subject suggests that the critical question is whether precedent actually causes justices to reach decisions that they otherwise would not have made78 this can be verified if justices voice disapproval of precedent but nonetheless vote to uphold it79 spaeth and segals conclusion is that in the realm of stare decisis minority will does not defer to majority rule80 conclusion this sampling of the courts practice in adhering to or departing from precedent seems to bear out justice souters obs ervation quoted above that the decision whether to overrule precedent invol ves variety of often competing considerations81 including competing perspectives among the justices stare decisis is always one such consideration wh the court decides whether to overrule precedent but because the court does not appear to have developed coherent or stable conception of the appropriate role of precedent in constitutional adjudication82 it is difficult to predict when the court will rely on stare decisis and when it will depart from it
