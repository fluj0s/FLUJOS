of the us occupation contingent on the completion of new constitution and the holding of national elections for new government tasks to be comple ted by 2005 however political infighting among iraqs various ethnic and political factions coupled with persistent insurgency slowed progress on setting up an elected political structure the us administrator in iraq l paul bremer head of the usled occupation authority the coalition provisional authority or cpa in consultation with iraq is appointed to 25seat iraq governing council igc agreed to plan that would lead to sovereignty for iraq by june 30 2004 under the plan announced november 15 2003 transitional administrative law tal provisional constitution was to be si gned by february 29 2004 followed by the holding of local caucuses in each province to select national assembly by may 31 2004 the assembly was to choose an execu tive leadership the agreement encountered opposition from the revered shiite muslim leader grand ayatollah ali sistani who called for early direct elections his views prompted the cpa to ask the united nations to assess the feasibility of holding elections for an interim government team led by envoy lakhdar brahimi concluded in february 2004 that nati onal elections could not be held earlier than late 2004 or early 2005 sistani accepted that time frame the transition roadmaphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820crs2 1 the text of the tal can be obtained from the cpa website httpcpaira qorg governmenttalhtmlmuch of the brahimi findings were incorporated into the tal which the igc formally signed on march 8 20041 its key points are as follows transition government is to be fo rmed chosen by 250seat national assembly elected in vote later than january 31 2005 the assembly is to choose presi dency council president and two deputy presidents it is expected that the president would be shiite and the two deputies sunni arab nd kurd the presidency council is to operate by consensus incl uding in naming prime minister the election law for the transition government shall aim to achieve the goal of having women constitute less than onequarter of the members of the national assembly the kurds maintain their autonomous kurdistan regional government but they were not give n control of the city of kirkuk and they received some powers to contradict or alter the application of iraqi law in the kurdish provinces the kurdish militias peshmerga are allowed to conti nue to operate the transition government post january 31 2005 is to draft constitution by august 15 2005 and put it to national vote by october 15 2005 provision which sistani and the shiite islamists oppose allows twothirds of the vot ers any three iraqi provinces to veto the constitution giving the kurds who control the three northern provinces of dohuk irbil and sula ymaniyah essentially veto if the constitution is approved in th national referendum elections to new government are to take place by december 15 2005 and the government is to take office by december 31 2005 if the constitution is not approved it is to be redrafted and submitted again for approval and if approved elections are to take place in 2006 the tal states that islam is the official religion of iraq and is to be considered source but not the onl source or the primary source of legislation it adds that law can be passed that contradicts the agreed tenets of islam but neither can any law contradict the fundamental rights provided for in the tal those rights include peaceful assembly free expression equality of men and women before the law and the right to strike and demonstrate interim postjune 30 government the tal did not address how an interim government which will be in office from july 1 2004 until

times june 9 2004 smaller roundtable of iraqi notables or tr ansforming the existing or an expanded igc into the interim government continuing viol ence in iraq contributed to the us decision to give envoy brahimi substantial responsibility for selecting the interim government2 brahimi said he envisioned an inte rim government of technocrats who presumably would not seek to use their fficial positions to further their chances in january 2005 national elections however maneuvering by igc and cabinet members led to inclusion of many of them or their political allies in the interim government named on june 1 2004 few of the cabinet positions are held by relatively nonpolitical personalities the interim government began working immediately brahimi has said publicly that pressure by us and iraqi politicians to complete the interim government on time caused him to acquiesce to many of the appointments the composition and powers of the inte rim government are addressed in an addendum to the tal signed by the igc on june 1 2004 just before the igc dissolved itself the interim government has presidency composed of largely ceremonial president former igc member and shammar

works resolution 1546 many of the powers and responsibilities of the interim government are spelled out in security council resolution 1546 adopted unanimously on june 8 2004 which endorsed the handover of sovereignty its major provisions are the following after the handover us officials longer have final authority on non security related issues the united states and united nations intend that the interim government not make any longterm laws or decisions its primary function is to run the ministries and prepare for national elections the kurds fear that the interim government will repeal aspects of the tal that the kurds view as protecting them from the arab majority3 fear that was heightened by the omission from resolution 1546 of any mention of the tal that omission was reportedly at the behest of pressure from sistani and his shiite allies who want to remove from the tal limitations on majority rule prime minister allawi has tried to defuse this dispute by promising that the interim government would not undo the relevant provisions of the talhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820crs4 4 information in this section was obtained from various press reports the text of may 11

debates in th adoption of resolution 1546 was on security issues particularly the relationship between coalition forces and the iraqi interim government the operational relations hip to be one of coordination and partnership is outlined in an exchange of letters between secretary of state powell and prime minister allawi annexed to the resolution the resolution sa ys that the coalitions mandate would be reviewed at the request of the g overnment of iraq or twelve months from the date of this resolution th at the mandate would expire when permanent government is sworn in at the end of 2005 and that the mandate could be terminated at any time if the interim government so requests the iraqi government wa s not given veto over specific coalition operations and the coalition retains the ability to take prisoners resolution 1546 gives the interim gove rnment control over iraqs oil revenues and the development fund for iraq dfi subject to monitoring for at least one year by the unm

funds as of july 2004 about 8 billion of 23 billion in appropriated recons truction funds had been obligated legal issues of the handover number of legal issues are likely to arise the actual extent of the interim governments sovereignty or its lawful c ontrol over its own territory to the general exclusion of other states is unclear as are the continuing coalition responsibilities laws and agreements put in place during the occupation may be challenged placing the validity of legal contracts nd property interests public or private in some doubt the status of coalition forces remaining in iraq has changed somewhat as discussed below interpreting resolutions 1483 1511 and 1546 two sources of international law have governed the occupation of iraq u n security council reso lutions in particular resolution 1483 of may 22 and resolution 1511 of october 16 2003 and international treaties such as the hague regulations of 1907 and the fourth geneva convention of 1949 under these treaties and other sources fo rming the internationa l law of belligerent occupation an occupying power must maintain existing laws and governmental structure unless absolutely prevented by the exigencies of occupation and any such changes are temporary on the other hand resolu tion 1483 appears to contemplate an overhaul of iraqi institutions even as it reiterates the applicability of international occupation law resolution 1483 may be read to provide cer tain carveouts from that law allowing initiatives that might otherwise exceed th authority of an occupying power resolution 1546 recognizes that the inte rim government has only temporary and limited power noting that even as the inter im government assume s full responsibility for governing iraq it is to refrain from taking any actions affecting iraqs destiny beyond the limited interim period until an elected transitional government of iraq assumes office in effect resolution 1546 appears to substitute the iraqi interim government for the cpa as temporary governing authority until an internationally recognized representative govern ment is established but it appears that some of the cpas obligations and authority do not pass to the interim government and will remain instead with the united states as head of the mnf obligations that were made under explicit approval such as the oilforf ood program or the dfi are expressly madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21820crs6 binding on the interim government if iraq ex ercises full sovereignty as that concept is ordinarily understood the inte rim government could concei vably revoke or amend the tal notwithstanding provision in the tal that allows only limited amendment during the second phase of the transition despite language in resolution 1511 recognizing limited and temporary sovereignty in the cpa and the igc both entities arguably lacked the clear authority to bind iraq to any agreements outlasting the formal occupation of iraq cpa laws laws put in place by the cpa are to remain in force during the transitional period unle ss rescinded or amende d during the second phase of the transition the united states does not however retain an authority to interpret and enforce those laws although resolution 1546 admonishes th interim government to refrain from any actions that would affect iraqs postinte rim period destiny it is not clear whether temporary laws put in place by the cpa are automatically protected the interim government could conceivably choose to rescind such laws or agreements and decline to honor or enforce any obligations created pursu ant to them for example if cpa orders authorizing foreign investment in iraq were to be rescinded or m odified the interests of foreign investors could be adversely affected status of military forces it appears that the mnf is operating under mandate with the consent of the iraqi government rather than as occupying forces resolution 1546 reaffirms at the request of the interim government the authorization for the mnf to take all necessary measures to c ontribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq including by preventing and deterring terrorism until elections can be held under the letter from secretar powell annexed to resolution 1546 these measures include combat operations against insurgents internment where necessary for imperative reasons of security and the conti nued search for weapons that threaten iraqs security notably the mandate is to be nded at the request of the iraqi government although res 1546 recognizes the end of the occupation of iraq it nonetheless notes that the mnf is committed to promoting security and stability in accordance with international law including obligations under international humanitarian law ordinarily international humanitarian law would longer apply at the end of military occupation the resolutions leave ambi guous which of the responsibilities of an occupying power under the laws of war were to apply both during the occupation and afterward some observers ve suggested that iraq rema ins under facto occupation and that all relevant intern ational continues to apply status of forces agreement will not be possible until the second phase of the transition because only the iraqi transitional government will have the authority to bind iraq to treaties at present coalition forces in iraq are immune from iraqi legal process under cpa order 17 which has been extended for the duration of the mnfs presence however sovereign iraq even under an interim governme nt could assert the authority to revoke the immunity
