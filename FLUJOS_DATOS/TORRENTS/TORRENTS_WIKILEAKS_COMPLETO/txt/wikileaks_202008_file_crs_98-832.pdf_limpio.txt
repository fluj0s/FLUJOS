thus must be that under 1503 his lying to grand jury with intent to obstruct its investigation did not amount to corrupt obstruction of the due administration of justice on the face of it this is surprising proposition it supposes thatcorrupt has nothing to do with honesty that witness whose aim is to impede grand jury investigation by distorting the truth is not acting corruptly it also entails some odd consequences for instance how can it be that concealing or destroying documents requested by grand jury subpoena duces tecum may violate 1503 while lying under oathabout the location of the documents cannot anyone who intentionally lies to grand jury is on notice that he may be corruptly obstructing the grand jurys investigation russo also found inapplicable to 1503 the poindexter

government must prove beyond reasonabl doubt 1 that there was pending judicial proceeding 2 that the defendant knew this proceeding was pending and3 that the defendant then corruptly endeavor ed to influence obstruct or impede the due administration of justice 6 there is little dispute over the demands of the first two elements the supreme court has maintained for over century that person is not sufficiently chargedwith obstructing or impeding the due administration of justice in court unless itappears that he knew or had notice that justice was being administered in such court 7 marking the outer boundaries of corruptly endeavoring to influence obstruct or impede has proven more challenging several circuits have held that to actcorruptly within the meaning of the omnibus clause requires that the defendanthave acted with the intent to influence obstruct or impede the proceeding inquestion 8 the combination of this somewhat relaxed standard coupled with the the fact that an offender need only endeavor to obstruct gives the clause potentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98832crs4 9 united states v collis 128 f3d 313 318 6th cir 1997the action taken by the accused must be with an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings some courts have phrased this showing as nexus requirement that the act must have the natural andprobable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice quoting united states v aguilar 515 us at 599 see also united states v furkin 119 f3d 1276 1281 7th cir 1997 10 united states v aguilar 515 us at 599 600 united states v muhammad 120 f3d

we re intended to obstruct an actual judicial proceeding the government need not prove that the actions had their intended effectfurthermore an endeavor to obstruct justice violates the law even if unbeknownst to thedefendant the plan is doomed to failure from the start citing united states v osborn 385 us 323 333 1966 12 united states v masterpol 940 f2d 760 762 2d cir 1991 13 united states v tackett 113 f3d at 607 the second circuit has held that the enactment of new witness protection laws in 1982 and 1988 means that the government must prosecutewitness tampering under the new law 18 usc 1512 rather than under 1503 the othercircuits that have addressed the issue have reached the opposite conclusion see united states v malone 71 f3d 645 659 7th cir 1995noting that fourth ninth and eleventh circuits have held that the omnibus clau of 1503 continues to cover witness tampering united states v kenny 973 f2d 339 34243 4th cir 1992same for first fifth eighth and ninth circuits see

onfine by requiring demonstration of clear nexus between the obstructing conduct and the target proceedings the nexusrequirement is alternatively and more regularly cast as requirement that themisconduct have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the dueadministration of justice 9 there is requirement however that the defendants endeavors succeed10 or even that they were capable of succeeding as long as the accused was unaware of the futility of his efforts to obstruct11 the courts are at odds over whether the due administration of justice in section 1503 may be obstructed by corrupting witne ss before federal judicial proceeding the second circuit believes that when c ongress enacted the more specific witness tampering and witness retaliation provisions of 18 usc 1512 and 1513 it intendedto remove those crimes from the omnibus clauses inventory of proscriptions 12 the other circuits to the extent they have addressed the issue disagree13 the specific kinds of misconduct which under the appropriate circumstances may provide the basis for prosecution under the omnibus clause include creation of false documents to be presented in evidence14

1118 1127 dccir 1994 the court also observed that other courts have held that agency inves tigative activities are proceedings within the scope of section 1505 in those cases the investigations typically have involved agencies withsome adjudicative power or with the power to enhance their investigations through the issuance of subpoenas or warrants id 29 united states v leo 941 f2d 181 19899 3d cir 1991the government argues that the agency that badolate obstructed acted under the direction of the armys contractingofficer who had the authority to make adjudi cations on behalf of the defense department other courts of appeals have broadly cons trued the term proceeding as that term is used in 1505 the sixth circuit in united states v fruchtman 421 f2d 1019 1021 6th cir 1970 rejected the contention that the word p roceedings refers only to those steps before federal agency that are judicial or admini strative in nature the tenth circuit in united states v browning inc 572 f2d 720 724 10th cir 1978 wrote in sum the term proceeding is not limited to something in the nature of trial the growth andexpansion of agency activities have resulted in meaning being given to proceeding which is more inclusive and which longer limits itself to formal activities in court of lawrather the investigation or search for the true facts is not to be ruled as nonproceeding simply because it is preliminary to indictment and trial see also rice v united states 356 f2d 709 712 8th cir 1966proceedings befo re governmental department or agency simply mean proceeding in the manner and form prescribed for conducting business beforethe department or agency given the br oad meaning of the word proceeding and the defense contract audit agencys particular mission we agree with the

cir 1989the question of whether given congressional investigation is due nd proper exercise of the power of inquiry for purposes of section 1505 can not be answered by myopic focus on formality rather itis properly answered by careful examination of all the surrounding circumstances if it isapparent that the investigation is legitim ate exercise of investigative authority by congressional committee in an area within the committees purview it should be protectedby section 1505 while formal authorization is certainly factor that weighs heavily in thisdetermination its presence or absence is not dispositive to give section 1505 the protective force it was intended corrupt end eavors to influence congressional investigations must be proscribed even when they occu r prior to formal committee authorizationperhaps due to the breadth of judicial construction the question of what constitutes pending proceeding has arisen most often taken as whole the casessuggest that proceeding describes virtually any manner in which anadministrative agency proceeds to do its busin ess the district of columbia circuit for example has held that an investiga tion by the inspector general of the agency for international development may qualify as proceeding for purposes of section 1505 in doing so it rejected the notion that section 1505 applies only toadjudicatory or rulemaking activities and does not apply to wholly investigatoryactivity 28 furthermore proximity to an agencys adjudicatory or rulemaking activities such as auditors working under the direction of an officer withadjudicatory authority has been used to support claim that an obstructed agency activity constitutes proceeding 29 the courts seem to see comparable breadth in the congressional equivalent obstructing the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry by congress and its committees30 in the case of either congressional or administrative proceedings section 1505 condemns only that misconduct which is intended

that the accused knew the crime wasfederal or knew that the authorities were federal authorities but the government must still prove the existence of the federal nexus in fact 52 as practical matter evidence that establishes the requisite intent w ill ordinarily prove guilty knowledge as well corrupt persuasion corrupt persuasion seems to be both the most commonly charged and the most perplexing of the m eans used in violation of section 1512 to obstruct federal proceedings and criminal investigations there is consensusamong the circuits as to its exact demands the second and eleventh circuits have held the element requires more than that the government prove that thedefendants attempts to persuade were motivated by an improper purpose 53 the third circuit appears to have adopted an improper purpose plus standard having suggested that under the facts of give n case an accused who with the improper intent to obstruct attempted to persuade witness to testify falsely would be guilty of violation of corruptly persuading54 the district of columbia circuit seems to be similarly inclined for when it addressed poindexter based vagueness challenge it found the element satisfied by evidence that the defendant had attemptedto persuade witness to violate her legal duty to testify truthfully in court 55 when the defendants misconduct takes the form of deceiving potential witness with the intent that the witness ter repeat the deception either in federal proceedings or to federal authorities the government need prove neither that thepotential witness was in fact deceived nor that there was any particular likelihoodthat potential witness would in fact ever be called upon to testify or report 56 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98832crs14 57 puckett v tennessee eastman co 889 f2d
