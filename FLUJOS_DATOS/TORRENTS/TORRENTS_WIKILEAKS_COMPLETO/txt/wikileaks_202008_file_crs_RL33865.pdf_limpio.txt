implementation slowed however in the 1990s and during the past six years the bush administration has usually preferred unilateral or ad hoc measures to formal treaties and agreements to address us security concerns the united states and soviet union began to sign agreements limiting their strategic offensive nuclear weapons in the early 1970s progress in negotiating and implementing these agreements was often slow and subject to the tenor of the broader ussoviet relationship as the cold war drew to close in the late 1980s the pace of negotiations quickened with the two sides signing treaties limiting intermediate range and longrange weapons but progress again slowed in the 1990s as us missile defense plans and range of other policy conflicts intervened in the us russian relationship at the same time however the two sides began to cooperate on securing and eliminating sovietera nuclear chemical and biological weapons through these cooperative efforts the united states now allocates more than 1 billion each year to threat reduction programs in the former soviet union the united states is also prominent actor in an international regime that attempts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons this regime although suffering from some setbacks in recent years in iran and north korea includes formal treaties export control coordination and enforcement resolutions and organizational controls th nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt serves as the cornerstone of this regime with all but fo ur nations participating in it the international atomic energy agency not only monitors nuclear programs to make sure they remain peaceful but also helps nations develop and advance those programs other measures such as sanctions interdiction efforts and informal cooperative endeavor s also seek to slow or stop the spread of nuclear materials and weapons the international community has also adopted number of agreements that address nonnuclear weapons the cfe treaty and open skies treaty sought to stabilize the conventional balance in europe in the waning years of the cold war other arrangements seek to slow the spread of technologies that nations could use to devel op advanced conventional weapons the chemical weapons and biological weapons conventions sought to eliminate both of these types of weapons completely this report replaces crs report rl30033 it will

for much of the past century us national security strategy focused on several core interrelated objectives these include enhancing us security at home and abroad promoting us economic prosperity and promoting free markets and democracy around the world in addition the united states has used both unilateral and multilateral mechanisms to achieve these objectives with varying amounts of emphasis at different times these mechanisms have included range of military diplomatic and economic tools one of these core objectivesenhancing us securitygenerally is interpreted as the effort to protect the nations interests and includes for instance protecting the lives and safety of americans maintaining us sovereignty over its values territory and institutions and promoting the nations wellbeing the united states has wielded deep and wide range of military diplomatic and economic tools to protect and advance its security interests these include for instance the deployment of military fo rces to deter dissuade persuade or compel others the formation of alliances and coalitions to advance us interests and counter aggression and the use of us economic power to advance its agenda or promote democratization or to withhold us economic support to condemn or punish states hostile to us interests in this context arms control and nonproliferation efforts are two of the tools that have occasionally been used to implement the us national security strategy they generally are not pursued as ends in and of themselves and many argue that they should not become more important than the strategy behind them but many believe their effective employment can be critical to the success of that broader strategy many analysts see them as complement to rather than substitute for military or economic efforts effective arms control measures are thought to enhance us national security in number of ways for example arms control measures that promote transparency might increase us knowledge about and understanding of the size makeup and operations of an opposing military force this might not only ease us military planning but it might also reduce an opponents incentives for and opportunities to attack us forces or the forces of its friends and allies transparency measures can also build confidence among wary adversaries effective arms control measures can also be designed to complement us force structure objectives by limiting or restraining us and other nations forces in an era of declining defense budget resources such as the 1980s and 1990s arms control measures helped ensure reciprocity in force reductions indeed some considered such arms control measures essential to the success of our national military objectives similarly most agree that efforts to prevent the further spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery should be an essential element of us national security for one reason proliferation can exacerbate regional tensions that might escalate to conflict and involve or threaten us forces or those of its friends and allies proliferation might also introduce new and unexpected threats to the us homeland furtherm ore proliferation can greatly complicate us national military strategy force structure design and conduct of operations and these weapons could pose threat to the us homeland if they were acquired by terrorists or subnational groups hence the united states employs diplomatic economic and military tools to restrain these threats and enhance its national security

national security policy the president and many in his administration question the degree to which arms control negotiations and formal treaties can enhance us security objectives for example the president has argued that the united states did not need formal treaties to reduce or restrain its strategic nuclear forces and therefore initially intended to reduce us nuclear forces without requiring russia to do the same the administration only incorporated these reductions into formal treaty after russia insisted on such document similarly some in the administration have noted that some formal multilateral arms control regimes may go too far in restraining us options without limiting the forces of potential adversaries instead the admi nistration would prefer when necessary that the united states take unilateral military action or join in ad hoc coalitions to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the absence of confidence in arms control has extended to the state department where the bush administration has removed the phrase arms control from all bureaus that were responsible for this policy area the focus remains on nonproliferation but this is seen as policy area that longer requires formal arms control treaties to meet its objectives g22g145g142g561g3g155g150g156g561g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g561g3g144g142g151g141g138g561 the united states has participated in numerous arms control and nonproliferation efforts over the past 40 years these efforts have produced formal treaties and agreements that impose restrictions on us military forces and activities informal arrangements and guidelines that the united states has agreed to observe and unilateral restraints on military forces and activities that the united states has adopted either on its own or in conjunction with reciprocal restraints on other nations forces and activities because these arms control arrangements affect us national security military programs force levels and defense spending congress has shown continuing interest in the implementation of existing agreements and ongoing negotiations the changing international environment in the 1990s led many analysts to believe that the united states and other nations could enter new era of restraint in weapons deployments weapons transfers and military operations these hopes were codified in several treaties signed between 1991 and 1996 such as the strategic arms reduction treaties start i and start ii the chemical weapons convention and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty yet for many hopes for new era were clouded by the slow pace of ratification and implementation for many agreements the 1991 start i treaty did not enter into force until late 1994 the 1993 start ii treaty never entered into force and was replaced by new less detailed strategic offensive reductions treaty in 2002 the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt in spite of widespread international support failed to win approval from the united states senate in october 1999 furthermore india pakistan iran and north korea raised new questions about the viability of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and its role in stemming nuclear proliferation some progress did occur in the latter years of the decade in 1997 the united states and russia the two nations with the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons both ratified the chemical weapons convention in december 1997 more than 120 nations signed an international agreement banning the use of antipersonnel land mines although number of major nations including the united states have so far declined to sign however the us senates rejection of the ctbt the bush administrations withdrawal from the abm treaty and the us rejection of verification protocol for the biological weapons convention led many nations to question the us commitment to the arms control process the united states has outlined many new initiatives in nonproliferation policy that take far less formal approach with voluntary guidelines and voluntary participation replacing treaties and

has signaled change in the focus of us nonproliferation policy instead of offering its support to international regimes that seek to establish nonproliferation norms that apply to all nations the administration has turned to arrangements that seek instead to prevent proliferation only to those nations and groups that the united states believes can threaten us or international security in essence nonproliferation has become tool of antiterrorism policy which in some ways may diminish its role as tool of international security policy this report provides an overview of many of the key arms control and nonproliferation agreements and endeavors of the past 40 years it is divided into three sections the first describes arms control efforts between the united states and the states of the former soviet union covering both formal bilateral treaties and the cooperative threat reduction process the second section describes multilateral nuclear nonproliferation efforts covering both formal treaties and less formal accommodations that have been initiated in recent years the final section reviews treaties and agreements that address chemical biological and conventional weapons the report concludes with several appendices these provide list of treaties and agreements that the united states is party to description of the treaty ratification process and list of the bilateral and international organizations tasked with implementation of arms control efforts

limitation of strategic offensive arms and the treaty on the treaty on the limitation of antiballistic missile systems these were followed in 1979 by the strategic arms limitation treaty known as salt

soviet union completed the salt ii treaty in june 1979 after seven years of negotiations during these negotiations the united states sought limits on quantitative and qualitative changes in soviet forces the us negotiating position also reflected the congressional mandate for numerically equal limits on both nations forces as result the treaty limited each nation to total of 2400 icbm launchers slbm launchers and heavy bombers with this number declining to 2250 by january 1 1981 within this total the treaty contained sublimits for the numbers launchers that could be deployed for icbms with multiple independent reentry vehicles mirved icbms mirved icbms and mirved slbms and mirved icbms mirved slbms mirved airtosurface ballistic missiles asbms and heavy bombers the treaty would not have limited the total number of warheads that could be carried on these delivery vehicles which was growing concer n with the deployment of large numbers of multiple warhead missiles but the nations did agree that they would not increase the numbers of warheads on existing types of missiles and would not test new types of icbms with more than 10 warheads and new types of slbms with more than 14 warheads they also agreed to provisions that were designed to limit missile modernization programs in an effort to restrain qualitative improvements in their strategic forces although it contained equal limits on us and soviet forces the salt ii treaty still proved to be highly controversial some analysts argued that the treaty would fail to curb the arms race because the limits on forces were equal to the numbers already deployed by the united states and soviet union they argued for lower limits and actual reductions other analysts argued that the treaty would allow the soviet union to maintain strategic superiority over the united states because the soviet force of large landbased ballistic missiles would be able to carry far greater numbers of warheads even within the equal limits on delivery vehicles than us ballistic missiles some argued that with this advantage the soviet union would be able to target all us landbased icbms in first strike which create d window of vulnerability for the united states the treatys supporters argued that the soviet advantage in large mirved icbms was more than offset by the us advantage in slbm warheads which could not be destroyed in first strike and could retaliate against soviet targets and the us advantage in heavy bombers the continuing soviet buildup of strategic nuclear forces along with the taking of us hostages in iran and other challenges to the us internat ional position in the late 1970s combined with the perceived weaknesses to the treaty to raise questions about whether the senate would muster the votes needed to consent to the treatys ratification when the soviet union invaded afghanistan in december 1979 president carter withdrew the treaty from the senates consideration

missiles along with specified radars and sensors the abm treaty also obligated each nation not to develop test or deploy abm systems for the defense of the territory of its country and not to provide base for such defense it forbade testing and deployment of spacebased seabased or airbased abm systems or components and it imposed number of qualitative limits on missile defense programs the treaty however imposed restrictions on defenses against aircraft cruise missiles or theater ballistic missiles in protocol signed in 1974 each side agreed that it would deploy an abm system at only one site either around the nations capital or around an icbm deployment area the soviet union deployed its site around moscow this system has been maintained and upgraded over the years and remains operational today the united states deployed its abm system around icbm silo launchers located near grand forks north dakota it operated this facility briefly in 1974 before closing it down when it proved to be not cost effective the abm treaty was the source of considerable controversy and debate for most of its history presidents reagan george h w bush and clin ton all wrestled with the conflicting goals of defending the united states against ballistic missile attack while living within the confines of the abm treaty president george w bush resolved this conflict in 2002 when he announced that the united states would withdraw from the abm treaty so that it could deploy ballistic missile defenses the substance of this debate during the clinton and bush years is described in more detail below

taking office in january 1981 president ronald reagan pledged to restore us military capabilities in general and nuclear capabilities in particular he planned to expand us nuclear forces and capabilities in an effort to counter the perceived soviet advantages in nuclear weapons initially at least he rejected the use of arms control agreements to contain the soviet threat however in 1982 after congress and many analysts pressed for more diplomatic initiatives the reagan administration outlined negotiating positions to address intermediaterange missiles longrange strategic weapons and ballistic missile defenses these negotiations began to bear fruit in the latter half of president reagans second term with the signing of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty in 1987 president george hw bush continued to pursue the first strategic arms reduction treaty start with the united states and soviet union signing this treaty in july 1991 the collapse of the soviet union later that year led to calls for deeper reductions in strategic offensive arms as result the united states and russia signed start ii in january 2003 weeks before the end of the bush administration

progress occurred during the gorbachev regime at the reykjavik summit in october 1986 gorbachev agreed to include reductions of soviet inf systems in asia in june 1987 the soviets proposed global ban on short and longrange inf systems which was similar to the us proposal for double zero gorbachev also accepted the us proposal for an intrusive verification regime the united states and the soviet union signed the treaty on intermediaterange nuclear forces inf on december 8 1987 the inf treaty was seen as significant milestone in arms control because it established an intrusive verification regime and because it eliminated entire classes of weapons that both sides regarded as modern and effective the united states and soviet union agreed to destroy all intermediaterange and shorterrange nucleararmed ballistic missiles and groundlaunched cruise missiles which are those missiles with range between 300 and 3400 miles the launchers associated with the controlled missiles were also to be destroyed the signatories agreed that the warheads and guidance systems of the missiles need not be destroyed they could be used or reconfigured for other systems not controlled by the treaty the soviets agreed to destroy approximately 1750 missiles and the united states agreed to destroy 846 missiles establishing principle that asymmetrical reductions were acceptable in order to achieve goal of greater stability on the us side the principal systems destroyed were the pershing ii ballistic missile and the ground launched cruise missile glcm both singlewarhead systems on the soviet side the principal system was the ss20 ballistic missile which carried three warheads these systems on both sides were highly mobile and able to strike such highvalue targets as commandandcontrol centers staging areas airfields depots and ports the soviets also agreed to destroy range of older nuclear missiles as well as the mobile short range ss23 system developed and deployed in the early 1980s the parties had eliminated all their weapons by may 1991 the verification regime of the inf treaty permitted onsite inspections of selected missile assembly facilities and all storage centers deployment zones and repair test and elimination facilities although it did not permit anywhere anytime inspections it did allow up to 20 short notice inspections of sites designated in the treaty the two sides agreed to an extensive data exchange intended to account for all systems covered by the agreement the treaty also established continuous portal monitoring procedure at one assembly facility in each country inspections under the inf treaty continued until may 2001 however the united states continues to operate its site at russias v otkinsk missile assembly facility under the terms of the 1991 start treaty the inf treaty returned to the news in 2007 russia partly in response to us plans to deploy missile defense radar in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland has stated that it might withdraw from the inf treaty some russian officials have claimed this would allow russia to deploy missiles with the range needed to threaten the missile defense system in case it were capable of threatening russias strategic nuclear forces analysts outside russia have also noted that the russian might be responding to concerns about the growing capabilities of chinas missiles or of those in other countries surrounding russia some analysts have suggested that the united states russia and others negotiate global agreement banning intermediate range missiles to address the growing threat these systems might pose to both the united states and russia

of the treaty at that time about 70 of the strategic nuclear weapons covered by start were deployed at bases in russia the other 30 were deployed in ukraine kazakhstan and belarus1 russia initially sought to be the sole successor to the soviet union for the treaty but the other three republics did not want to cede all responsibility for the soviet unions nuclear status and treaty obligations to russia in may 1992 the four republics and the united states signed protocol that made all four republics parties to the treaty at the same time the leaders of belarus ukraine and kazakhstan agreed to eliminate all of their nuclear weapons during the sevenyear reduction period outlined in start they also agreed to sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt as nonnuclear weapons states the us senate gave its consent to the ratification of start on october 1 1992 the russian parliament consented to the ratification of start on november 4 1992 but it stated that russia would not exchange the instruments of ratification for the treaty until all three of the other republics adhered to the npt as nonnuclear states kazakhstan completed the ratification process in june 1992 and joined the npt as nonnuclear weapon state on february 14 1994 belarus approved start and the npt on february 4 1993 and formally joined the npt as non nuclear weapon state on july 22 1993 ukraines parliament approved start in november 1993 but its approval was conditioned on ukraines retention of some of the weapons based on its territory and the provision of security guarantees by the other nuclear weapons states in early 1994 after the united states russia and ukraine agreed that ukraine should receive compensation and security assurances in exchange for the weapons based on its soil the parliament removed the conditions from its resolution of ratification but it still did not approve ukraines accession to the npt the ukrainian parliament took this final step on november 16 1994 after insisting on and apparently receiving additional security assurances from the united 1 leaders in these the nonrussian republics did not have control over the use of the nuclear weapons on their territory russian president boris yeltsin and now valdimir putin is the sole successor to the soviet president in the command and control structure for soviet nuclear weapons and he along with his

start ii would have relied on the verification regime established by start with few new provisions for example us inspectors would be allowed to watch russia pour concrete into the ss18 silos and to measure the depth of the concrete when russia converted the silos to hold smaller missiles in addition russian inspectors could have viewed the weapons carriage areas on us heavy bombers to confirm that the number of weapons the bombers are equipped to carry did not exceed the number attributed to that type of bomber g21g22g3g20g22g561g11g11g561g20g138g157g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 although start ii was signed in early january 1993 its full consideration was delayed until start entered into force at the end of 1994 the us senate further delayed its consideration during senate dispute over the future of the arms control and disarmament agency the senate eventually approved ratification of start ii by vote of 874 on january 26 1996 the russian duma also delayed its consideration of start ii many members of the duma disapproved of the way the treaty would affect russian strategic offensive forces and many objected to the economic costs russia would bear when implementing the treaty the united states sought to address the dumas concerns during 1997 by negotiating protocol that would extend the elimination deadlines in start ii and therefore reduce the annual costs of implementation and by agreeing to negotiate start iii treaty after start ii entered into force but this did not break the deadlock the duma again delayed its debate after the united states and great britain launched air strikes against iraq in december 1998 the treatys future clouded again after the united states announced its plans in january 1999 to negotiate amendments to the 1972 abm treaty and after na to forces began their air campaign in yugoslavia in april 1999 president putin offered his support to start ii and pressed the duma for action in early 2000 he succeeded in winning approval for the treaty on april 14 after promising among other things that russia would withdraw from the treaty if the united states withdrew from the 1972 abm treaty however the federal law on ratification said the treaty could not enter into force until the united states approved ratification of several 1997 agreements related to the 1972 abm treaty president clinton never submitted these to the senate for fear they would be defeated the bush administration also never submitted these to the senate announcing instead in june 2002 that the united states would withdraw from the abm

g22g155g142g138g157g162g561 the arms control process between the united states and russia essentially stalled during the 1990s as efforts to ratify and implement start ii dragged on in 1997 in an effort to move the agenda forward presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed to framework for start iii treaty but these negotiations never produced treaty as the usrussian arms control agenda came to be dominated by us plans for ballistic missile defenses and issues related to the abm treaty when president bush took office in 2001 he had little interest in pursuing formal arms control agreements with russia he signed the strategic offensive reductions treaty known as the moscow treaty in 2002 even though he would have preferred that the united states and russia each set their force levels without any formal limits

russia argued the united states and russia should bypass start ii and negotiate deeper reductions in nuclear warheads that were more consistent with the levels russia was likely to retain in the future the clinton administration did not want to set start ii aside in part because it wanted to be sure russia eliminated its mirved icbms however many in the administration eventually concluded that russia would not ratify start ii without some assurances that the warhead levels would decline further so the united states agreed to proceed to start iii but only after start ii entered into force presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed to this timeline in march 2007 the start iii framework called for reductions to between 2000 and 2500 warheads for strategic offensive nuclear weapons on each side the united states and russia held several rounds of discussions on start iii but they did not resolve their differences before the end of the clinton administration president bush did not pursue the negotiations after taking office in 2001 the demise of these discussions left many issues that had been central to the usrussian arms control process unresolved for example presidents clinton and yeltsin had agreed to explore possible measures for limiting longrange nucleararmed sealaunched cruise missiles and other tactical nuclear weapons in the start iii framework these weapons systems are not limited by existing treaties many in congress have joined analysts outside the government in expressing concerns about the safety and security of russias stored nuclear weapons in addition when establishing the start iii framework the united states and russia agreed that they would explore proposals to enhance transparency and promote the irreversibility of warhead reductions many analysts viewed this step as critical to lasting predictable reductions in nuclear weapons the bush administration has however rejected this approach although it has pledged to eliminate some warheads removed from deployment it will not offer any measures promoting the transparency or reversibility of this process it wants to retain us flexibility and the ability to restore warheads to deployed forces many critics of the administration oppose this policy in part because it will undermine us efforts to encourage russia to eliminate warheads that might be at risk of loss or theft

research on variety of ballistic missile defense technologies in 1983 president reagan collected and expanded these programs in the strategic defense initiative sdi which sought to develop and deploy comprehensive missile defenses that would defend the united states against deliberate massive attack from the soviet union the first bush administration changed this focus seeking instead to provide defense against possible limited missile attacks that might arise from any number of countries throughout the world after the persian gulf war in 1991 with iraqs attacks with scud missiles alerting many to the dangers of missile proliferation and the threats posed by short and mediumrange theater ballistic missiles the united states began developing several advanced theater missile defense tmd systems at the same time the clinton administration pursued research and technology development for national missile defenses nmd the department of defense concluded that there was military requirement for the deployment of such system after intelligence estimates found that additional nations beyond china russia france and great britain were likely to develop missiles that could threaten the continental united states for at least the next 1015 years however after congressionally mandated commission raised concerns about the proliferation of longrange missiles in july 1998 and north korea tested threestage missile in august 1998 the clinton administration began to consider the deployment of an nmd with program structured to achieve that objective in 2005 on september 1 2000 after disappointing test results president clinton announced that he would not authorize construction needed to begin deployment of an nmd president george w bush altered us policy on missile defenses his administration is seeking to develop layered defense with landbased seabased and spacebased components it is seeking system that could protect the united states its allies and its forces overseas from short medium and longrange ballistic missiles it has begun to deploy landbased missile interceptors for defense against longrange missiles in alaska and california and has pursued the deployment of defenses against shorterrange missiles on naval ships the administration had hoped that these missiles could be operational by 2004 but the system still is not operational

administrations would not have been permitted under the abm treaty in 1985 the united states proposed in negotiations with the soviet union that the two sides replac the abm treaty with an agreement that would permit deployment of more extensive defenses these negotiations failed and in 1993 the clinton administration altered their focus it sought demarcation agreement to clarify the difference

to the senate knowing that the required 67 votes would prove elusive as many of the senators in the republican majority believed the abm treaty even if modified would stand in the way of the deployment of robust missile defenses in february 1999 the united states and russia began to discuss abm treaty modifications that would permit deployment of us national missi defense nmd system the united states sought to reassure russia that the planned nmd would not interfere with russias strategic nuclear forces and that the united states still viewed the abm treaty as central to the us russian strategic balance the russians were reportedly unconvinced noting that the united states could expand its system so that it could intercept significant portion of russias forces they also argued that the united states had overstated the threat from rogue nations furthermore after russia approved start ii pr esident putin noted that us withdrawal from the abm treaty would lead not only to russian withdrawal from start ii but also russian withdrawal from wider range of arms contro l agreements through the end of the clinton administration russia refused to consider us proposals for modifications to the abm treaty some argued that russias position reflected its belief that the united states would not withdraw from the abm treaty and therefore if russia refused to amend it the united states would not deploy national missile defenses officials in the new bush administration referred to the treaty as relic of the cold war and the president stated that the united states would need to move beyond the limits in the treaty to deploy robust missile defenses in discussions that began in the middle of 2001 the bush administration sought to convince russia to accept us proposal for the nations to set aside the treaty together the administration also offered russia extensive briefings to demonstrate that its missile defense program would not thre aten russia but that the abm treaty would interfere with the program russia would not agree to set the treaty aside and instead suggested that the united states identify modifications to the treaty that would allow it to pursue the more robust testing program contained in its proposals but according to some reports russia would have insisted on the right to determine whether proposed tests were consistent with the treaty the bush administration would not accept these conditions and president bush announced on december 13 2001 that the united states would withdraw from the abm treaty this withdrawal took effect on june 13

with president putin in november 2001 president bush announced that the united states would reduce its operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to level between 1700 and 2200 warheads during the next decade he stated that the united states would reduce its forces unilaterally without signing formal agreement president putin indicated that russia wanted to use the formal arms control process emphasizing that the two sides should focus on reaching reliable and verifiable agreement russia sought legally binding document that would provide predictability and transparency and ensure for the irreversibilty of the reduction of nuclear forces the united states wanted to maintain the flexibility to size and structure its nuclear forces in response to its own needs it preferred less formal process such as an exchange of letters and possibly new transparency measures that would allow each side to understand the force structure plans of the other side within the bush administration secretary of state powell supported the conclusion of legally binding agreement because he believed it w ould help president putins standing with his domestic critics he apparently prevailed over the objections of officials in the pentagon although the eventual outcome did differ from th initial approach of the bush administration most observers agree that it did not undermine the fundamental us objectives in the negotiations because the treatys provisions would not impede the bush administrations plans for us strategic nuclear forces the united states and russia signed the strategic offensive reductions treaty on may 24 2002 the us senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the treaty on march 6 2003 the russian duma approved the federal law on ratification for the treaty on may 14 2003 the treaty entered into force on june 1 2003 the treaty is due to remain in force until december 31 2012 after which it could be extended or replaced by another agreement in theory the parties might be able to increase their warheads above the 2200 limit as soon as the treaty expires the treaty also states that either party may withdraw from the treaty on three months

that are operationally deployed all warheads that would count under the start counting rules or some other quantity of nuclear warheads the text does refer to statements made by presidents bush and putin in november and december 2001 when each outlined their own reduction plans this reference may indicate that the united states and russia could each use their own definition when counting

program was slowed by administrative requirements on the us side the complex nature of activities being undertaken the need for major changes in the attitudes of recipients toward the united states and the idea of weapons dismantlement and destruction and political and economic upheavals within and among the states of the former soviet union for example before funds could be obligated for specific projects the united states had to sign general umbrella agreements with each recipient nation that set out the privileges and immunities of us personnel and the legal and customs framework for the provision of the aid the umbrella agreement between the united states and russia has recently been renewed for another seven years after intensive debate between the nations and in the russian duma the united states provides assistance with several different types of projects most of the funding in recent years has gone to russia as the participants have completed most projects in the other nations for example the united states has provided extensive assistance with destruction and dismantlement projects these are designed to help with the elimination of nuclear chemical and other weapons and their delivery vehicles these projects have helped russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan remove warheads deactivate missiles and eliminate launch facilities for nuclear weapons covered by the start i treaty chain of custody projects are designed to enhance the safety security and control over nuclear weapons and fissile materials these projects provided russia with bulletproof kevlar blankets secure canisters and improved rail cars for warheads transported from ukraine belarus and kazakhstan to storage and dismantlement facilities in russia the ctr program also funded several projects at storage facilities for nuclear weapons and materials to improve security and accounting systems and to provide storage space for plutonium removed from nuclear warheads when they are

the material could have great value for its civilian power program the united states initially intended to pursue both options however after reviewing us nonproliferation policies in 2001 the bush administration concluded that this approach would be too costly instead it outlined plan for the united states to convert almost all its surplus plutonium to mox fuel in late july 2003 the bush

systems that use modern technology and strict material control and accounting systems the program has also provided security training for russian nuclear specialists in recent years the bush administration has expanded the focus of the program to include efforts to secure radiological materials that would not be suitable for nuclear weapons but could be used in radiological dispersal

russias nuclear weapons complex might sell their knowledge to other nations seeking nuclear weapons many of these scientists had worked in the soviet unions closed nuclear cities where they had enjoyed relatively high salaries and prestige but their jobs evaporated during russias economic and political crises in the early 1990s even those scientists who retained their jobs saw their incomes decline sharply as russia was unable to pay their salaries for months at time in response to these concerns the united states japan the european union and russia established the international science and technology center istc in moscow similar center began operating in kiev in 1993 in subsequent years several other former soviet states have joined and other nations have added their financial support the science center programs also began as part of dods ctr program and were moved to the state department budget in 1996 the centers fund scientists who have worked on nuclear chemical and biological weapons but they have historically focused on nuclear scientists with many projects going to those who work at institutes in the closed nuclear cities the state department estimates that about half of the participants are senior scientists which means the programs may have reached significant portion of the estimated 30000 to 70000 senior scientists and engineers in the soviet nuclear complex however most of these scientists spend fewer than 50 days per year on projects funded by the science centers in the remainder of the time most continue to work at their primary jobs some analysts have noted that because the science centers do not have enough money to support full pay for significant number of scientists they may not achieve their objective of keeping these scientists away from nations or groups seeking weapons of mass destruction others however note that even if the financial support is less than complete the cooperation with russian institutes and the promise of fairly steady stream of funding helps build relationships and draw these institutes into the western orbit to address this problem some have suggested that instead of providing short term grants the centers should focus on projects that will lead to the longterm redirection of scientists out of weapons work the state department seems to agree with this approach with its growing reliance on the partners program and its acknowledged need to transition russias nuclear scientists to more commercially viable projects the collapse of political control along the soviet borders along with incentives created by the weakness in the economies of the newly independent states contribute to concerns about the potential for smuggling or illegal exports of materials and technology from the former soviet union the state departments export control and related border security assistance exbs program helps the former soviet states and other nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and their ability to stop the illicit trafficking of all materials for weapons of mass destruction along with dual use goods and technologies the exbs program currently has projects underway

energy agency was established in 1957 to assist nations in their peaceful nuclear programs primarily research and nuclear power programs and to safeguard nuclear materials from these peaceful programs to ensure that they are not diverted to nuclear weapons uses the iaea safeguards system relies on data collection review and periodic inspections at declared facilities the iaea may also inspect other facilities if it suspects undeclared nuclear materials or weaponsrelated activities are present nonnuclear weapon npt members are required to declare and submit all nuclear materials in their possession to regular iaea inspections to ensure that sensitive nuclear materials and technologies are not diverted from civilian to military purposes some states who are not parties to the npt india israel pakistan are members of the iaea and allow inspections of some but not all of their nuclear activities the iaea also provides technical assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear technology for energy medicine agriculture and research after the 1991 persian gulf war iaea inspection teams working with the special commission on iraq unscom revealed an extens ive covert nuclear weapons program that had been virtually undetected by annual inspections of baghdads declared facilities this knowledge inspired efforts to strengthen the iaeas authority to conduct more intrusive inspections of wider variety of installations to provide the agency with intelligence information about suspected covert nuclear activities and to provide the agency with the resources and political support needed to increase confidence in its safeguards system in 1998 the iaea adopted an additional protocol that would give the agency greater authority and access to verify nuclear declarations the protocol enters into force for individual npt states upon ratification the additional protocol was gradually adopted by ma ny countries and in february 2004 president bush recommended that it be

technology to foreign buyers and in some cases ban certain exports to some countries international nuclear controls are coordinated by an informal association of nuclear exporters called the nuclear suppliers group nsg founded in 1975 nsg members agree to common policy to restrict exports of certain goods such as uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technology that could be used by pr

warhead rrw program which seeks to replace existing warheads with simpler designs that would be less prone to fail doe intends that rrws could be certified for the stockpile without nuclear testing

states first proposed that the international community negotiate ban on the production of fissile material plutonium and enriched uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons over fifty years ago negotiators of the npt realized that fissile material usable for nuclear weapons could still be produced under the guise of peaceful nuclear activities within the treaty consequently fissile material production ban or fmct has remained on the longterm negotiating agenda at the conference on disarmament cd in geneva these negotiations have been largely stalled since 1993 the bush administration undertook comprehensive review of the us position on the fmct in 2004 and concluded that such ban would be useful in creating an observed norm against the production of fissile material intended for weapons but it has argued that such ban is inherently unverifiable the bush administration proposed draft treaty in may 2006 that contained verification measures substantively it has always been important to capture the undeclared nuclear weapon states initially india pakistan and israel but now also north korea that were not parties to the npt

many observers believed that negotiations at the cd were preferable to smaller eightparty talks united states united kingdom france china russia india pakistan and israel because they would establish global norm and would not have the appearance of conferring nuclear weapons status upon india pakistan and israel since the mid1990s however both india and pakistan have openly tested nuclear weapons and north korea has pulled out of the npt and tested nuclear device negotiators may have to balance the very real need to halt production by such states against traditional concerns of the nuclear nonproliferation community in addition to north korean capabilities irans burgeoning enrichment capabilities are cause for concern also the uncovering of the aq khan nuclear black market network in late 2003 and 2004 points to the need for greater efforts to halt the spread of production capabilities director general mohamed baradei of the international atomic energy agency in early 2004 called for renewed efforts to negotiate an fmct as one response to the proliferation of enrichment capabilities by the khan network president bush notably did not include fmct in his list of approaches to combating the khan network but instead called for supplier controls and voluntary ban on enrichment and reprocessing by npt member states one key issue is whether or not such treaty would seek to include existing stocks of fissile material the united states has strongly objected to such an approach it is not clear from official statements that th bush administration will vigorously pursue fmct negotiations at the cd in geneva in the near term however while negotiations are still in their infancy it could be important to begin public debate through hearings on various options and approaches to end the production of fissile material for weapons some outcomes particularly those that include intrusive verification could have an impact on us facilities that are not currently being monitored another aspect for congressional consideration is how wellequipped the us intelligence community is to verify any such agreement f or fur ther reading crs report rs2247 4 banning fis sile material

security initiative psi on may 31 2003 this initiative is primarily diplomatic tool developed by the united states to gain support for interdicting shipments of weapons of mass destru ctionrelated wmd equipment and materials through the psi the bush administration seeks to create web of counterproliferation partnerships through which proliferators will have difficulty carrying out their trade in wmd and missilerelated technology the states involved in psi have agreed to review their national legal authorities for interdiction provide consent for ot her states to board and search their own flag vessels and conclude shipboarding agreements the proliferation security initiative has budget formal offices supporting it international secretariat and formal mechanism for measuring its effectiveness like database of cases to many these attributes are positive allowing the united states to respond swiftly to changing developments others question whether the international community can sustain this effort over the longer term sixteen core nations have pledged their cooperation in interdicting shipments of wmd materials agreeing in paris in 2003 on set of interdiction principles as of december 2007 the bush administration states that 86 nations have committed formally to psi participation although it is not clear what this entails beyond limited participation in operational

officials have noted that iran and north korean activities are focus of particular concern thus it may be important to win the support of states that may lie along established sea air and land transportation routes to and from those states as well as states that may manufacture key materials and equipment the 911 commission act of 2007 recommended that psi be expanded and coordination within the us government improved bush administration officials have stressed that psi is an activity not an organization it seeks to develop according to key officials new means to disrupt wmd trafficking at sea in the air and on land however very few new means of disruption appear to have been developed so far although old means may be applied more rigoro usly to improve disruption for example key wmd supplier states have cooperated for many years with the united states in interdicting shipments of wmdrelated items whether through sharing intelligence information or the actual boarding of ships and airplanes in particular the united states is pursuing vigorously the conclusion of shipboarding agreements with key states that have high volumes of international shipping so far the united states has signed agreements with belize croatia cyprus liberia malta the marshall islands mongolia and panama in february 2004 president bush proposed expanding psi to address more than shipments and transfers including shutting down facilities seiz ing materials and freezing assets although this proposal has not yet been realized in april 2004 the security council adopted resolution 1540 which requires all states to criminalize proliferation enact strict export controls and secure all sensitive materials within their borders unscr 1540 called on states to enforce effective domestic controls over wmd and wmdrelated materials in production use storage and transport to maintain effective border controls and to develop national export and transshipment controls over such items all of which should help interdiction efforts the resolution did not however provide any enforcement authority nor di d it specifically mention interdiction about twothirds of all states have reported to the on their efforts to strengthen defenses against wmd trafficking since psi is an activity rather than an organization and has budget or internal us government organization it may be difficult for congress to track psis progress several intelligence resource issues may be of interest to congress including whether intelligence information is good enough for effective implementation and whether intelligencesharing requirements have been established with nonnato allies another issue may be how psi is coordinated with other federal interdictionrelated programs like export control

initiative has potential to bolster nuclear terrorism prevention efforts it is unclear how activities under this initiative will be coordinated with related international efforts such as psi and gtri

slow the proliferation of nuclear weapons these cooperative measures have been effective in some cases south korea taiwan belarus kazakhstan ukraine but failed in others iraq israel pakistan some favor greater use of sanctions against countries that violate international nonproliferation standards while others view sanctions as selfdefeating most observers conclude that mix of positive and negative incentives including diplomacy to address underlying regional security problems provides the best opportunity for controlling the spread of nuclear weapons however when diplomacy fails some policymakers have argued that military measures may be necessary to attack nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and related facilities in states hostile to the united states or its allies for example the bush administration claimed that the overthrow of the saddam hussein regime in iraq was justified in part on the basis of claims that iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons and might resume efforts to develop nuclear weapons as developments revealed however accurate intelligence is key component of both diplomatic and military approaches to nonproliferation 6 partner nations

of compliance through onsite inspections its implementation has resulted in an unprecedented reduction of conventional arms in europe with over 50000 tles removed or destroyed almost all agree it has achieved most of its initial objectives under the cfe treaty all equipment reductions needed to comply with overall national and zonal ceilings were to have been completed by november 1995 as this deadline approached it was evident that russia would not meet those requirements particularly in the socalled flank zones which include the leningrad military district in the north and more importantly the north caucasus military district in the south the outbreak of armed ethnic conflicts in and around the caucasus most notably in chechnya led russia to claim it needed to deploy 9 the

this claim in the context of broader assertions that some cfe provisions reflected cold war assumptions and did not fairly address its new national security concerns further it argued that economic

ukrainian administrative districts from the old flank zone thus permitting existing flank equipment ceilings to apply to smaller area to provide some counterbalance to these adjustments reporting

revisions and ironically it sought to maintain the alliancewide equipment ceilings an alliancewide cap on nato would presumably force adjustments of national holdings as the na to alliance expanded

with national limits on all categories of tles it also stated that the flank agreement was to remain in effect the adaptation agreement reiterates that nato has plan intention and reason to deploy nuclear weapons on new members territory and seeks to improve new members defensive capabilities through interoperability and capability for reinforcement rather than by stationing additional combat forces on new members territory russias most serious focus has been however on nato enlargement and how cfe could adapt to mitigate what many russians see as an encroaching threat russia has called

istanbul commitments to remove its troops from both the republic of georgia and the breakaway province of transdniestra in moldova 10 though not part of the cfe adaptation agreement document nato

will it report on its military movements the istanbul commitments regarding troop withdrawals in georgia and moldova are not an integral part of the cfe adaptation agreement document and consequently not legally binding and should not stand in the way of nato members ratification of the agreement the baltic states and slovakia are not bound by the cfe and their nato membership coupled with the new

state parties were unable to find sufficient common ground to issue final joint statement the european and us governments have reacted with some surprise at the harshness of russian statements and

with president putin and russian foreign minister lavrov and assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs in testimony before the us commission on security and cooperation in europe have reiterated the us position that ratification of the cfe adaptation agreement still remains contingent upon russia fulfilling its commitment to withdraw its military forces from georgia and

russian compliance with cfe effective december 12 2007 this action came during the madrid osce summit meeting and evoked an expression of regret on the part of nato officials who noted that russias military posture would be under discussion at the nato foreign ministers meeting in december undersecretary of state nicholas burns characterized the russian action as mistake and urged russia to negotiate its concerns within the cfe framework russian officials have emphasized that this action is not withdrawal from the treaty and that they are willing to participate in further discussions if they perceive greater willingness on the part of the nato allies to address their concerns though immediate redeployment of russian forces is expected deputy defense minister kolmakov has indicated that some bolstering of forces on russians western borders is under consideration for their part the nato nations are maintaining their insistence that russ ia fulfill the 1999 istanbul commitments

the united states canada and 22 european nations signed the treaty on open skies the parties agreed to permit unarmed aircraft to conduct observation flights over their territories although the flights will likely focus on military activities the information they gather was not intended to be used to verify compliance with limits in other arms control agreements instead open skies is designed as confidencebuilding measure that will promote openness and enhance mutual understanding about military activities the treaty entered into force on january 1 2002 open skies was originally proposed by president eisenhower in 1955 in the years before satellites began to collect intelligence data aerial overflights were seen as way to gain information needed for both intelligence and confidencebuilding purposes the soviet union rejected president eisenhowers proposal because it considered the overflights equal to espionage president george hw bush revived the open skies proposal in may 1989 by this time both the united states and soviet union employed satellites and remote sensors for intelligence collection so aircraft overflights would add little for that objective but at the time when europe was emerging from the eastwest divide of the cold war the united states supported increased transparency throughout europe as way to reduce the chances of military confrontation and to build confidence among the participants the senate consented to the ratification of the treaty on august 6 1993 and president clinton signed the instruments of ratification on november 3 1993

flights over any area including military installations that are considered secret or otherwise offlimits in most cases the nation conducting the observation flight will provide the aircraft and sensors for the flight however russia insisted that the treaty permit the observed country to provide the aircraft if it chose to do so nations can also team up to conduct overflights to share the costs of the effort or use aircraft and sensor suites provided by other nations each nation is assigned quota of overflights that it can conduct and must be willing to receive each year the quota is

united states this quota is equal to 42 observation flights per year the treaty permits the nations to use several types of sensorsincluding photographic cameras infrared cameras and synthetic aperture radarsduring their observation flights the permitted equipment will allow the nations to collect basic information on military forces and activities but it will provide them with little detailed technical intelligence for example the resolution on the sensors probably will allow the nations to identify vehicles and distinguish between tanks and trucks but it probably will not allow them to tell one type of tank from another each observation flight will produce two sets of dataone for the observing nation and one for the observed nation other parties to the treaty can purchase copies of the data each nation is responsible for its own analysis of the data the open skies treaty was designed as confidencebuilding measure allowing all nations including those without access to satellites to collect information on military forces and activities of other parties to the treaty it is not designed to provide detailed intelligence information or data needed to verify compliance with arms control limits instead it allows the participants to gain an improved understanding of military activities in other nations overflights may provide early signs of efforts to build up military forces or conversely assurances that an adversary or neighbor is not preparing its military for possible conflict in any case it is designed to promote openness and transparency as way to ease tensions and reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings about military intentions g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 although several of the participating nations

policy is to provide them when the jdec is complete24 russia had been providing prelaunch notifications since 2004 but reportedly stopped doing so effective january 1 2008 the lack of us notifications is one reason for this action25 ambassador jose julio pereira gomes said in an october 19 2007 statement on behalf of the european union that some unnamed subscribing states have not been providing

arrangement is not formally targeted at any state or group of states but it is intended to enhance cooperation to prevent the acquisition of armaments and sensitive dualuse items for military enduses if the situation in region or the behaviour of state is or becomes cause for serious concern28 the arrangement which currently has 40 members is designed to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dualuse goods and technologies thus preventing destabilizing accumulations member decisions are made by consensus this group has broader membership but smaller lists of controlled goods than did cocom its control regime is also less rigorous under wassenaar each national government regulates its own exports whereas under cocom any member could disapprove the export by any other member of controlled item to proscribed destination there is also mechanism to punish participating

states report all transfers or licenses issued for sensitive dualuse goods or technology and all deliveries of items on the munitions list the data exchange identifies the supplier recipient and items transferred participating states also report denials of licenses to transfer items on the dualuse list to non member states the arrangement does not prohibit participating country from making an export that has been denied by another participant this practice is called undercutting but participants are required to report soon after they approve license for an export of dualuse goods that are essentially identical to those that have been denied by another participant during the previous three years 28 the arrangements guidelines and procedures may be found at

members of congress may question whether other participants will be as diligent as the united states in controlling exports of dual use technologies most countries place fewer restrictions on exports than does the united states the arrangement may support us interests by encouraging other suppliers to forgo irresponsible exports that they might consider politically or financially beneficial on the

concerns through continued highlevel consultations russia has maintained that it needs significant foreign aid to carry out its destruction program including substantial assistance in infrastructure improvements for the communities where destruction sites are located under dods cooperative threat reduction program the united states has provided russia with considerable financial assistance for chemical weapons destruction 33 the impetus for continued funding despite reservations about this program has been the concern that the russian cw stockpile is potential source of covert cw proliferation even with foreign assistance russia will almost certainly not be able to meet cwc destruction deadlines it requested an extension until 2012 but few believe that extension will be sufficient consequently the cwc conference of states parties has approved an extension of russias interim deadline to destroy 20 of its stockpile to april 2007 and also agreed to an extension of

undertaking good faith effort to destroy its stockpile the eighth opcw conference of states parties approved the extension of the 45 deadline to december 2007 and the extension of the final deadline

deadline from april 2007 to april 29 2012 the latest possible date allowed under the cwc 35 however ambassador eric javits us permanent representative to the opcw added that we do not expect to be able to meet that deadline because washington had encountered delays and difficulties in destroying its stockpile 36 these delays have generally resulted from the need to meet state and federal

gents toxins weapons equipment and means of delivery the bwc permits only defensive biological warfare research eg vaccines protective equipment and allows production and stockpiling of bw agents only in amounts justifiable for protective or peaceful purposes unlike the chemical weapons convention cwc the bwc does not specify particular biological agents but generically defines them as microbial or other biological agents or toxins whatever their origin or method of production of types and in quantities that have justification for prophylactic or peaceful purposes the convention has 159 states parties including the united states and there are 15 additional countries that have signed but not ratified the convention the convention does not contain any independent verification or enforcement

the bwc ended in disarray unable to agree upon final declaration the primary deadlock was the issue of an adaptive protocol to the convention intended to enhance its enforcement in july 2001 after almost seven years of negotiations the united states declared the 200page protocol unacceptable as basis for further negotiation bush administration review concluded that th draft protocol would not provide adequate security against covert violations yet could endanger the security of us biodefense programs and us commercial proprietary information alone in its complete rejection of the draft protocol the united states came under widespread international criticism including from close allies for jeopardizing the future of biological arms control in response the administration put forward several proposals at the 2001 review conference urging their adoption by bwc state parties at the national level these included criminalization of bwc violations and expedited extradition procedures for violators united nations investigation of suspicious disease outbreaks or alleged bw use procedures for addressing bwc compliance concerns improved international disease control improved security over research on pathogenic organisms the review conference was unable to reach compromise final declaration on future activities satisfactory to all state parties and adjourned until november 2002 the us has continued to oppose further negotiations on verification while calling for international action against iran and north korea whom it has identified as bwc violat ors confronted with the us position the chairman of the 2002 review conference pr esented minimal program emphasizing only annual meetings to discuss strengthening national laws and ways to respond to bw attacks these were endorsed by the united states and accepted by the conference the 6 th bwc review conference held in december 2006 could not reach consensus on comprehensive set of guidelines for nationa l implementation of the convention owing to differences between the united states and the nonaligned nations group over technology transfer control issues the assumption of the united states opposition also precluded consideration of enhanced verification or enforcement provisions for the convention the conference did establish new program of work for annual meetings which are to take place before the 7 th review conference in 2011 for discussion and information exchanges on variety of issues including domestic enforcement of bwc provisions pathogen security and oversight of potentially dualuse research the united states required however that these sessions be prohibited from reaching binding decisions reserving that for the next review conference the first meeting of the bwc statesparties was held december 1014 in geneva 44 the text of the bwc and associated documents are available at the united nations website biological weapons convention httpdisarmament2unorgwmdbwc

anthrax attacks in the united states spurred significant congressional interest in biological weapons but the focus has been primarily on increased domestic security and medical protectivetreatment measures though there has been some congressional criticism of the administrations position on the bwc there has been political initiative to refocus biological arms control efforts while those in favor of strengthening the bwc have pointed to the anthrax attacks and rapid advances in biotechnology as emphasizing the need for greater efforts to control biological weapons those supporting the administrations position maintain that the difficulties in apprehending the perpetrators of the anthrax attacks and wide dissemination of biotechnology merely highlight the futility of an

retained the possible use of smart mines that render themselves harmless after certain period of time either through selfdestruction selfneutralization or selfdeactivation in november 1996 the united states introduced resolution to the general assembly to pursue an international agreement that would ban use stockpiling production and transfer of aplthere were 84 cosponsors some countries such as canada already abided by the intent of the proposed agreement and pushed for an early deadline to reach agreement others however were concerned that verifying such an agreement would be difficult or that ap landmines still have useful and legitimate role in their security planning landmine control specifically ban on exports was briefly on the agenda of the conference on disarmament cd in geneva for 1999 during 2000 however that body could not agree on its program of work and the landmine issue was not addressed again during 1997 the government of canada and num ber of nongovernmental organizations such as the international campaign to ban landmines sponsored conferences to craft treaty outside the cd process over 100 nations signed the ottawa treaty formally titled the convention on the prohibition of the use stockpiling production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and on their destruction which entered into force for its parties on march 1 1999 currently 156 states are party to the treaty the clinton administration participated in the ottawa process but declined to sign the treaty after failing to gain certain temporary exceptions to treaty language specifically the united states wanted to continue to use apl in the defense of south korea until 2006 if necessary and the ability to include smart apl or devices within antitank landmine munitions president clinton suggested that the united states would sign the ottawa treaty in 2006 if effective alternatives to apl were available 47 the ottawa convention requires statesparties to st op the production use and transfer of apl as well as destroy all stockpiled apl except for the minimum number absolutely necessary for training purposes within four years statesparties are also required to clear apl within 10 years but can request extensions of up to 10 years to complete this task48 of the 156 statesparties 80 have destroyed their apl 10 have not yet done so there is evidence that any statesparties are currently violating the convention however 14 states appear not to be on course to meet their mineclearance deadlines49 the convention does not include verification body but statesparties may submit allegations of noncompliance as well as requests for clarification from relevant governments to the secretarygeneral stateparty may also request that special meeting of other treaty members address

constitution establishes responsibilities for treaty ratification it provides that the president shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur contrary to common perceptions the senate does not ratify treaties it provides its advice and consent to ratification by passing resolution of ratification the president then ratifies treaty by signing the instrument of ratification and eith er exchanging it with the other parties to the treaty or depositing it at central repository such as the united nations in section 33 of the arms control and disarmament act pl 87297 as amended congress outlined the relationship between arms control agreements and the treaty ratification process this law provides that action shall be taken under this or any other law that will obligate the united states to disarm or to reduce or to limit the armed forces or armaments of the united states except pursuant to the treatymaking power of the president under the constitution or unless authorized by further affirmative legislation by the congress of the united states in practice most us arms control agreements have been submitted as treaties word reserved in us usage for international agreements submitted to the senate for its approval in accordance with article ii section 2 of the constitution the senate clearly expects future arms control obligations would be made only pursuant to treaty in one of its declarations in the resolution of ratification of the start treaty the declaration stated the senate declares its intention to consider for approval international agreements that would obligate the united states to reduce or limit the armed forces or armaments of the united states in militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty power set forth in article ii section 2 clause 2 of the constitution nonetheless some arms control agreements have been made by other means several confidence building measures have been concluded as legally binding international agreements called executive agreements in the united states without approval by congress these include the hot line agreement of june 20 1963 the agreement on prevention of nuclear war of june 22 1973 and agreements concluded in the standing consultative commission established by the anti ballistic missile treaty in another category that might be called statutory or congressionalexecutive agreements the salt i interim agreement was approved by joint resolution of congress in 1972 in third category the executive branch has entered some arms control agreements that it did not submit to congress on grounds that they were politically binding but not legally binding such agreements include several measures agreed to through the conference on security and cooperation in europe such as the stockholm document on confidence and securitybuilding measures and disarmament in europe signed september 19

parties first the parties decide whether to ratify that is express their consent to be bound by the treaty that the negotiators have signed each party follows its own constitutional process to approve the treaty in the united states after treaty has been signed the president at time of his choice submits to the senate the treaty and any documents that are to be considered an integral part of the

presidents message is accompanied by letter from the secretary of state to the president which contains an analysis of the treaty after submittal the senate may approve the agreement approve it with various conditions or not approve it senate consideration of treaty is governed by senate rule xxx which was amended in 1986 to simplify the procedure50 the treaty is read first time and the injunction of secrecy is removed by unanimous consent although normally the text of treaty has already been made public the treaty is then referred to the senate committee on foreign relations under senate rule xxv on jurisdiction after consideration the committee reports the treaty to the senate with proposed resolution of ratification that may contain any of the conditions described below if the committee objects to treaty or believes the treaty would not receive the necessary majority in the senate it usually simply does not report the treaty to the senate and the treaty remains pending indefinitely on the committee calendar 51 after it is reported from the committee treaty is required to lie over for one calendar day before senate consideration the senate considers the treaty after adoption of nondebatable motion to go into executive session for that purpose52 rule xxx provides that the treaty then be read second time after which amendments to the treaty may be proposed the majority leader typically asks unanimous consent that the treaty be considered to have passed through all the parliamentary stages up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification after the resolution of ratification is presented amendments to the treaty itself which are rare may not be proposed the resolution of ratification is then open to amendment in the form of reservations declarations statements or understandings decisions on amendments and conditions are made by majority vote final approval of the resolution of ratification with any conditions that have been approved requires twothirds majority of those senators present after approving the treaty the senate returns it to the president with the resolution of ratification if he accepts the conditions of the senate the president then ratifies the treaty by signing document referred to as an instrument of ratification included in the instrument of ratification are any of the senate conditions that state department officials consider require tacit or explicit approval by the other party the ratification is then complete at the national level and ready for exchange or deposit the treaty enters into force in the case of bilateral treaty upon exchange of instruments of ratification and in the case of multilateral treaty with the deposit of the number of ratifications specified in the treaty the president then signs document called proclamation which publicizes the treaty domestically as in force and the law of the land if the president objects to any of the senate conditions or if the other party to treaty objects to any of the conditions and further negotiations occur the president may resubmit the treaty to the senate for further consideration or simply not ratify it 50 the 1986 amendment eliminated stage in which the senate met as in committee of the whole and acted on any proposed amendment to the treaty 51 for further information see rejection of

conditions include amendments reservations understandings and declarations or other statements or provisos sometimes the executive branch recommends the conditions such as the december 16 1974 reservation to the 1925 geneva protocol prohibiting the use of poison gas and the understandings on the protocols to the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons in latin america an amendment to treaty proposes change to the language of the treaty itself and senate adoption of amendments to the text of treaty is infrequent formal amendment to treaty after it has entered into force is made through an additional treaty often called protocol an example is the abm antiballistic missile protocol signed july 3 1974 which limited the united states and the soviet union to one abm site each instead of two as in the original 1972 abm treaty while the senate did not formally attach amendments to the 1974 threshold test ban and 1976 peaceful nuclear explosion treaties it was not until protocols relating to verification were concluded in 1990 that the senate approved these two treaties reservation is limitation or qualification that changes the obligations of one or more of the parties reservation must be communicated to the other parties and in bilateral treaty explicitly agreed to by the other party president nixon requested reservation to the geneva protocol on the use of poison gases stating that the protocol would cease to be binding on the united states in regard to an enemy state if that state or any of its allies failed to respect the prohibition one of the conditions attached to the inf treaty might be considered reservation although it was not called that on the floor the sponsors referred to it as category iii cond ition the condition was that the president obtain soviet consent that ussoviet agreement concluded on may 12 1988 be of the same effect as the provisions of the treaty an understanding is an interpretation or elaboration ordinarily considered consistent with the treaty in 1980 the senate added five understandings to the agreement with the international atomic energy agency iaea for the application of safeguards in the united states the understandings concerned implementation of the agreement within the united states condition added to the inf treaty resolution requiring presidential certification of common understanding on groundlaunched ballistic missiles might be considered an understanding the sponsor of the condition senator robert dole said this condition requires absolutely nothing more from the soviets but it does require something from our president 53 declaration states policy or positions related to the treaty but not necessarily affecting its provisions frequently like some of the understandings mentioned above declarations and other statements concern internal procedures of the united states rather than international obligations and are intended to assure that congress or the senate participate in subsequent policy the resolution of ratification of the threshold test ban treaty adopted in 1990 made approval subject to declarations 1 that to preserve viable deterrent series of specified safeguards should be an ingredient in decisions on national security programs and the allocation of resources and 2 the united states shared special responsibility with the soviet union to continue talks seeking verifiable comprehensive test ban in somewhat different step in 1963 the senate attached preamble to the resolution of ratification of the limited nuclear test ban treaty the

amendments to treaties are subject to the constitutional process the important distinction among the various conditions concerns their content or effect whatever designation the senate applies to condition if the president determines that it may alter an international obligation under the treaty he transmits it to the other party or parties and further negotiations or abandonment of the treaty may result during its consideration of the salt ii treaty the senate foreign relations committee grouped conditions into three categories to clarify their intended legal effect i those that need not be formally communicated to or agreed to by the soviet union ii those that would be formally communicated to the soviet union but not necessarily agreed to by them and iii those that would require the explicit agreement of the soviet union in the resolution of ratification of the start treaty the senate made explicit that some of the conditions were to be communicated to the other parties the senate approves most treaties without formally attaching conditions ten arms control treaties were adopted without conditions the antarctic outer space nuclear nonproliferation seabed abm environmental modification and peaceful nuclear explosions treaties the biological weapons and the nuclear materials c onventions and the abm protocol in some of these cases however the senate foreign relations committee included significant understandings in its report even when it does not place formal conditions in the resolution of ratification the senate may make its views known or establish requirements on the executive branch in the report of the foreign relations committee or through other vehicles 54 such statements become part of the legislative history but are not formally transmitted to other parties in considering the limited nuclear test ban treaty in 1963 the senate turned down reservation that the treaty does not inhibit the use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict but senate leaders insisted upon written assurance on this issue among others from president kennedy in reporting the nuclear non proliferation treaty the committee stated that its support of the treaty was not to be construed as approving security assurances given to the nonnuclearweapon parties by security council resolution and declarations by the united states the soviet union and the united kingdom the security assurances resolution and declarations were the committee reported solely executive measures 55 54 for discussion of methods by which congress influences arms control
