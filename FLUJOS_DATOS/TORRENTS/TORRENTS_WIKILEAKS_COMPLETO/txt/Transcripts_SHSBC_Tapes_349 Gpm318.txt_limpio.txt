routine 4 shsbc318 renumbered 349 29 oct 63 routine 4 lecture given on 29 october 1963 from the modern clearsound bc cassettes not checked against the old reels well winter has arrived and you are all ready now with your mukluks and parkas but therell be dog sleds they bark you know and interrupt sessions and so forth whats the date audience twentyninth october twentynine october ad 13 saint hill special briefing course well i was going to talk to you today about r4 but you look little weak and i better talk about it anyway now if you only knew the truth of it the whole mind is composed of r4 and you can get somebody into more trouble with incorrectly done r4 and somebody into more high levels of beingness with correctly done r4 than anything youve ever seen this r4 doesnt compare to being shot being burned alive being dumped out of high buildings going through wars and things like this its much more effective on thetan the truth of the matter is that every now and then somebody relatively expert in auditing who is doing r4 or some oldtime pc also an auditor who is being run on r4 will look up and say my god how could raw meat ever do this and thats the truth of it they couldnt and ive just been through were right up to the top of the bank fooling around with my pt gpm and so forth and ive had lot run out below it but moving in on the thing for the kill you see and we were sitting there doing an analysis of having missed the present time gpm and gotten into muck which consisted of running items without having the gpm with shutoff rr see the rr had shut off the only thing that shuts off an rr or rs or falls or stills the meter or anything like that the only thing that does this and i underscore thats terribly important datum for you is running items without having the goal and they shut off clank off goes your surges off goes the lot off goes your ta action off goes everything else and especially the rr that goes off your rs shuts off in other words your meter becomes completely inoperative and inactive and the only thing that does this sweepingly with crash and an exclamation point the only thing that dda this the only thing that does this i i wish to god that when youre looking at stilling meter meter thats going still on you youre doing lists not goals list now that naturally runs out of its rr dont you see and it runs your tone arm action out of the list im not talking about that you see but youre doing items youre doing items its an item list and youre doing items in you see the the needle is getting less active aaaaah now if youre very very clever very very very clever as an auditor and youre very very observant and youre right on your toes and you know your business all the way through youre just grooved man grooved you all of sudden will will watch this phenomenon and the funny part of it is the next slash is slightly less the next rr is slightly less the next rr is slightly less the next slash is slightly less the next blowdown is less dont you see see you can get good you can be fooled you see you can get two good blowdowns on items then the third item and it doesnt blow down at all hardly and then the other one doesnt blow down and so forth see but the slashes and the reads of the needle is what youre really taking here not the blowdown and you all of sudden see that youre looking at stilling meter youre running wrong goal you are busy busy busy little beaver getting items out of gpm for which you do not have the goal and the pc will go not necessarily creak this isnt what turns on the creaks its bad enough lot of things turn on the creaks but the pc feels like hes getting in sort of dry sandpaper mass is getting very very thick and things are getting very heavy and so forth and the next thing you know why he just goes stuck and hell go completely leaden hell feel just very leaden hell feel like he cant think and cant act cant operate cant spark and oddly enough he wont necessarily arc break how do you like that he just sits there woodenly youre running in gpm to have fun see except youre calling it to be sad doesnt even have to be that far opposite its just to be funny thats good enough to have fun and youre running it as to be funny thats enough the next thing you know surges getting less meter getting less active everything getting less active and you find another item and you find another item and youve got less action and less surge and less this and you knucklehead you then went ahead and found another item and you found yourself looking at completely stuck still needle matter what you do with that needle now of course the thing to do isnt it is to immediately put in all the mid ruds thats the best way to then clobber the pc put in all the mid ruds of course that thats something like pouring gasoline on fire thats just nonsense nobody can suppress that hard cant be done and you do your regular bypassed charge because you cant get anything to read now and youll get nice flick on wrong goal or incorrectly worded goal or something like this and there might be much stronger one lying in your case analysis form such as are we because this is the most serious thing that can happen in auditing you can add line in there that says something to this effect something to this effect are we running items out of gpm we dont have the name of some such wording see you havent got the name of the gpm you see you havent got the goal for the gpm and youre running items on it well that will lock up case gorgeously now theres only one cure for this one cure there arent any other cures and this is not necessarily difficult cure but there is only one one one and that is find the right wording for that gpm find the right goal for that gpm see see gpm is thing its great big massy island of mass black and uncouth and filled full of items which are all opposed to each other and its all packed in like mad and if you had one of these things in here it because thetan is mocking it up you see it doesnt necessarily have lot of weight but as you get one in the middle bank why its about 65 feet long about five six feet thick maybe 20 25 feet wide and it is thing in other words its rather uncouth looking thing big slab and irregular edges and if you had tractor someplace and pulled one of these things out into the front yard you see its just mass and its just mass but the significance of that mass is its goal is the goal to something or not to something and its much easier to run implant gpms than it is actual gpms because implant gpms have predictable wordings an implant gpm is to spit or to be spat or something like this you see its always to be or to not is about as complicated as an implant gets to not be see to be cold to not be cold seldom the nots the nots are very infrequent in implant gpms its more likely to be warm versus to be cold see and to run that isnt an implant gpm but that would be the sense of one see nice and simple it isnt the end wordings thats simple its that be that is simple see its either be or its missing see its to move see or to be moved see thats the total the total there is more variety see theres more variation in these things theyre quite predictable somebody thats listing for implant gpms say to have very good time and so forth kick his shins there are such implant gpms couldnt be see thats carried forward by the limitations of those squawk boxes you see and those things had to put out meaning and they had to put it out briefly and electricians are expensive and people who implant are chichi see they always follow these very very simple patterns but an actual gpm is horse of another hue now an implant gpm doesnt have one of these big islands with it its more like an alley actually it has black mass connected with it but its more like little alley its couple of well its couple of rows of parking meters or something like this sometimes theyre all centralized in one location with the snaps and bangs up on the poles and the squawk box speaker box right on the platform they put the thetan on these vary but they make little bit of mass see they do make mass and thetan whos relatively uneducated and even one who is pretty well educated sometimes looks at an implant gpm and because hes in the middle of it dont you see all cats are black you know and you cant see out of the middle of small dark room any better than you can see out of the middle of big dark room you know thats the same same piece of business you cant see in other words so you dont know what youre looking at because youre sitting in the middle of it and an implant gpm looks like it had little alley about three four feet wide but longer but longer it looks much longer theyre normally about seventyfive feet or eightyfive feet or even hundred feet long you see sometimes longer than that thetan stuck on pole was pulled down between these things you see and once in while you think the pcs running an actual gpm and he says what is this parking meter well this is not necessarily meaningful because the implant gpm might be part of the ri which youre running out of the actual gpm you see the actual gpm is enormously senior to an implant gpm implant gpm has the power to aberrate of keyin it has native power in itself to aberrate all by its little old lonesome because it isnt that strong it doesnt amount to much oh well you getting stuck in the middle of them with the pings and the bangs going from left to right and your jaws are hurting and your eyes feel all inflamed and so forth theres nothing to be sneezed at has about the same power of aberration as breaking your leg or something like that dont you see but i suppose any pc has got 8760272943 12 broken legs and hes still functioning somehow or another you see its quantitatively nonsense it doesnt matter but here youve got situation where the pcs sitting in the middle of this implant gpm suddenly doesnt recognize what it is as an implant gpm because its all black mass well the black mass oddly enough is his suppress the black mass doesnt much come from the implanters it comes from the suppression of the thetan you put the button suppress in very much on implant gpms and youll wish you hadnt engrams and implants you really mustnt run mid ruds on they mush and they do bad things if you run an implant gpm putting in lots of mid ruds whyyoull very soon be in very sad trouble as an auditor because the mass is beginning to mush and so forth it cant stand up to it its not true of an actual gpm its not true of an actual item these things are big strong and tough and you can run all the mid ruds you want to on the things and youre not going to get in any trouble but getting back to what i was saying there the individual running wrong goal in an implant gpm actually gets similar effect you can run out of rr and ri if youre running 3n implant gpms you see see you can get the same effect you can run out of rr you think the goal is to be cold you see something like that and its actually bit worse than this its to be dead rather common goal to be dead in these implant gpms seldom to die usually to be dead in fact i dont know of any implant gpm which is to die theyre all to be dead you see its very easy but getting back to what i was talking about there you get into trouble just running the wrong goal and implant gpm what do you think happens with this great big mass for which you dont have any name well you can start running items in it because the pc has guide he doesnt know where to go he doesnt know what the name of it is and so forth hes going to go over the hills and far away and hes going to go into other implant gpms and very shortly running an implant gpm will happen this way too but in an actual gpm this gets very serious youre running goal with name see you havent got the goal youre running the gpm and you havent got the goal for the gpm and you run ris and now listen carefully it isnt so much problem that you run out of rrs see and blowdown you know and needle action that is not really the problem the problem is that you almost never find almost never find the item for that gpm you usually find an item in some other gpm or an implant if you havent got the goal in other words it isnt just that your slash and surge and all that stuff shut off on your needle its the fact that you now give the pc the wanders and with what ease you will pull in an item out of an implant gpm thats very easy to do now you have guide you see so the pc will pull an implant item in and then you oppose that in some knuckleheaded fashion and you you all of sudden will find an your hair should start standing on end now youll find an item in some other gpm actual gpm see not even the one you didnt have the goal for you understand youre already running one wrong see you havent got the goal for this gpm but now because you are finding items in it you are very likely to pull an implant gpm into that gpm now you got that thats bad enough now if you persist you then will pull this is great stuff for an auditors nerves it if an auditor can live through these r4s without going mad and if he if he can hold his coffee cup without it slipping out both sides while auditing this on somebody why we call him steady auditor only slipping out one side we pass him see nervy stuff because you see the next item you find is going to be out of another gpm out of another actual gpm so that brings now its all right now at this point to start looking pale this brings another gpm out of line and pulls it up and yanks it into the gpm you havent got the goal for got that now as you oppose this one since youre already skidded on the track it isnt that you just dont have guide its just that theres some actually some mystery about all this how come all these things go wrong when you just dont have the goal for this gpm well its almost its almost magic how wrong it can go see it isnt that the pc just doesnt know just dont put it down to the fact well he doesnt know what the goal is so he doesnt know what item to list on it it isnt there these other things just go wrong just for the hell of it all on their own see so now you oppose this one now youve got another gpm in here see youve already pulled an implant gpm into the actual gpm now youve got your next item and that took gpm down the track up here 65 feet 5 feet high 20 feet wide and that towed that up the track and pulled that into this gpm that you didnt have the goal for you got it weirdly enough pcs still in the gpm you dont have goal for because theres where he is dying item by item see all right now now we oppose that we oppose that one and were very likely to reach way to some other corner of the bank and tow up another actual gpm and pull that into this one pc by this time he looks like he had cross between yellow fever and typhoid or something like this but at this point of course he ceases to be certain of his auditor for some reason or other at this point he has some lapse of confidence and he doesnt necessarily oddly enough arc break he just gets puzzled and starts to whatsit like mad and hell say theres lots of things he doesnt understand about whats going on thats usually what you get out of this kind of mess he doesnt quite understand what is going on well of course the auditor at this stage of the game if its very persistent auditor who knows he had better get on with it and get his job done because the thing to do is to find items you see doesnt notice this tone arm is motionless by this time you see and is likely then to go on and compound the felony and pull another series of implant gpms in on top of this one pc by this time can recognize nothing see nothing have nothing to do with anything got the idea i mean thats thats its too horrible for words now what happens well actually your proper action is to find the goal for the gpm you thought you were working with in the first place your proper action is to do everything you can to find that goal whether you had to do it by represent lists or inspections of the meter its very tricky you can ask does it have something to do with the subject matter you see that youre already handling you thought you were running to be cold dont you see or something like that and your subject matter well does it have something to do with being cold or does it have anything to do with cold and so forth you can get fairly good rendition off of your meter you can at least block it out you see and you can say well give some represents you see give some goals similar to this goal or something like that youre not really doing goals list it doesnt follow the rules of goals list youre just tinkering with this thing trying to put it right and find the goal youll find yourself doing this every now and then particularly if you didnt do good thorough goals list job in the first place theres substitute for good goals job in the first place see but nevertheless even though you do do one you occasionally run into this other condition now you think thats the end of it you found the right goal and all of sudden ahhhaahhhhh the guys rr you see this thing the goal rrs and you can tell its the right goal because in this particular instance the only thing that will turn back the rr is not some similar goal similar goal wont turn on an rr its got to be the goal you see right down to the last comma see its got to be the goal and you read this and you see the thing rr you know youve got it because the rr is back on see you wont find some other goal nothing will rr until you find that right goal interesting isnt it and now because youve sinned and went on and on and on without having the right goal for that gpm you now have to take every one of those items and identify it analyze it identify it and put it in its right place and try to pat the track back into some kind of condition and you do that by asking is this an implant item is this an actual item is this from the gpm we were working is it from some other gpm is it lock on an ri is it lock on an implant ri is it lock on an actual gpm ri is it something or other you see you just go on with questions of that particular type and you get that thing identified and all of sudden the pc will say ah oh well yeah haha well yes yes and you suddenly see your thing start to blow and 65footlong gpm is hooked up and it starts moving back into its right place youve got to undo this ball of yarn that you have undone and tangled see youve got to undo that tangle and put it back into its proper order again that sounds pretty wild doesnt it it sounds pretty wild its things like this and this is only one of them i want to cheer you up today in cheery mood really the first day of high furnace heat i just want to make you make you feel happy about this whole thing that is not all of the problems connected with r4 thats just one of them it will happen to your pcs dont think you can avoid it itll happen to you as case its fairly inevitable its happened to twice and three times i think in running an awful lot of gpms but all of sudden why notice that the auditors gone white as chalk not feeling too alert yourself you see and start to run whatsit and it turns out that your rr has been shut off for the last item or two so it can happen dont you see this is not an unusual action and just to cheer you up is only one of the problemsconnected with r4 its not enough to be an expert thats the first lesson youve got to learn you be an expert and then work like hell from there on first be an expert and then work like the dickens because youll find that an auditor whos an old hand at running this type of this ottype processes will give you this will give you this as maxim and you yourself one day regardless of whether ive told you this here will one day be sitting there after complete particularly arduous session and you will come up with this as datum and so forth all on your own bat as how you run it you do the very best you can you do everything as best you possibly can and then you cope with the things that go wrong you dont try to run total perfection you dont try to run this right from scratch perfectly with the expectancy that it will be perfect you try to run it perfectly with the expectancy that every now and then you canoe barrel pc are going to go over niagara falls see you can expect your pc to one fine morning not appear and when found they will be staring emptily at the ceiling in total creak and everything looked right on your meter and everything was the best you possibly could do and so on and yet this occurred now youve got the task of unsnarling what you dont know is wrong yet you dont know whats wrong and yet you have to unsnarl it so you have to find out whats wrong and unsnarl it now theres real sense in getting superemotional about it that is what you can expect you do the best you can and you cope with the things that go wrong and theres sense in thinking well this is all just walk in the park see theres nothing to it you see and you just sit down and rons given some little rules here and its all fine and i can just put the rules in the chair and theyll run the case and we just sit back and itsa the whole track you see nicely and the pc emerges at the other end ot well unfortunately that is not the case that is not the way its happening and i can tell you that there is absolutely faintest possibility faintest possibility at all of that condition improving to any great extent i can give you absolutely hope of any kind that technology will move an eighteenth of an inch beyond that deadline r3m2 has been in existence for very long time and has been run in lot of areas it is being improved i can give you little tips here and there that have improved the living daylights out of it recognize new way of recognizing something wrong dont you see something like that but there is substitute for an auditor here and there is possibility that the technique or auditing it will become any easier in the future because the tips i can give you still require an auditor they still require the same address to the case and the hurdles are still there and none of those hurdles are going to be mounted by any little set of rules any new set of rules rather theyre not going to disappear simply because i tell you that there is new address to this particular problem those hurdles are there and the reason why this hits this horizon and the reason why this process is in this condition and will continue to be in this condition is the matter of meter the meter reads just exactly the same distance always below the pcs ability to itsa meter will not read any deeper than that the subitsa in other words this meter can see further into the case than the pc can itsa well thats godsend because it in actual fact can see far enough to barely get us by as the pcs ability to itsa improves the subitsa level on the meter rises this is constant distance the meter is never going to see deeper now ive experimented with meters for long time im going to make very very antipathetic statement to any research man when i say this meter is not going to be improved see thats antipathetic to research man he likes to sweep statements like that aside remember ive been trying to improve this meter weve been working on this meter one way or the other we have spent quite bit of money and time in very recent times trying to improve meters and the limiting factor on the meter is mental factor not an electronic one and that is that the individual itsas at level and the meter reads always then at level b and as you cannot develop meter which is more sensitive that will then read to level c do you understand and this meters already at the zenith you get anything you get anything more sensitive than that meter it gives you more trouble and has more variations and vagaries on it and gives the auditor more trouble than it gives him help dont you see so as you begin to make this meter more sensitive as you begin to switch around and change and alter various factors in it you start entering in various other things now of course the modern medico approach pavlovian hes got the answer you stick the electrodes into the brain of the patient ive had these dogs actually propose this seriously as solution to an emeter i mean im im not joking now that we use an emeter whereby we bore holes in peoples skulls and put the electrodes into the brain and this gives you more sensitive reading now ive tried to inform these fellows havent you slightly mistaken our purpose were not trying to kill the patient were trying to help him you see and these fellows look at with complete blankness they had never realized that we had any idea of helping anybody why they thought we were just trying to find out now therefore you can look at real help from the electronics of meter there wont be any you can put these things weve tried oscilloscopes but these things have terrible liabilities i think if wed invested billion dollars we would probably come up with slight improvement we would probably have moved the b below the maybe thousandth of an inch see hardly worth struggling for see the improvement you can put oscilloscopes great big you can imagine you auditing with an oscilloscope you know great big dial you see here and the thing is going back and forth you know and you know these old singsongs where you have the ball bouncing off the words you know this thing going back and forth you know and ill tell you something about that societies sufficiently electronically advanced to conquer space and to put spaceship through the air at trillions of light years trillions of light years an hour that fast have not conquered two problems theyve never even come close to the problem of the human mind or any other mind never come close to it its something like small boy shooting at squirrel in germany by being in demnark see not even miss you see just another state and they have never conquered space communication these very fancy spaceships can go so much faster than light waves and so forth they can never telephone home and say what do i do next joe you know thats what causes the warfare state of this universe the inadequacy of communication wave you can never communicate to anybody space fleet sent out is of course immediately beyond any possibility of communication or control this and that and the other thing lot of problems add up around this sort of thing if you have crash for instance even if your telephone or radio was preserved and so forth you would never be able to call home and say we ran into telephone pole joe send the wrecker thats the end of that people look for you for long time on your predetermined course lines or something like this the answer to communication is life living being and you can always of course release an individual from wreck to return to base and tell the boys what happened this by the way is the only method which is used in space opera didnt mean to get off onto space opera but im just giving you relative development so they turn the guy loose out of the wreck and he goes home and he says hey the boys are wrecked over on pluto thats the only answer theyve had to it but they couldnt improve that because they didnt know anything about life or the mind hoho interesting isnt it didnt know anything about that so they couldnt improve that which left them totally really without communication because the times you can exteriorize somebody and send him back to pluto or send him back to home base from pluto and so forth reliably hed have to be in pretty terrific shape but this has limiter on it the second you apply real science of the mind you get powerful beings and you get fellows who are very able and capable and that sort of thing and one they wouldnt be riding in spaceship to pluto so the situation is actually not neat statement it cant be made as neat statement as you improve one or the other but these two things have never been improved communication in the universe runs up against factor of this particular character and knowledge of the mind and that has oh theyve done quite bit in this particular direction they know how to implant people and so forth but they can make people worse and so on but making them better the easier route is to make them better and yet they havent been able to do that so those are deadended lines and its my contention that if the great electronic civilizations where the way you get your coffee in the morning is to roll your head on the pillow you just roll your head over to the other side of the pillow and sleep for few more minutes and the coffee appears on the side table brimming hot exactly to the temperature you like to drink at that particular moment you see and simultaneously why the living room is swept up and somebody has informed the office you are now awake and the you see any gimmickry that you can possibly think of you see way in advance of any gimmickry weve even dreamed of on this planet you see if they havent been able to develop anything that reads the mind we havent got prayer see thats as far as because were dependent there on another line of science were dependent on the electronic development of the age and that we had managed to milk this out of the electronic technology extant in this time and period is absolutely miraculous absolutely miraculous and that the what somebody laughingly called the other day the united states government busy seizing trying to seize this is actually accident at all that by the way isnt very serious suit i just got full report on it in the midst of everything else and the last two weeks have been legal weeks and that isnt now considered very serious suit if it ever went up for trial wed win it like that they cant find anybody to testify even people weve arc broken upset and so forth wont come in and clobber us governments having hell of time feel sorry for it the poor government i dont happen to have any items in that particular line im developing some one of their ideas of fighting this case by the way was showing that i was mad because i thought tomatoes talked these guys cant even read you know well we expect i always knew they were lip movers but i didnt think they just couldnt read anything anyway theyre trying to clobber this meter trying to clobber this meter this has given some puzzlement as to why they were trying to clobber this meter because i wondered if they werent getting orders from someplace or something you know i was trying to puzzle this thing out and then i thought well theyre just nasty tempered ignorant louts and that explains it so ill just let it go the fact is the fact is this meter has been eighty years in existence this is not new meter this is an old thing but weve grooved it up and sensitized it up to point where it performs our function we know more about these things than other people have ever known about them we know the voltage it best operates on and nobody ever dreamed of running these things before at 7 12 volts or something like that and weve done lot of lot of work this way and all this is limited limited technology because its limited by the state of development of the period in which we live so just take tip from the possibility of your meter getting better from standpoint of its guts and therefore reading deeper on the pc than meters now read is not improbable but nonexistent forget it now i stirred up stirred up cup of genius the other day and whipped up meter that makes it easier for you to list that its easier to handle and that sort of thing thats and thats in production i saw the prototype of it the other day but thats in design that has to do with physical design of the case has nothing to do with the guts and theres glass pane and you look through this glass pane to write your list and therefore you dont have to look sideways and develop that mirror inside the cornea and this is very tricky meter its listing meter and you look through this meter and you see the needle floating in thin air on the glass panes you see and you look through these two glass panes and your hand is here on the other side of the meter so the thing actually is its little thing its much smaller than this by the way its like this and you look through this in order to write and of course your line of sight passes through this floating needle and of course that needle cant wiggle without you seeing it see and it goes out of set that sort of thing why of course your thumb is right there bang because you see that its out of set you dont have to pick your eyes up off of what youre listing in order to see if youve had read on it in other words there are various adaptions of this this meter by being wired just the other way to could be set in desk now theyre getting really fancy with projection light underneath the meter with the knobs that controlled it over here someplace and you would have the shadow of the meter projected on the paper you were writing the list on its actually the same meter you hardly have to change it at all to do that with this is very fancy dont you see now if you took that meter and put it in desk like this so that it projected its light against the back of your list and you had video not tape recorder you see but video that gave you the picture and everything and this video machine was running over here and that just had couple of click buttons it would be so rigged as to take picture of your meter you see while you were auditing the pc and record your voice and the pcs voice and make total record of the session dont you see now if that video was improved electronically little bit further why of course every time you moved the tone arm it would put certain number of clicks on the video tape and then by running the video tape back through why it would also give you the total down divisions of ta for that particular session you see now you could fix this up so cocacola would also appear probably chilled you see the direction you see the direction this could move from there on we actually cease to deal in sensitivity or workability of the meter and simply get into into flubberjubber stuff foofaraw word of another age and time anyway this little meter with the pane of glass in it answers all these things its very lightweight its tiny it surprised that it could come up so light and its lemon the plastic on it and so forth is lemoncolored its rather rather smart and it comes in beautiful british leather case gorgeous gorgeous case but that case isnt going to read your pc see and nothing else is going to read your pc and you being able to see the needle better on top of the glass that isnt going to read your pc any better dont you see thats going to make it easier on the auditor in other words your developmental line is to make it easier on the auditor see make it easier for the auditor to read and see what is going on but not actually more subitsa from the pc that limit is there all right lets look on the looking further on the horror of it all your pc is of very little assistance even when hes itsaing in fact sometimes quite the contrary the number of things he will assert then causes these things to read on the meter hes asserted this is an actual gpm so when you read it on the meter it reads as an actual gpm dont you see and you dont quickly put in your rudiments and say on this has anything been asserted or suppressed or invalidated or something like that and then read it you see well of course your limitation is you havent heard him assert anything so you dont do that you see slippy sensible auditing approach here but whats what have you got your pc is sitting there hes being hammered and pounded by the biggest toughest aberrations that he has ever been able to develop and theyre flashing back on him in in solid avalanche as he goes through this stuff and as hes being knocked around and his itsa is just what he can actually factually realize and its not very high because the thing which is reducing his itsa is what youre running you see this is the case of the snake eating its tail this thing defeats itself in other words you could run these things out easily if the pc could itsa better but the pc cant itsa better because hes got these things the thing to do is to clear him and then have him itsa these things and tell you what they are you get all kinds of wild and silly solutions of this and of course thats an automatic limitation now as far as techniques techniques that improve this condition youve had one in just an analysis of what is itsa and the itsa maker and the whatsit line and ta action and get ta action all these are just general improvements of auditing and if you can do these things of course you can improve the pcs ability to itsa but it improves only to certain extent and after that after that it can only be improved by r4 because the thing which is preventing him from itsaing now are the items which are contained in r4 but nevertheless as you find these items getting little more ta action than you would normally get auditing little more smoothly making fewer mistakes not making mistakes but making fewer mistakes and you continuously raise the pcs ability to itsa and the job gets very good so it requires basically very smooth auditing its auditing its smooth auditing is what this requires now the rules of auditing apply to all r4 and if an auditor is basically rough auditor hes going to have trouble hes going to have more trouble on r4 than he would ordinarily get because hes going to reduce the pcs ability to itsa reduce the pcs meter abilities so he wont get the right answers off the meter you see and then you get into more confusions and more upsets than youd ordinarily wouldnt give so it comes down to basic auditing so you got to improve basic auditing and improve your ability to audit basically you see this is the cornerstone on which r4 must be built we already see process here which is going to go to hell in balloon at the least chance you see its going to go bang well lets not make it go bang because of bunch of fumblebum auditing see ill give you an example pc says youve i think youve overrun the list i think the list is too long i think the item back on the list is cheesecake now i think the items back on the list earlier and i think its cheesecake and the auditor is insufficiently alert to see that when the pc said cheesecake there was considerable there was beginning of commotion on that meter you see and is insufficiently schooled to realize the list is already too long and goes on nulling down the list and ignores this pc statement cheesecake see just kicks that out window just ignores it or plows on further you see well youre going to have lot of trouble there man youve now added some more suppress and youve added potential youve got cut comm line on the pc and the pcs ability to itsa has been reduced and so forth well it isnt much in itself you eventually go back and find out that it is cheesecake or you go back and find out that it wasnt cheesecake but the net result is that the mess has resulted from just unsmooth auditing see pc says something at least give him cheers and say all right you say its cheesecake you audit with the pc not system you see you say oh its cheesecake cheesecake cheesecake anything been suppressed on it all right well im sorry that doesnt read doesnt read yet might read later but it doesnt read now and the pcs itsa has been handled to this degree and not totally invalidated you see and the pc you very often find out that it was cheesecake you see the rolling rr thats what almost knocks you off you make that list one item longer and the rr moved one bit further it isnt that all each item has different rr the rr all comes from the goal so the rr coming from the goal therefore and thereby operates to move as you list so that you went the item that fell three from the top is the item and yet you went five down and had another one that fell now the rr lives at 50 the right item is at 30 you call 30 you say cheesecake cheesecake and you dont whistle the rr back because it has moved further down the bank and the pcs attention is now stuck deeper into the gpm and so therefore you cant get his attention off the gpm and back over to the cheesecake arrhhhh arrhhh till after you list it while longer and finally the pc puts cheesecake back on the list again or does something like this and you all of sudden if youre lucky youll see cheesecake and itll read again well what happened is you moved the rr the rolling rr you moved that thing out from underneath it see i shouldnt be using rr because you dont list by rrs these days you list by surges the stable datum is it took twenty minutes or ten minutes or twelve minutes or something like that to teach somebody whose name i wont mention the other day datum one datum one datum one datum and that is this datum and youd better know this datum i dont think you will i think youll do something else with it and then eventually come back to it and know it an ri in an actual gpm is anything that surges falls or rocket reads while being listed and that is the point of assumption from which we adjudicate an ri and it doesnt happen to be true see it its not total truth because you could also find an implant ri on the list someplace you see and it would read too but its still an ri in gpm someplace isnt it even though its an implant gpm you consider anything that falls anything that does well you know surge rr any kind of lefttorightasyoufacethemeter action anything that does that you assume that any item which when said by the pc did that that was an ri thats an ri whats an ri its an item that does that regardless of course you can now describe it in geographical position in bank and what it is and how it composes and compounds and all sorts and you go into that endlessly but the truth of the matter is the point of assumption from which we are operating today in the auditing of items is just that point of assumption and it doesnt have anything to do with anything else and there is additive to this and that is itself and many of you said oh now then when you list so therefore if something appears on the list that isnt what i said i call to your attention all i have told you is that we assume that this is point of assumption that anything which moves the needle from left to right anything that moves the needle from left to right in surge in fall or an rr thats or or or see was an ri in gpm and thats how we define one as far as its assumed if it did it thats what it is gpm see elementary that is it and thats the ri in relationship to the meter that isnt even anything in relationship to list dont you see thats just the datum by itself you get out of your skull this datum that an ri is something that rrs only that an ri is something that does this only or does that only or does something else only you just throw that datum out just pick up the lid of the garbage can and dump it in because this other datum is the one we have to operate from to find and work make r4 work otherwise youre going to get in trouble if you dont operate from this datum and know this datum well whats an ri well we assume anything is an ri which causes action on the needle from left to right as you face the needle which we would call fall surge or an rr now somebodys going to going to modify that on you sooner or later somebodys going to change that on you or youre going to change that and the moment you change that youre going to be in trouble youre going to be arguing around and you all of sudden are going to have something on the order of say i didnt think that one inch was fall i didnt think one inch was fall you get the change of datum somebodys going to get around this see oh i i but it rred so i didnt really give it to you because it shouldnt have rred it should have disintegrated you get the idea you get the number of variations here that can go on this assumption and just know this about that assumption that there arent any and thats the primary assumption that you have to have firmly in mind with r4 otherwise youre going to get yourself in all kinds of trouble now you notice i havent said its something which falls when you call it back to the pc i havent connected this with auditing in any way shape or form it just lives in pristine purity all by itself as datum uncontaminated by application thats an ri behavior on meter now if you know that you recognize that and you see what the score is with regard to that youre going to have very little trouble very little trouble because this now can be used in listing it can be used in nulling it can be used in testing it it can be used in this that and the other thing now the basic listing datum which you should use is the first ri or the first item on list that can be made to fall surge or rr on being called back to the pc thats the earliest one on the list that when being called back will fall surge or otherwise is probably we hope maybe the item that goes in that position but that by overlisting we can move the read on the list down now knowing that knowing that you get into very simple situation here it gives you terrific number of oneitem lists the best answer is to know what an item looks like on meter undescribable it looks certain way on meter for each pc it isnt the same for all pcs but its pretty close to the same for all pcs so what you must do is recognize an item when you see one on the meter but until you do in listing follow the severest rule again not necessarily not necessarily the right rule its dont let the pc list beyond the first fall you say well well cut off his itsa if we shut him up you better cut off his itsa that rr will be rolled right on down the bank and the right item wont be wont be readable now wow so you get things all arranged with the pc you say when the quarterback says soandso and hits the wicket with the cricket bat by saying thank you or thats it or something like that thank you is probably better youre to shut your mouth and you are not to say nothing else now this is very hard on somebody in w unit who has been shot very recently for having dared shut the pc off do you see but boy you better get to that valve and close it tight right now because youre going to be in trouble if you dont now you get take the first datum i gave you youll see why youll see why so just list till you see an item on the list using that earlier definition as the item just list till you see an item on the list and without startling the pc unduly say thank you thats it got it all right now ill read this item back to you all right ill read the item back to you well i i was saying oh bo dutdut dutdutdut dut i was but i had had it now i was trying to ssshhhh cheesecake cheesecake it reads is that your item well well as matter of fact it is yes yes yes sometimes however that wouldnt oppose it you usually suspect not that the list is incomplete but that it is overlisted you probably had an earlier item than cheesecake which you didnt notice read so you go on these various data in other words youve got to shut that pc up you cant let that pc list man dont let him list and list and list because hes going to be in trouble any item any list that tends to get long long is used advisedly what is long list well it is long list and any item which is used advisedly like this any long list comes about because the item you are listing from was the wrong item thats also true of goals thats true of anything the item you were listing from was incorrect to begin with your list gets long see your list gets long and you just cant get anything to read back and the pc says battercakes you see and you say thank you you know thank you battercakes battercakes battercakes it fell beautifully when he said it see you cant get it to read back uhuhuhuh well let him list little bit further and he comes now with cupcakes you see good thank you thank you cupcakes cupcakes cupcakes cupcakes and you sometimes see this is the mark of an amateur and its also the mark of very harassed pro cupcakes cupcakes cup cakes cup cakes cupcakes this item been suppressed this item been suppressed thats all right cupcakes sorry it doesnt read you get into too much of that sort of situation you see and your list is going for oh i dont know its going for 30 40 50 items or something like that and you still cant get anything to read you have to assume that what you are listing from was incorrect in the first place and the usual assumption is that there was an earlier item on the list than the one you gave the pc that is the usual assumption you dont now continue that other list in other words listing items is not handed handled by extending lists theyre handled by rolling back the rr if possible under the item it should have been under in the first place do you follow r4m2 is nearly always overlisted on items and underlisted on goals the only thing that really follows all of the rules of listing is goals list that follows all of the rules of listing beautifully two items reading on the same list shoot the pc its not complete see two items reading this that all these other rules that you know they apply to goals list the list is incomplete the list is this the list is that that applies all to goals lists and they are usually underlisted auditors tend to list too few goals thats the tendency because pc begs off all the time well its on the list now i know its on the list it must be on the list and so forth well you havent had an rr for long time have you well i havent had one i havent had one well how many well its uh uh uh 27 thats 27 since the last rocket read oh well 27 since the last rocket read well thats all right i guess its boy if hed only put the 28th on he would have gotten another rr dont you see and then he takes goal from an incomplete list and it is then messed up because he has skipped couple of gpms and the pcs attention is dislocalized or moved from where it should be on dont you see all these lot of lot of things happen see youve taken an item off an incomplete goals list and doing something with it and oh it its mess so an incomplete or underlisted goals list gives bounteous trouble oh thats lots of trouble and most of your horrible psychosomatic responses to r4 stem from incomplete goals lists nothing wrong with item lists but something wrong with the goals list see all right item lists listing for items inside gpm tend to be overlisted see goals lists tend to be you see they tend to be underlisted and item lists tend to be overlisted youll see some auditor with what enthusiasm going on on his item list you know bang bang on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on boy he should have shut up and moved on stopped long time ago you see item lists must be as short as possible you only want an item list just long enough to be able to get the item on it youll have tremendous number of oneitem lists youd be surprised how often the pc comes up with the exact next item the pc sometimes also in blue moon skips one but youd be surprised at how many oneitem lists youve got so much so that there is certain way of writing up the list so that you dont have to keep copying the item you have just found you just circle it and draw it into your next question and then circle that and draw it into the next question dont you see and circle that and draw it into the next question just for rapidity of listing you can list fairly rapidly this way youve got to call it back and its got to fall and blow down and its got to do all these things and you got to do your courtesy steps on it and theres reason you do these things slowly but youd be surprised how seldom you have to list long list on an item and if you do list long list on an item and you cant get anything reading back easily and it isnt making good sense why you assume already that you have just got through finding wrong item and you backtrack one list and then fix that list up and it usually is an earlier item on the existing list its not something that you extend dont you see thats the way you handle these things now even with that youll make mistake occasionally but these are fairly infallible actions that you start extending item lists endlessly and youre going to get in trouble now weve done tests weve done lot of tests one way or the other tests of how complete lists are and mathematical count lists you see i mean like 25 beyond and 12 beyond and weve done all kinds of list tests of various types you see theres lot of this work has been done and there is only one listing that works and thats the one ive just described to you so all of those other listing systems are not only kaput but dangerous you dont want rrs the nexttothelast rocket reading item on the list and the last rocket reading item on the list you remember that system and so forth that just finds tons of wrong items but this one this one now another thing is you say well geewhiz this this this item rocket read beautifully just rocket read beautifully so therefore you know item therefore therefore it must be the item because look at that beautiful rocket read well rocket read proceeds out of solid mass therefore you expect goals to rocket read but you dont expect items to if an item rocket reads its inevitably the wrong item ooooh horrible isnt it youve got to have disintegrating read and it more looks like fall than anything else but if that item rocket reads with beautiful stylized rocket read it must be gripped in very solid case to rocket read that beautifully so therefore it isnt disintegrating so therefore it wasnt the next item to come up do you see that the reason goal rocket reads so beautifully is because its got that 65foot by 20foot by l0foot case see and that imparts this beautiful rocket read with the whip start and the hook end and perfect of course its perfect youd be perfect too if the thing was that much encased you see nowvery often implant ris implant ris that are rring are also suspect little bit but implant ris tend to rocket read more often than actual gpm ris now you dont throw it out because it rocket reads if you see that its stylized rocket read but you regard it with considerable suspicion you wonder if you didnt miss fall just earlier on this list you see you dont get any wild scurvish whirling dervish dance over this thing just because you made something rocket read the least valuable commodity you can have is rocket reading item see thats something like yesterdays newspaper or something its going to be wrong anything that it says is going to have some difference in it goal on the other hand that doesnt rocket read is something to be regarded with considerable suspicion this goal blew down and oh smoke came out of the emeter and everything went bang and the pc was delighted with it cognited all over the place you know rave notices in all directions felt so much better but the auditor could never make it rocket read i know the history of several of these things one or two of them in particular blew down did all the things i just said to you gorgeous everybody was very delighted with it but later on it transpired that it was lock on an ri in the first bank of course the power that the thing had was the partial disintegration of an ri it wasnt even gpm dont you see it wasnt anything it was just lock and there are tremendous numbers of actual goals hanging around the perimeters of ris in actual gpms you see its very hard to do but if you knew what the goal was if you knew what the item was before you found the item this is very hard to do unless you find some out of sequence and arc break the pc like mad but if you knew what the item was before you found it then you could probably tailormake the goal that would also read give you an idea thirst the item is thirst see thats the ri thirst and if you knew that that was going to be the item you could then read to thirst or to be thirsty or even to be dry and get fall get falling goal of some kind or another youd get goal response these goals would do something its quite intriguing to watch this even though its almost impossible to test i know this because ive seen them in reverse you see ive seen goal fall and then later on found out what ri it was connected with and got big meter response by suddenly adding in this these are actual goals dont you see theyre actual goals of one kind or another which are salted through these gpms well they dont have any decent read to them and they they dont do anything very much and you can analyze them out rather rapidly one of the easiest things to get rid of is an actual goal if you know an actual goal exists you see theyre usually just locks on ris i regarded this with some suspicion for while wondering what if ris werent expressed as goals ordinarily and so forth but theyre not funny how these things hang on the perimeter of it and there are many trips and traps for the unwary with regard to these things but the point im making is that goals now dealing with goals you expect rocket reads you should know all about rocket reads if something doesnt rocket read you sit there and cry into your kleenex you see while the pc pats you on the shoulder sympathetically the subject of goals is then subject of rocket reads anything that is real goal can be midruded up to rocket read you see you can fix it up first itll start rocket reading on just the suppress buttons it itself might have just ticked when you first found it and you get suppress in as you run suppress on real gpms goal see why youll see that thing start to rocket read suppress rocket reads you say on this goal has anything been suppressed pour see you dont get you get an instant rocket read on suppress and that will clean up and another button or two will clean up and all of sudden youll call goal and maybe once out of three average why itll fire with rocket read doesnt fire three out of three with rocket read thats really asking for it because the pc is anxious and hes wondering if its his goal you know and you call it once and he anticipates the next one suppresses the thing and of course the next time you call it it haha what dogs breakfast trying to get one of these things to read sometimes and an actual gpm will blow down but not much itll blow down but blowdown is requisite for it whereas an ri has to blow down if an ri doesnt blow down it isnt an ri sometimes an ri doesnt blow down just because the pc is waiting to find out if its his ri hes got the brakes on the thing see cheesecake see and you hes sitting there and well well did it read or didnt it see the auditor didnt say it read or anything like that see hadnt really said is that your item had just said cheesecake and looked alertly at the pc you know the pc says well is it or isnt it my item you know well it read it read is it your item yeah psssseewur you see blowdown sometimes the pc doesnt dig it see its siberia see the item is siberia see and the pc cant see how this relates to instructors siberia instructors you see so on oh oh and then you get your blowdown in other words lack of comprehension can sometimes hold up blowdown blowdowns however usually just happen and they require other things but they can be slowed down so an ri always has blowdown always invariable an ri that doesnt ever blow down is not an ri for that position now youll get some of the ramifications of this definition i gave you of that earlier it was an ri but it didnt belong there it belonged someplace else in view of the fact the pcs got many thousands and thousands of ris actual ris and he has in actual fact well id say at least hundred locks thats being very very conservative for every one of these ris you see how many things in the bank can be made to read or can be made to function or operate with or be found or something you got complications on your hands here but the point im making is that an ri if it is in the right position will fall surge usually and blow down but it always must blow down to be the ri for that position see that doesnt change the definition for an ri i gave you earlier if its in the right sequence itll blow down very often its quite correct as an ri but you werent supposed to get it for two more items and it wont blow down yet and this sort of thing you have to ride this horse now we look over we look over r4m2 we find theres lot of other little rules of various kinds or another theyre not things however that trip you up ive given you the important salient factors of this process there is one more stable datum that i think i ought to peel off however and hand to you if the case is running well you dont repair it you only repair cases when they have ceased to run well persons not now running well you repair the case case running well leave it alone i had case running like startled gazelle and went back up to repair an upper bank i shouldnt have had anything to do with that man i found about six items then found out they didnt belong to that bank and found out this and found out that and oh my god why should i have gotten up that morning you see but i was repairing case that didnt need repair we all of us learn this lesson many times and i just am not giving it to you as something you must know now but something which i am inviting you to relearn every time you do it another guiding datum another guiding datum which is of great use is never force balk never continue to audit across balk never never never pc balks q and man you balk youre doing something wrong you try to drive down oneway street wrong way to or youre doing something weird but the pc will instinctively balk you never really pay too much attention to why the pc is balking you dont necessarily say the pc is wrong but you dont necessarily say hes right either the pc doesnt want to go on well then youd better damn well find out whats wrong with the r4 i dont care what he says what she says i dont care you find out whats wrong with that r4 because theres something wrong with that r4 right now man right now and the sooner you find it the better off youre going to be and you start to push past any kind of balk of that kind youre going to be in trouble the pcs going to go into sad effect youre going to wrap that case around telegraph pole usually the pc can be counted on balking when something is going wrong with the case its fairly reliable the pc can balk as faintly as this i dont really think i ought to have session today see thats faint thats faint balk i really cant cant seem to list on this list thats balk now theres something wrong and you take those things up at once never push past them dont in r4 use the datum that the auditor must go on summer storm winter snow or night the auditor must not pause in his flight you see thats the wrong motto thats the wrong motto you try to shove down the wrong rabbit warren on r4 and you got yourself hat full of trouble and youre going to have trouble and its going to get worse and its going to get worse and probably the hardest lesson you have to learn in r4 is not all of its complicated rules and how you stand on your head in order to list that sort of thing dont worry about all of that sort of thing you just basic auditing and sensitivity to the pc you notice balk on the part of that pc man find out why right now and analyze it right down to the end of the run square it up man square it up notice those balks and dont push past them and almost never run pc up an alleyway get sensitive to balks in other words the unwillingness to be audited i dont feel well these days i dont think auditings doing much good balks see find out what they areyoull find theyre always connected with finding wrong item skipping some items wrong goal something out of sequence gpm skipped youre running an implant gpm when you thought you were running an actual one you know horrible things are going on here and theyre actually the first notice you have of them is little bit of light balk and sometimes an auditor is not sensitive enough to see balk when he sees one pc gets right up to the point i wont go on puts the cans down you see steps back from the chair puts his hands behind him you see and is about to walk out the door the auditor says you know i think that might be balk see well that is long way and far cry from where the auditor would should first notice this balk which is simply that i dont know i dont know i just and so on do you suppose its doing much good to find these items i havent cognited on very much here lately thats balk find out right away whats wrong and dont be satisfied with little things wrong it isnt that you listed the list and invalidated something on the pc you see its that you listed the list through the implant gpm down to its bottom and you have now been opposing the implant goal as an ri instead of the actual gpm goal as an ri or its something horrible that you were just sitting there and all of sudden this happened you see its that sort of process how anybody ever gets to ot you will sometimes wonder cases are on the road however and cases have met up with these conditions and are running through them it is not process of sitting there holding the sprig of violets smiling its more like one hand full of lilies of the valley you see and the other hand full of clouds youre not quite sure which direction youre going to wind up its its desperate situation it is fraught with many difficulties many upsets and so forth winning through this for the auditor and the pc is considerable task it is very difficult and it is not an easy process to do and i would be lying in my teeth if i told you any differently the road all the way to ot is the road that youre taking with this there are lesser roads and there are lesser heights and lesser goals youre going all the way to ot on this theres only one way to do it and thats right and even when you do it right itll go wrong and theres only one road to ot and thats the road over these confounded cobblestones and corduroys and tax and so there it is and just thank your stars that its there and cry quietly to yourself on your pillow because it is so damned rough that goes for pc and an auditor this is rough rough shot we know all the answers to this we know all the answers but we cant get over an inability to do basic auditing and we cant get over an inability to read an emeter we cant get over these corny ones but the rest of the road we know all the rules and in knowing all those rules we can impart this information i can tell you how to do this i can show you how to do this but i cant show datum sitting in chair how to do it you have to be alert and on your toes and you can do it you can do it it is doable and you can do it but it isnt easy and there isnt any easier road ive been looking for many many months now that we have had this process trying to find some easier road trying to find easier roads through it ive perfected listing little bit ive got little bit better meter coming so forth these improvements are so minor that it simply dumps it on our lap and leaves it up to us to simply audit to get through and somehow or another make it thank you end of lecture
