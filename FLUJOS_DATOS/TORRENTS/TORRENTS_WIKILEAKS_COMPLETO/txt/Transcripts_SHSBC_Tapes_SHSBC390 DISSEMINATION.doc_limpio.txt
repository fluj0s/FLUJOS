dissemination lecture given on 7 july 1964 thank you have to look you over see whats happening to you got to keep check on you isnt everybody that can read off seventy or eighty eases in the breath of an eye whats the date audience seventh of july seven july ad 14 saint hill special briefing course and lecture on something i havent found out what yet little piece of news here first its quite interesting scientology in its impact and its effectivenessfantastic effectiveness at lower levels only trouble is as we who are accustomed to it are so seldom well you might say driven to total simplicity that we dont always see its effectiveness at lower level you know we say well absolutely this thing has to be far more complex in order to do something for somebody and well lets do something little more skilled lets get some auditing in at good professional level you see and so forth and as you might have heard and which you saw the evidence of i went to circus on the invitation of its management and photographed the various acts in the circus itself and so forth and these photographs by the way im not quite sure what their disposition is but theyve already been swept into the torrent of publications and publicity and i had to part with about thirty of them with shaking hands for fear of what might happen to them for reproduction in paper on the south coast onetime reproduction and of course those are transparencies so they have to come back to but of course theyre the only copy there is you know and all that somebody would have to do is taking them out of the cover glasses is slightly scratch one and that would be the end of that as picture you see but already why theyve started into the torrents of publicity and last night by the way we gave smashing show absolutely smashing the circus you know is noted for showmanship and so we outshowmanshipped the circus always count on ron you know and we didnt take that little screen you saw them on you see i tookand there are also nearly hundred additional pictures that we had and we hung up twelve by twelve white sheet that we had to sew up with our own little fist for screen making twelve by twelve screen now twelve by twelve doesnt sound very large to you at first glance but that is an awfully big screen thats actually the vertical i think is slightly greater than the technirama or something screens i dont know what those are but it certainly looks so and this hung on uprights in the ring last night over at the side of the ring of course made an elephant as big as an elephant and it made performer anything up to five or ten times his normal size and regs beautiful rollei projector there and boy it threw that picture out in that dark tent like mad we gave them party actually having shot all their pictures and everything why we ordered bunch of beer to be delivered up there by tylers and so forth and after their show was all over you see why we gave them show see and it was terrifically acceptable to them but actually show or show drinks or drinks these people had been becoming more and more and more friendly we practically own the circus and even the animals smiling you know the elephant man there hes got quite sense of humor he keeps putting an elephant over on top of every time i start shooting his act elephant will sweep in right deadclose to where im sitting you know the other night why he popped whip in front of my face i dont know not more than an inch or two away from my cheek you know of course theyre experts at this sort of thing see if id blink and i just grinned at him you know but this has been actually very amusing experience in numerous lines and these people of course are quite accustomed to highclass black and white photography andbecause thats professional theater photography its someone of the glossiest of photographic fields so anyway this beautiful bunch of transparencies and so forththrown up there on the other edge of the ring you see elephants as big as elephants and so forth and boy these people really enjoyed themselves you know naturally as picture of their own acts and that sort of thing and we really gave them good time but the point islittle numerousnumerous little things happened one of them youd be very interested incouple of weeks ago when we first started thisit isnt i havent been working on this for two weeks buttotally dont you see but weve managed to get couple of evenings off and go andabout three by the wayand go tearing up there you know and wherever the circus is playing its playing in this radius and its within about fortyfive minute drive of us or something like that at any given night you see even though its changing locations and they had just been through an awful jump because the grounds they had had suddenly been denied them and the council had found that the man who was loaning the groundsrenting the grounds to the circus had clause in his rental of the grounds from the council that he must not sublet it so the council forbade the circus appearing on its own grounds and at two oclock on sunday dawning why they were out there with flashlights and the chief of police and the mayor and everybody else looking over groundfor new ground to put the circus on well this made bit of rippleso they attracted fantastic quantity of press and here was council turning down circus in an area but actually they did them tremendous favor they put this circus up on top of knoll and you come down on one of these ml type highways from about three four different directions and over there miles visible for miles is this big top sitting up there on top of this knoll see and boy they had that thing stuffed to the rafters yesterday you couldnt actually hear yourself think much less even hear camera click or anything like that with the kids and the cheers and hurrahs and you talk about enthusiasm man it was there but anyhow youd have thought this crowd would be pretty doggedout with all this experience and they werent bit were they they just right on their toes and so forth and they gave us big sendoff but the elephant man couple or three weeks ago when we first started this right away got ahold of just before his actand he was in the elephant tent there bull tentand he said you know he said i have terrific swelling on my knee and rolled up his trouser leg to show us and it was it was huge thing was as big as softball and he used to be tumbler and its ivor rosair hes one of the last remaining members of rosair family the circuses go by families and its very traditional and so forth and this sir robert baileys well thats sir robert fossetts circus is the name of it and its run by captain bailey fossett and the place is absolutely drowned in fossetts everywhere you look theres fossetts couple of girls last nighti was busy shooting some shots of one kind or another and id pass by of course they double in brass you see little circus and youll see this girl up in all of the aura of performer doing deathdefying stuntand kidding it is its good their acts are terrific you see nothing corny about them the next thing you know why shes down there selling ice cream you know and everybody turns to to knock the big top down including the manager and the owner you knowjust everybody and they put it all up again and take it all down and everybody has got his part you know terrific circus organization but anyway this fellow says that he had this terrific swelling on his knee and it was worrying him great deal and i dont know quite where he got the idea since we hadnt introduced ourselves in any way where we quite gotwhere he quite got the idea that i could do anything about this you know but he was leaning on pretty heavy to do something about thisthe demand was definitely there so i showed himi showed him how to do touch assist on it told him to remember to touch both knees and i didnt give him look at it i just gave him feel that you see and now just feel your finger on one knee and then feel your finger on the other knee and you do that he says well at night he says i cant even go to sleep uhitit hurts so bad and hes been to hospital hes had specialists and medicos on it and so forth and i think they were going to remove all the ligaments in his brain at one time or something of the sort and anyway hes prettypretty pressury on the thing so i told him how to do it and i said make sure you do that and you dont have to do it very long and just do it every night before you go to sleep sit down on the edge of the bed and do this you see well i didnt expect he would because the cue had already sounded and the elephants had heard the cue but he was so interested talking to about his knee that he had missed his own cue and the elephants more or less picked him up you know and took him along so there he was going along there restoring the bandage and getting his pants leg down and so forth and the elephants shoving him on you know toward the big top so we thought well thats the last of that you very often give somebody how to do touch assist and they forget about it you know and they think something or other we pulled up there yesterdayof course weve gotten very friendly with ivor sinceand we pulled up there yesterday and whos there but ivor see hes all dressed up hes ready to go on and this guy by the way is one of the biggest elephant trainers and that sort of thing in england and he was out there and he was talking very cheerfully and so forth and he said say he said i want to show you something you know and he pressed his pants together against his knee right knee left knee same size swelling gone yeah he said ive been doing it he said yeah of course why not he said either youre crazy or im crazy he says but it works so last nightlast night after the show why i was developing practice on business consultation and on personal problems and ive got practice moving around the country two or three different locations week and so forth at this very minute and somebody who says he cant find anybody to process or get any results with scientology and so forth sometimes puzzles puzzles because actually ive never been able to lift head anyplace in the world without developing practice i dont even ask for practice and ive got one you know ive got an old sign i have to show you some day i think it says esha mak hlopi isangoma which means something on the order of the white witch doctor and it gives my name in script and then says that im white witch doctor in im not sure its one of the bantu tongues i think its probably zulu and so anyway i had nice practice there but im careful not to work at it you know i actually have to be very careful not to work at it you turn around and the next thing you know you got four or five guys standing outside the door and theyve got something going on and then they actually dont ask for anything very heroic they dont expect any results and theyre absolutely flabbergasted you do something for them just do something for them thats the primary note somebody asks you for help why do something for them you know tell them something fellow was saying to last night that he got fainting fits and he says you just show up at the door and theyre all disappeared now he says but i was having fainting fits just before you came i was talking to him in the arena after the show and i say well all right i what can you do for somebody with fainting fit you know well id just got through giving the show and so forth and my wits were not in very groovedin condition you know id just given an extemporaneous performance on the circus to circus performers you know and you dont think that isnt tough try it sometime and of course the lantern slide went out as medium of entertainment some years ago you know and to suddenly whip up all this old technology you see and dream it up and talk to circus people about the circus you know you dont know whether youre talking to pedestal or drum you know you have to call all their names you know as pictures of them appear maybe you got them wrong or backwards you know you got list and its bit of abit of pressure all of sudden somebody says to you i have fainting fits you know so ronnie just into the other harness you know zipzippresto chango well now i think if youll look back on it youll find somethat youve done something that you thought you shouldnt have done every time just before youll have one of these fits and he wanders around about this thinking about this and of course what did i give him you see obviously there must be some ow mixed up in it thats just one off the cuff you know and he thought that over for while and he wasnt quite sure about this and so forth and he hadnt digested it yet now hell go off and hell figure that one out see and hell at least have something to do dont you see when he has fainting fit hell say i wonder what ive done that i feel guilty about and hell think oh yes oh yes you know i stepped on this and hell get rid of couple of overts and thats justit doesnt matter whether that was the fainting fit or not the fainting fit will tend to change at that moment see after hes done this two or three times he might also cease to have fainting fits dont you see but the point is this is athis is huntandpunch type of practice you know its just off the cuff and you better develop facility of how to do that somebody finds out youre scientologist and that youre in this field and that sort of thing and i dont go the funny part of it is i dont know how you handle it but i personally neveri never tell anybody anything i just never tell anybody anything of course i have the slight advantage occasionally i have press agent circulating around unbeknownst to you know driving in practice on and so forth like reg probably was and i dont know that reg was doing this but he might have been doing it naw heshas nothing to do with it because it happens to anyplace i go and as far as these fellows were concerned why i was just photographer that was taking pictures and i proved it to them with the show see must be pro look at the show you know very funny part about it the only person that was really rattled at the circus was young photographer up there from one of the local papers he blew in there with his flash gun and jap camera and they all carry little yashimat or something like this camera flash gun he blew in there and he says uhyou from the press and i said i said american magazine features you know and its true enough you know oh he says the english small circus hm you know bored you know like that and he sayi introduced myself and he said what are you shooting there and he looks and he sees its rollei and hes shooting japanese version of it see well thats little pointand he says something about what are you shooting there and i said well i dont have any black and white im shooting only color oh eyes go roundabsolutely black tent you see impossible to shoot color and he says there are couple of other photographers around therebeen arounda lot of photographers around this act of course that was reg and bonwick standing over there my cameras ready so forth and i said yes i said were team working on it you know so he starts to ask for what are the pictures in the place you know and i pointed out this picture and that picture to him and he went and took them my respect for him went up howeverthe comedy horse got loose amongst whole mass of children the comedy horse thattwo men occupy it you know and its up there in the stands and these kids are absolutely mobbing this comedy horse you know and i slid around and jumped up on bench to get shot of this and just before i fired with telephotowhich stacked it all up you seejust before i fired with telephoto there was flash on it i dont know how this boy got picture i dont know how he dematerialized on one side of the ring and rematerialized on the other side of the ring but he rematerialized right in the midst of these kids and right in the midst of the comedy horse i dont know how he ever got picture of ithe must have been far too close up or he was running hundreddegreewide wideangle camera but there he was and he came tearing out of there and he waved his hand to he says i got it i got it and offhes gone he had another appointment somebody was having fire someplace he had to shoot you know but my respect for him went up i hadnt ever seen anybody dematerialize and rematerialize press boys are very good at that you know they have to be very quick they have to be very quick on the draw its an odd skill and if you dont believe it sometime just pack camera down the street and spot some pictures and youll find out youre usually spotting the pictures twenty minutes after youve seen them at first and then you cut the comm lag down actually this type of thing needs drills like we have in scientology but putting practice together has always been mystery to how anybody could miss it isnt because im or because of my name because very often i will appear in some entirely different guise you know like im motorcycle enthusiast or something like thati got practice you know im photographerive got practice you know it doesnt matter how i pull the mask over face itsi wind up with practice and one that could be just with small amount of pressure built right straight on up dont you see maybe its because everybody is trying to build practice the hard way somebody says ive got headache and you say my auditing rates are soandso and they say whats auditing you know id say that would be the wrong way to go about it id say that what you do is just on huntandpunch basis get halfadozen cases here or there and so forthdo something here or there and so forth and you probably build it up to practice that you could charge money for you see having practice and practice that you can charge some money for and practice that you could charge lot of money for are just gradient scale thats all it is and if you dont start the one practice youll never get into the other two ive been almost ashamed of myself somedaysometimes after ive been in an area for while the amounts of moneythe amounts of money that get pushed in my directionrather fantastic sums of money they start going up to the degree that i wont you know go into professional practice you know they start putting the pressure on it you know and every now and then i had to raise my rates from two hundred and fifty dollars an hourthats too little two hundred and fifty dollars an hour is too little and those rates were put on my auditing for onlyfor one reason and that was to stopnot have to audit see at five hundred dollars an hour thats fairly safe you only get an occasional onceinabluemoon bid on something like that but two hundred and fifty dollars an hour thats too cheap but of course now were talking about and myin conjunction with my name well what would i operating as nobody at all just an anonymity or obviously somebody involved with some other profession well how fast would it build up to that actually itd build up to the same figure theres difference because id get the same practice start in the same way move up in the same gradients the only thing an auditor would really have to solve is what does he do for an income while hes building practice and if he hasnt got bunch of cash in the bank to relax on or something during this period of time well what does he do for income during that period of time thats all because theres going to be lag period of time there depending on how clever he is and how fast hes off the mark and so forth theres going to be short period there when he isnt making any money and period could probably go with from week to somebody elsethree four five months you see and some auditors play it backwards they set out and use what capital theyve got until they get practice see but they never really start their practice dont you see they just live on what money theyve got until the practice suddenly mysteriously materializes someplace or other well that isnt the way you do it you actually shouldnt lean on any capital you get yourself bit of sort of income if youre starting in in an area or something like that that puts you in communication and contact with people jobs and having something to do and that sort of thingvery useful in getting you in contact with people not in any little small office if i had to work in small office and i was trying to build practice i certainly would not depend on the small office in which to build practice i would go out and join some social clubs i would join some very numerous social clubs you know something thats got lots of people in it you know motorcycle racing clubs or debating societies or cooking schoolid do something desperate id just get in touch with people and id give few people little advice but usually you dont have to give them any advice they come and ask you for advice they just listen to you talk thats all and you seem to know your business youd be surprised how scientology communicates across space that has nothing to do with processing its the most amazing thing you ever had anything to do with there was navy captain who washad been flying back and forth on nato business and i happened to get intothis was some years ago into the bottom of they used to have these stratocruisers that had huge bar thatin the lower part of the body and so forth and they used to fly back and forth across the atlanticold fan jobs the days of the atlantic barons and so forth these were what they called the pilots of those old fan jobs took them seventeen hours to cross the atlantic or something like that anyway i was sitting down there with this navy captain and he was pumping about something or other or hammering or pounding about something or other and i was trying to talk to him on the subject of business reorganization or something like this it was very banal all of sudden guy sitting on the circular seat that was several feet away from he all of sudden says to um say he says leaning over do you have some kind of philosophy of life or something of the sort he said you seem to know what youre talking about he saidyou know he was very puzzled he was very puzzled he wasnt hearing words that were different you see but he was hearing thoughts that made sense of course he had business overhearing this conversation anyhow you see but we werent even talking about scientology and here was this bird over there and i said yes as matter fact thats scientology oh he says scientology of course i just handed him central organization card and told him to write in for book or something like that he was very interested he put it in his pocket and so on i never fail to get on an aircraft without changing the life of at least one person on it its almost impossible id have to be sound asleep or under sedatives you know i findand my point of view is why i dont pay any attention to dissemination or thatthe amount of attention i should pay to dissemination perhaps because its not point i have any trouble with you see of course id be terribly interested in this point if i had lot of trouble with itand i dont and i imagine lot of scientologists find this lack and are upset little bit about it thats why im talking to you about it now see but its not problem with and its not problem with because i dont make it problem im actually not particularly worried about it name and reputation have nothing much to do with it and so on nothing they can even know you as famous in some other line and youre still there you see you dont have to build name for yourself you know its balderdash because lot of people in the world know my namejust in conjunction with writing and that sort of thing but ive found very routinely i could call myself joe blitz and it just wouldnt make bit of difference its what you can do that counts dont you see its somebody trying to break into the field of writinglets get an analogy going on itsomebody can break into the field of writing and he always says well if i had good name you see of course i could immediately get past the editor you know and the editor would buy my stuff and its because i dont have name and that sort of thing well i dont know all of my life ive been signing things joe blitz you know rene lafayette ken martin kurt von raachen you see names all kinds of names winchester remington colt and those things dont go to an editor as l ron hubbard is now sending you manuscript which is written by pseudonym winchester remington colt see it isnt even identifiable as manuscript form it goes in they buy it the only time i have any trouble is give it to an agent or something like that and he buries it underneath bunch of other manuscripts and nobody reads it about the only trouble i ever had in the old days i stopped using agents they have usefulness and they have uselessness theyre liable to do you in theyre liable to send bunch of stories that youve given the agent to sell around to the editor thats already had them you see and then he wonders what on earth is coming off then he wonders if the stories youre sending him havent been rejected by somebody else dont you see and he gets all confused so i found it was far better just to write winchester remington colt sometimes you have trouble cashing the checks once in while you have to send the check back to the accounting department and say please make this out to l ron hubbard so i can get it in my bank account but namepractically nothing whatsoever to do with it name is mostly valuable to the editor well science fiction story signed l ron hubbard can usually kick science fiction circulation up something on the order of twenty to eighty thousands additional copies you see on the stands can be counted on to do so so hes interested in that you see and sounds as if i wrote nothing but science fiction but one of the reasons they pay you high rates in some publication fields and so forth is just because you kick their circulation up see and then you can bargain now theres name theres name but thats what thats not whether or not you got story sold thats just whether or not you gotwhether or not you got more money for it and you can stand around and argue with those guys and they finally cry and moan youd think you were taking their last knucklebone out of them in painful way you know and yeah my god man i cant pay you ten cents word i cant do it it shoots my budget thatthat ruins my budget for the next three months and i usually look at them and yawn cavernously and then say well why dont you get another budget the guy breaks down and says well all right and the only reason he would be in that position is he wants to kick his circulation he isnt telling what happened i know very well what happened hes under the gun from the managing editor the managing editor says i hate to call it to your attention because body odor and other things of this character and halitosis are not things that are discussed very personally or out in the open but your circulation has dropped lately you have circulation falling well the guy says how do i get my circulation up obviously the only way he can get his circulation up is reach for fast name thatll sell some more issues thats familiar to the public or something like this he can do something spectacular with the subject matter dont you see popes sex life revealed you know but frankly frankly that is notthats not reallythats part of it but its not as reliablethats not as reliable as maybe putting photograph by steichen or something on the front page dont you see and the public sees this thing and this thing is going to be full of these things or you know something like this or here is new novel by pearl buck you know something like this bang you know and his circulation goes brrrmmm see and then he is now permitted to drink cocktails at the cocktail party three steps closer to the managing editor you see in their order of rank and his circulation is back up so thats his problem how well known you are is his problem and it regulates to some degree but only to some degree how much money youll get but thats all it regulates it doesnt regulate how much volume you do quite the contrary you very often find that famous name bars volume in the field of the arts but wouldnt necessarily in processing i was just giving you an example youve shot my budget to pieces for the next three months i had some fellow come around to one time and said you mean you would have sold usyou would have sold us somesome articles and i said yes i would have sold you some articles he said my god he said ii never thoughtii justjust never dreamed thatthatthat you would so we never ask you you run into that situation once in blue moon see ii just never dreamed that you would process you know so name can stand as liabilitycan stand as big liability everybody knows you wouldnt process them because theyre so unimportant and youre so important you see they can see you some time getting the janitor to put down his mop pail and you stand him back against the corner of the thing and youre standing there running reach and withdraw process on him they would get over the idea that you wouldwere very selective and erudite about who you processed or when you processed but the idea here is simply that you can go at it im sure you could invent ways to go at it wrong and that you dont have to try very hard to go at it right thats the whole idea you see you probably have to work at it accumulating practice or getting your name up in scientology now some of you many of you dont have the problems of gaining practice but always sooner or later scientologistwhether hes working in an organization or matter where hes workingruns into this problem of accumulation of practice he very often doesnt know what to do with it central organization the wrong thing to do with it is to pick it up and do it you know carry on an outside practice that is actually the wrong way to go about it for about eight reasons its the wrong way to go about it you become suspect from your fellow staff members and everybody thinks you must be scanting your job if youre processing outside and so forth well you can always make some handy jimdandy arrangement with the director of processing or somebody in the organization dont you see yeah you bring people in and process them and so forth and you know that practice area so you know who can stand traffic and who cant stand traffic pour your practice on into the central organization just make sure however that your neck isnt way out so that some kid that just came out of the academy and had nearfailing grade isnt suddenly given the pc who is looking to you for help dont you see but you could make all kinds of wild arrangements in an organization and itd be very knuckleheaded assoc sec who wouldnt listen to them hed have to be awful knuckleheaded you say ive got kind oftheres five or six people around that i process at occasionally is it all right if i keep this up well do you do it for nothing they give some money and you say well why dont youyou knowi dont want to be making this money outside the organization and that sort of thing because this is nonsense this is probably cutting the organizations throat well work something out see work something out and these people got to be processed why process them on organization time he probably even could work it out so that they wouldnt even be charged full organizational rates you get the idea these things are very flexible far more flexible than you could imagine the idea is of course after youve accumulated the trust of somebody you dont want to see that trust betrayed and you want to follow this thing through well bring some hammer and pound and pressure to bear to make sure that it gets followed through now if you go on the idea that life is just dream and that we pass through life on little light cloud and really nothing is ever any work and so forth i dont think youre talking about human being i think youre talking about rocka boulder or something like this youre not talking about human being anything is trouble man just itsanything is trouble you start doing something youre in trouble you know there is easy way to do anything see you keep looking for the easy way to do it youre fool there is easy way to do things there are some ways that are not as hard as others and you look over what it takes to maintain yourself in the realm and rank of professional competence in any particular field and youll just be amazed somehow or another not iniit took about fifty hours to shoot these circus pictures fifty working hours and that includes all visits all transport all assembly of this and that and so forth and i had to somehow or other take this out of my scientology working day i wont say that my scientology working day hasnt suffered somewhat in the last couple of weeks because you cant take fifty hours of work out of somebodys work week without something else not getting done you see but nevertheless in view of the fact that my working day is seven days week and so forth i figure out i have stacked myself up bit of backlog dont you see so forth but theresim just giving you an idea here i havent been working on this exclusively far from it matter of fact during the same period of time ive probably saved the bacon of central organizations doubled their income handled this line handled that line done an awful lot of other things too dont you see but lets just look at this other thing just from standpoint of professional competence i dont know if you think its any work as far as physical labor is concerned to pack somewhat heavy camera and throw yourself into all kinds of wild corkscrew attitudes and wrapping yourself aroundaroundaround tent poles and that sort of thing and leaping out of the way oftwo or three times ive been saved from hospitalization and so forth basically trying to keep from getting in the road of the performers and so forth but even then be so intent on picture or something like that that ring boy would grab by the shoulder just in the nick of time to get out of the road i almost got run over by the pony carts id never getlive that down dont you see it wasnt that itd hurt it was inappropriate see it was déclassé bitten by lion well yes you could live up to that type of injury but not being run over by shetland pony cart and yet im sure that it would have hurt just as much but up down back and forth and an empty camera and pegging back over and so forth and this that and the other thing and talking to this one and that one and corkscrewing into this position and that position and here there and up and down and back and forth and around and so forth why ifthere really arent very many people who work that hard thats why they dont get pictures you see i mean the difference is somebody else wouldnt work that hard so well hes then not ahe cant come up to pro standards why he wont work that hard simple its hard work see you dont have to look on it as hard work but its certainly active dont you see and youll find this obtains in any field one of the reasons i went about studying photography is parallel line for you i dont need any excuse or apology for having done so but restudying photography after all these years im about to rewrite all your courses from the word go so the best thing to do is to take full course in another extra field dont you seethat has nothing whatsoever to do with what were doingand how does that put together and what trouble does student run into and all the rest of this sort of thing im coming on down the line finishing this up having lagged it for three years having had reason to do it now finishing it up in about an eighth the time anybody is supposed to practically every mail is coming back here with one of its examination papers in it dont you see and of course will be finished up in record time then ill know how course like that should be run know what student objects to in course know how to study it what the shortcomings of it are know all this sort of thing and nevertheless this is again hard work you cant just limply sit there and say well isnt it interesting that cameras have lens covers you know isnt it interesting brother you have to say if you use camera and theres several different ways you can use shutters on camera and one of them is to remove the lens cap isnt that interesting thats the oldest shutter there is what do you know about that you see you have to invest some of yourself in it even if only to that degree then you saythen you say well you know if i ever found myself little imagination see if i ever found myself out there and my shutter went busted wide open or i couldnt get the camera to speed and i didnt know what the speed was i could probably stop the aperture way down and put some kind of lens cap over the front of the thing and lift the lens cap and get the exposure as long as i could have second or half second in which to accomplish this operation i could probably get the picture you see makes good basic photographer out of you you know lens cap goes over the front of the thing it was used by oldtime photographers in order to get the exposure when they didnt have any shutters thats the datum in the course see all right what are you going to do with that datum well itsif its just running river of data that doesnt have anything to do with anybody and doesnt apply to anything you havent invested any of yourself in it see youve got to say well what is this datum what can i do with this datum whats it about this for instance i was reading about composition of portrait lighting portrait lightingwow you say whats akind of subject is this well its staggering subject its sufficiently staggering subject in the first place that hardly anybody ever shoots portrait and that of all the samples gotten from all of the portrait photographers in england not one of them passed muster here few weeks agoa few months ago i looked over all of their samples they hadnt made the grade they werent up to sunset boulevard or park avenue photography standards and this was the whole field you understand theyve lagged little bit behind now its very odd to find an english professional lagging behind in any particular field but thats because the public makes demand on him you see but this is field that is one of these fantastic fields i mean the portrait photographer that can take real portrait you know he almost can name his price you see the best paid fields are portrait and fashion so you sure know something about lighting well one of the reasons why nobody ever gets any portraits they dont know anything about the lighting this is one of the wildest subjects i think i ever tangled with i didnt know there was that much to it see so well naturally if youre going to take somebodys picture picture of somebodys face youve got to have some light on it you know thats the simple statement well its just about as simple statement as describing the entirety of atomic physics as something that is used to make atomic bombs now weve described the whole field of atomic physics dont you see in that brief statement well it doesnt describe it because this is wild subject i was involved with it last night for short time im studying this course just before i go to sleep and all of sudden realized everything they were talking about in this particular section had application to any portrait i would ever take i wouldnt take blackandwhite portrait if i could possibly avoid it i wouldnt shoot blackandwhite picture if i could avoid it this is the day of color and the thing to do is be in the vanguard not in the rear guard and black and white is terrifically complex technique but whod ever buy blackandwhite portrait of themselves if they could get color portrait of themselves just as easy thatthe prices that you get for portraits you might as well give him one see it isnt the finishing or the materials that make the portrait sitting expensive or inexpensive its what the traffic will bear thats how thethats how the thing is calculated on its pricing what will the traffic bear well what the traffic bears is greatly superior to anything that color materials would cost you this is fantastica fantastic area and i suddenly realized everything theyre describing here in the way of studio equipment and that sort of thing would have to be converted because there is field of color portrait photography left in the middle of the lesson going uh you know then i realized ive got to go ahead and learn blackandwhite color portrait lighting in order to know how to convert it well it didnt say to do any of that in the text did it they didnt tell you to invest anything of yourself in this subject it says youre just supposed to put the fill here supposed to put the main light here youre going to put the hair light there and youre going to put thea small spot over here in order to bring up the hands and youre going to put headscreen over here in order to take out the ungainly large ear of the person thats all you have to know and well all right aarriigghhtt araaraaraeah and we get down and well pass the examination nyahnyah one day you would have been setting up and you suddenly would have realized wait minute im shooting color i dont shoot black and white what am i doing with thirtyfive hundred kelvin what am i doing with photoflood 2 well youre not doing anything with photoflood 2 because the day they make what is laughingly called indoor color film into color film i want to hear about it because i dont think the day has arrived there are two brands of color film theyre whats called outdoor color film or sunlight color film and theres indoor color film or tungsten color film and tungsten color film has certain adequacy im sure and some photographers try to shoot inside color film by putting blue lens cap on theiror little blue lens on their filter and make it do somehow but i notice oddly enough they dont get color pictures and i always thought the point in taking pictures was to get picture i know thats naive but all im making here not to drag you off into those ramifications is it here required the tremendous investment of self in the study of the thing what was i going to do with this material i was studying i wake up in the middle of this thing of course im happy as clam to know all about these areas and angles and im very happy to know all about blackandwhite lighting and so forth but none of this can be done with the equipment which is advised because the equipment which is advised is allwould turn your color film into nothing but red fire and you would have nothing on that color film the kind of color film i shoot and the day i study course and change my color film just because they havent given the answer of course hasnt arrived see because color film is something you cant make work anyway youve got color film thats working for you man dont move off of it well what happens to portrait lighting what happens well you cant use any of those types of lights you have to use the basic setup but how do you figure out basic setup the thirtyfivehundredkelvin red light would just make ruddy mass of red mush on your color film you see we cant do anything with it there are strobe lights burning fiftysixhundredkelvin daylight color there are strobe lights that you could compose with see but i dimly remember sometime somebody or other in photographic magazine modern photography something like that that somebody had put out something that had bulb in it and also had strobe in it so that you could compose with the bulb and then when you fired with the strobe you would get the daylight that sounds awfully roundabout dont you see and it might look different but this was the line i was suddenly shoved off into technical problem miles wide how do you solve that technical problem well you better know all there is to know on the subject which youre studyingnot go galloping off into the wild blue yonder just because you have technical problem not specifically covered lets find out the subject we are studying before we go galloping off this was reason then why i should put down portrait lighting as text you see and start maundering and spinning practically on the subject well all right this is the way you light portrait but ill be taking color portraits even if i take black and white dont you see i will first take it in color i wouldnt shoot blackandwhite negative not now im learning better you take color negative and convert it to blackandwhite negative by secondary step well what do you do well your best operating procedure is jolly well study what youre studying you know not leap out of the airplane with parachute now when youve got some command of that why maybe the dawn will rise and the bells will tinkletonk you see and you will suddenly have brilliant clue because you may not be up against that problem after all it may be simple problem when you finally get through you may finally discover that there are such things as masking disks of some kind or another that fit and that you could even convert photoflood or you may find some various other things but even though knowing full well you were studying something that is inapplicable to what you will be doing the best thing to do is toas far as formal subject is concerned or the formal study of the subjectis to go on and find out all you can about it from it so id say the system that you would be operating with is first invest little bit of yourself in the study and having done that study what youre studying even when you find it doesnt apply if its there to study study it see and even though you say well it doesnt apply to my peculiar particular problem well finish studying it if youre in training you see finish studying it even though it doesnt apply to your particular problem dont go getting impatient with it and so forth because youre liable to find out that its principles as you go around the corner suddenly in some way do apply but you actually at that stage dont know enough about it to really know whether they apply or not you may only think they dont apply you may be under misapprehension well the way to get around all that is to go ahead and study what youre studying even though it is apparently not applicable to what you are going to apply it to and then after you have completed all that make your adaptions so youve got three steps here put little bit of yourself in it you know how am i going to use this stuff you see how does this apply to it says here that woggaroo is nine feet taller than whizzabung well thats an interesting datum whats it got to do with you whats it got to do with pc whats it got to do with anything study actually does you good whatsoever unless you ask questions like that all of sudden you say oh he means ahe means hoolagaroo oh uhoh well of course thats nine feet why does he remark on it well thats just being curious about it you see all right well lets back it up just little bit and youll say well how would i use this datum in handling case see how would iyou thats reading thathow would i use this datum in handling case how would i apply it what does it have to do with anything i would be doing see thats what i mean put little bit of yourself in it see what does this have to do with anything i am or will be doing and youll be quite electrified sometime that statement that doesnt have anything to do with the price of fish all of sudden becomes very intimate and very germane from just meaningless string of words it turns into very meaningful statement indeed one of the reasons whyone of the reasons why people have an awful hard time studying things like engineering and so forth is theyre not involved with engineering students in universities are not involved with engineering students in medical schools are not involved with healing people in mentaltreatment skills of yesteryear are not involved with mental treatment at the time that they are studying it so of course they come out at the other end with total unreality on the whole cockeyed thing this lays an interesting foundation dont you see because andwhy this is badthe only thing thats bad about this see youre not in that position you are using it but yourwhats bad about thiswhats very pooris that your nonapplication then never brings up what would i do with it see ill give you the lousiest course the most horrible course i ever took i stayed in washington one hot summer to finish off an awful lot of engineering courses and so forth that i needed for credit you know people stand around and they say i havent got any degrees i havent got any of this and so forththey ought to been there that summer man id much rather been out flying airplanes because i was having ball flying airplanes instead of that i had to sit in this horriblethey didnt have any air conditioning in washington and washington is cool at 95 in most summers you know sitting down there at gw sweating over this stuff and one of the courses was materials of construction i could have cheerfully have choked the guy who ever wrote that textbook he had the organization facility of an army officer and my god brick and concrete brick and concrete and pebbles and aggregate and the streak characteristic of marble and the tension of steelwere all in the same paragraph you just couldnt sort it out nothingnothing was ever over here grouped you didnt start in something we are now going to talk about bricks there are big bricks and little bricks bricks are made out of clay see and you take clay and you put them on paddle and shove them in an oven and you bake them at umphtyumph degrees for umphtyumph hours and when you bring them out you can sell them for money and theyre called bricks see nothing like this this bookthis textbooki think cost about twenty dollars or something like that of those precious dollars of those days that really bought something you know with twenty dollars of today i think you can get lolly for it anyhow this cockeyed book was about twoandahalf or three inches thick and he hadnt classified anything like that bricks and steel and pebbles and marble andand every sentence was another disrelated datum you talk about walking zone of gpm confusionthis was the worst i ever heard of every sentence in every paragraph related to different subjectsand contained many subjectsbut every sentence in the paragraph was something which was isolated and different from the paragraph and with the thermometer bouncing around hundred you know sitting in roaring hot classroom you see trying to walk my way through thisthats why i almost kill reporters who say what degrees do you have its just that one anyhow i wasnt using any bricks see it wasnt actually how confused the text wasand it was horrible textbookthe usual gag of the textbook written by the professor you know when there are better texts i wasnt using any bricks i wasnt about to do anything with marble i wasnt about to do anything with aggregate and i didnt care what the tensile strength of steel was i wasnt going to steal any this stuff was blahwho cared well id be interested in it right now id be interested in quite bit of that material now well were building quite few buildings around here and theyre built out of various thises and theyre built out of thatas you know and itd be very interesting to know what this stuff was and what its genus was and that sort of thing but id now be reading it from different viewpoint wouldnt i id be reading it from the viewpoint of well i dont know does this have any application to anything were doing around here all right heres datum that says bricks when theyre put on paddle are flipped and pancaked and after that you have groozergruffs in them that have anything to do with what were doing oh groozergruffs i dont know that must be thatthat must be that weird scoop that has the makers name in it hey what do you know i think ill go out and pull that on mr jenner you know you know look very wise and say be sure you get the groozergruffs right side up you know but id probably know what that was for you know its so they wont slip sideways after theyre laid or something you know id probably have some interest in them but only if id invested something of myself in it of course there was nothing to invest in it at that particular time because i 1 had slightest intentions of ever doing anything in the field of engineering and 2 wasnt doing any engineering and 3 it had been removed academically as far as possible from the realm of practicality it couldnt have gotten any further without spaceship and left the planet you see well that makes then very unreal very poor professional youd have very poor professional well it comes from the basishe must invest some of himself in it hes got to do it in other words i dont know i could probably sit up there and read that photography course from cover to cover all the way through true theres lot of these things im not doing im not suddenly taking lesson and so forth but i am using it i was clever enough last nighta couple of them the proprietors of the circus asked why i hadnt taken their picture there was some inference that i should have taken their picture well true enough and i told them that portraiture was entirely different than candid shooting an act i could speak with some authority id been studying the living daylights out of it you see i said itd take considerable more equipment i said itd take lot more time and id have to catch you some day and ill come up some day with some equipment and well shoot your pictures and i said but this is different field and they were very impressed with it but i was on solid ground yeah i could have laid gorgeous egg you see because those people would tend to be seen full face and full in close theyre not performers dont you see the only thing you could shoot of them would be portrait the only thing that would be worth shooting would be portrait dont you see they arent doing anything there is action theyre involved in except owning and being themselves so what can you shoot of them but portrait well then itd have to be sort of study wouldnt it it would depend on its characteristics for their character or theirtheir attitude this portrait would sort of have to reflect this fact itd have to tell little bit of the story what could you do with it well thats what you could do with it but right away when i came back i was reading there last night before i got forty winks and i was reading this how the hell would you walk into circus eighteen pounds of snoots and sixteena snoot is something you use in photography not in their zooand big spots with barn doors and headscreens and backscreens and benchesand this is minimal studio photography equipment i looked this over how would you go about getting portrait of these people you havent even got two hundred and twenty volts to work with seeyou havent even got the voltage they run on fourforty i suppose you could take an ordinary bulb and screw it into reflector but you wouldnt know how hot that was or what the light was after youve done that and portraiture requires fixed setup of fixed and known areas how would you go about this and i suddenly got the peculiar notion of how would you go about putting together portable portrait studio what would you have to have in order to do this wow it left completely adrift i havent got it licked at all see but theres lack of interest in the subject i had two people two very good looking people standing in front of you know well why havent you taken our pictures you know i had to think fast i had to say well portraiture thats very specialized field of photography you realize that weve been shooting in the field of action candid here color but portraiture thats another field takes long time i could speak with authority yeah it does take long time i get back and i got very very renewed interest ive been going over portrait lessons and so forth and that sort of thing and i got very renewed interest in this whole field what is this see all of sudden some reality dawns on im not opening up shop you see with thirtyfoot back studio its very funny you know you get sold in this course every one of these boys is specialist theyre terrific authorities in the field theyre good boys you know good practical menwriting these texts and so forth and every one of them assumes that youre going to be their kind of photographer you know so he gives you all the pressure this is what youve got to do and this is what you should have and this is the kind of camera you will be using you see and its all intent and youre from this field of photography to that field of photography the other field of photographyand you never knew there were so many fields of photography and when you wind up you wonder what you are you know youre not quite sure youre going toare you fashion photographer are you this actually kind of wind up mixed bag were not going to open up any studio down there on the street and hang out little sign saying your lifelike portrait finished in five minutes or something like this youre not going to do anything stupid like that well how are you ever going to take any portraits what are you going to do have your wife falling all over these light stands in the middle of your i got enough things to fall over you ever notice in my office and so forth people keep bringing things and giving things i have things to test and every once in while every two or three months we get very heroic and we move out the tigers and we move out these various things and we find places to put them and all this sort of thing all we need is to add large spots small spots fills mains backscreens this is all we need you know just to make life unbearable i can hear suzie now shes very good at it but i think shed blow up she wouldnt be able to get to dining room table or bring coke or anything see what do you do apparently nobody has really solved this one but probably they have see and somewhere down along the line somebody is all of sudden going to talk because i notice theres future lesson someplace says home portraiture odd thing for lesson to be about for professional photographers he must be talking about some kind of photography you do going around driving around in car and setting up aportrait stuff or portable portraiture maybe theres whole book on the subject see theres particular reason to just give up and throw in the sponge because it cant be done dont you see and there is portable equipment and you know bog down at this point youve invested some of yourself in it you see and now youve run into this fantastic problem that is undoable well lets go on and study the thing out to its bitter end see and somewhere along that line youre going to find doability youll know more about it from which to evolve your solution solutions are not actually evolved from inspiration solutions are evolved from observation and inspection and data thats what you get solutions from observation inspection data familiarity youve got an object its object i dont care what this object is and you got problem with relationship to this object i dont care what it is this could be handy jimdandy clock that is made in switzerland and tells how many freckles youll have in august you know it doesnt matter what this thing is familiarity is tremendous factor in this as you know so you just touch it and not touch it and touch it and not touch it for while scientology has lot of simple facets you know all of sudden you say oh thats what you do with it you know you get the idea thats what you do with it familiarity observation it runs off the barriers which prevent you from observing itrun off on this reach and withdraw stuff but more importantly youve gotyouve got all kinds of data and other things you can look the thing over of course you can go to another crime of we will study it for the next five or ten years before we do anything about it that is equally crime dont you see thats nonsense thats overstudying that is not solving it by studying it huhhuh which i think that some of the boys in some of the fields which preceded us were quite guilty of well we will study your case for two years and at the end of that time well find out whether or not we can do anything for you during that period of time we will charge you sixty dollars week for your sittings whats your paycheck sixtyfive well actually sixtytwofifty is our charge bunch of fakes you know that criticism or critique of psychoanalysis youre probably familiar with the old paper from way back when that really landed harpoons into those poor psychiatrists down there he doesnt know anything about psychoanalysis hes crazy he doesnt know anything hes well they were presented with this thing this paper see on the stand they just went mad boy that thing must have sunk into them like harpoons fired into whales you know because every line of it is deadon and deadtrue but its the very things they dont want anybody to know you see and so out of the whole field of scientology all psychiatry could pick on was critique of psychoanalysis in other words they didnt pick on scientology they just picked on scientologys opinion of them and that was all they found fault with and it shortcircuited their whole you understand what happened we wrote criticism of psychoanalysis so we wouldnt make similar errors so when they were dragged up as witnesses by the laborites down there and so forth and when they were all squared around why they were really going to throw harpoons into us see they were going to really fix our clocks and so forth when as matter of fact although they did give some other extraneous testimony to this their attention and all the excitement and heat went on on our criticism of them see they were just trapped right there with that and actually never got off to first base about saying how bad it is only thing they could say is they dont know anything about psychoanalysis its not true see of course every line of it is true and so all they harpooned was our harpooning of them and i tell you driving harpoons into harpoons after they have sunk into your midriff is not good defensive mechanism so the upshot of this is that familiarity knowledge and so forth can be overdone someive heard of somebody going to school till hesfor eighteen or twenty years to learn how to thread needles or something like thatan overstudy situation but that would again be because the study must not be developing any familiarity i should think the thing would shortcircuit itself out if there was subject there to be studied and if any familiarity could be gained with it so the shortness of study depends on familiarity acquired thats why university education takes so long they dont acquire familiarity with what theyre studying in many zones they dont few of them they do they take flashlights and go around at night around in parks to shine them in cars to study sociology and that gives them familiarity as matter of fact ive often thought it was too familiar but there are some fields where they do do some looking now in then course of approach to the world of gaining understanding of gaining knowledge of gaining things you actually have necessity to be in contact to be in touch with to not fall out of touch with and as long as you can maintain your familiarity line or channels or approaches or something like this you will find that your competence will increase it is only when you crawl off into an ivory tower and so forthone of the reasons why you find tearing off into the wild blue horizon whenever i get an opportunity every few years and suddenly hitting some other subject matter and so forth is just that you can become too concentrated on one line of subject matter you fall out of contact with line of subject matter which is the basic line of subject matter which we have which is people and you can fall out of that you can get so withdrawn into that that you never meet any people you can overdo this by getting so involved and so in contact with them that it stops being familiarity it seems to be horrible bore you can overdo this very easily that is to say you can throw yourself out into the sticks somewhere and youre not in contact with anybody who knows anything or does anything and you dont actually operate to improve the situation dont you see you dont get anybody in that area studying anything and so forth and you just keep contacting raw meat and associating with nothing but raw meat after while you get kind of overwhelmed because its awful raw but if you withdraw to point where youre in contact with raw meat whatsoever you tend to 90 out of contact with your basic material how do people operate who are people what do they do how do they look how do they feel how do they act and then youre liable to get specialized idea of what raw material is or how it operates or how it should operate or something like this youre liable to get an odd opinion of it so you ought to go look at it once in while and you ought to go look and see how people operate and so forth see if youre getting unreal in any particular line and so forth well i obviously find im not getting very unreal i go out and i apply scientology i at the very highest i apply it just as ive told you to apply it i go out and be pleasant and smile dont even hang up shingle or sign and so forth and i get practice i got one growing and believe that if i went on contacting that area and those peopleand i very probably willover period of time without my doing another blasted thing about it except being nice to them and when they have problem give them piece of advice or tell them something to do or do something for themnext confounded thing you know these people are built right on up along the line they want to know more about this they want to know more about whats going on and so what do you do you route them into some texts you give them some books you tell them to read this or read that or read something of the sort you dont even have to strain at it dont you see you give them card say if you order book from this area for five bob why itll tell you all about it see something like that it isnt even difficult see it requires strain well you go on this way and if you are not running it backwards and interfering with yourself you wind up at the other end with practice you just cant help yourself its whether or not you can keep yourself busy during this interim period that iswould be the problem wouldnt be the problemthe problem isnt to develop practice the problem is to have little bit of time in which to let practice develop dont you see buying little bit of time the economic world you buy time with dollars and pounds and runts and things of that sort but anyway theres thethe problem involved in the world is familiarity with the world and the people of the world and so forth and these people are very far from mean vicious and ornery bums there are some that are blinder than others and you can normally find out that yourwhat you know and what youre doing works and its wise and it brings with it great deal of comfort and straightens lot of things out and so forth and then you sort of know that youre doing right and going right and all is well and all of this sort of thing works out id say as far as developing practice is concerned the problem is simply to get over the period of the coffee and cakes while one is forcing itself on you see so if you try to force practice on yourself or try to speed this up or razzledazzle it in some particular line oryoure liable to goof it up dont you see youre liable to violate its time factor see youre going to work at it you know youre goingyou got to keep working at it all the time but you cant force its development you cant say this has got to be developed seven times as fast as it is developing or something like this because i need more money next tuesday or something like that thats how you get in the road but you normally develop practice anyway im quite intrigued with this little adventurea very small adventure only ive had them many times im not really creature of ivory towers this is why we have scientology familiarity with existence and iti get into rebellious frame of mind every once in while i dont want to sit at the desk any longer you know and be snowed under with the despatches and all this sort of thing it appears to to be profitless something like that i lose touch with whether or not its worthwhile you see and i go out and in the space of couple of weeks of few visits to particular area doing an entirely different thing and without any reason for anybody to be nice to at all why i getwhat were doing works its desperately needed the little light touch that you can hand out just off the cuff and so forth makes better happier world in the environment you enter very magical matter of fact i feel myself just little bit overwhelmed because i dont know anything i work less hard on than scientology in that particular area see i worked on scientology hard at home but in that area i carefully didnt work on scientology and all of sudden why there it comes next thing you know i probably wouldnt be able to do anything about it at all why there is probably the practicei wont exaggerateof the whole circus world walking in my direction there it is i can do something else for them and so forth but gradually if i keep associating with that zone or area thats going to walk in more and more it happened to once before in england i had movie actresses and things like that walking in on my direction i cut it off i channeled it off very hard in another direction because it was getting in my research road and so forth well i hope i wont have to cut this one off because its too pleasant its too pleasant after all if youyou can suddenly appear for just few brief hours in an area and have people asking you all about it and the next thing you know face the problem of what am i going to do with this practice while not trying to acquire one well then theres hope for any scientologist that walks out into the world and doesnt try to push it too fast or too soon or too quick and does his job somewhat competently thank you
