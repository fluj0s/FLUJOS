jansen eysteinjansengeouibno jtouarizonaedu subject important the next steps for chapter 6 enroute to the fod date thu 14 jul 2005 214856 0600 xflowed hi all in the last few emails we have suggested that you serve as head lead authors for the various sections of our chapter one main purpose of this email is to make sure you are comfortable with the responsibility and have time for it the other main goal is to explain what is expected of each of you first heres list of whos heading what sections we picked you guys since you have proven to be intellectual leaders on the team but also because you have track records of getting the job done on time the one person we worry about is olga since she is leaving soon for the field but nonetheless wed like all her input on box 63 before she leaves we will take over after then exec summary and section 61 peck and eystein section 62 david section 63 stefan section 64 bette section 65 keith section 66 fortunat box 61 david box 62 fortunat box 63 olga box 64 keith second what is needed here is list that has come to mind wed like you all to comment on this list use the email list used for this email so that we all agree about what were doing in the next couple weeks 1 your primary job is to make sure your section text tables figs and refs is as perfect as possible each of us has to be careful about how we schedule things so that we have the job done by july 24 2 each of you should solicit feedback and edits from the entire team plus relevant cas this is obviously to get the best ideas possible but also to ensure that all on the team have had input please create check list and make sure that you have some sort of feedback at least an ok from each we suggest you start asap and dont expect to just respond to the emails we just sent many of the just dont respond in timely fashion thankfully you guys are not on that list 25 monitor all chapter listserv traffic for your input as some prefer to communicate only in that way 3 please explicitly ask for feedback on the text tables figs and refs 4 with respect to text try hard to get it down to size see below and to ensure that it is focused on only that science which is policy relevant all text should support an exec summary bullet if it doesnt the text should be removed or bullet created for discussion with our team also although it is ultimately our job to try to make the chapter flow as one document please do what you can to make your sections text flow with the other sections look to make sure all information is compatible across sections and that the same type of languagestyle is used to the extent you can 44 we hope that you will start your process by reading the entire chapter carefully and sending your comments for each section to the head for that section this will get things moving fast and help with the compatibility issues mentioned in 4 above 5 with respect to the figures and table make sure each one is as compelling as possible to save space see below you might decide figure has to go you might decide new figure has to be included only if there is space work to get the figure redrafted where needed to be perfect sign of ultimate success will be that our figs get into the tsspm docs peck will be on that team and will push hard but figures must be policy relevant and compelling 6 with respect to refs please make sure that only the most relevant ones are cited and that all of the citations are complete and entered into your copy of the master chapter endnote file although we expect to cite our own work where it makes sense please be double sure that were not going overboard in this regard it wont look good to the outside world eg skeptics if we appear selfserving at all 7 if you run into any debates that cant be easily solved ie with all happy please consult with us it is our job to make the ultimate calls since someone has to do it again it is our goal to make sure that one is left with bad feeling about our product on the other hand we have to make sure we stick to only the best science 8 well be asking to make sure we have all the cas listed let us know if you need to consult with any new ones again we must do what it takes to get the science and message as perfect as possible ca consultation at this point is encouraged where it will help for example we need to get out the preq box to some preq experts we are discussing w david 9 at any point you need input ask we are happy to talk on the phone and can call you or group if you want conference call we are doing this already and it can save lots of time or email both of us will be mostly around save day or two 10 size and need to cut some sections because of recent changes in the tsu we havent been able to get the latest word but we suspect that our comments in the fod draft just sent are true some sections have real space issue factor in figures others less so well provide more on this soon and we expect that if you follow the above guidelines youll be getting things into more focus and hopefully less space especially section 63 when thinking about figs tables and refs also be thinking how can i save space 11 feel free to bring in other to help you coordinate for example for section 63 bette and dominique to be back soon can be big help stefan keith is working with tim and ricardo but also some others to do the job he has left etc 12 we will start sending more info next week and will help reach consensus on what were doing and by when if needed let us know what weve missed and what might be wrong or unclear ok thats more than enough
