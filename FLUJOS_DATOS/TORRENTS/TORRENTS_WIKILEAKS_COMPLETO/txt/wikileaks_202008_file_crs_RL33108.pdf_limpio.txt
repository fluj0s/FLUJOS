in natural resources policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33108aging infrastructure dam safety summary while dams have multiple benefits balanced against financial and environmental costs they can also present risk to public safety and economic infrastructure this risk stems from two sources the possibility of dam failure and the damage it would cause although dam failures are infrequent age construction deficiencies inadequate maintenance and seismic or weather events contribute to the possibility to reduce the risk regular insp ections are necessary to identify potential problems corrective action can then be take n to remedy those deficiencies congress is often called upon to fund remedial ac tions as way to prevent the larger catastrophes the 110th congress will likely see proposals for improving dam safety and may oversee existing safety programs to identify deficiencies that could cause dam failures the federal government established inspection requirements for the nations federal dams once deficiencies are identified most agencies finance repa irs through their opera tion and maintenance accounts funding mechanisms vary for larger rehab ilitation ac tivities at the bureau of reclamation for example most larger repa irs are conducted with annual appropriations to its dam safety program at some other agencies dam rehabilitation must compete with other cons truction projects for funding the federal agencies with dam safe ty responsibilities include the tennessee valley authority the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the departments of agriculture defense ergy the interior labor and state at nonfederal dams safety is generally state respons ibility though some federal assistance has been provided the na tional dam safety program which is authorized through fy2011 by pl 109460 helps states improve their dam safety programs and train inspectors in ddition ferc and the department of labors mine safety and health ad ministration require regular inspections at the nonfederal dams within their jurisdiction even so th ere are concerns that most state dam safety programs have inadequate sta ff and funds to effectively in spect or monitor all of the dams for which they are responsible further there are concerns that states local governments and other nonfed eral dam owners may not ve the financial resources to maintain and rehabilitate their dams the collapse of the i35w bridge in minnesota highlighted the potential for unexpected infrastructure failure this may re sult in review of the safety of other elements of our nations inve ntory of critical infrastructure such as dams levees tunnels and bridges and call for additi onal funding to resolve any deficiencies congress has periodically been urged to provide federal suppor t for rehabilitation work at nonfederal dams demand for ch assistance is likely to increase but currently federal policy describes the conditions unde r which federal funding is appropriate nor has congre ss established criteria for prioritizing funding among nonfederal projects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33108contents introduction 1 d

navigation and water supply for drinking irrigation and industrial uses dams also entail fi nancial costs for c onstruction and for operation and maintenance and sometimes environmental costs eg loss of riverine habitat dams also can present risk to public safety local and regional economies and the environment prior to september 11 2001 congress had ex pressed an increasing interest over several decades in dam safety in recent years congressional interest has focused largely on securing and protecting us dams and water storage facilities from terror attacks hurricane katrina and the disastrous failure of levees that once protected new orleans however have re newed congressional in terest in the structural integrity of major water infrastructure the modern period of congressional c oncern began in the 1970s with dam failures that resulted in loss of life and billions of dollars in property losses2 congress and private groups interested in dam safety noted that while states and localities are responsible for th maintenance and safety of 95 of the nations dams large numbers of older dams lacked the maintenance needed to guarantee operational integrity and prevent failure these aging dams represented then and continue to present potential hazard to downstream populations first essential task was to develop accurate data on the nations dams their number type structural condition and othe r information useful for making decisions about dam safety polic and priorities this was ach ieved in 1972 with the creation of the national inventory of dams nid3 computerized

generally fo cus on publicly owned dams additional information on thes programs is provided in the task committees 2003 report and is recreated in table 345 federal funding while the federal g

of home land security through fema runs the national dam safety prog ram which offers training and other assistance to state dam safety programs though it generally does not provide rehabilitation funding legislation in the 109th congress would have extended the ndsp and authorized funding through fy 2011 and would have provided total of 350 million to fema for gran t program for states to rehabilitate and repair publicly owned dams authorized fundi ng would have been 50 million for fy2007 and 100 million annually through fy2011 th rough other programs fema may provide assistance to reduce the fl ood damage failure would cause46 however this assistance generally does not include fundi ng for rebuilding or rehabilitating dams nrcs many upstream flood control dams were built with assistance from the nrcs and turned over to local sponsors many of these dams are now nearing the end of their design life and some have significant rehabilitation needs the nrcs has estimated that more than 540 million is needed to rehabilitate these dams47 in 2000 congress enacted legislation author izing 90 million in discretionary fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33108crs15 48 the grain

appropriated 10 million for this dam re habilitation program for fy2003 the administration did not include the program in its budget request however the 2002 farm bill49 established the small watershed rehabilitation program and included 275 million in mandatory funding for the program through fy2007 the small watershed rehab ilitation program is significant because it is the first federa l initiative to dedicate funding assistance to repair nonfederal dams rather than tear dow n or build new dams it uses cost share formula providing for 65 federal35 local funding in the past cost sharing has been an equal responsibility of the fe deral government and local sponsors for most purposes other agencies in general federal agencies such as the corps and reclamation do not rehabilitate nonfederal dams as scribed above however the corps does sometimes repair structural deficiencies that resulted from its participation in the design or construction of the nonfeder dam though quite rare congress has also directed federal agencies to use their dam safety appropriations to rehabilitate nonfederal dam that it did not help design or build50 however representatives from the corps and reclamation have testified that they do not support such congressional direction51 conclusions as the nations dams age and devel opment continues in floodplains the structural integrity of this infrastructure will become more si gnificant public safety issue in the aftermath of hurricane katrina dams planned capacity to withstand floods and other natural disa sters has come under increased scrutiny however it is unclear to what extent there will be widespread reevaluation of flood and earthquake ratings at highhazard dams such an evaluation could raise additional policy questions for example 1 what criteria should be used to determine whether current risks are acceptable 2 if risks are not acceptable s hould the dam be improved or should other activ ities eg changes to the design and or placement of downstream development be undert aken and 3 who should pay regardless of whether dams were cons tructed to withsta nd an earthquake or flood of appropriate magnitude they may have agerelate d deficiencies that need to be corrected to maintain current levels of safety therefore it is likely thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33108crs16 appropriations requests for safety inspections and rehabilitation activities will continue and may increase it should be noted however that there currently are clear criteria for prioritizing dam re habilitation funding across agencies it is also unclear to what extent the federal government w ill fund inspection and rehabilitation activities at nonfederal dams throu gh the national dam safety program the federal governme nt provides training and ssistance to state dam safety programs authorization of appropriations for this pr ogram was extended through fy2011 further congress has authorized appropriations for rehab ilitation activities at several nonfederal dams while there is likely to be an increasing demand for such assistance there is currently federal policy that describe s the conditions under which federal funding is appropriate nor has congre ss established criteria for prioritizing funding among nonfederal projects
