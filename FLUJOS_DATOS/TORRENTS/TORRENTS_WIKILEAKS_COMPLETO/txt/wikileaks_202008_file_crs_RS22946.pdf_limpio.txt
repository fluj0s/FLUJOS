than 1 trillion see table 1 the agency is responsible for the safety of most foods human and animal and cosme tics and it regulates both the safety and the effectiveness of human drugs biologics eg vaccines blood and blood components medical devices and animal drugs in many cases its respons ibilities abut those of other agencies see table 1 in such cases interagency agreemen ts may define the regulatory boundaries the primary law authorizing fda activities is the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca 21 usc chapter 9 see table 2 fda is also responsible for implementing provisions in other laws most notably the public health service act phsa 42 usc chapter 6a for example fdas authority to regulate most human biologics flows both from the phsa 351 and from the ffdca see table 2 fda

to give people access to useful pr oducts while protecting them from unsafe ones creating too many regulatory requirements raises costs and prevents products from reaching consumers creating too few places consumers at risk1 the 110th congress placed new focus on fda s regulatory responsibilities passing the most comprehensive fda reform legisla tion in almost decade the food and

clinical trials reporting and publication by erin d williamsadministration amendments act of 2007 fdaaa pl 110852 fdaaa reauthorized four expiring programs and expanded the agen cys authority to regulate the safety of prescription drugs and biologics medical devices and foods in the wake of that legislation issues remain both in areas th at fdaaa did not comprehensively address and in areas raised by its implementation the following is an introduction to the types of issues that congress now faces with respect to fda for further assistance with any fdarelated issue see table 3 at the end of the report for list of crs experts budget the primary budgetrelated question f aced by congress is how to fund the agency sufficiently for it to carry out its responsibilities while also funding competing national needs and ensuring that the agency operates costeffectively3 some secondary budgetrelated questions center on user fees4 they ask to what extent fda should be funded by money from the industries it regu lates and for which activities such funds should be collected and used eg premar ket review inspection and enforcement premarket approval before fda will permit drugs devices and biological products to be marketed in the united states the agency requires evidence that they are safe and effective only limite d types of food ingredients require premarket approval premarket approval processe s vary by product type5 most processes rely on evidence from clinical trials the topic of clinical tr ials raises questions of when it is appropriate to test new products on people particularly on children and in what circumstances it is appropriate to publicize the trials and their results6 the approval process for new products can take time while this may be of little consequence for people with ma nageable conditions special issues arise for people with lifethreatening diseases or conditions for which there is current treatment as

approval process7 products on the market fda is responsible for suring the safety of products it regulates including foods once they ar on the market it accomplishes this goal through product tracking inspection and enfor cement some attention has been focused on the fact that the agency has different enforcement aut horities for product types for example fda has mandatory recall authority for medical devices nd infant formula but not for other foods or for prescription drugs8 questions have also arisen regarding whether marketing with fda approval should preempt certain tort claims9 fdas role dovetails with pr oduct safety issues that cut across numerous agencies creating the need for interagency coordination10 for products such as tobacco and genetic tests the current patchwork of regulation or lack thereof has led to calls for comprehensive fda oversight11 in areas of shared responsibility such as product importation and advertising fdas role nd its ability or willingness to use agency resources to fulfil its res ponsibilities has caused concern12 food safety as noted above there is pr emarket approval for foods or most food ingredients fdas statutory authority nd historical approach are reactive focused on foods or ingredients that are found to be unsafe13 many policy makers seek more preventive approach and debate how to craf t such system proposals include having fda inspect processes instead of products set performance measures or increase industrys burden to assure sa fety successful approach may take into account the variety of foods fda regulates growin g stream of imported foods limited global food tracking systems and the agencys finite resources advisory committees in its vetting of the numer ous products it regulates fda relies on
