policy makers are becomin g aware that national program of carbon capture and sequestrati on could require an extens ive new network of carbon related infrastructure carbon capture and sequestration ccs is threepart process involving carbon dioxide co2 source facility co2 pipelines and permanent co2 sequestration site key c onsideration in the developm ent of such infrastructure is community acceptance which may ultimate ly determine whether where and how anticipated ccs projects may be built lthough the general public is still largely unfamiliar with ccs there are early indi cations that community acceptance may prove significant challenge to the siting of ccs infrastructure in the united states recent federal statutes and legi slative proposals related to co2 control have only obliquely addressed public acceptance of co2 infrastructure or related siting issues the energy independence and s ecurity act of 2007 pl 110140 requires report recommending procedures for pub lic review and comme nt and protection of the quality of natural and cultural resources related to the siting of sequestration projects on public land the liebermanwa rner climate security act of 2008 s 3036 would require ccs c onstruction feasibility study examining any barrier or potential barrier including any technical s iting financing or regulatory barrier relating to the development of co2 pipelines or geological sequestration sites for ccs the carbon capture and storage technology act of 2007 s 2323 would fund ccs demonstration project s in locations that repre sent range of population densities and are in close proximity to utilities and i ndustrial settings community acceptance studies in the united states and other developed countries are limited and based largely on hypothetical ccs scenarios and infrastructure choices the research available suggests that the public is ambivalent towards ccs at the policy level this ambivalence may cause concern among legislators seeking to promote carbon control strategies that could impose significant costs on local communities or the us econom overall at the project level this ambivalence may become outright opposition as community residents incorporate local considerations in their eval uation of proposed ccs development if carbon control and associated ccs policies were narrowly targeted or expected to have only marginal impacts on the us energy sector congress might choose to defer consideration of community acceptance issues until ccs technologies were more matu re and states had more time to work out ccs siting problems but understanding public accepta nce of ccs takes on greater urgency in light of proposals to curb co2 emissions quickly and the scale of ccs infrastructure required to do so the most prominent co2 proposals in the 110th congress seek reductions of nationwide co2 emissions to 1990 levels or lower by 2030 given such goals for reducing us emissions of co2 and the potential contribution of ccs to reaching them the issue of community acceptance of ccs infrastructure may prove challenging httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34601contents introduction 1 background 2 public acceptance

infrastructure siting challenges introduction congress is considering po licies to reduce us emissions of carbon dioxide major contributor to global warming these policies include promoting the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide co2 from manmade sources such as electric power plants and manufactur ing facilities carbon captu re and sequestration ccs is threepart process involving co2 source facility an intermediate mode of co2 transportation pipelines and permanent co2 sequestration site ccs is of great interest because emerging technologies may be able to remove up to 95 of co2 emitted from an electric power plant or other industrial source power plants are the most likely initial candidates for ccs b ecause they are predominantly large singlepoint sources and they contribut approximately onethird of us co2 emissions from fossil fuels as us carbon policies evolve cong ressional policy makers are becoming aware that national ccs program could require an extensive new network of co2 related infrastructure in the 110th congress there has been considerable debate and legislative activity related to the technical economic and regulatory aspects of such infrastructure another key considerati on however is public acceptance which may ultimately determine whether where and how anticipated ccs projects may be constructed although the ge neral public is still largel unfamiliar with ccs there are early indications that similar to the siting of other kinds of energy and industrial infrastructure community accepta nce may prove significant challenge to the siting of ccs infrastructure in the united states recent federal statutes and legi slative proposals related to co2 control have only obliquely addressed public acceptance of co2 infrastructure or related siting issues one provision in the energy i ndependence and secur ity act of 2007 pl 110140 for example requires report recommending procedures for public review and comment and protection of the quality of natural and cultural resources related to the siting of sequestration projects on public land sec 714b3 the liebermanwarner clima security act of 2008 s 3036 would require ccs

community acceptance issues related to selected alternatives to ccs policies such as investment in renewable energy infra structure and nuclear power the report introduces key ccs policy cons iderations as congress continues to evaluate opportunities and re quirements for carbon control background public acceptance has long posed challenges to energy infrastructure development in the united states lack of public acceptance is often cited for example as one reason why oil refineri have been constructed in the united states since 1976 and nuclear power plants have been ordered since 19732 in 2001 representative of the national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc testified before congress that the main impediment to siting energy infrastructure is the great difficulty getting public acceptance for needed facilities3 likewise the national commission on energy policy ncep stated in its 2006 report that energyfacility siting is major crosscutting challenge for us energy policy largely because of public opposition to new energy projects and other major infrastructure4 in 2008 public acceptance remains an overriding concern in proposals by energy companies to site electric power trans mission lines liquefied natural gas lng terminals natural ga s pipelines wind farms and other energy facilities in many pa rts of the

building public acceptability for carbon capture and sequestration world resources institute october 2007 2faced with substantial public opposition many energy infrastructure projects viewed by policy makers to be in the national interest ve been cancelled by developers or have failed to win state or local siting approval reacting to such failures over the years congress has occasi onally enacted statutes intended to help developers overcome community opposition to energy projects in 1947 for example congress amended the natural gas act pl 75688 to grant federal eminent domain authority to interstate natural gas pipeline developers seeking to secure rights of way from unwilling landowne rs 15 usc 717fh the trans alaska pipeline authorization act of 1973 pl 93153 stopped regulatory and legal challenges to the transalaska pi peline project brought by environmental native american and community opponents the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 streamlined the federal licensing process for new nuclear power plants in part to ensure that community siting concerns would be addressed prior to plant construction sec 2801 2802 most recen tly congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 which increased fe deral authority to approve interstate electric transmission projects sec 1221 and granted federal regulators exclusive authority to approve the siting of onshore lng terminals sec 311 notwithstanding federal siting legisla tion community stakeholders retain many statutory and regulatory avenues to affect energy infrastructure siting decisions these include public input to state per mitting under federal statutes such as the coastal zone management act of 1972 16 usc 1451 et seq the clean air act 42 usc 7401 et seq and the federal water pollution control act 33 usc 251 et seq among others community groups also have role in siting reviews such as those in pl 10958 which require fe deral regulators to consult with governordesignated state agencies regarding state and local safety considerations prior to issuing lng terminal permits s ec 311d local zoning and land use regulations in particular have been widely used by communities to influence or block energy infrastructure development5 since public acceptance has influenced the development of virtually every category of us energy infrastructure it is logical to consider how the public may view future infrastructure specifically associated with ccs as one analyst has stated there is good reason to be concerned over public perception of ccs lack of information will prevent balanced evaluation of its costs and benefits it may also create exaggerated perceptions of risk which can delay or stop implementation of this new technology6 consideration of this issue can be divide d into two separate but related dimensions public acceptance of ccs as an overall na tional policy and public or community acceptance of specific ccs facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34601crs4 7 jf palmer

that determines whether community stakeholders accept new energy technology is whether they view it as consistent with broad policy objectives they support for example residents of searsburg vt have supported local wind farm development primarily because they believe wind power does not pollute the environment7 community groups oppose proposed coal gasification power plant in edwardsport in because they prefer investments in electricity conservation and renewable energy sources8 other community groups oppose proposed lng terminal off the southern california coast in part because they believe it would increase us dependence on foreign energy supplies9 in such cases the nature of the proposed tec hnology from br oad policy perspective has been separate consideration from its particular location or operational characteristics although the 110th congress has been debating the need for carbon control studies in the united states and other veloped countries cons idering ccs policies shows that the vast majority of the public is not aware of carbon capture and sequestration and even fewer underst and the technology and its risks10 consequently research on public acceptan ce of ccs is limited and based largely on hypothetical scenarios and infrastructure c hoices nonetheless policy researchers have begun to identify likel attitudes among members of the public who learn about ccs technology their findings are mixe d 2007 study in australia found that although most people believe it is very important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at national level many are neutral towards ccs as strategy to do so this study found that approximately 40 of the public believes ccs would be quick fix that would not solve the greenhouse gas problem11 2007 study in france

co2 emissions including new nuclear power plants15 2004 study in the united kingdom found slight support for ccs in concept but also belief that as standalone policy ccs might delay more farreaching and necessary longterm changes in societys use of energy16 other researchers report similarly mixed findings although speci fic study methodologies differ so it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from the overall body of research to date17 public acceptance of ccs policies is co mplicated by public views of climate change as global phenomenon notwithst anding recent science studies and public information campaigns about the effect s of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change parts of both the science comm unity and the general population reject arguments that global warming is pr oblem requiring greenhouse gas mitigation18 for example 2006 survey by mit found that only 61 of the us public believed action should be taken to address global warming19 another national survey in may 2008

about the primary cause of global warming have remained stable in recent years21 taken together the studies above suggest that the public is ambivalent towards ccs as an overall carbon control technology at the policy level this ambivalence may cause concern among legislators seek ing to promote carbon control strategies that could impose significant costs on local communities or the us economy overall at the project level this ambivalence may become outright opposition as community residents incorporate local c onsiderations in their evaluation of proposed ccs development to the exte nt that members of the public reject assertions that human activity is responsible for rise in global temperature or that such rise requires intervention by th united states policy makers may face difficulty convincing communities that ccs is necessary to begin with project specific considerations are further discussed in the following section community acceptance of ccs infrastructure another factor influencing how public stakeholders may view an energy facility is their assessment of its potential negative community impacts eg property values environmental effects safety balanced against local benefits eg jobs tax revenues22 in the case of ccs three main cat egories of facility may be involved power plants with co2 capture technology transportation pipelines and underground sequestration sites although it is nece ssary to integrate these three types of infrastructure to implement ccs they are physically distinct and so present different challenges related to s iting and community acceptance unfortunately there is almost publicly available research about community ttitudes towards these three infrastructure categories specifically in the context of ccs policy makers must therefore draw inferences about ccs infrastructure from experience with similar infrastructure in applications analogous to ccs while not perfect comparisons these analogies may offer valuable insights into the potential reactions of affected communities to the siting of ccs facilities power plants with co2 controls community acceptance of electric power plants has been concern of policy

to new power plant proposals has evolved since the n along with federal state and local policy approaches to addre ss them detailing these approaches is beyond the scope of this report but they have met with only limited success power plant projects particularly coalfired projects throughout the united states continue to struggle for siting approval in part because communitie s where they would be located often do not want them24 if the public views co2 capturecapable power plants in the same way it has conventional power plants in the past it seems likely that the former will face the same sorts of community acceptance barriers as the latter and for many of the same reasons the fact that ccs power plants are intended to be cleaner may not matter as the national commission on ergy policy points out new technology alone will not alleviate siting problems25 indications to date suggest that this is likely to be the case for example one prominent community group in minnesota opposes the proposed mesaba coal gasificati on power plant which is intended to be co2 captureready because the group be lieves the facility would degrade recreational lake country would pollute air nd water would require environmentally harmful coal mining woul d be subsidized with public funds and would force private landowners to accept ssociated network infrastructure ie electric transmission lines railroad connections pipelines and roads26 whether these objections are justified or not they ar the same types of objections often raised against conventional coalfired power plants in addition to traditional considerations the siting of power plants and co2 capture facilitie s under ccs scheme may f ace new concerns stemming from changes in the physical configuration of pow er plants or the processes they employ to make carbon capture possible while the ul timate characteristics of car bon controlled power plants have yet to be determined becau the capture technologies are still in development new sitingrelated concerns are already apparent plant site area power plants incorporating carbon capture may require significantly larger site area than conve ntional plant to accommodate the additional process facilities associated with co2 capture such facilities could include co2 compressors scrubbers oxygen produc tion plants or other carbon

ibidequipment27 depending upon the capture technology employed the site area required for the capture equipment may approach the size of the site area of the power generating plant itself28 this larger site requirement is particularly important consideration for existing power plants mit researchers conclude that additional space requirements for the co2 recovery and compression systems may cause difficulties for existing plants that do not have space readily available29 furthermore if net power production from the site must be maintaine d construction of additional generating capacity onsite could be necessary to offset power losses in the capture process30 power plant sites have expa nded successfully in the past for example to add sulfur oxide sox control equipment scr ubbers nonetheless to the extent an existing power plant would need to expand into adjacent communities or natural areas to add co2 equipment such expansions could face community resistance hazardous materials certain carbon capture technologies may use or produce hazardous materials in large qua ntities for example carbon capture demonstration project in pleasant prairie wi employs chilled ammonia to strip co2 from power plant combustion gases at full scale such process would require tons of ammonia which is listed as highl hazardous chemical under occupational safety and health admin istration osha regula tions 29 cfr 191011931 ammonia in quantities exceeding 100000 pounds in aqueous solution and therefore requiring risk management plan s to be filed with the environmental protection agency epa is already found in nearly 300 us power plants where it is widely used in selective catalytic reduction scr of nitrogen oxide nox emissions32 the pleasant prairie power plant itself has over million tons of ammonia in its nox control equipment unrelated to its co2 control demonstration equipment33 furthermore ammoniabased scr may be required for any new coal fired plants in order to meet federal cl ean air standards with or without carbon capture nonetheless perceived risks of an uncontrolled ammonia release from ammoniabased co2 capture facilities may increase

postcombustion co2 capture option may raise hazardous material cerns of different kind aminebased systems may generate wastes in process chemical reclaimers which are toxic to humans and the

hazardous wastes would need to be transported offs ite by truck or rail and disposed of in suitable hazardous waste disposal facil ities alt hough process wastes are also generated by existing sox and

chemicals transportation power plants employing ammonia amine or other potentially hazardous chemicals as inputs to or outputs from their carbon capture processes may require new or substantially expanded transportation facilities to move those chemicals these include product pipelines to get enormous volumes of ammonia h2s and other chemical solvents to the new pow er plants for carbon

of the most serious security concerns for the nation41 given these prominent and public concerns the siting of chemicals transportation infrastructure for carboncapture capable power plants may face potential oppos ition in communities where it is proposed co2 pipelines for ccs the energy industry has c onstructed nearly half million miles of oil and gas transmission pipeline across the united states since the early 20th century42 since the 1970s the industry has also operated limited co2 pipeline network in relatively remote areas of the western united states primarily to transport naturallyoccurring co2 for use in underground injection for enha nced oil recovery eor experiences with natural gas pipelines are relevant to ccs because natural gas pipelines are similar in design to co2 pipelines and therefore may be viewed in similar ways by the public with respect to siting furthermore unlike the existing co2 pipeline network natural gas pipelin are found throughout the country including densely populated regions where new co2 pipelines may be needed for ccs experiences with co2 pipelines in eor provide record of siting in unpopulated areas as well as statistics on network

according to the energy information administration eia nearly 1700 miles of natural gas pipeline in at least 50 separate projects were completed in the lower 48 states in 2007 primarily to serve new

requirements for co2 pipelines some analysts anticipate that co2 network for ccs will begin with relatively short pipelines from co2 sources located close to sequestration sites61 this development approach would place co2 capturecapable power plants for example directly atop the largest saline aquifers and would transmit electric power to distant urban centers such power plants would be conceptually similar to existing coalfired plants located directly adjacent to coal mines minemouth plants scattered throughout us coalproducing regions it is debatable whether co2 pipeline costs would generally outweigh ectricity transmission costs including capital operations maintenance and electric line losses in new construction62 nonetheless any ccs project requiring the construction of extensive new transmission infrastructure from remote to populated areas could face concerted community opposition to the siting of those transmission lines public challenges to electric transmission projects have long been considered among the most serious and most intractable challenges in the us energy sector63 such challenges continue to delay or prevent new tran smission development in so regions despite the provisions in pl 10958 intended to encour age the siting of new transmission lines carbon sequestration sites carbon sequestration sites ar similar in many ways to natural gas and oil production sites only operating in reverse rather than extracting an underground resource operators of questration sites inject co2 underground using technologies originally developed for the oil and ga s industries and adapted for longterm sequestration and monitoring of co2 as stated earlier in this report some oil fields already employ co2 injection to increase oil produc tion these injections are limited in scale and focused on the oil resource but they may achieve substantial levels of permanent co2 sequestration as byproduct of the oil production process key difference is that enhanced oil recovery removes and recycles injected co2 by design whereas ccs project deve loped strictly for carbon control would not other undergr ound injection applications in practice today such

acceptance is the acqui sition of property rights if an oil or natural gas deposit lies be neath private property deve lopers may need to lease mineral rights from hundreds or even t housands of landowners distributed across large geographic area in order to produce oil or gas from that deposit64 historically most private ndowners have been willing to lease their oil or natural gas rights in return for production roya lties as the american association of petroleum geologists has stated private lands have been largely explored and produced65 consequently some ccs proponents expect that private owners would be similarly inclined to lease pore sp ace under their property for the purposes of permanent carbon sequestration66 early indications however suggest that this may not generally be the case for example as the national commission on energy policy ncep states in its 2006 report public opposition remains inextricably intertwined with local concerns including environmental and ecosystem impacts as well as in some cases complex issues of property rights and competing land uses in some cases upstream or downstream infrastructure requirements such as the need for underground carbon sequestration sites may generate as much if not more opposition than the energy facilities they support67 as with other ccs infrastructure empirical research specifically about community attitudes toward s sequestration sites is limited the 2007 french study found that approximately 40 of survey s ubjects would be afraid if ccs was to be used near their community68 2007 survey of

united states i nvolving actual sequestration projects or related legislation have also demonstrated sign ificant public opposition in 1998 the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority abandoned an experiment to sequester co2 in the deep ocean in part due to strong public outcry against the project72 focus groups in 2007 in two ca lifornia communities where actual sequestration sites were

sign pore space contracts in part to ensure the development of the power plant complex in their comm unity which they believed would provide direct benefits to community members apart from sequestration payments76 due to these factors it is unclear whether the tuscola sequestration s ite acquisition would be representative of seque stration site development in commercial operations compulsory unitization oil and gas production reservoirs and other geologic formations into which co2 might be injected are typically continuous bodies of porous rock that extend beneath large geographic areas deep 1000 feet or more underground in addition to the i ssue of landowners willingness to lease sequestration rights devel opers must also be concerned about the physical configuration of the rights they must acquire the most economically efficient and least environmentally impactful way to produce oil from large natural deposit is to do so by means of single operator treating that deposit as geophysical whole rather than as artificially independent fragments delin eated by property boundaries where an oil deposit is spread out beneath multiple parcels of private land an energy company may therefore seek to acquire the rights to all or nearly all such parcels to form contiguous production unit th acquisition and development of deposit in this way is called unitiza tion and has been practiced in the oil industry since the 1940s77 unitization agreements are typically negotiated as private voluntarily agreements between an operator and multiple minerals rights owners78 however nearly all oil and natural gasproducing states also have compulsory unitization laws requiring unwilling landowners to join pr oduction unit if sufficient percentage of other potential unit members voluntarily do so79 the minimum percentage required may range from 51 to 80 of unit pr operty owners depending upon the state80 compulsory unitization laws facilitate the

oil and gas industry experience with com pulsory unitization is important in the ccs context because analysts anticipate that similar unitization process will need to be developed prior to largescale injection of co2 for sequestration in geological formations83 an interstate oil and gas compact commission task force examined this issue in proposing model ccs regulations in 2007 the task force concluded that control of the reservoir and associated pore space used for co2 storage is necessary to allow for the orderly development of storage project the model general rules and regulations propose the required acquisition of these storage rights and contemplates use of state natural gas storage eminent domain powers or oil and gas unitization processes to gain control of the entire storage reservoir84 unitization requirement for co2 may stem from sequestration efficiency considerations co2 trespass concerns or the colocation of pore space and natural gas or oil trespass may be important because co2 injected underground could spread in unanticipated ways through ge ological formation with way to prevent its entering the pore space of any particular landowner located within that formation in locations where subset of relevant landowners is unwilling to lease its pore space for example disput about subterranean co2 trespass could hamper sequestration field development85 the presence of oil or gas may be important because it may require site to be developed in compliance with longstanding mineral statutes including mineral resource unitization statutes along with co2

projects as minority interests could refuse to ratify unitization orders making operation of the unit as sequestration fi eld difficult nonunitized interests may have available to them legal remedies such as nuisance and trespass actions for any provable interference with their mineral production86 further challenge associated with unitization requirement for co2 sequestration sites is the app licability of state co mpulsory unitization statutes to ccs because such statutes typically have been enacted specifically for oil and natural gas extraction it is unclear to what ex tent they could be applied to co2 injection into formations not associated with oil or natura l gas such as deep saline aquifers for example new mexicos oil and gas statutes cover the production of natural gas or gas defined as any combustible va composed chiefly of hydrocarbons occurring naturally in pool87 this definition would not seem to apply to co2 accordingly new mexico regulators have concluded that there exists clear authority for the state to regulate anthropogenic co2 injection for sequestration purposes alone nor does it have general authority to regulate injectionsequestration of co2 into reservoirs other than those that produce oil and gas88 by comparison west virginias statutes pply to natural gas and all other fluid hydrocarbons not defined as oil without defining natural gas in way which clearly excludes co289 the states unitization statute applies to pool defined as an underground accumulation of petroleum or gas in single nd separate natural reservoir90 the statute appears am biguous as to whether co2 is covered gas and whether sequestration site is natur reservoir in states without any unitization statutes or where existing unitization statues do not clearly apply to co2 community opponents of sequestration project s may therefore litigate to prevent the voluntary or compulsory unitization of pore space rights necessary for site development eminent domain for natural gas storage another potential analog to co2 sequestration is underground na tural gas storage used by the natural gas industry to manage seasonal variations in natura l gas demand most natural gas

domain authority resides with the federal energy regulatory commission which approves the siting of natu ral gas storage facilities under section 7 of th natural gas act94 some analysts have proposed

significant issues of fairness and process even in cases wh ere property owners come to terms with developers the community as whole or other individuals may suffer uncompensated and persistent

statutes in its support unless federal siting authorities are significantly expanded see section on federal siting authority below although many state policy makers have indicated willingness to

ccs concepts and analogies may indeed be enough to win community support for ccs pr ojects officials in tuscola il for example have credited the midwest geol ogic sequestration c onsortiums extensive public outreach efforts with securing co mmunity support for the proposed futuregen ccs project including power plant pipeline and sequestration sites107 in other cases however some argue that the best way to facilitate br oad public acceptance of ccs projects may be to prove their sa fety through nearterm demonstration projects108 this appears to be key motivation for the does rcsp initiative nonetheless according to some research even successful technology demonstration projects may not completely alleviate community concerns about the potential negative impacts of ccs whether focused on risks to the environment public health property values or other impacts scientific assessments of potential risks and impacts are often challenged by lack of trust in both the data and the institutions that develop them distrust of regulators lack of c onfidence in experts and the possibility of accidents caused by human error all contri bute to high level of public concern even in light of low levels of assessed risk109 consequently even given the history of safe co2 injection for enhanced oil recovery and even with successful rcsp or other demonstrations some segments of the public may remain skeptical and unsupportive of ccs infrastructure development in their communities furthermore focus on technology demonstrations to win public approval carries significant risks if th these demonstrations do not perform as expected an mit report assessing analog s to ccs infrastructure concluded that significant problems in the early years of technologys development affected public perceptions and produced regulatory regimes and political battles that took decades to reform or resolve110 as federal ccs policies c ontinue to develop congre ss may seek to identify range of options to influence community attitudes toward ccs infrastructure congress may ensure that the positive opera tional experiences of federally supported ccs demonstrations are communicated transparently and effectively to public audiences beyond scientific and regulatory stakeholde rs congress may seek to establish structured initiatives for public outreach beyond technology

economic and geographic differences among communities near potential ccs infrastructure sites as part of this effort congress may explore potential partnerships with state or local agencies that have relevant siting responsibilities and establis hed relationships with potential ccs community members congress may also seek to ev aluate how public ducation and community outreach may affect the timing scale and chances of success for future commercial ccs proposals federal siting authority for ccs if congress takes action on co2 reduction and if states are not able to site ccs infrastructure in accord with those fede ral carbon control policie s congress may find itself facing proposals to strengthen fede ral siting authorities for ccs as indicated earlier in this report there are existing models of federal siting authority for energy infrastructure offering congress ra nge of options to consider for co2 infrastructure the telecommunications transportation and waste disposal industries offer additional models for some ccs in frastructure projects such as co2 pipelines existing analogies suggest fairly clear dir ections for federal role other types of ccs projects may require innovative approach it is beyond the scope of this report to examine the applicability of any existing federal siting models to ccs but they are source of both legal precedent nd siting experience which may be helpful in identifying promising approaches to spur ccs deployment additional policy tools to encourage siting such as fede ral economic incentives for communities with ccs projects may also warrant evaluation apart from the details of potential federal siting authority for ccs projects general policy question concerns when congress may need to consider the need for such federal authority in the case of lng infrastructure congress legislated the exclusive federal lng siting authority in pl 10958 approximately three years after the hackberry lng terminal siting application the first such application in 25 years by which time it was already apparent that community and state opposition would create significant barriers to national resurgence in lng terminal development111 by contrast congress has not enacted broad federal siting authority for interstate oil pipelines although the fe deral government does regulate the rates and operations of oil pipelines in the specific context of siting authority for ccs infrastructure the need for federal involvement ma be driven fundamentally by congressional expectations for infrastructure deployment as the ferc ch airman testified before congress in 2008 with regard to pipelines looking at what congress did on gas pipe line siting it started off with state siting and at some point it failed in the views of congress they concluded state siting had failed and then congress came in and changed the law exclusive and federal preemptive siting wa s the rule the state siting has worked for co2 pipelines up to this point but the network is much smaller than the oil and gas pipeline networks so it really re lates to if this is the path the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34601crs26 112 the honorable joseph t

pipeline network are we going to need and how quickly are we going to need it112 given the legal and regulatory complexities and taking into consideration public ambivalence toward ccs projects at least some states are likely to struggle with the details of state ccs siting authority congress may therefore seek to understand how public acceptance may in fluence the nature and timing of ccs infrastructure regulation by the states and whether state siting efforts are likely to satisfy possible congressional objectives in terms of ccs scale and scope if it appears that state efforts are unlikely to do so then congress may examine the possibility of stronger federal role in ccs siting approval such policy could be controversial however and still might not guarantee success for ccs infrastructure siting as demonstrated by the challenges f aced in interstate natu ral gas pipeline siting which has been under federal jurisdiction for over 60 years as naruc official has stated matter where sitin g responsibility falls with state government or the federal government siting energy infrastructure will not be easy and there will be quick fix to this situation113 siting challenges for ccs alternatives if public acceptance becomes significant barrier to ccs infrastructure congress may consider promoting more ggressively other energy sources such as solar wind geothermal and nuclear power to meet future energy needs within the confines of co2 emissions limits research has shown that parts of the general public may prefer some of these power generation options over ccs projects nonetheless these other energy sources may still face public acceptance barriers of their own although the number of renewa ble energy projects successfully sited in the united states has grown significantly some proposals have been delayed or abandoned because local commun ities have rejected them114 the cape wind project off cape cod ma is nationally prominen t example of such project which faces concerted community opposition and related litigati on nearly eight years after it was proposed and has yet to receive siting approval115 nuclear power plants likewise face community opposition the national commission on energy policy has stated that electricity generating technology is likely to face more formidable challenges to the siting of new facilities than nuclear power116 although solar power plants appear to face less community opposition than other types of renewable power plants community groups have fought against th electric

projects may differ they presen t interrelated challe nges and opportunities with respect to siting and public accepta nce indeed the 2004 carnegie mellon university study suggests that the us public may exhibit strong desire to frame decisions about ccs in the context of other carbon control strategies such as developing renewable energy resour ces or investing in nuclear power118 consequently it may be c onstructive for congressional policy makers to consider ccs siting as part of broader integrated policy debate including the siting of other energy technologies which may help to satisfy national co2 management objectives it follows that federal siting policies pursued for ccs infrastructure may have implications for the siting of other energy infrastructure community acceptance of ccs in perspective some analysts assert that community opposition to ccs siting may be the single most important considerati on in carbon control policy the gravest threat the overriding issue or potential show stopper119 while drawing needed attention to the issue such pronouncements are perhap s too extreme first while promoting ccs as potentially important means by which to reduce us greenhouse gas emissions it is only one of several policy measures with the potential to do so congress is also considering policies to promote energy conservation renewable energy nuclear power and hydrogen fuel any of which could also yield major reductions in co2 emissions second while the community acceptance barriers to energy infrastructure in the united states ar significant they are also complex and not really amenable to show stopper char acterizations the more likely reality is that new ccs infrastructure projects if they are ultimately constructed will be distributed on continuum of public accepta bility along with other types of energy and industrial infrastructure projects the key question for congress is not whether communities will accept ccs project siting at all but where and to what degree relative to other energy infrastructure options so far there is little research or ccs project experience in the united states offering specific insight into these questionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34601crs28 120 world resources institute comparison of legislative climate change targets washington dc june 18 2008 3 121 dm reiner and hj herzog developing set of regulatory analogs for carbon sequestration energy vol 29 nos910 2004 15611570 from comprehensive national perspective consequently legislators must rely on siting analogies and their own judgment to develop policy perspectives on community acceptance and ccs infrastructure needs if carbon control and associated ccs policies were narrowly targeted or expected to have only marginal impacts on the us energy sector congress might choose to defer consideration of community acceptance issues until ccs technologies were more matu re and states had more time to work out ccs siting problems but understanding public acceptan ce of ccs may take on greater urgency in light of proposals to curb co2 emissions quickly the most prominent co2 proposals in the 110th congress seek reductions of nationwide co2 emissions to 1990 levels or lower by 2030120 some expect ccs along w ith conservation renewables and other energy alternatives to make significant contribution to meeting these goals even with complete public s upport however it would be challenge to commercialize carbon capture technology tablish comprehensive ccs standards and regulations design nd finance ccs projects s ecure numerous regulatory approvals and physically cons truct ccs network of sufficient size to meet such co2 emissions reductions targets co mmunity opposition could complicate and delay each element of ccs implementation potentially adding years to national ccs deployment alternatively commun ity concerns could lead to national patchwork of ccs projects constructed only in publicly acceptable geographies or on public lands creating in terregional disparities and fa iling to meet congressional objectives if congress sets goals for reducing us emissions of co2 the potential influence of public acceptance on reaching them suggest that more proactive approach to addressing the latter might be in order an advantage of being in the early stages of ccs policy formation is that congress may have the opport unity to manage public acceptance issues before they become intractable while community opposition is frequent impediment to siting it is not insurmountable strategies that offer concrete benefits or promote trust in affected communities and that remove legitimate arguments as camouflage for selfinterest can overcome public goods problems committing to compensation openness information sharing monitori ng and enforcement can help diffuse legitimate grievances this strategy will add to the costs and lead to delays but so too will permitting process where the public feels disenfranchised121 as congress considers co2 policies going forward it may find significant benefits in fully understanding the role of comm unities in the implementation of those policies although efforts to do so may requi re added resources nd attention in the near term they may be preferable to waiting for siting failures as some have suggested and expending far greater effort to address them at later time
