darnall steuart for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary plainspoken nuclear physicist told econoff that those spreading rumors that venezuela is helping third countries ie iran develop atomic bombs are full of expletive he said venezuela is currently unable to provide such assistance particularly as the chavez administration does not trust scientists he added that venezuelas nuclear cooperation agreement with russia finalized may 4 is pure political theater as venezuela is incapable of cooperation with russia on the development design construction and operation of nuclear reactors also contrary to the agreement with the russians to the knowledge of the scientific community there is exploration or exploitation of uranium ongoing or planned in venezuela the scientist contended that even if the venezuelan government used all cuban scientists exploring for commercially viable uranium deposits in venezuela would require large taskforce and news of such an effort would leak quickly end summary russian nuclear agreement political theater 2 c xxxxxxxxxxxx told econoff june 3 that the agreement between venezuela and russia on nuclear cooperation has real substance the agreement signed by the ministry of foreign affairs in november 2008 but approved and formally issued by venezuelas national assembly may 4 lays out cooperation between the venezuelan ministry of energy and petroleum and russias rosatom in the following areas 1 basic nuclear research 2 controlled thermonuclear synthesis 3 development design construction and operation of nuclear reactors 4 industrial production of inputs and components for nuclear reactors 5 exploration and exploitation of uranium and thorium 6 infrastructure development for nuclear energy and 7 the development of legal framework in the sector 3 c in previous conversation with xxxxxxxxxxxx strictly protect throughout on december 2 xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that the only part of the russian agreement that had any potential might be the exploration and exploitation of thorium as he believes venezuela has significant deposits of that resource ref xxxxxxxxxxxx emphasized that as to the rest of the agreement meaningful cooperation is not possible all venezuela is currently capable of he argued is the purchase of finished materials and technology uranium exploration and exploitation not happening 4 c xxxxxxxxxxxx bluntly discounted the idea of cooperation with the russians on uranium exploration and exploitation as well as rumors that venezuela is providing venezuelan uranium to assist other countries ie iran with atomic bombs note international press reports citing an israeli foreign affairs ministry document leaked may 25 alleged that bolivia and venezuela are supplying uranium to iran for similar perspective from paz on the dubiousness of this claim see ref b xxxxxxxxxxxx added that former venezuelan president of the interamerican commission on atomic energy julio cesar pinedas may 8 statements to the press about venezuela having more than 50000 tons of uranium were funny and not too clever 5 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said that in the states of merida and trujillo there might be uranium deposits ranging between 60 parts per million ppm and 2000 ppm with 200 ppm being the minimum for an economically viable deposit he contended that one could be sure however since the last meaningful study caracas 00000728 002 of 002 concluded in 1976 he noted that his lab has conducted yellow cake experiment with few milligrams of venezuelan uranium but that it is impossible to extrapolate or even guess at the amount of uranium in venezuela from such limited testing 6 c xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that currently as with all nuclear related materials if venezuela had need for refined uranium it would make much more economic sense to simply buy it rather than try to produce it itself for political reasons however the government could decide to refine uranium anyway xxxxxxxxxxxx suggested he claimed that venezuelan scientists would be involved in such decision as the chavez administration does not trust scientists nevertheless he added there is indication of any interest on the part of the government to resume uranium exploration or exploitation 7 c xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the last uranium exploration effort involved multiple labs and more than 30 scientists such major undertaking would not be easy to hide for long he said even if the government avoided using venezuelan scientists and opted instead for 100 percent foreign team consisting primarily of cuban members additionally there are only three labs in venezuela that could measure whether or not uranium concentrations are high enough to exploit all three labs including the one at usb xxxxxxxxxxxx reluctantly admitted either have broken equipment or nitrogen none of the three he said could currently participate in such study comment 8 c although rumors that venezuela is providing iran with venezuelan produced uranium may help burnish the governments revolutionary credentials there seems to be little basis in reality to the claims similar to the conclusions drawn by paz in ref b it is highly unlikely that venezuela is providing venezuelan uranium to third countries at one point venezuela may have been able to make good on chavezs claims that it would purchase multibillion dollar nuclear power plants from the russians but even that type of nuclear cooperation is doubtful due to the venezuelan governments current financial difficulties caulfield
