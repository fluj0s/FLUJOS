although many observers expected ilkham aliyev to be elected president the outcome was in some doubt and the race appeared set to be lively contest for power most polls showed ilkham aliyev in the lead but some indicated major public support for gambar while the issue of stability was fundamental to most of the electorate and may have inclined them to endorse ilkham aliyev other major campaign issues included the status of nk and poor living standards ilkham aliyev stressed that the catastrophe of the civil unrest of the early 1990s might return if he was not elected he promised to create new jobs and otherwise improve living conditions and to resolve the nk conflict peacefully gambar pledged to increase democratization combat corruption and boost government wages pensions and scholarships mammedov promised to alter the constitution to reduce presidential power and to boost military spending to intimidate armenia and lead to settlement hasanguliyev criticized the other

secretarygeneral walter schwimmer and parliamentary assembly chairman peter schieder issued joint statement on october 20 criticizing excessive police force against protesters and government suppression of opposition media and warning that these incidents have deepened our concerns about azerbaijans willingness to respect coe standards the azerbaijani government argued that it was necessarily responding to rioting that endangered life and property implications for azerbaijan ilkham aliyevs backers hailed the results as reflecting overwhelming support for the stewardship of the aliyev family and scant support for the opposition party candidates lending this view some credibility are suggestions that ilkham aliyev drew backing from substantial portion of the population who work in public sector jobs or otherwise are dependent or politically linked to the aliyev family he also may have drawn support from some rural areas where living standards are improving slightly and from employees and pensioners whose payments were recently boosted by the government the high ostensible electoral support for ilkham aliyev also may have reflected voter endorsement of his main campaign theme that political and economic stability and peaceful resolution of the nk conflict would be jeopardized if the opposition won crs4 ilkham aliyevs supporters argue that he brings important skills to his new post that will benefit the country including experience in the major energy sector political acumen as legislator and first deputy head of the ruling party and familiarity with world leaders they also state that he belongs to younger generation he is 41 that is not oriented to past soviet style of rule and can embrace democratization and economic reforms fbis aug 8 doc cep40 his backers claim that ilkham aliyev displayed restraint in the face of the october 16 protests since police reportedly relied on nonlethal methods to suppress protests resulting in very few deaths but dozens of injuries and that the subsequent arrests of instigators were justified to prevent further insurrection those who take more pessimistic view of developments in azerbaijan argue that the vote and the violent aftermath further set back democratic progress in country where developing civil society seemed ready for more pluralism the political polarization evident before the election has increased since with the government and the opposition labeling each other incorrigible rather than cooperating in nationbuilding ilkham aliyevs campaign remarks that the opposition would never be allowed to win are indicative of this polarization some observers have warned that the governments apparent postelection crackdown on many opposition politicians and media may suggest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21661 that it might become more authoritarian under ilkham aliyevs rule rferl caucasus report oct 10 international federation of journalists oct 17 ilkham aliyev faces major challenges in implementing campaign pledges to remedy problems his father was unwilling or unable to solve his authority may not yet match that of his father so that he might not be able to deal with alleged growing disputes within the ruling elite that eventually could threaten his tenure world markets research center oct 16 ilkham aliyev also may face as much difficulty as his father in convincing the country to accept compromises to peacefully resolve the nk conflict his pledge to redistribute wealth to address social needs may well face opposition from entrenched interests also the patience of many in poverty may fray before major energy revenues become available after the completion in early 2005 of an oil pipeline to turkeys port of ceyhan in particular 550000 internally displaced persons idps continue to suffer from poor living conditions and unemployment ilkham aliyev maintains that conditions are beginning to improve for the idps who amount to about 7 of the population but some critics charge that the government is moving too slowly among the main problems faced by ilkham aliyev are corruption and poverty ilkham aliyevs promise to retain the existing structure of power may have comforted some corrupt officials and ensured their backing according to one viewpoint oxford analytica may 2 many in azerbaijan and the international financial community call for greater transparency and independent oversight of the state oil fund controlled by the president although islamic fundamentalism appears to be minuscule threat at present the protests by some islamic groups against the election results could indicate an emerging political force most western governments and international organizations had strongly urged azerbaijan to hold free and fair election and the failure could have repercussions on political ties and aid although many governments have indicated that they are ready to work with ilkham aliyev azerbaijans neighbors georgia and turkey transit states for azerbaijani oil and russia and iran quickly endorsed ilkham aliyevs win as promising stability armenias foreign minister also found reassuring the continuity of policy crs5 regarding nk promised by ilkham aliyev some oppositionists criticized western governments of being willing to overlook electoral irregularities because of the belief that dynastic transfer of power would ensure stability and the continuation of existing contracts with world energy firms implications for us interests us objectives in azerbaijan include cooperation in the war on terrorism the advancement of us energy security and progress in democratic and economic reforms the united states is interested in azerbaijans internal stability and peaceful approach to resolving the nk conflict congressional budget justification for fy2004 there are also suggestions that possible us military access could facilitate power projection in the caspian and black sea areas and the middle east the major candidates running in the race did not appear to fundamentally oppose these goals but us policymakers and others nonetheless remained concerned about azerbaijans political future and urged that the contest be free and fair and eschew warmongering the administrations interest in stability and cooperation with azerbaijan seemed apparent in president bushs letter of congratulations to ilkham aliyev when he became prime minister and his brief meeting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21661 with the azeri at the general assembly in september 2003 some in azerbaijan criticized these overtures as us endorsement of dynastic handover of power the administration response to the election appeared mixed perhaps reflecting the complexity of us interests or an evolution of views the state department on october 16 and 20 seemed to take mild stance regarding the election and its aftermath according to some observers it concurred with the findings of the oscecoe observers that the elections were orderly but marred by problems with voter lists coercion and other irregularities and it voiced concern over reports of violent clashes after the election it also averred that deputy secretary richard armitage had telephoned ilkham aliyev on october 17 to congratulate him on strong win and indicate that the united states desired close ties with azerbaijan on october 21 and 22 however the state department appeared to take more forceful stance by emphasizing deep disappointment with serious deficiencies in the election it also expressed extreme concern about post election violence by both police and civilians and politicallymotivated arrests and urged independent investigations of both electoral deficiencies and the violence nonetheless the state department spokesman stated that the united states did not view the deficiencies as discrediting ilkham aliyevs strong win and explained that we are strongly committed to promoting democracy at the same time we believe that weve got to stay engagedstate department press statement oct 21 2003 and press briefing oct 22 washington post oct 22 2003 p a28 in one view this us support for continued engagement with azerbaijan encourages it to democratize helps it bolster its sovereignty and independence and safeguards other us interests in this view policy of less engagement in response to the problematic election might harm us interests if azerbaijan becomes unstable moreover such problems in azerbaijan could exacerbate instability in the whole south caucasus region however many us policymakers and others question to what extent the united states should assist the ilkham aliyev government to maintain stability particularly if the government commits more human rights abuses these observers stress the harm of overly linking us interests to one leader particularly if the new president becomes more authoritarian rather than cultivating ties with other political figures and groups crs6 they warn that such links could eventually backfire if disaffected populace views the united states as supporting authoritarianism they stress that us efforts to bolster democratization worldwide including in nearby iraq could be set back if azerbaijans halting democratization is not addressed new york times oct 27 eurasia insight oct 17 among other possible implications some observers suggest that us interests in energy development in azerbaijan may be affected by delays in decisionmaking during ilkham aliyevs consolidation of power over the next few weeks or months some observers have been concerned that russia may be seeking undue influence with the new azeri leadership or that ilkham aliyev may seek greater support from russia in response to us criticism of the human rights record in azerbaijan some us commentators warn that azerbaijani support for the us war on terrorism including such actions as recently sending some troops to iraq could be harmed turkish daily news aug 8 eurasia insight aug 7
