background content of defense authorization and appropriations bills the annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for m ilitary activities of the department of defense dod including pay and benefits of military personnel operation and maintenance of weapons and facilities weapons procurement an d research and developmen t and for other purposes most of the funding in the bill is for programs administered by the department of defense though the bill als provides 1 relatively small unclassified amo unts for the central intelligence agency retirement fund and intelligence community management and 2 classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities administered by the cia and by othe r agencies as well as by dod several other app ropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities of dod and other agencies including the military construction appropriations bill which finances construction f military facilities and construct ion and operation of

annual defenserelated appropr iations congress also acts every year on national defense authorization bill in rec ent years the defense authorization has been an omnibus bill that considers funding in all of the appropriations measure s discusse d above the authorization bill addresses defense programs in almos t precisely the same vel of line item detail as the defenserelated appropriations bills differences between the authorization and appropriations measure s within each house generally concern only few programs as result congressional debate over major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization bill because the defense authorization and appropriations bills are so closely related this report discusses congressional action on both measures though it focuses on the progress of the appropriations process status the status of congressional action on fy1998 defense authorization an d appropriations bills is as follows house authorization on

13 17 14 sources house and senate budget committees deflators from dod comptroller the cuts in the defense budget over the past several years have been achieved mainly by reducing the s ize of the military force and by slowing the pace of weapons modernization active d uty military endstrength will decline from about 22 million in fy1987 to about 145 million by the end of fy1997 under administration plans reduction of about 33 the number of divisions in the army and marine corps ships in the navy and air wings in the air force have fallen accordingly under plans established by the quad rennial defense review released on may 19 the active dutyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs5 force will decline to about 136 million over the next few years 36 below th fy1987 level funding for weapons acquisition has declined even more steeply than the force structure the initial fy1998 budget requested 426 billion for weapon s procurement and 359 billion for research development test and evaluatio n rdte ad justed for inflation proposed procurement funding is 69 below the level in fy1985 and the total for procurement plus rd is down by 57 the level of procurement funding is matter of ongoing deb ate key goal of the quadrennial defense review is to increase procurement funding over the next several years mainly by reducing defense civilian personnel levels and transferring the savings t weapons acquisition by fy2001 the administration projects 60 billion fo r procuremen t and by fy2002 68 billion see table a2 in the appendix to reach these levels however depends on 1 achieving projected savings through reform s in defense business practices and 2 controlling the growth of operation an d maintenance expenses see below for further discussion key budget and policy issues debate over the level of defense spending has been resolved at least for th present by the white housecongressional budget agreement reached in may the budget agreement also resolves troubling technical issue concerning the balanc between defense budget authority and outlays in fy1998 substantial imbalanc between budget authority and outlays appears to remain in fy2002 however with the budget battle at least temporarily in abeyance the major issues w concern tradeoffs within the defense budget and implementation of longer ter m administration defense priorities in action on the fy1996 and fy1997 budgets congress added substantial amount s to administration defense requests the money went mainly to increase purchases of major weapons re quested by each of the military services congress had much s room to add to the fy1998 request however as result increased funding for some programs had to be off set by reductions in others this led to disputes both within congress and between congress and th administration over defense priorities missile defense b2 bomber procurement tactical aircraft procurement navy shipbuilding and department of energy nuclear weapons activities were among the programs that were the focus of debate related issue remains unresolved how congress will respond to proposals the administration made in the quadrennial defense review qdr review of defense strategy and force planning that the defen department released on may 19 the qdr proposed additional rounds of base closures and other reductions in defense infrastructure subst antial reductions in civilian personnel levels through outsourcing and other measures smaller reductions in active duty and reserve troop levels an d adjustments in numbe r of weapons programs without these changes the defense department says sufficient funding will not be available to finance needed weapons modernization over the next several yea rs congress has not been receptive to new round of base closures however in addition in the past congress has rejecte d proposals to privatize some sup port activities and cuts in force levels have also beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs6 contentious congressional action on these issues is critical test of the fate of the qdr finally number of other matters also arise every year in debate over defense legislation social is sues such as abortions in military hospitals gays in the military and sales of obscene materials on military bases have been contentious in recen t years this year d ebate focused on the role of women in the military combined sex training sexual harassm ent and the application of rules against adultery the use of military force abroad is often matter of contention and this year congress debated whether to set date for withdrawing us ground forces from bosnia defens burdensharing is often an issue and this year the debate was compounded by the issue of nato expansion finally matters affecting the quality of life in the military and benefits for military retirees and dependents often arise this year retirees an d military dependents were greatly concerned about trends in military health care and congress addressed the issue the following discussion 1 reviews action on overall funding levels for defense in the annual congressional budget resolution 2 discusses debate over majo r weapons programs and other defense priorities 3 highlights congressional action on aspects of the q dr and 4 identifies other issues that have been matters of debate budget resolution funding levels for defense the first stage in the congressional budget process each year is action on th annual congressional budget resolution the budget resoluti on sets ceilings on budget authorit and outlays for each major functional category of the budget includin g national defense budget function number 050 the budget resolution include s projections of funding for each budget function for the budget year and at least four more years this years resolution extends through fy2002 the target year fo r balancing the budget for the past two years annual budget resolutions have provided for substantial congressional additi ons to the administrations defense budget request including an increase of about 7 billion in budget auth ority for defense in the fy1996 budget and 112 billion in the fy1997 budget final congressional appropriations each yea r added about as much as the budget resolution recommended last year s congressional budget resolution passed in june of 1996 projected that congres s would add another 94 billion in budget authority to the amount that th administ ration was then projecting for fy1998 in preparing its fy1998 budge t request however the administration added substantially t the amount it had planned for national defense specifically the administration added 1 26 billion to th department of defense budget mainly to protect weapons procurement accounts 2 36 billion for department of energy defenserelated activities partly to provide advance funding for major capital projects and partly to privatize cleanup activities and 3 300 million for defenserelated activities of other agencies as result the difference between congress and the administration over th fy1998 defense budget was reduced to 29 billion in budget authority congressional budget office scoring of the admini stration request further eroded the difference to about 26 billion for future years t he june 1996 congressional budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs7 resolution proposed funding levels that were below those the administration wa s projecti ng in fy20002002 negotiations between the white house an d congressional leaders over plan to balance the budget by fy2002 ultimatel resolved the issue essentially by providing the higher of either congressional r administration budget authority numbers for defense for each year from fy199 8 through fy2002 table 2 compares the may 1997 budget agreement with earlie r administration and congressional budget plans the budge t agreement also resolves troubling technical issue that d concerned congressional defense committees as table 2 notes the budge t compromise provides 66 billion more in outlays for fy1998 than the administration had project ed and 30 billion more than congress estimated last year thi s eliminates severe mismatch between budget authority and outlays that arose when the congressional budget office cbo provided its estimates of outlays likely t result from the administrations r equest to explain when congress appropriates funds for defense or other discretionary programs it pr ovides budget authority which allows agenc ies to hire personnel or sign contracts for goods and services outlays however occur only when checks are actually issued for salaries or for progres s payments on contracts outlays in any given year resulting from new budge t authority and from budget authority provided in prior

estimated that approval of the administr ation program would entail defense outlays in fy1998 of 2650 billion 56 billion higher the budget compromise resolved the issue by providing 2660 billion in national defense outlays enough to accommodate cbo scoring with room for an additional 26 billion in budget authority the outlay problem has t disappeared however both cbo and the defense department now calculate that the budget compromise will lead to an imbalanc between budget authority and outlays in fy2002 cbo estimates outlay s 49 billion above the level in the budget resolution for fy2002 and dod s calculated gap of 56 billion this issue will have to be resolved in the future priorities within the defense budget for the past two years congress added substantial amounts to administration defense budget requests mainl to finance additional weapons purchases under the budget compromise however congress had only 26 billion to add to the request using cbo scoring in action on the d efense authorization and appropriations bills this led the congressional defense committees to reorder priorities within the defense budget substantially one source of funding for congressionally supported programs was n administration request to increase funding for department of energy doe weaponsrelated activ ities in its fy1998 request the administration proposed two major initi atives that substantially increased the amount of budget authority though not of outlays that it wanted for doe defense programs first the administration requested 15 billion to provide full funding in advance for major doe construction projects in the past do had paid for construction incrementally asking congress only to provide funds for progress payment s on contracts full funding would follow the method used to finance most department of defense projects second th administration requested 1 billion to provide advance funding for environmenta l cleanup projects for which it wants bids from private industry advance funding officials say would make the bi ds more attractive neither of these requests had any outlay implications in fy1998 hnsc turn ed down both requests freeing up budget authority for other defense programs this increased the amount available fo r congressional addons to more than 5 billion sasc also rejected th administrations new initiatives except for 215 million for cleanup privatization similar priorities were implied by the house appropriations committe allocation s to the subcommittees under sections 302b602b of the congressional budget act the hou allocated 2483 billion to the defense subcommittee which was 44 billion above the amount the administration had requested the senat appropriations committee in contrast allocated 2472 billion to the defens subcommittee the compromise reache d in the conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill provides 2477 billion for defense 38 billion above th administration requesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs9 with the additional money the congressional defen committees have been able to finance wide range of highpriority pr ograms highlights of congressional action include pay raises all of the defense bills provide for 28 military pay raise as the administration requested this is equal to the increase in the employmen t cost index eci hnsc also added requirement that future pay raise s equal the ec i current policy calls for federal pay raises to be onehal f percent below the eci the administration opposes the hnsc proposal to treat military

required and in may secretary of defense cohen sent letter t congressional defense committees requesting an increase of 474 million i n fy1998 for nmd programs the housepassed authorization bill

defense nmd programs 47 4 million above the initial request as cohen had asked in may the house bill also added selectively to theater missile defense tmd programs th largest increase was for the n avy theater wide program which congress has long favored the senate authorization provided the same amount for nmd and also increased navy theater wide funding major difference between the house and the s enate concerned the theater highaltitude area defense thaad program the house authorization added money to thaad which the administration had proposed slowing due to technical problems the senate authorization reduced thaad funding by 200 million below the administration request while cutting the fy1998 thaad budget sas c instructed dod to add 340 million to the program in fy19992000 thus sasc and hnsc both supported thaad but differ ed on the timing of funds in view of the programs technical difficulties the house appropriations bill differed from the authorization it reduced thaad funding by 56 million while the senate appropriation followed the authorization the conferenc agreement on the appropriatio ns bill reduced thaad funding for fy1998 byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs10 150 million and the authorization conference agreement follows suit see table a6 below for summary of congressiona l action on bmd programs the authorization bills

sasc in contrast approved the requested f18 amount but cut f22 funding subst antially citing concerns about development costs the senate appropriations bill also cut f22 funding the hous appropriations bill did not go along with the hnsc cut in the f18 but otherwise followed the authoriza tion in significant action on the floor the senate rejected n amendment to the authorization bill by senator feingold to require dod t report on which of the programs it would cancel if funds are not sufficient for all three the senate approved an amendment by senator bumpers however to cap the total cost of the f22 program at 43 billion and similar provision is included in the authorization confe rence report the house and senate also differed on procurement of current generation aircraft the house bills added funding for 3 unrequested f1 6 aircraft while the senate bills added funds for 3 additional f15s the appropriations conference report resolved the issues as follows it provides full funding as requested for 20 fa18ef aircraft which hnsc would cut it supported continued development of the f22 though as the house proposed 6 million is shifted from advanc procurement to rd it provided funding for 5 f15s one fewer than th senate wanted and also for 3 f16s as the house proposed and it provided about 15 million more than requested for jsf development splitting th difference between the house and the senate the authorization bill follows the appropriations on all of these issues b2 bomber the housepassed authorization and appropriations bills added 331 million to the

provides 653 million and the authorization conference report provi des 643 million additional funding for equipm ent designated for the guard and reserve is provided in othe r appropriatio ns accounts the house national security committee reported that total of about 22 billio n is provided for guard and reserve equipment from all sources in the defense authorization conference agreement implementing the quadrennial defense review as in the past couple of years most of the funding that congress has added to the administrations request for fy1998 is for weapons procurement an d development the defense ap propriations conference report adds about 3 billion to the administr ation request for new weapons and 500 million for rd note these figures take account of an acrosstheboard reduction of 15 in procurement an d rd required by section 8043 of the conference agreement and an additiona l reduction of 474 million in rd required by section 8048 and the authorization bill provides comparable increases in the past the admi nistration has often criticized congressional additions 1 for adding pro grams that will have substantial costs in the future when budgets will be tighter and 2 for continuing procurement of curren t generation weapons when the critical task is to develop the next generation at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs13 same time however the defense department has agreed that funding for weapon s procurement especially should turn up substantially over the next few years in order to finance needed weapons modernization the official goal has been to increas procurement to about 60 billion by the turn of the century the curren t administration program calls for 60 billion procurement budget in fy2001 it has however proved difficult to increase procurement spending as planned when i t submitted the fy1998 budget request in february for example the administration requested 426 billion for procurement just year earlier however dod d projected budget of 455 billion for procurement in fy1998 the reason for the decline was that the operation and maintenance budget had grown by 51 billion partly to finance military operations abroad and partly because weapons maintenance costs had climbed the cut in procurement was limited to 29 billion only because the president agreed to add 26 billion to the overall dod budget such migration of funds from om to procurement accounts has occurred in each of the past four years and the problem of protecting planned increases i n procurement was major focus of attention in the pentagons quadrennial defense review in order to allow spending for weapons moderniz ation to turn up adequately in the future the qdr proposed number of steps including modest reductions in the size of the active duty force significant cuts in army guard and reserve forc levels substantial cuts in civilian personnel levels another round of base closures authority to outsource defense support activities and other measures to reduc defense overhead implementation of the qdr recommendations depends n congressional action judging by h ouse and senate action to date the congressional reaction is at best mixed the house and senate specifically and pointedly rejected the administratio n request to enact legislation implementing another two rounds of military bas closures indeed the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill b senator dorgan requiring improved accounting for base closure costs and saving s before another round is p roposed hnsc also rejected an administration request to repeal rule that reserves 60 percent of weapons depot maintena nce work for publicly owned facilities sasc in contrast endorsed shift to 5050 split between public and private facilities tho ugh it broadened the definition of the depot work to include logistics activities that were earlier open to private industry perhaps most importantly hnsc rejected proposed cuts in active and reserve troop levels and instead reaffirmed floor on active duty troop levels that had been included in the fy1997 defense authorization bill the house appropriations bill however endorsed cuts in active duty troop levels sasc agreed to cuts in bot h active and reserve troop levels the funding provided in the appropriation s conference report implies reduced troop levels the authorization conferenc agreement accepts most of the cuts in active and reserve force levels that th administration has proposed though it maintains floor of 495000 on army active duty endstrength which is higher than the qdr proposed instead of fol lowing the qdr recommendations hnsc approved number of quite different measures to impr ove defense efficiency including some that dod has found difficult to accept t he efficiency measures in the housepassed authorization bill and final conference action are as follows httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs14 hnsc imposed 20 cut in funding for operations of the office of th secretary of defense and requirement that dod provide previousl mandated reports on the functions of osd this cut is not included in th authorization conference agreement hnsc required cut of 25 over five years in military service headquarters and management staffs the authorization conference agreement imposes 25 cut over five years in management headquarters and headquarters support personnel hnsc required 42 reduction over five years in the defense acquisitio n work force the authorization conference report requires cut of 2500 0 positions i n fy1998 but allows the secretary of defense to waive part of the reduction hnsc mandated publicprivate competition for defense financial services computer and telecommunications rvices printing services and number of other activities the authorization conference agreement mandate s competition for somewhat smaller list of activities hnsc also made series of other reform s in acquisition rules and regulations some of which are included in the authorization conference agreement in testimony before hnsc on june 17 dod comptroller john hamr complained that the civilian personnel reductions that h nsc was proposing could not be implemented under civil service regulations and that the cuts are too deep in any event the authorization conference agreement appears more acceptable to th defense department the overall policy issue is remains unresolved however the qdr has focused attention on efforts to improve efficiency in the department f defense as the one means available to finance increased weapons purchases th administration and congress appear substantially at odds however over means to achieve savings other issues other issues range across broad spectrum from us policy in bosnia t combined sex training to environmental cleanup of defense facilities this year matters of debate included bosnia policy in action on supplemental funding and rescissions earlier thi s year the senate approved measure that would have cut off funds for us ground forces in bosnia after june 30 1998 the date the administration had tentative ly set for ending the current mission this provision was droppe d from the conference agreement however hnsc did not include measure cutting off funds for bosnia in its vers ion of the fy1998 defense authorization bill but instead required various reports on bosnia costs and policy on the floor however the house approved an amendment by representative buyer cutting off funds for us ground forces in bosnia after of june 30 1998 the house rejected substitute by representative hilleary to requir withdrawal by december 31 1997 on july 11 the senate adopted nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97205crs15 amendment by senator levin and others to the authorization bill expressing the sense of the congress that us ground forces should be withdrawn by jun 30 1998 the amendment would not cut off funds the administratio n warned that rigid cutoff of funds will prompt veto the housepasse d defense appropriations bill includ ed cutoff of funds identical to the provision in the authorization bill the issue was resolved in the defense appropriations conference report in fashion that appears to give the administration som flexibility to extend the mission in bosnia though congress may have n opportunity to address the issue in d ebate over supplemental funding section 8132 of the bill cuts off funds for t roops in bosnia after june 30 1998 unless by may 15 1998 the president certifies that continued presence is needed to meet us national security interests the certification must include statement of the expected duration of the mission and describe an exit strategy along with the certification the administration is also required to submit request for supplemental funding to c over costs of the extended mission this request could be come vehicle for congressional opposition th authorization conference agreement included the same requirements aircraft maintenance depot work loads the most difficult issue to resolve in this years defense debate concerns workloads at air force aircraf t maintenance depots this issue has important implications for the ongoin g debate over base closures in 1995 the base closure commissio n recommen ded shutting down two of five air force air logistics centers alcs alcs are large industrial fa cilities that perform overhauls of aircraft although the administration did not propose eliminating any alcs th commission found that t here was not enough work for all of the facilities and recommended closing the alcs at mcclellan air force base in sacramento california and kelly air force base in san antonio texas this woul d concentr ate work at remaining alcs in utah oklahoma and georgia instead of closing the mcclellan and kelly facilities however the clinto n administration devis ed privatization in place strategy which would allow the facilities to operate under private ownership this plan came unde r increasingly vocal criticism among other things for allegedly politicizing the base closure process both hnsc and sasc versio ns of the authorization bill initially included provisions to protect work loads at the remaining publi c alcs before work could go to the privatized facilities because of hi s objections to the sasc provision senator gramm held up senate action on the bill until the relevant provisions were removed the house however rejected floor amendment by representative everett to remove simila r provisions from the h nsc version of the bill the administration threatened to veto the final authorization bill if it included provision that would restrict competition for work by the privatized alcs the authorization conference agreement includes measure that will allow competition between the public facilitie s and the privatized depots but requires that core work defined s that essential to carry out pr imary military missions be reserved for the public facilities senators from texas and california continued to object to th compromise language however and in an october 28 l etter to senate leaders omb director franklyn raines said th at the presidents senior advisors would recommend veto unless there are changes in the depot provisions in th end however the president decided not to veto the bill over the depot
