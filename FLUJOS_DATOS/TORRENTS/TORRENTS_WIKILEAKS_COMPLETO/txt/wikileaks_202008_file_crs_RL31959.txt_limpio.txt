annual foreign operations appropriation measures division b of s 2144 foreign assistance authorization for fy2005 is an effort to reinforce the senate foreign relations committees role in foreign aid policy making it is not an attempt to comprehensively review and re write existing foreign aid legislation but rather it is first step in providing necessary authorization for program appropriations

recent developments on march 4 2004 the senate foreign relations committee ordered reported s 2144 the foreign affairs authorization act fy2005 division b of the measure is designated as the foreign assistance authorization act fy2005 text that is largely patterned after foreign aid authorizing legislation s 1161 debated but not passed in the senate last year division b of s 2144 authorizes about 169 billion for most but not all foreign assistance programs funding many economic and military aid activities at levels requested by the administration for fy2005 division b also incorporates two policy initiatives the radiological terrorism security act and the global pathogen surveillance act background congress last enacted broad foreign assistance authorization act in 1985 prior to 1985 beginning in the mid1950s it had been the congressional practice to debate and approve general foreign aid legislation either annually or biennially these debates frequently evolved into wideranging consideration of us foreign policy that went well beyond discussions of economic and military assistance programs as such the legislation was frequently marked by controversy internal congressional disagreements concerning international issues and disputes between the executive and legislative branches regarding presidential management of foreign policy in several years since 1985 congress considered foreign aid authorizing measures but the bills failed to reach final passage1 in the interim lawmakers have approved more narrowly focused singleissue foreign aid authorization bills such as the support for east european democracy seed act 1989 the freedom support act 1992 the international malaria control act 2000 and the more recently enacted united states leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 lack of administration support for foreign aid bills has been continuing obstacle to enactment over the past 18 years the clinton administration submitted draft legislation in 1994 seeking to rewrite the foreign assistance act of 1961 but in most cases the executive has opposed or not encouraged consideration of broad foreign assistance measures which were perceived as intrusions into presidential flexibility in managing foreign policy or excessive congressional earmarking 1 the closest congress came to approving foreign aid bill came in 1991 when the house and senate passed hr 2508 102nd congress the international cooperation act of 1991 after passing the senate however the conference agreement failed in the house crs2 in the absence of omnibus foreign aid authorizations the majority of the foreign assistance legislation has been enacted as part of annual foreign operations appropriation measures over the past 19 years these appropriation bills increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war legislation authorizing us participation in most multilateral development bank replenishments since the early 1980s has been incorporated into foreign operation measures the legislation and companion supplemental appropriation bills have also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 earlier this year the presidents new foreign aid initiative the millennium challenge corporation was authorized with the fy2004 foreign operations appropriations act appropriation measures have also been key instrument used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes similar to those that occurred previously in authorization debates last year the foreign relations committee reported similar bill s 1161 characterizing the action as effort to reinforce the committees role in foreign assistance policy making2 chairman lugar noted during the committees markup of that bill that it was not an attempt to comprehensively review and rewrite existing foreign aid legislation rather s 1161 represented first step in providing necessary authorization for program appropriations in fy2004 and updating selected legislative provisions to reflect current policy senator lugar said that it was his intent to launch more ambitious effort in the future to revamp the foreign assistance act of 1961 and other longstanding foreign aid laws after being folded into s 925 the foreign relations authorization act fiscal year 2004 the senate debated on july 9 and 10 2003 the foreign aid authorizing legislation adopting several amendments but without coming to final vote s 2144 is continuation of the 2003 committees effort to steer an omnibus foreign policy authorizing bill for fy2005 through the senate for consideration by the house senate conference committee the house approved on july 16 2003 companion legislation hr 1950 that includes many of the same provisions on state department operations and security assistance issues as the new senate measure but does not address economic aid programs 2 foreign assistance authorization act fiscal year 2004 report to accompany s 1161 srept 10856 may 29 2003 crs3 contents of the foreign aid legislation division b of s 1161 is divided into

reconstruction civilian management act of 2004 s 2127 in total authorizations recommended in s 2144 and s 2127 equal the presidents fy2005 budget for the equivalent accounts while several foreign aid

consolidated appropriations act fy2004 b fy2003 supplemental includes funds appropriated in pl 108106 3 two other foreign assistance programs are authorized in s 2144 but not within division b the foreign aid portion of the bill in division sec 105 the migration and refugee assistance account is authorized at 765 million for fy2005 35 million above the request title ix of division broadly modifies peace corps authorities and authorizes 351 million 50 million less than the budget proposal crs5 offsetting these and additions made in other parts of s 2144 is reduction of 500 million for the presidents new foreign aid initiative the millennium challenge account mca the legislation however continues for fy2005 existing authority to use up to 10 of mca funding to assist countries that fail by narrow margin to qualify for the mca program in hopes of improving their chances in future years total amounts authorized in s 2144 conform to the overall level for international affairs spending approved in the senate on march 11 in the fy2005 budget resolution sconres 95 the senatepassed measure increases the presidents 316 billion foreign policy budget request to 3233 billion in discretionary spending largely due to floor amendments by senators lugar durbin and dewine adding 183 billion to the committeereported level although not binding amendment sponsors said they intended the additional funds to be used for higher resources for hivaids aid to haiti and more broadly to fill funding gaps throughout the international affairs budget general foreign aid authorities title xxii of division b of s 2144 includes 35 sections most of which incorporate into permanent law legislative items that have been included in annual appropriations in recent years or update existing provisions that have not been amended to reflect current circumstances for example provisions routinely carried in appropriation acts concerning assistance to nongovernmental organizations authority to undertake reconstruction projects with disaster aid funds aid to the former soviet union aid prohibitions for countries whose elected head of government has been deposed by military coup and administration of justice demining and debt relief programs would be added to the foreign assistance act of 1961 presumably similar measures would be dropped from future foreign operations appropriation bills the legislation also updates longstanding authorities such as those related to the presidents special waiver authority section 614a of the foreign assistance act prohibition on aid to countries in default on debt owed to the united states additions to war reserve stockpiles in israel restrictions on aid to lebanon dollar thresholds of arms sales that must be notified to congress and several other administrative authorities s 2144 further extends an existing waiver for pakistan aid restrictions through fy2005 radiological terrorism security act4 title xxiii of s 2144 addresses the threat posed by terrorist use of radiological dispersal devices or rdds these devices spread radioactive material whether by chemical explosive dirty bombs or by spraying scattering or dumping it without an explosive the united states has devoted far more resources to studying the effects of rdds and to planning responses to an rdd attack than have many other countries 4 this section was prepared by jonathan medalia specialist in national defense crs6 accordingly section 2304 authorizes the secretary of state to help other countries directly or through the iaea develop national response plans and train first responders for dealing with an rdd attack in addition section 2303 would require the secretary of state to submit to the appropriate congressional committees report on preparations to detect and mitigate radiological attack on us diplomatic missions abroad rankordered list of the secretarys priorities for improving radiological security and consequence management at these facilities and budget for such improvements and rank ordered list of facilities where improvement is most important this report would be submitted within 180 days of the enactment of this act and annually thereafter beginning with the budget submission for fy2006 the legislation authorizes 2 million to undertake both provisions under this title global pathogen surveillance act of 20035 title xxiv of s 2144 the global pathogen surveillance act would authorize 35 million for fy2005 to enhance the capability of developing nations to detect identify and contain infectious disease outbreaks whether naturally occurring or the result of bioterrorist attack similar legislation was first introduced on may 9 2002 by senators biden helms kennedy and frist s 2487 it passed the senate amended on august 1 2002 further action was taken on the measure during the 107th congress the sars outbreak underscores the importance of developing global surveillance system to detect and track the spread of infectious disease around the world public health experts view sars as just the latest manifestation of the growing threat of infectious disease that threat driven by complex set of biological social political and economic factors encompasses not only new and reemerging infectious diseases of natural origin but also bioterrorist attacks international trade travel and migration patterns facilitate the rapid spread of pathogens from one continent to another infectious disease outbreaks need not originate in the united states to pose threat to the nation global surveillance especially for newly recognized infectious diseases is crucial to responding to and containing microbial threats before isolated outbreaks develop into regional or worldwide pandemics key components of an effective surveillance system include trained epidemiologists network of modern fully equipped laboratories able to isolate and identify emerging pathogens and public health communications infrastructure to transmit and share information on disease outbreaks in 2000 the world health organization who established the global alert and response network to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every region of the world but the who network is only as strong as its individual components many developing nations lack the trained personnel laboratory facilities and public health infrastructure to detect emerging pathogens and track evolving disease patterns the 2003 institute of medicine report microbial threats to health emergence detection and response recommended that the united states 5 this section was prepared by c stephen redhead specialist in life sciences crs7 take leading role in promoting the development of global infectious disease surveillance capability based on existing systems6 the global pathogen surveillance act includes several provisions that are intended to support and strengthen the disease surveillance capabilities of developing nations first it seeks to address the lack of adequately trained public health officials who can identify and diagnose infectious disease outbreaks the legislation in sections 2406 and 2407 would provide for incountry training for medical and laboratory personnel and permit eligible nationals of developing countries to come to the united states to pursue master of public health degree or advanced public health training in epidemiology second sections 2408 and 2409 would provide assistance to developing nations subject to the availability of appropriations to purchase 1 basic laboratory equipment necessary for the collection analysis and identification of pathogens and 2 communications equipment and information technology for the dissemination of information on disease patterns throughout regional health networks additionally sections 2410 and 2411 would permit the expansion of cdc facilities overseas to further the goals of global disease monitoring it would also authorize the heads of executive branch agencies to assign public health officials to us diplomatic missions and international health organizations when requested finally section 2412 of the bill would authorize the president to provide funding and other assistance for the purpose of enhancing whos surveillance and reporting capabilities and those of existing regional health networks and for the development of new regional health networks s 2144 authorizes total of 35 million for these activities in fy2005 funds that would be drawn from the nonproliferation antiterrorism demining and related nadr programs account the legislation allocates the funds as follows 25 million for training public health officials and assisting developing nations to procure lab and communication equipment sections 24062409 05 million for the assignment of public health officials at us missions overseas and international organizations section 2410 25 million for the expansion of us government labs
