sonar environmental exemptions for the navys midfrequency active sonar training introduction the use of sonar in navy training exer cises has been contentious some argue that the noise harms marine mammals others note that welltrained military is national priority in the case of midfreque ncy active sonar training exercises the controversy was brought before the us supreme court the supreme court did not consider the merits of the action meanin g it did not evaluate whether the navy had met all of its environmental obligations in preparing for the training but it held that the navy could not be enjoined from training in this case based on the evidence of merely the possibility of harming marine life1 this report will discuss that litigation midfrequency active mfa sonar emits pulses of sound from an underwater transmitter to help determine the size distance direction and speed of objects the sound waves bounce off objects and reflect b ack to underwater acoustic receivers as an echo2 mfa sonar has been used since wo rld war ii and according to the navy is the only reliable way to identify track and target submarines3 mfa sonar has range of up to 10 nautical miles nm active sonar differs from passive sonar in that passive sonar only receives sound waves and does not emit them the navy indicates that passive sonar is ineffective at detecting quiet submarines such as those that run on batteries to prepare its fleet the navy conducts training exercises on regularly scheduled rotation this re port considers the mfa traini ng exercises conducted off the coast of california which have b een challenged on environmental grounds4 scientists have suggested that mfa sonar may harm some marine mammals especially beaked whales some opponents have noted that the sonar is emitted

navy agrees that the sonar coul d harm marine mammals under certain circumstances but argues that the navy takes additional protective measures to prevent harm in press release of december 20 2007 the navy indicated that it takes 29 mitigation measures to protect marine mammals during sonar exercises and that injuries have been attributed to s onar use since the measures were put in place in january 20076 the navys program could affect marine mammals that are protected under the marine mammal prot ection act mmpa and some under the endangered species act the training program must also comply with the national environmental policy act nepa and in some cases the coastal zone management act czma each of these laws has provisions where federal action may be exempted from full

given notice of the exemption the mmpa has other adjustments for military actions the mmpa has different definition for harassment when conducted as part of military readiness activity under the 2003 amendments the tw types of harassmen t were redefined for military readiness activities level harassment meaning an act that injures or has the significant potential to injure marine mammal or marine mammal stock and level b harassment meaning the act di sturbs or is likely to disturb marine mammal or marine mammal stock by causing disruption of behavi oral patterns such as migration breathing nursing breeding f eeding or sheltering to point where such behavioral patterns are ab andoned or signif icantly altered12 this is distinct from the other definition of hara ssment which is an act

endangered and 28 temporar threshold shift exposures to endangered blue fin humpback sei and sperm whales the court said it was likely to be held that the navy should have prepared an eis after findi ng these effects and that the navy did not adequately review alterna tives to its training plan the court also found that there was likelihood that the navy violated the czma according to the navy the mfa training was consistent with the state cmp because it would not affect californias coastal resources and the navy did not need to adopt the mitigation measures californi deemed necessary the court suggested that the navys determination that its exercises would not harm coastal resources could be found arbitrary and capricious the court issued preliminary injuncti on halting the training activities until full review could be conducted the na vy appealed and on august 31 2007 the ninth circuit court of appeals stayed the injunction meaning the injunction was put aside but not rejected outright28 later in november the ninth circuit dissolved the stay meaning the navy was again joined from conducting mfa exercises29 the case was remanded to the district court with instructions from

ninth circuit to vacate the injunction the ninth circuit remanded the action to the district court on january 16 200832 on february 5 2008 the district court reconsidered the preliminary injunction in light of the developments the court held that the ceq had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in granting alternative arrangements to the navy when there was actual emergency ceq apprehended the phrase emergency circumstances to refer to sudden unanticipated events not the unfavorable consequences of protracted litigation ceqs contrary interpretation in this case is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation and concomitantly not entitled to deference33 the court held that the navy still had to comply with nepa therefore its injunction remained in place and the navy could conduct mfa tr aining only if it used the mitigation measures required by th court the court stated that public interest was best served by requiring those mitigation measures in that way the navy would have the benef it of conducting training and the natural resources would have limited harm from the training the c ourt reviewed but did not rule on the czma exemption

navy moved to have the injunction st ayed but the ninth circuit denied the request34 on february 29 2008 the ninth circu it rejected the navys appeal of the preliminary injunction35 it found that ceqs in terpretation of emergency circumstances was overly broad36 the ninth circuit described the course of litigation that ended in the injunction as series of events that gives rise to predictable outcome and not sudden nd unexpected occurrence the ninth circuit compared it to ceqs response to hurricane katrina in which alternative arrangements were provided because the re was not sufficient time to follow the regular eis process37 in separate opinion the ninth circuit modified two of the mitigation measures required by the district court38 the ninth circuit allowed the 2200yard suspension to remain in place unless the training was at critical point in the exercise in which case the navy would reduce the s onar by 6 db if marine mammal was detected within 1000 m 10 db if within 500 m and suspend the activity if within 200 m the second modification was for when significant surface ducting conditions were detected rather than shutting down the training as required by the district court the ninth circuit required the navy to reduce the decibels of the activity see table 3 for details therefore the navy can conduct its training exercises provided it uses the mitigation measures indicated by the court the navy petitioned the us supreme court to review the ninth circuit decision39 the supreme court reviewed two claims brought by the navy whether the ceq acted within its authority to grant the alternative arrangements and whether the injunction based on nepa viol ations was appropria in 54 decision the majority of the supreme court held that the balan ce of public interests favored allowing the training to continue it did not review th merits of the case instead the majority ruled that the district court did not consid er the correct balance of public interests the majority found that the public interest in national defens outweighed the public interest in protecting marine mammals we conclude that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest in this case tip strongly in favo r of the navy for the plaintiffs the most serious possible injury would be harm to an unknown number of the marine mammals that they

of welltrained military versus animal safety it considered the issue as what harm would ccur to the navy by delaying training until it complied with nepa42 based on that view of the case the dissenters found the balance weighed in favor of protecting the marine mammals the dissenters indicated that the navys agreement to prepare an eis after the training was completed was contrary to the purpose of the statute only the dissenting opinion discussed th alternative arrangements provided by ceq the opinion said ceq lacks authority to absolve an agency of its statutory duty to prepare an eis indicating that legislative options were available to the navy the legislative option would be to obtain statutory exemption from nepa for the training program legal analysis the injunction ultimately was put in place by holding that ceq had been arbitrary and capricious in granting an emergency exception under nepa legal analysis of the courts decision is somewhat hampered by the few court decisions and the brief regulatory history of secti on 150611 ceq has recorded only 41 instances where it was contacted to obtain alternative arrangements since the regulation went into place in 1978 and only three until this case have led to published decisions43 while the dissenting opinion openly challenges the authority of the ceq to circumvent nepa noting that alternative arrangements are issued based on one sided record it is persuasive authority only and not legal precedent for interpreting the regulation section 150611 was part of th initial regulations created for ceq to implement nepa in response to an executive order44 the regulation has direct statutory authority but can be supported by 42 u sc 4331b which states it is the responsibility of the us government to u

slightly from the draft the initial wording had said that under emergency circumstances the federal ag ency proposing to take the action should consult with the council about alternative arrangements46 out of concern that the regulation could be construed as requiri ng consultation before an emergency occurred47 the regulation was modified to read as follows where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action with significant environmental impact without observing the provisions of these regulations the federal agency taking the action should consult with the council about alternative arrangements agencies and the council will limit such arrangements to actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency other actions remain subject to nepa review48 the regulation has not changed since then the court in the mfa cases found ceq d acted beyond the scope of section 150611 when it provided alternative actions for the navy to conduct rather than requiring the navy to complete an eis as directed by the court courts give agencies deference regarding the interpretation of their regulations including the emergency provision and the ceqs interp retation of its regulations is entitled to substantial deference49 however where an agencys inte rpretation defies the plain meaning of regulation courts have reject ed the agencys interpretation50 that has not happened before in the context of the nepa emergency provision the few courts that have considered challenges to ceq alternative arrangement have upheld the ceqs deter

earlier in an ea the dc circuit reversed holding that the district court erred in substituting its judgment for the ceq the dc circuit found that fws had rational basis for changing its policy especially in light of the lead poisoning death of condor in an area belie ved safe the court said that once it had determined that the underlying agency decision reflects sufficient attention to

the underlying eafonsi has been found insuffici ent also the court suggested the navy lacked rational basis for declaring the training exercises an emergency the emergency in the case of detroit was not one of military readiness instead it was argued that major corporation w ould leave the city if funding were not provided for an urban renewal project putting the city in immediate financial peril

arrangements in which an eis was waived rather than deferred the only military action reviewed by the cour ts in response to challenge to the application of section 150611 re lated to night flights out of an air force base an eis completed years earlier d supported the decision that flights would not occur between the hours of 10 pm and 7 am however concurrent with the us commitment of forces to operation dese rt storm the air force began 24hour operations out of that base the plai ntiffs asked the air force to conduct supplemental eis prior to the flights but the air force sought alternative

the air force or ceq had been arbitrary and capricious in allowing the nepa exception54 the court found that the crisis in the middle east was an emergency the court noted that the air force was particular in describing the emergency need defendants have pointed to specific military concerns with regard to tr oop redeployment flig ht scheduling cargo transport and other operations that necessitate the use of westover afb for c5a operations on twentyfour hour basis55 in the instant case the court distinguished the facts from the air force exception noting the air forces circumstan ces had changed after an eis had been prepared but in this case change had occurred also the court criticized the navys characterization of the emergency noting that these routine training exercises had been planned for long time and suggesting that the navy was seeking ways to avoid preparing the eis ordered by the cour t the court said ceq had not used the plain meaning of emergency56 the court found ceq chose mitigation measures that had already been rejected by the court according to the court this raises serious constitutional concerns under the paration of powers doctrine but the court found that because ceqs applica tion of section 150611 was invalid it did not need to examine the constitutional issue57 the ninth circuit agreed with the rationale of the lower court noting that there was national security or military exemption within nepa58httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34403crs14 table 1 listed species found off the california coasta classification common name scientific name t
