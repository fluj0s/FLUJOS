6211c13 shspec210 the difficult case problems intensive see p 292 is apparently capable of producing book one mest clear if it is done right it has done so on couple of pcs if this is not happening elsewhere than at st hill it may be that people elsewhere dont know what free needle is peoples tas have been gotten to clear read with mention of fn so pay some attention to this it could be that it was happening without being reported the aspect of case depends on the way the case is handled generally how the case is handled has great deal to do with how rough the case looks say case and case b are similarly tough cases if case gets lot of usual actions good hope factor good rfactor and case b gets unusualness and wrong actions case will run easily and case b will run rough and break anybodys heart psychiatric classification behavior in life etc have bearing on how hard or easy the case will be to handle the same goes for scientology classification schemes we make our own tough cases the black v theetieweetie etc it doesnt matter the length of time to handle the case doesnt compare to the state of the case all cases are hard actually some are made more difficult by preconceptions and classifications that dont really apply the technology has bypassed the difficulties the case that you will have trouble with is always spook and surprise to you it is not the psychiatric disaster case the tough ones are the ones who look sane and able and lie like hell because they dont do the commands they get upset if you keep at them to see if they did the command that just makes them feel accused and they get harder to audit you can spot this kind of case by observing that after short period of modern auditing the case hasnt recovered this case either 1 hasnt done your commands or 2 you havent audited the case this case interrupts the auditing cycle the most extreme example of this kind of case is the individual who cant communicate at all or the case that cant hear or that has command of the language that you are using but that is simple you recognize the outofcommunication state that he is in and know that you would get nowhere with subjective process like straightwire but you miss the case who ostensibly speaks and understands english but never answers the question or executes the commands there is actually gradient of this which at its top level includes every case sooner or later any case wont do the command the spook is the one who never does the command and always does something else what is happening is that he is on circuit he is being wired set of valences the pc is out there somewhere and has nothing to do with the auditing at all dont let your pc sit there in sort of comfortable relaxed puzzle find out what is going on but dont chop up the pc auditors sometimes sense that the pc isnt executing the command and they start harassing the pc chopping him up because they know something is wrong they dont feel in good 2wc with the pc so you move in and get insistent with the pc then the ta moves even less this case is the last one in the world to admit that he is not doing the command he could even get ta say he is running the command through an electronic incident because he knows that if it changes he is better how do you handle this case you watch the ta while you are running the pcs right havingness process or you can run another process that has something to do with the physical universe like op pro by dup scs or cchs if you get good ta with that flatten that the reason you dont notice the ta is that the pc is off the meter but if the pc gets lot of ta in the rudiments and little in the body of the session you know at once that the pc never does the auditing command it is selfevident that this is the true state of affairs if you run the pt environment eg with look at the _______ and the ta moves while problems intensive gives zilch ta here you will see that the pc can get ta such people have short span into the past reality on what went on in the world ceases five minutes to five days ago or so in the body of the session you are trying to send him out of pt if all pcs were like this tough case we would clear people with ruds since ta action gives direct index of case change if you dont get as much ta action in the body of the session as you do in running the rudiments please realize that the process is not running ta motion mirrors directly and immediately the amount of change which is being secured it is direct index of how much bank is changing or shifting so you handle the difficult case by giving ruds and havingness sessions case with good reality on the bank wouldnt get good ta on ruds ta on havingness or any cch or contact process means that the pc is becoming aware of the walls of the room what wall indeed his concept of mass is being shifted by confronting his environment it is not bank mass that is giving ta it is the mass of the walls of the room the pc is in shape to be audited because where is he going to be audited from furthermore he doesnt have the stability of pt to audit against so any attempt on your part to get him to address the track throws him into confusion he cant answer the auditing question because he has point of reference cases are audited against the reference point of pt oddly enough the memory of eight million years ago totally depends on knowing it was sight million years from specific time eg pt guy who is stuck in an electronic incident of three million years ago will get ta when you get him to look at his immediate vicinity otherwise hs will run problems intensive from point three million years ago which is an unstable point so you are running confusion against an instability but two confusions never made stability case that is wildly out of pt seldom answers the auditing command or executes it and auditing depends exclusively on getting the command executed the auditing cycle must occur every time the auditor opens his mouth on recall time you communicated if the time he commed is up the track from where he is stuck he cant recall it because it hasnt happened yet so he has to do something else so for instance he mocks up psychoanalyst against the auditor or he holds the two back corners of the room he does these things because he doesnt want to wasts the auditors time ta action on ruds and on the body of the session is the only reliable indication of this type of case in this situation it becomes important to prepare case dont try to plow the ground with cadillac it is the wrong vehicle if the pc isnt doing the command dont harass him do objective processes when the motion goes out of the ta do the body of the session with subjective processes the gradient scale of toughness of cases is proportional to the amount of ta they get on pt or nearpt processes ruds and havingness to get good reality on this point take pc who has been having an awful time with 3gaxx and run some ptps or some such and watch the ta fly first mentioned in tape 6210c23 shspec202a 3gaxx also mentioned in tape 6210c23 3gaxx following the rock slam and 6210c25 shspec209 3gaxx secondary prehav scale these tapes are confidential the process lists and handles some types of implants it unburdens the case and locates goals see also pp 332335 below and hcobs 8nov62 listing pack ii and 11nov62 3gaxx straightening up 3gaxx cases for more on 3gaxx running the pc must be there before you audit him the auditing cycle requires the presence of the pc so give him lots of ruds and havingness and problems intensive on closetopt problem he can confront this type of pc will get sensation on list all right because he would get sensation from two days ago it is that unreal he has sensation because he is in the middle of confusion with referral point pt how do you expect him to be anywhere but in confusion thats what sensation basically is the pc in confusion give him pt then you can run him
