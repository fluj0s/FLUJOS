agreements on the defense auth orization and appropriations bills resolved number of major issues including relations with china the house approved several floor amendments to th authorization bill to limit satellite and missile technology exports to china the white house objected to seve ral of the provisions especially to ban on satellite exports china was also contentious issue in senate debate on the authorization bill the senatepassed bill included severa l statements of policy but some especially contentious chin arelated amendments offered by senator hutchinson were dropped dur ing floor debate chinarelated provisions were major issue in the au thorization conference the conference agreed to drop language banning the export f satellites to china but included provisions that would 1 take review of technology exports to china away from th comme rce department and return it to the state department 2 requir advanced congressional notification of satellite sales to china along with presidential justification for waiving human rightsrelated limits on satellit transfers and 3 prohib it export of missile equipment or technology to china unless the president certifies that the export will not hurt the us space launch industry and will not improve chinas missile launch capabilities th conference agreement also includes housepassed measure that woul d prohibit the transfer of port facilities near san diego to cosco chines shipping company the senatepassed version of the defense appropriations bill included r evised amendment by senator hutchinson condemning forced abortions in china and requiring that foreign officials from china or othe r nations involved in forced abortions forced sterilization or genital mutilation be denied visas to the united states the appropriations conference agreement does not include this measure but it contains prohibition on dod doin g business with chinese armyowned companies and requires report on th security situation in the taiwan strait base closures neither the house nor the senate authorization bills approved new rounds of military base closures as the administration had requested the senate approved an amendment by senators inhofe and dorgan tha t would make it somewhat more dif ficult for the defense department to realign military bases in the absence of congressionally established base closur process dod strongly objected to th is provision the conference agreement drops this provision according to press accounts sen inhofe agreed t drop it in return for conference acceptance of the housepassed provisio n regarding cosco social issues the housepassed authorization bill required the army navy and air forc to separate men and women in basic training as the marin corps now does the senatepassed bill in stark contrast specificall prohibited implementation of new policies to sep arate men and women in basichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs5 training until after congressionally established commission reports in key floor vote on june 24 the senate rejected brownback amendment t incorporate the house language instead the senate endorsed substitut offered by senator snowe that allows current integrated training practices to continue though it would require ad ditional steps to separate male and female sleeping quarters this was reportedly major issue in the housesenat authorization conference the conference ultimately adopted the senat language but also included sense of the house statement urging separate training units on other social issues the house authorization included measure applying to the secr etary of defense and the president requirement that commanders display exemplary be havior and the conference agreement includes similar provision but only as sense of the house statement both the house and the senate rejected floor amendments to eliminate th current ban on abortions in military medical facilities tritium production the housepassed authorization bill included measure that would prohibit the defense of energy doe from buying tritium fo r nuclear weapons from commercial nuclear reactors without this source f tritium doe would have to build new facilities to produce tritium in sout h carolina the congressional budget office timated that it would cost about 3 billion over the next forty years to buy tritium from commercial sources and 10 billion t buy it from new facilities the senatepassed authorization bill included provision allowing doe to choose the longterm option th conference agreement allows doe to make the choice but prohibit s implementation of any plan for year which wil l allow congress to review the decision again active duty endstrength the housepassed authorization bill rejected n administration request to eliminate floors on active duty endstrength levels the senate version of the authorization bill and both house and senat versions of the appropriatio ns bill however all agreed to the administrations proposed reductions in endstrength the authorization conference repor t agrees to the administration request pay raise the housepassed authorization provided pay raise of 36 fo r military personnel while the senate version and both house and senat versions of the appropriations b ill initially provided only the requested raise of 31 on june 25 however the senate approved an amendment to th authorization bill by senators thurmond nd levin to increase the pay raise to 36 offset by an acrosstheboard reduction of rd funds senator s stevens and inouye among others cosponsored the amendment and the subsequen tly offered an amendment to provide the same pay raise on th defense appr opriations bill the authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide 36 raise bosnia the administration requested 19 billion for bosnia in fy1999 s emergency funding not subject to the 2705 billion cap on defense spending under the 1997 balanced budget act the senatepassed version of th defense appropriations bill included the requested funding while the house bill did not in addition the sasc report on the authorization bill approved thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs6 amount and explicitly stipulated that the funding should be provided s emerge ncy appropriations the housepassed authorization bill did t address emergency funding but instead included provision to cap bosni spending at 19 billion with the services allowed to spend 100 million more if necessary to protect us troops the administration strongly objected to this provision in floor action on the authorization both houses considere d and rejected measures to require the withdrawal of us troops from bosnia by specific date but the senate version of the authorization bill also included sense of the congress statement encouraging the president to establis h conditions allowing drawdown of forces in bosnia the authorizatio n conference agreement specifically authorizes 19 billion in emergency funding for bosnia and allows larger expenditures if the president certifies that th funding is needed to meet us national security needs and will not undermine readiness the appropriations conference agreement did not includ emergen cy funding for bosnia but it was later provided in supplementa l appropriations measure included in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill weapons priorities compared to past yea rs contentious weapons issues were few but there were some the administration requested just one c130j aircraft and objected to the addition of more than 400 million for 7 additional aircraft in the ho use authorization and appropriations bills the senate bills added smaller amounts the authorization and appropriations conferenc agreements provide funds for 7 aircraft 6 more than requ ested the house and senate appropriations bills reduced funding for t he theater high altitude area defense thaad system by substantial amounts in the wake of the mos t recent test failure in may although the administration agreed that th program should be restructured it wanted to maintain funding th authorization conference agreement however cuts 294 million and th appropriations conference agreement cuts 376 million the senat authorization and appropriations bills reduced or eliminated funding fo r another theater missile defense tmd syste m the medium extendedrange air defense system meads cooperative program with allies that th adminis tration wants to continue the authorization conference agreemen t cuts funding from 44 million requested to 24 million and prohibit s expendit ure of any funds unless the defense department finds room fo r meads in future budget plans the appropriations conference agreemen t provides just 10 million the senate authorization and appropriations bill s also reduced funding for the airborne laser abl program and increase d funding for spacebased laser sbl rd the administration strongl objected but the autho rization conference agreement follows the senate the appropriations conference agreement provides somewhat more than th authoriza tion for abl both house and senate appropriations bills als reduced funding for new aircraft carrier developmen t in the wake of the navys decision not to pursue clean sheet design for new cvx carrier the navy wanted to keep some of the money to develop progress ive changes in the current design the authorization conference agree ment provides 110 million and the appropriations conference agreement provides 105 million of th 190 million requested the senate authorization and appropriations bill s included advance procurement funds for new lhd8 amphibious ship the defense partment did not object though some lawmakers denounced it ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs7 an example of pork barrel politics the authorization conference agreemen t provides 50 million and the appropriations agreement 45 million th house and senate differed on the number of new fa18ef aircraft t procure and the house added funds for two unrequested f16 aircraft the authorization and appropriations conferences funded 30 f18s as requested and one f16 the administration objected to requirement in the senat authorization bill that the f22 aircraft complete certain testing befor additional procurement contracts are signed the authorization conferenc includes the restrictions but allows them to be waived the administratio n objected as well to some cuts in other areas that the house especially imposed to finance increases in certain programs including department f energy weapons programs the authorization conference agreement makes somewhat smaller cuts in these programs some longterm weapons issue s appear to have been resolved this year the battle over b2 bombe r procurement now appears over and the house national security committee did not renew its long fight to require design competition in the new attack submarine nssn program see tables a3 a4 and a5 below for action on major weapons programs military health care the house nd senate authorization bills both took steps to ensure that military retirees continue to have access to the defense healt h care system the senate bill approved three pilot projects to test alternative approaches and the house approved floor amendment to establish test of plan to allow military retirees to join the federal employees health benefit plan fehbp the authorization conference includes pilot projects to tes t fehbp using the dod tricare program as supplement for medicare and giving retirees access to tricare pharmacy benefits each of these issues and background on other matters is discussed below in mor detail defense policy issues budget constraints the results of last years quadre nnial defense review qdr and its companion reports ongoing battles over some social issues and several other matters all combined to create broad agenda in this years defense debate ke matters of discussion included 1 military base closures 2 bosnia funding 3 controls on technology expo rts to china and some other nations 4 other efficiency measures 5 military readiness 6 longterm funding for defense modernization 7 military personnel levels 8 national guard and reserve funding and the role f army national guard combat units 9 major weapons programs including ballistic missile defense t he b2 bomber fighter aircraft and shipbuilding 10 number of social issues including sexual harassment and genderintegrated training an d 11 other matters including military health care policy and year 2000 compute r problems the following sections briefly review each of these issues the effect of budget constraints on the defense debate in considering the fy1999 d efense budget the congressional defense committees were constrained by the 1997 budget agreeme nt since the administration request for fy1999 was right at the agreed level of defense spending of 2705 billion in new budget authority thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs8 this point is based on briefing for congressional staff by under secretary of defens e1 comptroller william j lynn iiidefense debate in congress init ially amounted to zerosum game any amounts that congress added for programs it favored and any proposed administratio n reductions that it rejected would have to be offset by reductions in other defens programs this repr esents sharp break with the experience of the past three years in which congress has added substantial amounts to annual administration defense budget requests for details see table c2 in appendix c in the end congres s provided an additional 83 billion for defense programs as part of the omnibu s appropriations bill but this was not considered until the very end of the process the budget constraints could have l ed to confrontation between congress and the administration over defense priorities in which congress would add money for programs it felt the administration had neglected and pay for the additions by cutting some high priority administration programs for their part senior administratio n officials said that they tried to avo id potential conflicts by meeting congress half way on programs of ongoing congressional interest among other things officials say1 they fully funded national missile defense development they requested more money than in the past for national guard and reserve equipment they made an effort t identify and fund all defense health program costs and they moved funding for th next nimitzclass aircraft carrier forward one year to fy2001 to avoid gap i n production for the most part contentious debate over priorities within the defense budget did not materialize in house and senate action fy1999 defense authorization an d appropriations bills while the house and senate provided some money fo r unrequested weapons programs and ot her priorities the amounts are relatively small the amounts later added for defense in the omnibus appropriations bill for the most part did not go to contentious weapons programs except for 1 billion added fo r ballistic missile defense the quadr ennial defense review this years congressional defense debate was also affected b the outcome of last years quadrennial defense review qdr and two subsequent reports the defense r eform initiative report and the report of the national defense panel the qdr released on may 19 1997 was thoroughgoing reassessment of us defense policy by the department of defense the defense reform initiative report issued on november 10 1997 identified number of efficiency measures the national defense panel report released n december 1 1997 reviewed the qdr and focused on potential defense requirements in the 20102020 period each of these reports highlighted themes that will b important ongoing matters of discussion in congress among other things the qdr proposed revised ver broad statement of us defense strategy reaffirmed the requirement that us forces be able to prevail in two nearly simultaneous major theater wars proposed measures to reduce pressures on the force created by the relatively large number of smallerscale contingenc operations in the postcold war era and identified key elements of the socalle d revolution in military affairs rma the qdr and the defense reform initiativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs9 department of defense the report of the departme nt of defense on base realignment and2 closure april 1998 administration officials point out that the 1995 base closure commission recommended that3 work at the california and texas depots either be transferred to other depots or be mad subject to competition by private companies they insi st therefore that privatization in place is not insistent with the commissions recommendationsemphasi zed the need for increased efficiency in order to save money for weapon s modernization and both strongly endorsed two more rounds of military base closures the national defense panel report endorsed much of the qdr including its focus on shaping the international security environment and on efficiency measures but the panel also called for greater emphas is on homeland defense and on preparations for potentially very different kinds of threats in the future the panel argued that s emphasis should be placed on prepa ring to fight two major theater wars and more on preparing for the future and it called for 5 to 10 billion more to be spent each year on experimental force exercises and new technology additional military base closures both the quadrennial defense review and the defense reform initiative repo rt recommended two more rounds of military base closures as critical means of saving money to finance future defense modernization programs the defense department formally proposed two more closure rounds in its legislative plan last year one round i n 1999 and another in 2003 congress was not receptiv to the proposal however and dod did not pursue the proposal s vigorously as it did this year this year secretary cohen made congressiona l approval of two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 into one of his to p priorities on april 2 the defense department released report on base closures that was required by the fy1998 defense authorization act the report reaffirms earlier2 dod estimates that previous base closure rounds in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 will lead to annual savings of about 56 billion per year beginning in fy2000 on this basis the defense department projec ts that two future base closure rounds each as large as the earlier average will lead to annual savings of 28 billion in todays prices when fully phased in these amounts officials argue are crucial to pay fo r weapon s programs that are expected to begin production at the end of the nex t decade within congress resistance to more base closures has been hardened b objections to administration action following the 19 95 base closure round the 1995 base closure commission recommended that two air force aircraft depo t maintenance facilities in sacr amento california and san antonio texas be closed which would have left more work for depots in oklahoma georgia and utah the3 white house however instead developed plan to privatize in place at the tw sites ie private contractors would be allowed to bid for contracts to perfor m work at the two facilities this plan is now being implemented and th adminis tration argues that the results are positive with competition for contract s leading to better prices to many members of congress however the administration plan politicized the base closure process last year the defense uthorization bill was held up for several months by bitter dispute over proposals to sure that the remaining public facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs10 receive adequate work this spring lawmakers complained about an air forc memo discussing white house request that the defense department encourage private company to bid on contract to perform work at the sacramento facility in congressional hearings secretar cohen and other officials were told repeatedly that privatizat ion in place has eroded support for further base closures in response secretary c ohen has said that congress can include prohibition on privatization in place in any future base closure legislation cohen has also argued that congres s should approve more base closures now so th at the defense department can prepare for them in the longterm fy20002005 defense plan that it is now preparing for review of base

request for supplemental appropriations of about 1 8 billion in fy1998 to cover cos ts of extending the us mission in bosnia through the end of the fiscal year and f or costs of expanded operations in the persian gulf due to the confro ntation with iraq the second was an amendment to the fy1999 defense budget request asking for another 19 bill ion to cover costs of extending the mission in bosnia through fy1999 congress agreed to provide the fy1998 supplemental funding in hr 3579 discussed above the fy1999 re quest for bosnia was initially considered in the course of congressi onal action on the regular fy1999 funding bills and funding was ultimately prov ided in the onmibust appropriations bill hr 4328 the adminis tration requested that the additional fy1998 and fy1999 funding for bosnia be designated as emergency appropriations under the terms of the budget enforcemen t act this would raise caps on defense discretionary spending and n total discretiona ry spending by the amount provided so the costs would not have to be offset by cuts in other defe nse programs this proposal was contentious for the past three years congress had insisted that anticipated costs of ongoing militar operation s in bosnia the persian gulf and elsewhere be provided as part of regular defense appr opriations measures within caps on defense spending established in the annual budget process the fy 1998 and fy1999 supplemental funding has broken this precedent the administration argued that bosnia costs were not assumed i n defense plans at the time the 1997 budget agreement was reached if congress did not agree to designate the bosnia funding as emergency appropriations and bosni operations continue then the costs would have to be offset by cuts in other defense programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs11 congre ssional action in its version of the defense authorization bill sas c approved 19 billion for bosnia in f y1999 as an addition to the regular 2705 billion funding for national defens and explicitly said that the funding should be provided as emergency appropriations as the administration requested in its version of the authorization hnsc did not specifically address emergenc funding for bosnia but instead established cap of 19 billion on the amount that may be expended for bosnia in fy1999 with an additional 100 millio n available in case of emergency to protect us troops on may 21 the ful l house rejected motion by representative barney frank to recommit th authorization bill to committee with instructions to report revised bill tha t would cut off funds for operations in bosnia after dec 31 1998 without prior congressional pproval the housepassed defense appropriations bill also did not include emergency funding for bos nia on june 24 the senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by senator thurmond urging the president to reduce the us troop level in bosnia but in key test of policy it rejected an amendment by senator bob smith to cut off funds unless congress approves the deployment senators byrd and hut chison did not offer their amendment to require that the us troop presence in bosnia be drawn down to the averag level maintained by major allies on july 30 the senate added an amendment proposed by senator stevens to the defense appropriations bill to provide th requested 19 billion as emergency appropriations on the broader issue f congressional war powers the housepassed appropriations bill included provision proposed by representative skaggs to prohibit expenditures n offensive m ilitary action without advance congressional approval the senate however voted by 8 415 to table an identical amendment to the appropriations bill offered by senator durbin the white house threatened veto if the skaggs provision were included in the appropriati ons bill the authorization conference agreement approves 19 billion in emergency funding for bosnia but it must still be appropriated the conference agreement also all ows expenditure of more than that provided the president certifies that the funding is needed for national security and will not reduce readiness the appropriation s conference agreement does not include emergency funding for bosnia leaving the issue for late r consideration the skaggs amendment was dropped in the appropriation s conference agreement requested

amendments to the defense authorization bill to restrict technology exports to china and other countries one amendment limited expo rt of missile and satellite technology and provision of technical

number of amendments concerning technology exports to china relations with china and trad sanctions were pr oposed in senate action on the defense authorization bill on june 23 the senate rejected motion to table four chinarelated amendments by senator hutchinson and debate on china policy was then put off senator hutchinson then said that he planned to offer his amendments when the senate took up the defense appropriations bill senator stevens however delayed floor action on the bill reportedly in part because he was concerned that contentious amendments on china or other issues could derail the bill ultimately the senate considered number of chinarelated issues in action on other bills and senator hutchinson offered single revised amendment on the defense appropriations bill this

deeper cuts in overhead personnel and third how congress wil l react to privatization measures at local facilities over the past couple of years the house in particular has sought t impose deep cuts

military readiness has been focus of intense attention in congressional hearing s throughout the year many members of congress have cited repeated reports about readinessrelated problems ranging from shortage of ai r force fighter aircra ft spare engines to drop in army standards for new recruits to shortfalls in army personnel in key skill areas including combat infantry to drastic decline in pilot retention rates in the air force and the navy these are symptoms some conclude of an imminent readiness crisis brought about first by inadequat funding for defense and second by the clinton administrations willingness t commit us forces to more missions abroad than the force can reasonably support in response administration officials acknowledged some problems but the insisted that there is overall crisis in readiness now or in the foreseeable future early deploying units they say remai n fully ready though some later deploying units may take longer than in the past to prepare evidence of pro blems they say is largely based on ane cdotes that do not accurately portray the state of the force overal l readiness reports they insist continue to show highly qualified and capable force problems that have occurred are being fixed some air force engine spares fo r example were in short supply because of mistakes in projecting failure rates but the planning models have now been changed pilot retention has been problem in part because of airline hiring and in part because of demands of operations abroad but sustained effort to resolve the problem is underway congress approved highe r pilot reenlistment bonuses last year and several steps are being taken to limi t deployments army recruiting continues to meet longstanding quality goals most recently however officials in the services have expressed growing concerns abou t personnel recruitment and retention on septemb er 15 the president met with senior military officers who reportedly identified increasingly seri ous readiness problems and urged support for higher defense spending on september 28 the joint chief s testified before the senate armed services committee about the state of militar readiness and identified need for more that 17 billion per year in additional defense spending later in response to questions of senator mccain the chiefs identifie d shortfalls of as much as 135 billion over five years cong ressional action hnsc restructured operation and maintenance funding to provide more money for depot maintenance and real property maintenance it also mandated substantial changes in readiness reporting which do dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98205crs14 complains will be difficult and costly to implement sasc also provided limited additional amounts for readinessrelated accounts in floor action on the defense appropriations bill the senate approved an amendment by senators domenici and harkin to require reports on food stamp use by military families and other factors related to family life morale and retention the senate also adopted hutchison amendment statin g the sense of the congress that readiness has been eroded by combination of declining budgets and expanded missions including the mission in bosnia the authorization conference agreement require s improved readiness reporting provides more money for recruiting and various troop benefits increases added pay for fli ght duty and emphasizes quality of life measures such as day care c enters and housing in construction programs the fy1999 om nibus appropriations bill includes 13 billion for enhanced military readiness the bill did not however make changes that some had sought i n military retirement benefits as way of bolstering personnel retention longterm funding for defense modernization the flip side of the military readiness issue concerns the adequacy of longterm weapons modern ization programs in recent years the administ ration has given very high priority to readinessrelated funding as result from year to year funding that the defense department d planned to spend on weapons procurement has instead had to be reallocated t operation an d maintenance accounts which are most closely related to readiness in the fy1999 budget this problem has not been completely resolved the requested level of procurement funding 487 billion is very close to the level that was planned last year there was some decline officials acknowledge but only they say because of adjustments in weapons programs following the quad rennial defense review but this is true only because the administration requested funding for fy1999 bosni costs as emergency appropriations not subject to the cap on overall defense spending if the budget had to absorb bosnia costs then procurement spending would likel decline more generally the administration has set goal of building up procuremen t funding to 60 billio n per year by fy2001 to meet this goal without an increase in overall defense spending however flies in the face of historical experience in th defense budget as senior defense officials candidly ac knowledge the administration hopes to meet the t arget by applying base closure and other efficiency savings to the procurement accounts failure to chieve planned savings however would put off reaching the target as would continued growth in weapons maintenance costs unplanned quality of life requirements costs of contingency operations not funde d through emergency appropriations health care cost growth or any of number f other expenses recently under secretary of defense jacques gansler

congress to proposed personnel cuts while few object to reductions in suppor t activities many argue that active duty forces are already being strained by th requirements of contingency opera tions

assumption that units would be filled out with individual reservists i n the event of major conflict but in handling smallerscale operations this aggravat burdens on the force because units sent to bosnia or elsewhere are fully manned in part by drawing personnel from other active duty units increasing shortages elsewhere for the past two years 4 congress has set floors on active duty personnel levels in order to carry out th qdr reductions congress must agree to reduce or eliminate the statutory floors some members of congress do not want to do so congressional action the administration requested that active duty end strength be reduced by more than 35 000 from the authorized fy1998 level and by about 24000 from the actual fy1998 level and that congress repea l statutory floors on

costly gaps in production congress has also ensured that major shipyard s have enough work to cover overhead and development costs and to maintain trained employment levels one major issue carried over from last year concerns procurement of the cvn77 the last of the planned nimitzclas s aircraft carriers the navy had until recently planned to buy dod has now moved up planned procurement of cvn77 to the fy2001 budget ful l funding had b een planned in fy2002 this is an alternative to plan that the carrier shipbuilder newport news shipbuilding nns h ad proposed last year to provide acce

the new dod plan will not save as much but it also avoids big bill in fy1999 and fy2000 another longerterm issue concerns development of the nex t generation dd21 destroyer last year ingalls shipbuilding company f mississippi and bath iron works of maine agreed to team together i n developing and building the ship the navy initially agreed to the teamin g arrangement but then became concerned that competing team appeared to seek the contract most recently the navy has reached agreement with th ship builders and with combat system integrators for lockheedmartin an d bath to form
