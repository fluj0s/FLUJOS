financial cooperatives organized by people with common bond they are the only depository institutions exempt from the federal corporate income tax as financial cooperatives credit unions only accept deposits of members and make loans only to members other credit unions or credit union organizations many members of congress advocate reliance on market forces rather than tax policy to allocate resources furthermore some members of congress are interested in additional sources of revenue in order to either reduce the deficit offset the cost of higher federal outlays or make up for tax cuts elsewhere consequently the exemption of credit unions from federal income taxes has been questioned if this exemption were repealed both federally chartered and statechartered credit unions would become liable for payment of federal corporate income taxes on their retained earnings but not on earnings distributed to depositors for fy2008 october 1 2007 through september 30 2008 the department of the treasury estimates that federal taxation of credit unions would yield revenues of approximately 148 billion also for fy2009 october 1 2008 through september 30 2009 the joint committee on taxation estimates that federal taxation of credit unions with assets of 10 million or more would yield revenue of approximately 180 billion credit unions differ in some aspects from other providers of financial services but financial deregulation continues to lessen these differences deregulation has resulted from new legislation and decisions of regulatory agencies proponents of the taxation of credit unions argue that deregulation has led to vigorous competition between credit unions and other depository institutions they maintain that the tax exemption gives credit unions an unfair competitive advantage over other depository institutions and there is market failure that justifies government intervention with tax subsidy supporters of the tax exemption claim that despite deregulation credit unions are still unique depository institutions they assert that the purpose of credit unions is to serve the financial needs of their members rather than to maximize profits they argue that taxation would eliminate this service character of credit unions on july 23 2007 and december 20 2007 the treasury released two reports concerning us business taxation and global competitiveness in these reports the treasury presented for discussion purposes proposal to reduce corporate tax rates and broaden the corporate tax base by eliminating specific business tax preferences including the tax exemption of credit unions nevertheless in the 110 th congress as of january 28 2008 legislation concerning the tax exempt status of credit unions had been introduced in the future technological change and deregulation will likely further increase competition between credit unions and other depository institutions the income tax exemption for credit unions therefore likely will be the subject of further debate this report will be updated in the event of significant legislative activity or policy proposals httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97548g21g145g152g158g149g141

distinguishes them from the general public every member of credit union is an owner and may vote for credit union officers and policies credit unions do not have separate capital stock instead their capital consists of their members shares in accumulated reserves 6 credit unions cannot raise capital by issuing stock but utilize retained earnings to finance expansion credit unions are either federally chartered or statechartered each credit union is governed by board of directors the board exercises general supervision over all functional areas including membership and credit applications

directors shall elect from their number the board officers specified in the bylaws8 for june 2007 the 8504 credit unions had 896 million members and total assets of 7644 billion9 thus credit unions had an average of 899 million in assets although most credit unions are small some are large for year end 2005 the 100 largest credit unions had assets of 1043 million or more10 among depository financial institutions the concept of common bond is unique to credit unions in 1970 the national credit union ad ministration ncua was established by the federal government to regulate the credit union industry the ncua has specified four categories of common bonds single occupational single associational multiple common bond and community credit union members in the single occupational category are employed by the same enterprise such as the abc corporation credit union in this category may also serve trade industry or profession such as all teachers members of single associational category belong to groups of individuals who participate in activities that develop common loyalties mutual benefits and mutual interests such as the knights of columbus single associational group must sponsor activities providing for contact among members credit union with multiple common bond consists of combination of occupational andor associational groups members in the community category have common bond based on employment or residence in geographic area with clearly defined boundaries11 in the late 1970s and early 1980s serious economic dislocations threatened the financial stability of many federal credit unions12 hence beginning in 1982 the national credit union administration made series of administrative rulings that allowed multiplegroup federal credit unions that is combinations of existing federal credit unions that do not share common bond in 1990 the american bankers association and several small north carolina banks filed lawsuit challenging the ncuas approval of multiplegroup field of membership expansion for federal credit unions on february 25 1997 the united states supreme court at the urging of the clinton administration agreed to hear arguments in the case on february 25 1998 the us supreme court ruled in favor of the banking industry legislation was introduced to address the concerns of the credit union industry on august 7 1998

curia was introduced as hr 1537 this act would modernize capital requirements raise the cap on member business lending enhance the ability of credit unions to serve financially underserved areas and

the federal income tax was enacted state chartered credit unions were not specifically exempt in 1917 an administrative ruling by the us attorney general exempted state chartered credit unions from federal income taxation 15 in 1934 congress passed the federal credit union act which authorized the chartering of federal credit unions this act contained federal tax exemption and allowed states to tax federal credit unions in the same manner as banks in 1937 congress amended the act to exempt federal credit unions from both federal and state income taxes because of their service to members 16 until 1951 all savings and loans sls were exempt from federal income taxes under the same tax code provision the revenue act of 1951 repealed the tax exemption for sls but the exemption for federal and state credit unions was continued under separate tax code provision17 but congress provided sls facto exemption from federal income taxes by permitting liberal allowance for bad debt reserves this facto exemption continued until the revenue act of 1962 which reduced the liberal allowance for bad debt reserves18 federally chartered credit unions are exempt from all taxes including income taxes imposed by any state territorial or local taxing authority except for local real or personal property taxes19 states vary in their tax treatment of statechartered credit unions few states exempt state chartered credit unions from their state income taxes many states tax statechartered credit unions the same as statechartered thrifts and several states tax statechartered credit unions the same as any other business 20 before the passage of the tax reform act of 1986 numerous specific tax preferences were given to depository institutions except credit unions which were and are exempt the primary justification for these tax preferences was the extensive regulations imposed on depository institutions these tax preferences reduced the effective tax rate on operations of depository institutions below the effective tax rate on operations of average us corporate businesses continued report is available on request from the author 14 for an explanation of the contents of this

should be neutral concerning economic decision making they believed that the market forces of supply and demand could more efficiently allocate resources than the tax system consequently tax preferences for specific industries or sectors should be eliminated or curtailed they argued that the elimination or reduction of tax preferences would broaden the tax base and permit lower marginal tax rates therefore economic resources would be allocated more efficiently financial deregulation had been reducing both the differences among depository institutions and between depository institutions and other industries thus tax preferences for depository institutions were more difficult to justify if the tax system is to be more neutral and resources are to be allocated by market forces rather than federal regulations consequently the tax reform act of 1986 curtailed or eliminated tax preferences of depository institutions the three most important of these tax preferences were deductions for additions to bad debt reserves the deduction for interest to carry tax exempt obligations and special rules for net operating losses the more neutral federal tax system heightened criticism of the tax exemption of credit unions how does credit union taxation compare with that of other firms in economic terms for typical corporation income taxes are paid on income from equityfinanced investment whether retained or paid in dividends shareholders equity owne rs pay individual income taxes on dividends and capital gains taxes on the nominal appreciation if any in the value of their stock in the year that the stock is sold income from debt financed investment is tax exempt at the corporate level interest paid on bonds is deductible expense to the corporation but taxable income to bondholders most corporate equity investment is thus taxed twice debt once commercial banks and thrift institutions are taxed like other corporations except for the tax treatment of depositors in compensation for their deposits depositors receive mix of interest payments and free or below cost services interest payments received by depositors are subject to the individual income tax free or below cost services are not subject to the individual income tax but the cost of providing these services are expenses to the commercial bank or thrift since it is not administratively feasible to allocate the reduced cost of financial services among depositors it is not possible to levy income taxes on these services 21 thus at least part of banks income from debt is exempt from both corporate and individual tax bank equity income is taxed twice debt once at the most income of credit unions is exempt at the corporate level whether retained or distributed and as with banks portion of the income distributed to members in compensation for their deposits called member dividends is subject to individual income tax while the portion distributed as enhanced member services is not taxed thus in contrast to corporationsincluding corporate banksno credit union income is taxed twice credit union income is taxed once at the most under the individual income tax taxing credit unions in manner similar to corporate banks would require at least applying corpor ate tax to retained credit union earnings 22 21 most developed nations with valueadded taxes exclude financial services from taxation because it is not administratively practicable to measure valueadded received by customers 22 in theory it might be argued that since members are also equity owners of credit unions portion of income and benefits accruing to stockholders is actually distributed credit union equitylike earnings and simply taxing retained earnings would apply tax to only part of income from equitylike investment however it is not administratively feasible to assess the value of these distributed equitylike benefits and pr oposals to tax credit unions have been limited to applying the corporate income tax to retained earnings httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97548g21g145g152g158g149g141 g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g23g151g146g152g151g156g561g4g142g561g22g138 g161g142g141g501g561 g561

the tax treatment of another type of financial intermediary life insurance companies23 life insurance companies receive special treatment under the corporate income tax they are subject to low level of tax compared to other financial intermediaries excepting of course credit unions further the earnings of depositors ie policyholders are lightly taxed under the individual income tax because the inside buildupgrowth of cash valueson insurance policies is not subject to tax g6g142g155g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 over the past 30 years most of the distinct ions between credit unions and other depository institutions have been eliminated or reduced because of deregulation consequently the justification for the tax exemption for credit unions has been increasingly questioned proponents of deregulation argue that resources can usually be more efficiently allocated by market forces than government regulations they do not advocate the elimination of all regulations but rather greater reliance on market forces proponents maintain that deregulation increases competition which benefits customers through better access to services at lower prices furthermore deregulation leads to more integrated financial markets which improves national economic efficiency both federallychartered and statechartered credit unions have been deregulated as discussed in the following sect ion the discretionary powers of statechartered credit unions compared with those of federally chartered credit unions vary among states deregulation can be divided into price geographic and product deregulation price deregulation concerns the loosening or elimination of restrictions on interest rates that depository institutions may pay on supplies of funds and charge on loans price deregulation has caused credit to be rationed more by price than by availability many individual savers benefitted from price deregulation because they could earn higher interest rates on their deposits geographic deregulation has been particularly important to commercial banks and bank holding companies which were prevented by federal and state banking laws from offering full service interstate banking the office of the comptroller of the currency made rules that have expanded intrastate bank branching the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 pl 103328 authorized nationwide interstate banking through the holding company format effective september 29 1995 effective june 1 1997 under this law the federal bank regulatory agencies may approve mergers between banks in different states unless the home state of one of the banking institutions has opted out by enacting law explicitly prohibiting merger transactions involving outofstate banks that applies equally to all outofstate banks 24 in 1991 the national credit union administration permitted credit unions to share branches thus giving them an inexpensive way of expanding their geographic coverage25 in may 1992 the office of thrift supervision permitted nationwide branching by all thrift institutions26 23 for an overview of the taxation of life insurance see crs report rl32000 taxation of life insurance

federal credit union may not establish new branch office for the purpose of adding group combining with another credit union through multiplegroup charter27 product deregulation is blurring the distinctions among products offered by different types of depository institutions eg checking accounts credit cards mortgages etc product deregulation has been accelerated by the mergers of some large financial and nonfinancial firms also many firms have found methods of circumventing existing laws in order to offer additional financial products the enactment of the grammleachbliley act pl 106102 in 1999 facilitated affiliation among banks securities firms and insurance companies permitting financial conglomerates to crosssell variety of financial products to their customers onestop shopping 28 this act also allowed national and state banks to create financial subsidiaries for diversification into insurance sales and fullservice securities activities under specified conditions29 in addition this act permitted banking financial holding companies to invest in nonfinancial businesses for share of the profits30 deregulation has resulted in the rapid expansion of most services offered by credit unions larger credit unions tend to offer wider range of services than smaller credit unions deregulation has been implemented by legislation and rulings by the national credit union administration but credit unions compared to other depository institutions still have restrictions on their powers to lend and invest funds for example the cred it union membership access act pl 105219 limits business loans to members to 1225 of total assets 31 also credit unions may only extend lines of credit to their members to other credit unions and to credit union organizations32 the treasury compared the basic statutory and regulatory rules applied to depository institutions across four broad categories institution powers safety and soundness regulatory enforcement authority and consumer protection the treasury concluded that federal credit unions generally operate within the same legal framework as other federally insured depository institutions most differences between credit unions and other depository institutions derive from the structure of credit unions we found this to be most likely in the case of safety and soundness rules where credit union operations interact directly with the operation of the rules with regard to enforcement and consumer protection rules few differences exist credit unions have fewer powers available to them than do banks and thrifts but through cusos credit union service organization credit unions may provide their members with panoply of sophisticated financial services and products that rivals the offerings of banks and thrifts 33 continued 26 ibid 27 kessler p 10 28 crs report rl30375 major financial services legislation the grammleachbliley act pl 106102 an overview by f jean wells and william d jackson 29 ibid 30

deregulation has caused extensive competition among depository institutions these institutions actively compete for deposits by offering the best terms including the highest rate of return to depositors depository institutions also compete for borrowers by offering the best loan terms in cluding the lowest interest rates proponents of taxation argue that the concept of the common bond has continued to weaken for example the omniamerican federal credit union counts 137000 members employed at 1300 businesses and organizations ranging from the boy scouts of america to pier one imports at the end of 1996 assets totaled 517 million34 another example the wescom credit unions field of membership includes the 16 million people living in angeles ventura orange riverside and san bernardino counties35 tax proponents maintain that vigorous competition between credit unions and other depository institutions justifies the same tax treatment for all institutions they argue that for market forces to allocate resources efficiently depository institutions should have level playing field but in this view the income tax exemption for credit unions gives them competitive advantage over other depository institutions credit unions pay income taxes on earnings whether distributed or retained credit unions can earn tax free interest on their retained earnings proponents assert that credit unions have lower operating costs because of their tax exemption consequently credit unions can pay depositors higher rates of return and charge borrowers lower interest rates it can be argued that the income tax exemption for credit unions has enabled them to grow more rapidly than other depository institutions the american bankers association aba states that traditionally credit unions were based on simple concept bring together closelyknit group of people pool their resources and provide small loans for one another 36 the aba argues that the tax exemption has allowed some of these traditional credit unions to morph into highly competitive financial institutions virtually indistinguishable from banks37 the aba maintains that credit unions that have adhered to the traditional principles should continue to benefit from the tax preferences38 but the aba argues that credit unions that have morphed into large aggressive financial institutions should lose their tax exemption39 supporters of the credit union tax exemption emphasize the uniqueness of credit unions compared to other depository institutions credit unions are nonprofit financial cooperatives directed by volunteers for the purpose of serving their member s credit unions provide many services free or below cost in order to assist members these services include small loans financial counseling 34

credit unions would create pressure to eliminate these subsidized services furthermore taxing credit unions would raise the cost of credit to many people without an alternative source of credit concern has been expressed in congress about the access of lower income families to basic depository services the american bankers association cites surveys th at concluded that members of credit unions had higher average incomes higher average educational levels and higher rate of home ownership than nonmembers 40 hence the aba argues that the credit union industry is giving faulty image of their membership41 yet an official of the credit union national association cites recent survey conducted by gallup for the aba that found that the average household income of bank customers was 51000 per year compared to 46000 per year for credit union members42 the government accountability office gao found that the extent to which credit unions serve persons of modest means is not definitively known because of limited data and lack of indicators43 gao also concluded that federal reserve board data suggest that credit unions serve slightly lower proportion of low and moderateincome households than do banks44 supporters of the tax exemption argue that credit unions are subject to certain regulatory constraints not required of other depository institutions and that these constraints reduce the competitiveness of credit unions for example credit unions are not subject to the internal control reporting requirements that the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 imposed on banks and thrifts 45 these restrictions arguably impose an implicit tax on credit unions supporters of the tax exemption point out that under changes made to the internal revenue code by the small business job protection act of 1996 financial institutions including banks thrifts and their parent holding companies are able to elect subchapter s corporation status under the code and generally receive passthrough tax treatment for federal income tax purposes if certain criteria are met 46 thus financial institution with subchapter s status is generally not subject to the federal corporatelevel income tax the corporations taxa ble income flows through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership and the shareholders pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income supporters of the tax exemption point out that the credit union membership access act pl 105219 states that 40 american bankers association credit union

participants in the financial services market are exempt from federal and most state taxes because they are memberowned democratically operated notforprofit organizations generally managed by volunteer boards of directors and because they have the specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers especially persons of modest means 47

administration opposed taxing credit unions49 on march 16 2004 donald powell chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation stated that credit unions ought to pay taxes the playing field has shifted in recent years weve gone from 20 credit unions with assets of more than 1 billion ten years ago to 83 such institutions today more and more were seeing credit union advertising touting the benefits of membership over doing business with bank in my view if they are going to compete with banks then we should do our best to ensure that the competition is fair 50 on june 2 2004 three major banking trade groups announced that they had jointed forces to campaign against the taxexempt status of credit unions the american bankers association the independent community bankers association icba and the americas community bankers established the intertrade credit union coordinating council to campaign against what they considered to be unfair competitive advantages of credit unions

mr leighty was referring to tax foundation report sponsored by the icba which was critical of the tax exempt status of credit unions53 in response the credit union national association cuna published an analysis of the tax foundation report cuna defended the tax exempt status of credit unions and argued that the tax foundation study was flawed54 on march 1 2005 before the credit union national

federal credit unions conference board member counseled representatives of credit unions on how to retain the tax exemption for credit unions56 on november 1 2005 the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform issued its report which included two proposals for fundamental tax reform one proposal would broaden the income tax base and lower tax rates the other proposal would eliminate most tax preferences and shift the current income tax base to primarily consumption tax base neither of these proposals explicitly recommended the repeal of the tax exempt status of credit unions because these proposals would broaden the tax base however it is likely that each proposal would repeal the tax exemption also on november 1 2005 ed yingling president and chief executive officer of the american bankers association aba said that the aba will use the courts to challenge the credit union tax exemption because the tax exemption gives credit unions an unfair competitive advantage over

their tax exemption i ask that you be mindful of your proper role as an independent and objective regulator of credit unions as you move forward with your data collection project i also want to notify you that i am asking the government accountability office to expand its current review of credit union tax exemption to include an analysis of the independence and objectivity of the ncua the ncuas vigilance is critical to ensuring thorough oversight of credit unions as well as balanced analysis of their taxexempt status 60 in november 2006 the national credit union administration released report titled member service assessment pilot program 61 the ncua stated the this report provided the most conclusive data to date available on the membership profiles of fcus federal credit unions62 the ncua concluded that their study demonstrates that fcus are serving those they have been chartered to serve working individuals confirms the expectation that fcus desi gnated as lowincome with underserved areas or with community base have better opportunities to serve lower income groups and individuals and generally have more diverse membership profiles as compared to fcus with more restrictive common bonds and fields of membership strengthens ncuas previous position that changes in membership profiles do not occur immediatelythey take time 63 but former house ways and means committee chairman william thomas stated that the ncua still has much more work ahead of them with respect to transparency and data collection64 he also asserted that the ncua had overstated the

adoption of underserved areas to increas credit union services to individuals of modest means despite increased credit union participation in these programs and the expansion of community charters the 2004 and 2001 survey of consumer finances indicated that credit unions lagged behind banks in serving low and moderateincome households ncua officials told gao that given the nascent nature of its two initiatives and the relatively recent shift to community charters they did not yet expect observable changes in the data also ncua recently has undertaken pilot effort to collect data on the income characteristics of credit union members because limited data exist on the extent to which credit unions serve those of modest means any assessment would be enhanced if ncua were to move beyond its pilot and systematically collect income data 67 gao also stated that executive compensation for federal credit unions is not transparent largely because federal credit unions are not required to publicly file information on executive compensation68 g6g142g139g138g157g142g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343g342g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 the presidents budget for fy2008

on july 23 2007 the us department of the treasury held conference on business taxation and global competitiveness the treasury released background paper that argued that the current business tax base includes an array of special provisions that reduce taxes for particular types of activities industries and businesses these provisions take the form of exclusion from income deductions allowed or enhanced from what otherwise would be allowed preferential tax rates income deferral and tax credits some of these provisions are intended to ease tax compliance and administ ration such as allowing cash accounting for small corporations but others were intended by congress to encourage particular types of activity the premise underlying many of the special provisions is that they promote activities that have spillover effects or addr ess various externalities or market failures unwarranted tax subsidies may lead to the misallocation of capital as they encourage investment decisions based on tax characteristics rather than economic fundamentals and generally reduce economic growth 67 ibid highlights page 68 ibid p 6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97548g21g145g152g158g149g141

base which requires that tax rates be higher in order to raise the same tax revenue for example it is estimated that these special corporate tax provisions na rrow the corporate tax base by roughly 25 percent if the tax base were broadened by removing these special provisions the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent could be reduced to 27 percent or as an alternative about 40 percent of investment costs could be written off immediately ie expensed by all businesses 69 the treasury states that the united states has the second highest statutory corporate tax rate among countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an organization consisting of most developed countries70 the treasury maintains that broadening the corporate tax base and reducing the statutory corporate tax rate would improve the global competitive position of the united states 71 the tax expenditures that the treasury proposes to eliminate includes the exemption of credit union income which is estimated to raise 19 billion during the period fy2008fy201772 this 19 billion would equal approximately 153 of the total amount of 1241 billion from the treasurys proposed broadening

type of consumption tax 2 eliminating special business tax provisions coupled with either business tax rate reduction or faster writeoff of business investment potentially combined with the exemption of active foreign earnings and 3 implementing specific changes that focus on important structural problems within our business tax system rather than present particular recommendation this report examines the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches the various policy ideas discussed in this report represent just some of the approaches that could be considered this report does not advocate any specific recommendation nor does it call for or advance any legislative package or regulatory changes 81 in the first approach the proposed business activities tax ba t is

lists the exemption of credit union income83 as previously stated in the july 23 2007 report for the period fy2008fy2017 this table indicates that the amount of revenue that would be raised by eliminating this special tax provision would be 19 billion84 the total estimated revenue yield from eliminating the business tax preferences both corporate and noncorporate would be 1326 billion which would allow reduction in the top business tax rate both corporate and noncorporate from 35 to 28 85 79 bankers group applauds treasurys efforts to reduce corporate tax rates opposes exempt status for

daniel mica president and ceo of the credit union national association sent letter to secretary of the treasury henry paulson in his letter mr mica stated to achieve the goal of reduced corporate income taxes the paper focuses on repealing various business tax breaks listing the exemption of credit union income among the preferences as we pointed out in our previous letter such listing wholly contradicts the 2004 letter to cuna from president bush in which he stated i support strongly the taxexempt status of credit unions and will continue to highlight the important contributions that credit unions make to financial system we have already pointed out the inappropriate contrast between the reports silence on the substantial benefits of credit unions to consumers while lauding subchapter s corporations and other flowthrough entities that are part of what the report calls the noncorporate sector because credit unions are nonstock notforprofit cooperatives that operate for the mutual benefit of their members they do not compete in the marketplace for investment funds with stock companies or other forprofit entities that offer higher potential return than interest on savings account 86 in response to the issuance of the second treasury report reportedly keith liggett senior economist at the american bankers association applauded the idea of taxing credit union especially large ones that have moved away from their mission of serving customers of modest means and are morphing into large sophisticated banklike entities87 mr liggett also reportedly said if the subsidy is not going for its purpose it questions the efficacy of maintaining this exemption and if you are going to look at lowering corporate taxes preferences just really distort the allocation of resources 88 g22g155g142g151g141g156g561 in the future technological change and deregulation may further increase competition between credit unions and other depository institutions it should be noted that thrift institutions were exempt from the federal income tax until 1951 the tax exemption for thrift institutions was eliminated because congress felt that the relationship between thrifts and their members had substantially changed in the 1980s 1990s and through 2007 the credit union industry grew more rapidly than other depository industries and this more rapid growth may continue since many believe that an economically neutral tax system requires that financial institutions engaged in similar activities should have the same tax treatment the income tax exemption for credit unions may occasion continuing debate 86 daniel mica letter to secretary of treasury henry paulson dec 21 2007 87 robert barba treasury report retains notion of taxing cus american banker vol 173 6 jan 9
