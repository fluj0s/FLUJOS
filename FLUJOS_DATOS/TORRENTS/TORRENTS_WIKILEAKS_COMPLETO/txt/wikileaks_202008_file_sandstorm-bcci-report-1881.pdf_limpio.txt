bank ing act 1987 in connection with our audit of sandstorm sa the company and its related articles including sandstorm holdings holdings and sandstorm overseas overseas together with the sandstorm group sandstorm the group or the bank for the year ended 31 december 1988 certain irregularities were drawn to ou r attention and to that of the bank of england the bank by in january 1991 in accordance with your letter of instruction of 4 march 1991 we have prepared report on these irregularities and related matters which have come to our attention during the course of our work this comprised work in connection with the au dit of team which included partners and staff of price waterhouse review of corre spondence and other files previously held by and interviews with senior management many of the findings summarised on this report arise from examinat ion of documentation and interviews with former management by members of the investi gation team whilst the findings are inevitably based on incomplete informatio n and certain details have not been corroborated we believe that the enclosed report provi des fair reflection of what has occurred although detailed analyses of specific transaction s given in this report should be treated with care work by the investigation am is continuing and it is expected that many of the matters reported will be refined f urther as this work progresses it should be emphasised that much of the information contain ed in this report is based on records which have previously been concealed from us as auditors and only came to light as result of our insistence on the files of being sealed such records having been in his personal possession the particular matter drawn to the bank s attention by concerned potential deposits of approximately 600 million not recorded in the books of t he company or any of its related entities our work to date has confirmed that at l east the major element of these deposits appear to be valid facilities of the company or i ts96 xx june 1991 ra barnes esq page 2 related entities the government of abu dhabi has issued to holdings comfort letter of 600 million in the event that these liabilities become repayable as part of package of financial support arrangements concluded in may 1991 the accounting records and financial position of the group h as been falsified in relation to the above transactions for substantial number of years in fact these transactions represent only part of wholesale deception to misrepresent and falsify the financial position of sandstorm over the last decade through series of complicated manipulations these include the use of related bank fo rk overseas which now appears to have been controlled by sandstorm management nomin ee and hold harmless arrangements with substantial number of prominent middle ea stern individuals the irregular use of funds placed under management the formation of significant number of companies and operation of bank accounts outside the sandstorm group used to disguise the nature of transaction s and route funds the creation of further 70 or so companies to assist in the finan cing of agreements and unrecorded borrowings through third party banks and investment institutions and significant falsification of the accounting records inv olving false loans transactions and confirmations on such scale that the true fin ancial history of sandstorm is unlikely to be able to be recreated in order to place the unrecorded deposits in context we have briefly summarised the history of sandstorm and the manner in which deception on such scale was achieved with reference to some of the major customers and shareholder arrang ements and relationships our report is divided into the following ctions 1

directors of sandstorm our concerns about the relationsh ip between sandstorm and fork and about the involvement of f ork in the transactions which have financial implications for sandstorm copy fo ur report of 16 june 1991 is enclosed as an attachment to this report and includes examples of such transactions initiated by sandstorm management the informati on in the report is derived from review of correspondence and other files held b and from interviews with him and we have also had preliminary discussions with members of the investigation team who have rece ntly visited grand cayman as part of the sandstorm investigations responsibility for and knowledge of the irregularities management 123 from the investigation work it is apparent that the senior ma nagement of sandstorm have abused their responsibilities to depositors shareholders investors regulators and to the bank itself the strategic decisions to manipula accounts and in particular how to make use of the fork relationship the fund s placed with fork and the value within the shares of wxyz are clearly those of and 124 the inflation of treasury profits and use of unrecorded depo sits by to have been the sole responsibility of however it seems more likely that was responding to the expectations of and pa rticularly as in other areas eg there is evidence that was instrumental in account mani pulation as far back as the late 1970 s105 125 boxsolidboxsolid surrounded himself with core team who were largely responsib for the xxxxxx and falsification of documentation and fraudulent account entries and funds

team with its enquires 126 from the scale and complexity of the deception it is clear tha t most of the senior management of the bank who as noted were and remain extremel loyal to and were or should have been aware of certain elements of the f raud many simply followed instructions they should have questioned failure to do so appears to have arisen from blind loyalty to and brought about by the cultural b ackground where it was unthinkable to question either or it is also noteworthy that most of the senior management have been provided with significant loans from the bank wh ich on the basis of previous experience are not necessarily repayable on aving employment 127 we have particular questions concerning the existin g senior management of sandstorm as listed below we have not yet however interviewed all of them to obtain their version of events many of these senior executives have followed instructions from apparently without question and many others are likely to be similarly implicated boxsolidboxsolidboxsolid boxsolidboxsolidboxsolid 1 there is evidence of his approval of certain questionable transactions booked through the accounts of and used to repurchase sandstorm s shares from although his knowledge of the transactions concerned is uncertain appears106 to have accepted instructions in respect of this matter from without question 2 over the period from april 1990 to december 1990 we believe that had substantial if not full knowledge of all the matters dealt with in this report yet did not disclose them even in response to direct questions until much later 3 over the last year he has given additional responsibilities to various individuals including some of those listed below who appear to have been involved in fraudulent transactions

arrangements but inform us that everything they did was at the request of and directors 129 in the light of the scale and comple xity of the deception it is difficult not to conclude that the board failed to discharge is responsibilities properly nevertheless there is indication with the possible exception of that the present board of directors was aware of the major irregularities within the bank and it is clear that it has been consistency provided with misleading and inaccurate f inancial and other information the board had not been informed of the xxxxx rmless or nominee arrangements or the bank s and its management s true relationship with number of major customers and shareholders 130 was director from 19 86 to 1988 and is implicated in irregular transactions relating to the purchase of his own shares in sand storm and ccah 131 all major loans had to be approved by the board but it appears that significant number of xxxxxxxxx went to the board for approval after disbursement of funds and thus effectively avoiding its control however there is l ittle evidence that the board took any effective action to limit of reduce the exposure to individual customer groups or monitor the implementation of the credit policy limits were often increased after the event without insistence on effective re covery action 132 overall the board appear to have been taken in by and t rusted dominant and deceitful management in the form of and shareholders 133 the relationship between and latterly with the major shareholders being the ruling family of abu dhabi goes back substantial number of years and has been very close one and subsequently acted as the ruler s personal investment advisor and had his power of attorney the extent to which was awa re of the matters discussed in this report cannot be established we are however informed that were brief ed fully on all the problems in april 1990 notwithstanding that they allowed the 1989 accounts to be finalised in discussions with ourselves and the regulators without disclosing this in formation in addition up until discussion of our report to the directors and regulators of 3 october 1990 contended that the loans for collections by the shareholders which have now been proven to be totally fictitious we re recoverable108 134 we have discussed with his own accounts with fork which show that the received funds in 1988 and earlier from transactions purporting to be dealing with sandstorm shares where it now is apparent that he had risk f loss he has confirmed that he has benefited from such transactions arranged by and that in april 1990 he informed other senior government offi cials of his involvement we are unable to establish the extent to which his positio n in relation to and may have been compromised as result of these transactions but w have become aware of his confirmation of what has now been reveal ed to be fictitious loan in the name of the he could not recollect signing the confirmation that was presented to him and suggested to us that his signature might have been forged 135 we have also seen circumstantial evidence of proposed share t ransaction with in 1981 on guaranteed return basis and an out of book loan from in 1985 to finance the unauthorised buyback of shares from 109 section 2 shares and captial notes 21 sandstorm was established in 1972 with an original share capi tal of 25 million through number of scrip and rights issues this had increased to 85 million at 31 december 1990 it appears that over the bank s history extensive use has been made of nominee arrangements to finance these increases in share capital shareholdings appear to have been financed both directly by loans from sandstorm and fork and also from accounts and companies under the control of and the use of nominee arrangements through fork entities has enabled sandstorm to disguise the beneficial ownership of sh ares and has also provided pool of shares for setting guaranteed yield obl igations and other adjustments including the generation of funds from share trad ing 22 some shareholders including acquired shares on the basis of guaranteed rates of return and others acquired their sh ares on the basis of buyback arrangements these seemed to have been practice to gain the favour of influential people in the middle east there is risk t hat remaining shareholders may make claims in respect of losses incurred on sandstorm shares which were purchased by them on the basis of buyback or guaranteed rate f return and to date one such claim has been made by former shareholder 23 investigation work tinues in this area but as at 31 december 1990 some four million shares 40 million nominal are effectively owned by sandstorm or fork through number of nominees including and we are informed that othe r nominee shares were purchased by and during 1990 if all these purchases were those of nominees which may well have been th case it would appear that some 45 of the share capital of sandstorm was in the hands of nominees at 31 december 1989 whilst further 11 was owned by fork entities 24 there is evidence that holders of capital notes entered int side agreements with fork which provided for repayment on demand instead of in acco rdance with the terms of the capital note issue there exists the possibility that the remaining note holders have entered into similar arrangements110 section 3 routing arrangements 31 s office in london was the source of instructions for the moveme nt of funds in order to cover the exposures on loan accounts these routing s transactions were effected by the special duties department on the instructions of and through number of bank ccounts including those controlled by at fork 32 from the routing bank accounts already identified it is possib to see that the initial transactions took place on small scale in 1981 and remained f airly insignificant until 1984 transactions appear to have ceased by 1990 with th exception of some accounts at controlled by of fork which were used until september 1990 33 the level of activity reached its peak in 1985 when some 16 billion was passed through bank accounts on the instructions of members of the special dutie s department this seems to coincide with the disclosure of the increasing difficul ties on the treasury activities 34 the end of the year 1986 also appears to have been rning point in the method of operation of routing accounts with significant reduction i n activity passed through affiliated banks 35 funds were needed to manipulate the records of loan accounts as well as to make good the deficiencies of the treasury operations and it seems that to some degree these two problems were separately managed close relationsh ip with companies enabled the special duties department to open accounts in customers names at number of banks including bcp luxembourg to date eleven such accounts have b een identified but available documentation remains patchy and further accounts may well exist proper account opening forms and confirmatory letters of p ayment instructions were procured from in order to avoid any suspicion about the purpose and nature of the transactions 36 aside from these bank accounts the special duties department also needed to generate transactions for other customer loan accounts relationships were established with bcci executives at other locations who wou ld pass payments across their nostro accounts apparently without the need for ful l customer mandate these transactions were generally effected by tested telexes using t he bcci london test key or on the basis of personal telephone calls from members of the partment these arrangements with bcp zurich bcci spain madrid kifco nd national bank of oman and sdcc were made possible by the knowledge that they riginated from the highest levels within the bank and doubt the staff felt tha t they were proving an essential service to the recording of these transactions appears to have been irregular and they were either not entered in the dgers or effected by single aided but compensating entries 36 transactions passing through spain kuwait and oman all app ear to have been identifiable to the ultimate beneficiary of the funds however transactions through bcp were marked pay without mentioning our name with the result that the recipient was unable to identify the source of funds 37 accounts operated by management of fork add further dimension to these routing arrangements accounts were opened at bcp luxembourg and in the name of fork client accounts or in the name of companies which had come under the control of fork management it appears that most all transactions were sourced by memo s or telephone calls from the special duties department to who would instruct payments to be made by fork staff in cayma n or on the basis of111 telephone calls to the branch managers would if needed then visit switzerland to sign confirmatory letters covering the execution of transactions 38 the ability of the special duties department to undertake transactions of this nature was undoubtedly facilitated by the corporate culture of th group and general belief expressed by number of those involved that whatev er was being undertaken by had to be in the best i nterest of the bank112 this page has been deliberately left blank113 section 4 treasury background 41 central treasury was division of the head office of sand storm overseas it was set up in london in 1982 to provide centralised and coordin ated vehicle for the investment of surplus funds generated by sandstorm worldwide on day to day basis investment and liquidity management services were rendered within prescribe d guidelines to treasury by the central support office in london 42 treasury activities fell into two distinct functions the investment function which traded in cd s treasury bonds and various dealing activities and the liquidity management function which utilised surplus liquidity generated by the bcci group any funds in excess of the investment requirement s were placed on the inter bank market the liquidity management functions were p erformed through the london branch of sa under the overall direction of manag er within the treasury 43 treasury activities were managed up until 1985 by who was also responsible for the branch of sandstorm overseas which managed the accounts of number of significant customers and shareholders treasury committee including and was set up to monitor treasury activit ies the effectiveness of the treasury committee appears to have been compromised since these activities continued to be accounted for as part of the branch and was never called to account for treasury results separately because he appeared to be generating significant profit his activities continued in an uncontroll ed manner and he was given increased responsibilities in the use of all surplus sandstorm fu nds for trading and investment purposes 44 appears to have developed close links with major customer of the bank it appears that made funds available to for trading purposes on profit share basis in return for which he allowed to use h is name and that of his companies and to be used for trading for the account of sandstorm traded in number of markets including commodities futures and options and to disguise the nature of his activities he split treasury into two as follows normal treasury activities as described above number two account activities which appear to have been carri ed out in the name of particular clients these activities were physically segregated performed by different staff and outside the scope of external audit on the basis that they were for the account of private clients in actual fact appears to have been trading in the name of private clients but for the account of sandstorm in so doing he exposed sandstorm to significant risks and lost considerable sums of money 45 through false accounting using number two account funds supplemented profits by the normal trading activities in order to satisfy profit ta rgets created number of pool accounts in the name of which used depo sits credited to clients accounts114 loans drawn down in the name of xx xxx are xxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxxx s unrecorded deposits and certain external funds xx xxxxxxxx was xxxxx to segregate

work to date it appears that wrote options towards xxxxx ends and incorrectly accoun ted for the premium income at the level of xxxxxxx losses increased treasury staff appear to have written further options to conceal these losse s and generate fictitious profits when looses were incurred on closing out the positio ns they were not booked against the profit and loss account but instead against cli ent accounts bogus loans or the other unorthodox sources of funding noted above th is activity appears to have been particularly prevalent in the years 1982 to 198 5 47 in late 1985 the iml requested review of central treasury activities by the auditors management requested pw cayman to carry out this work who in turn called on us for assistance we discovered that significant losses were being incurred on option and futures trading but were not properly recorded the expo sure on loan contracts was considerable4 and significant losses were incurred in closing out the xxxxxxxxx we have formed the conclusion that the accounting methods ad opted were due to incompetence however the benefit of hindsight it app ears more sinister in that it mow seems to have been deliberate way to fictitiously in flate income as part of the review we did not examine accounting for closed contract of pre vious years since significant losses appeared to have occurred again with hin dsight we now know that such losses were being incurred as noted above methods of concealment of treasury losses 48 investigation work to date has indicated that used variety of techniques to fund and conceal the true nature of the transactions underta ken these include misappropriation of deposits with depositors knowledge to prov ide funds to adjust nonperforming and bogus loan accounts and treasury issues misappropriation of external funds deposited under trust with sandstorm and fork to be managed on behalf of few prominent people who are the shareholders of holdings the creation of loans with commercial substance in the names of people without their knowledge getting certificates of deposit with the central treasury wi thout informing the depositor and using the proceeds to fund adjustments routing funds through fork bcp kifco sdcc and other ffiliates and third parties freely by to make adjustments prior to accounting reference d ates and audit confirmation dates which are often reversed at later date maintaining pool of funds in the private named account s of which were used freely by to fund adjustments the funds were never those of alone his name appears to have been used only to classify the accounts as being for the general funding activities of the treasury division 115 49 left sandstorm in 1986 shortly after the di scovery of losses on option trading he subsequently provided with statement in which he set out t he losses he had apparently incurred in earlier years from treasury trading activit ies which he had effectively hidden from sandstorm management together with significant xxxxxxxx of the xxxxxx of treasury activities the inflation of profits was particularly significant in 1982 1883 and 1984 when fictitious profits were supposedl 108 million 136 million and 234 million respectively the full statement is atta ched in appendix iii for the period 1977 to 31 december 1985 claimed that the total amount of these lossesfictitious profits was 633 million but this is before djustment for losses of 225 million booked in the 1985 accounts as result of our treasury review 410 whilst the details of statement are incapable of confirmation beca use the records from these earlier years are sparse and incomplete it is clear th at there was major misappropriation of funds and falsification of accounting reco rds in the early 1980 s 411 took certain documents relating to his management f treasury with him when he left in 1985 he used this information to blackmail sandst orm which paid 12 million to prevent him disclosing

affiliates were routed into these accounts without being recorded as deposits by sandstorm treasury appear to have used these deposits as free funds with repayments and interest funded principally from t he pool accounts themselves the level of these unrecorded deposits appears to have fluctuated from 32 million in 1982 to over 800 million in 1984 the reduction to 400 million in february 1985

the investigation team has seen circumstantial evidence that these brokers did not always trade with treasury at arms length and may have facilitated in manipulating profits in particular had separate office to deal with sandstorm and appears to have allowed sandstorm to have si gnificant overdrawn balance at 31 december 1984 10 million which was possibly used to conceal losses perk liabilities at the 1984 year end 424 was established in 1984 and rapidly b ecame one of the most significant of the brokers used by treasury its initial shareholders were domin ated by major customers of sandstorm including and and some 70 of its share capital was registered in the names of people for whom was retained as advisor joined leaving sandstorm in 1986 as did his deputy and subsequently on the advice from the then group audito rs two payments of 50 million were made to in march 1986 out of external funds for which liability for repayment was recorded119 section 5 boxsolidboxsolidboxsolid background 51 we understand that the group s banking relationship with began in 1972 when it placed relatively large deposits with sandstorm in luxembourg and london there is little tangible evidence of other business until 1976 at which time trade finance lines and shipping loans were opened by the group even at this time the scale of the bank s lending to was significant in relation to its capital b ase and the relationship became one of interdependence summary of the history of lending in relation to the capital base of sandstorm is sho w at appendix i there is evidence that used this position as lever to obtain shortterm funding and repayment of non sandstorm bank debt 52 as result of the large exposure guidelines imposed by the b ank of england in 1977 the accounts were moved to grand cayman and in 1978 when it became apparent that was in financial difficulty and took direct responsibility for the accounts it appears that account manip ulation began at this stage and to this end special duties department was set up to oversee these accounts this was fulltime occupation which involved the manufacture of documentation inflation of account turnover concealment of funds flow etc and involved some 750 accounts over fifteen year period turnover in the period was some 15 billion 53 management in collusion with used sophisticated methods of deception to conceal funds flows including use of bank accounts which received funds and then redistributed them around number of accounts particularly 1976 to 1983 transfers between locations in different parts of the world to create turnover and imply debt servicing particularly just before year ends conduit accounts at external banks under the control of sandst orm officers largely after 1985 funds transfers through bcp

nominees in wxyz the ultimate holding company of the first american bank fab the largest banking group in the washington area with cross st ate banking licences to operate in seven states 62 this interest appears to have been obta ined through sandstorm or its affiliated companies granting loans to certain prominent middle eastern i ndividuals with which to subscribe for shares in wxyz such that or indemnified the shareholders against any liability for the loans disbursed in their names in return for which the shareholders gave sandstorm through variety of sha re dealing and attorney arrangements authority to buy and sell shares in wx yz on their behalf these indemnities were usually in the name of fork 63 the legality and effect of the various nominee and inde mnity arrangements is clearly uncertain and matter of which legal advice will need to be sought in order to ascertain the ultimate beneficial ownership but preliminary legal opinion would suggest that the registered shareholders do appear to have be nominees 64 sandstorm s former management have represented to us that the arrangements were in the form of merchant banking transaction in that it always acted as

these totalled some 150 milli on in the eight years to 31 december 1990 and to give the appearance that the nomine shareholders were agreeable to the charges letters drafted by imran imam indicat ing

sandstorm and fork mr was closely involved otherwise there is clear evidence that the other staff who were involved in giving or receiving instructions were aware of the true nature of the accounts or sandstorm s relationship with the account holders 632 generally the borrowers provide audit confirmations however it is now clear that hold harmless letters were also dispatched and that there was an orch estrated attempt by the senior management of sandstorm with the collusion of maj or customers and third party bank to deceive the auditors129 section 7 unrecorded deposits tumbleweed and others tumbleweed 71 sandstorm s relationship with tumbleweed dates back to the l ate 1970 s when inter bank acceptances were taken by overseas egyptian branches when in 1982 overseas sold its branches to the newly formed affiliate bcc mxxx the sale did not include the transfer of tumbleweed deposits of 171 million as its size would have given local capital adequacy problems and because tumbleweed wanted more confidentiality accordingly the placements were transferred to grand cayman although the customer relationship continued to be maintain ed by bcc mxxx the dealing operation in relation to tumbleweed was performed at bcc mxxx by an employee of overseas with transactions notified to london who determined the accounting to be effected in grand cayman 72 the nature of these transactions was formalised in 1983 when contr act between tumbleweed and overseas was signed stating that these funds were to be invested in commodities in accordance with islamic law although prices f or spot purchase and forward sale of commodities are always quoted on each dea l we have seen evidence to suggest that the bank actually entered any commo dity contracts yields equate to term deposits 73 we are told that there is an understanding between sandst orm an tumbleweed such that if tumbleweed needs to withdraw funds at short notice it can do so interest free without breaking deposit at later date tumbleweed will reciprocate by placing an equal amount interest free for the same period this agreemen t was apparently particularly beneficial to tumbleweed in the egyptian ba nking crisis of 1989 when 20 million interest free deposits were made and the group arrange d shipment of dollars to egypt to enable tumbleweed to meet its customers needs 74 although the banking relationship is still maintained by bcc xxxxx the account has been controlled since the resignation of by central team since 1988 the bank have employed as consultant at retainer of 75000 per annum paid through fork 75 from the time tha t the account was transferred to grand cayman in 1982 it app ears that all the funds from tumbleweed passed through the treasu ry pool accounts and were an integral part of the manipulation of funds withi n treasury up to the resignation of in 1986 over this period interest pa id to tumbleweed on its placements was not expensed but instead debited to the same pool accounts from march 1 1986 separate pool accounts for all tumbleweed transact ions were established although as previously interest continued to be debited tot he pool account rather than the profit and loss account 76 initially on the closure of the treasury pool account it ap pears that an attempt was made to reinstate tumbleweed s deposits and 190 million was injected into the tumbleweed account in august 1986 from funds under managemen t with fork although within few months these funds had again been utilised to service loans and make certain payments as follows130 m fork holdings servicing of

boxsolidboxsolidboxsolid 2 78 the balance of the tumbleweed account in the books of gran d cayman has since 1986 fluctuated between 100 million overdrawn and 50 million in credit we have been told that the account was manipulated to ensure that the balance was zero or insignificant at 30 september and generally at 31 december each year in order to avoid it being chosen for confirmation by the external audi tors this was the case in 1986 1987 and 1989 in 1988 balance of 113 mill ion debit was circulated and confirmed by tumbleweed but this had again been manipula ted to equal an interest free placement sandstorm had made as part of the backtoback arrang ements 79 in analysing the transactions between sandstorm and tumblewe ed over the last eight years we have reviewed over 3000 transactions and ag reed them to deal slips or telex confirmations in addition the supposed 37 outsta nding deals at 27 september 1990 confirmed to mr we have traced 85 by value to the original receipt of funds or the list of deals transferred at 31 octobe r 1982131 710 whilst there are unusual features about the tumbleweed account it appears from the tumbleweed financial statements that some 25 of its total assets are placed with sandstorm and some 170 million reaches back to pre1982 and do appear that there is significant facility to tumbleweed which has not been recorded in the books we have now received confirmation from tumbleweed of outstanding transactions at 31 december 1990 totalling 358 million in us dollars not recorded in the books and 38 million in other currencies which are recorded in the books boxsolidboxsolidboxsolid 711 and his company have been long standing customers of sandstorm since 1982 the relationship has been managed by bahrain branch although the

credited to the treasury pool account when recalled both principal and interest we re debited to the pool account it would appear that the liability for such dep osits was extinguished with the exception of three deposits which were recxxxxxxx in grand cayman in june 1986 following resignation and the closure of the treasu re pool account the recreation of these deposits totalling approximately 62 mill ion appears to have been achieved by using funds managed by fork investments 713 these accounts were rolled over and properly accounted for from ju ne 1986 until september 1987 when 65 million was transferred to and then onto grand cayman 56 million was used to repay bogus loan in name which had been used to repay borrowings from fork drawndown in an ttempt to reinstate the tumbleweed accounts the remaining 9 million was part of an amount of 12 million credited to the tumbleweed account to reduce the acco unt balance at 30 september 1987 having utilised these deposits

introduction 81 sandstorm sa would seem to have commenced islamic banking activit ies in its uk region on behalf of certain islamic customers in june 1984 i nitial activity is believed to have been low building to level of around 50 million at the time that the current records commenced in may 1988 thereafter volumes grew significant ly and from 1 january 1989 all these transactions have been routed through 8 separate islamic banking units ibu at its peak of activity at the end of 1989 amounts pl aced with ibu by islamic customers for islamic investment transactions totalled some 14 billion in seven different currencies 82 the most common type of islamic banking instrument is marubaha desi this involves the purchase of commodity and the immediate sale f that commodity with deferred receipt of the sale proceeds for period determined b the islamic customer this eliminates any risk pertaining to holding the commodity and leaves the cost of the deferred payment to generate higher selli ng price than purchase price not surprisingly the mark up usually bears close relatio nship to prevailing interest rates there is risk to the islamic customer that the co unterparty will not pay on the due date however it seems common practice for the islamic customer to seek to avoid this as well by obtaining bank guarantee letter of credit securing the recovery of funds sandstorm s approach to islamic banking 83 all funds received by sandstorm sa from islamic customers for inv estment purposes are applied in the manner outlined above with sandstorm cting as agent and for the vast majority of transactions the necessary guarantee is provided by sandstorm sa by issuing guarantee sandstorm inherits the risk of counterpart failure to avoid this sandstorm undertakes two further commodity deals the mirror ima ge of those taken on behalf of the islamic customer thus cancelling the f orward sale transactions with forward purchase transactions the resulting free funds are then on placed within the bcc group affiliated entities or on the mon ey markets to earn rate of interest at least equal to the guaranteed markup for the pe riod of the original deferred payment period 84 the effect of sandstorm s own commodity deals and on placement of funds can give the impression that the whole transaction is more than one of taking deposits from these islamic customers but this is not the case in respect of t he islamic customer sandstorm has acted as investment manager as principal it has i ssued guarantee and covered the risk by entering into its won contracts with b rokers and making matching placements problems have arisen however on the accoun ting for transactions undertaken by sandstorm as principal funds placed outside t he bcc group 85 the majority of funds on placed by ibu went to sandstorm verseas in grand cayman or branches within uk region however between 19 86 and 1990 funds were on placed by uk region with other affiliated sand storm entities135 86 uk

deposits of 10 million each which were placed via bc c in march 1989 these amounts were rolled over monthly to match the monthly ro ll over of the underlying islamic investment however when repayment was ca lled in october 1990 the funds were not forthcoming once again the origi nal islamic investment was paid forthwith total funds of million remains outstanding to sandstormsa uk region at 31 december 1990 we understand these amo unts have not been repaid to date137 88 the inappropriateness of the on placements to fork holdings nd bcc bahrain is emphasised by the fact that the manager of ibu withheld or manipulated all third party confirmations from islamic customers relating to these tra nsactions from the external auditors at the time of the 31 december audit of uk region total value of 905 million the informs us that he had knowled ge of this and that must have been clearly taking in structions from application of certain on placements 89 funds on placed to bcc grand cayman or fork oversea s were usually put in deposit account in the name of the original islamic customer wh had provided the funds for investment in some cases however it seems that the n placements with grand cayman were made into deposit accounts of certain third party customers those deposit accounts were then held out to be the deposi t security for certain loans made to those third party customers in the two instances that have been identified the third party who benefited from this deception was the with false loan security of 17 million destination of funds 810 the amount of 30 million onplaced with bcc bahrain is b elieved to have been transferred to an account with and then proba bly onwards to account 500 otherwise all the other amounts were received into the account 500 in the name of fork holdings and we have confirmed this by ref erence to bank statements this is one of the accounts under the control of and his central team used for the purposes of fraudulently routing funds 811 mr of fork acknowledges that the funds were received through the account of fork holdings but as they were then routed back to sandstorm or elsewhere on the instructions of mr he does not believe that fork has any liability to sandstorm uk region in respect of these amount s placed by ibu138 812 the funds appear to have then been utilised by and his team as follows m

agent and therefore part of the series of transactions was reflected on balance sheet the on placement to grand cayman uk region and fork overseas were reflected in the accounts of those entities as third party deposits rather than intra group deposits 814 since howev er certain parts of the series of transactions are actually origin ated by sandstorm namely its own commodity deals and on placement of funds the appropriate accounting treatment is to reflect due to brokers credit balance and placement debit balance 815 in sandstorm sa s accounts for the year ended 31 december 1989 the appropriate accounting treatment was reflected for known islamic investments n placed in grand cayman uk and fork overseas however this was not the case i n the uk region s own financial records and returns 816 since august 1990 uk region have reflected credit and bit balances in respect of islamic banking transactions on placed tot he above locations although the credit has been identified as deposit rather than due to brokers disclosure in prudential returns prior to august 1990 817 as consequence of uk region s accounting policy which treated all aspects of islamic banking as offbalance sheet for funds on placed to uk region the prudential returns submitted by uk region tot he bank of england duri ng this period showed significant understatement of assets and liabilities at 31 december 1989 for example assets were understated by 8024 million due from banks and liabilities understated by 802 million due to brokers although as not ed above adjustment was made in the legal accounts of sandstorm sa in addition 1763 million of deposits should have been classified as due to brokers being amounts rece ived and used within the uk region itself 818 in au gust 1990 at our insistence management decided to transfer th entire portfolio of investments from islamic customers into the books of uk region except for investments which were actually held by brokers and guaranteed by third party standby letters of credit ie genuinely offbalance sheet in practice this still excluded the transactions that had been on placed with london and london the impact on th prudential returns was continuing but smaller understatement of assets and liabilities which at 31 d ecember 1990 amounted to 1069 million and misclassification of 44 14 million as deposits rather than due to brokers at the same date in addition because of their classification as deposits the islamic customers with the four large st aggregate investments were also disclosed in the boxsolid7 return as depositors with more than 5 of total deposits139 819 the amounts placed with fork holdings and bcc bahrain amoun ting to 845 million at 31 december 1990 were correctly reflected in the books of uk region from 27 march 1991 funds totalling 225 million placed with two other institutions noted above are still not reflected in the books of uk region 820 the accounting adopted for the shortfall of funds was even more inappropriate rather than recognising debt from fork holdings uk region used loan accounts opened for and to disguise the recording of amounts due from fork holdings as result credit facilities and relevant loan accounts authorised by bcc central credit commi ttee for these banks were effectively used by uk region for purposes other than for those for which they were actually approved 821 to disguise the amounts due from bcc bahrain loan account in the name of was opened by uk region in september 1990 to record invest ments repaid by uk region to this customer but not recovered from bc c bahrain this credit facility for was not authorised by bcc ce ntral credit committee 822 the loan accounts were then subsequently adjusted by crediti ng them with new funds received from the same islamic customers up to the amount of the sh ortfall rather than crediting those new funds tot he liabilities xxx of th balance sheet thereby falsely understating assets and liabilities disclosure in the prudential returns 823 the impact of these accounting entries on the amounts discl osed in the prudential returns was an understatement of both assets and liabilities at 31 december 10990 assets should have included sundry debtor for 845 millio n being the amounts due from fork holdings and liabilities due to brokers of simil ar amount although the recoverability form fork is uncertain 824 those islamic investments shown in the boxsolid7 return as large deposits whilst not correctly classified as deposits would also have been understat ed by total of 845 million management control 825 the extent of the errors and deceptions raises enormous concerns abo ut how management control over the islamic activities was exercised 826 ibu is and has been under the executive control of for some considerable time even before he became regional general mana ger his knowledge or lack of knowledge as to the events outlined above demon strates lack of effective management with respect to this area of business141 827 with respect to the placement of funds with fork holdings and bcc bahrain represents that he was acting under instruction from there is however documentation supporting instructions given by or instructions given by to ibu furthermore represents that at the time of the transactio ns he was led to believer by and others that the fund s were being placed with fork overseas there is however documentation supporting notif ication by uk region to fork overseas or any other entity in respect of fun ds placed through bcc bahrain and the only documentation available according to uk region management is memorandu m sent by mr to mr fork foundation based at 100 leadenhall street outlining details of th funds so placed claims that the routing of placements ie through grand cayman bcc bahrain was determined and notified by or mr however there is written evidence to support this stateme nt 828 mr represents that he is seeking recovery of the debt from bcc central office in abu dhabi with respect to the misuse of on pla cements as security for third party loans and advances represents that he had knowled ge of this until it was recently identified and that the manager of ibu mu st have acted under direct instruction probably from mr the account officer fo r 829 in relation to the general accounting for these transactions has now recognised that the original accounting treatment was incorrect although it should be noted that the bank placed reliance for some time on illega l advice that lent support to their earlier practice however the precise accounting classificat ions for islamic transactions that have been outlined above still need to be adopted 830 with respect to the accounting practices adopted to cover up t he non repayment of certain on placements acknowledges that this was inappropriat but represents that whilst against his better judgement he was ag ain acting under instruction from the knowledge of other mbers of the uk management committee with respect to these transactions is unclear but it seems unlikely that these entities went unnoticed by the uk region s credit department conclusion 831 from customers point of view all islamic investment transactions have been properly executed and funds repaid on the due date uk r egion s approach to covering its own guarantee risk whilst acceptable was not adeq uately researched from an accounting view point and was misguided with respect to where funds we re ultimately placed 832 the resulting catalogue of errors with regard to the non repayment of some placements and the misuse of other placements as security reflects t the very least lack of any proper independent management control in uk r egion the accounting adopted for the non repayment is indefensible and lends weight to the clusion that uk management have acted irresponsibly in allowing the eve nts outlined above to occur whether uk management and particularly and mr have acted in good faith under instruction from senior officers within bcc g roup has been impossible to determine but it is difficult to imagine that every transaction could go through unchallenged by them142 sandstorm appendix 1 history of exposure recorded sandstorm balance sheet consolidated exposure capital m m 31 december 1977 80 113 1978 110 171

revealed widespread fraud and manipulation of account ing records conducted in collusion with our draft report is also based on the review of banking records from several locations and interviews conducted over number of months the findings re inevitably based on incomplete information and moreover certain details and the ir interrelationship have not been corroborated additional work has been carried out since 22 june which has bearing on some of the detail we have however not been able to complete ur verification procedures nor having summarised the information gathered to reinterview past and p resent management to ensure that our interpretation of individual transactions is appropriate accordingly we are not able to fully support the detailed information provi ded in the draft
