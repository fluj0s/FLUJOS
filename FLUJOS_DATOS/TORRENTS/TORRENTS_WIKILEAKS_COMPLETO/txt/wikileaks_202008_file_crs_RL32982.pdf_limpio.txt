recognition of this phenomenon wa s incorporated into the immigration act of 1924 which included provision for aliens who were entering the united states solely to carry on trade between the united states and the foreign state the alien was coming from pursuant to treaty of commerce and navigation1 over 80 years later comparable provision of immigration law continues to enable foreign nationals now known as treaty traders and treaty investors to enter the united states2 in addition to the specific treaty traderinvestor provisions of immigration law there are often broader immigration issues ra ised in the context of the recent free trade agreements ftas3 these issues include wh ether ftas should contain provisions that expressly expand immigration between the countries as well as whether ftas should require that the immigra ntsending countries restrain unwanted migration typically expressed as illegal aliens the question of whether the movement of people especially tem porary workers

the chile and singapore ftas chairman sensenbrenner offered the following summation in his opening remarks members of this committee spoke with united bipartisan voice that immigration provisions in future free trade agreements will not receive the support of this committee he went on later in the proceedings to state i am also concerned th at there not be future changes in the basic immigration

analysis the report concludes with set of immigration policy questions that arise in the context of ftas background on immigration policy context of policy making as prologue to any discussion of the nexus of immigration and trade it is important to acknowledge tw key points of departure in policy making on these issues foremost is what branch of government the legislative or executive takes the lead in setting the policy sec ondly is whether polic ies are set unilaterally and without special consideration of other countries or are deve loped bilaterally or multilaterally although congress has the ultimate c onstitutional authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce it has shared the authority with the executive branch the executive branch takes the l ead in negotiating trade agreements under strictly defined conditions congress considers legislation implementing the trade agreements according to the trade act of 1974 as amended4 immigration policy on the other hand is traditi onally spelled out by the congress not the executive branch congress has not shared its authority over immigration and naturalization law with the executive branch to the ex tent it has done so with trade policy5 bilateral and multilate ral agreements with specific countries staple of trade negotiations are quite rare in us immigration policy when the immigration amendments of 1965

countries listed in table 1 the findings presented in this portion of the report are statistically significant based on pearson correlati on coefficients ranging from 095 to 098 30 for more detailed data see appendix at the end of this reportinteraction of trade and migration classical trade theory presents trade and migration as substitutes that is country where labor is abundant and inexpe nsive is assumed to have the option of exporting either laborintensive goods or its workers another construct the multinational corporation emphasizes the value of relocating managers and technical experts to facilita production which has led to the theory that trade liberalization increases the migration of knowledgebased workers obviously the similarities of the ec onomies of the trading partne rs eg relative level of development and size of the economy are factors that would affect the assumptions underlying any theory of the nexus between trade and migration one analyst summed up the research on these relationships as follows the question of whether trade and migration are complements or substitutes has been the focus of numerous studies the results of which differ markedly according to the hypotheses selected according to some authors free trade could lead to reduction in migration flow s for others it could have visible effect on migration or it could bring about an increase of these flows disruptive effect by having negative effect on small and mediumsized industries and by accelerating the drift from rural to urban areas28 there are variety of approaches to study the impact of trade agreements on migration and this report draw s on three of several differe nt possible perspectives the first explores the relationship between trade and temporary workers and business personnel among the united states top tradin g partners the second synthesizes the research on how nafta may have aff ected temporary migration of knowledge based workers between the united states nd canada the third analyzes possible effects of nafta on permanent migration from mexico trade volume and business based tempor ary admissions the volume of trade that the united states has with its top trading partners correlates with the number of times foreign nationals from these countries enter the united states29 this positive relationship holds whether analyzing total nonimmigrant admissions or only those foreign nationals entering with the business based visas discu ssed above h l and tn visas30 as table 1 details the rankings of the top trading partners by tota l trade and by the number of their nationals entering with the businessbased visas while not identical are similar the relationship also appears when analyzing the alien admissions data with the balance

and temporary admissions appears to exist regardless of whether the united states has an fta with the country the specific relationship that one would expect between ftas and the issuance of visas for treaty traders and investors however is clearly illustrated in the growing use of visas by foreign nationals from th united states top trading partners and nafta signators cana da and mexico as figure 1 illustrates issuances of the visas by the state department to nationa ls of both countries accelerated as soon as the ftas were implemented in 1989 and 1994 respectively in 2004 us issuances of visas to mexicans exceeded cana dian issuances for the first time nafta canadian illustration when canada and the united states implemented an fta in 1989 some canadian policy makers expressed concern that the trade liberalization between the two nations would trigger brain drain of knowledgebased workers from canada others argued that the migration of professional and mana gerial workers is fundamental to economic integration and that us professi onal and managerial workers would likewise migrate to canada while some feared that labor flows would be economically damagi ng to canada

and one of these research studies found that the migration of skilled workers increased during this time in particular professor steven globerman currently the director of the center for international business at western washington university reported that the number of canadian profe ssionals coming to the united states on tctn visas increased by approximately 3000 to 4000 vi sas each year over the period studied globerman noted that professional workers from the united states were emigrating to canada in higher numbers though at slower rate than their canadian counterparts globerman also found an incr ease in bilateral flows of l intracompany transfers31 figure 2 illustrates the upward trends in the temporary migration of all business and professional workers that globerman observed between the united states and canada during the years that followed the entry into force of the canadaunited states fta the data depicted in figure 2 include intracompany transferees traders and investors as well as professional workers32 when globerman analyzed permanent migration flows between the two countries he found that the patterns of permanent migration had been fairly consistent during the 1980s and 1990s gl oberman concluded that the trade liberalization per had little impact on permanent migration between the united states and canada although the magn itude of the permanent flow did not meaningfully change the composition of the immigration did appear to change somewhat specifically globerman found some evidence that professional and managerial workers comprised larger share of the immigration to the united states and smaller share of the emigration fro m the united states over the period studied compared with the previous period33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32982crs13

debate over nafta some asse rted that the agreement would reduce unwanted migration typically expressed as illegal aliens from mexico they based this argument on the assumption that the nafta would bolster the mexican economy thereby improving employment oppor tunities the result some theorized was that nafta would reduce the pushpu ll forces that draw workers from less developed countries to mo re developed countries because of better economic prospects this view was presented by the us international trade commission in its 1991 report to the house ways and m eans and the senate finance committees an fta is likely to decrease slightly the gap between real united states wages and mexican wages of both skilled and unsk illed workers combined but greater share of the wage adjustment w ould occur in mexico than in the united states as wage differentials between the united states and mexico narrow the incentive for migration from mexico to the united states will decline34 others

thus the development solution to unauthorized migration is measured in decades even generations35 one widely discussed mode l referred to as the migration hump incorporated these perspectives

acknowledge the importance of other factors in shaping this surge the dramatic drop in the value of the peso in 1995 for example is often cited as major push determinant in outmigration from mexico the growth of jobs in the us ec onomy during the mid and late1990s was an obvious pull variable another factor that may have contributed to the increase in mexican residents is change in the ina provisions on lega l permanent admission that now allows 75 of mexicans coming as spouses and children of legal permanent residents lprs to exceed the percountry ceiling set by law38 immediate

in 200340 in terms of illegal migration the research points to constellation of factors that has contributed to the increase in unauthoriz ed resident aliens many of whom an estimated 57 are from mexico historically unauthorized migration is generally attributed to the pushpu ll of prosperityfueled j ob opportunities in the united states in contrast to limited or none xistent job opportunities in the sending countries41 some observers maintain that lax enforcement of employer sanctions for hiring unauthorized aliens has facilitated this pushpull but it is difficult to empirically demonstrate this element although most policy makers have assumed that tighter border enforcement w ould reduce unauthorized migration some researchers are now suggesting that the strengthening of the immigration enforcement provisions most notably by the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira may have inadvertently increased the population of unauthorized re sident aliens this perspective argues that iiriras increased penalties for illegal entry coupled with increased resources for border enforcement have raised the stakes in crossing the border illegally and created an incentive for those who succeed in entering the united states to stay42httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32982crs17 42 continued aliens in the united states estimates since 1986

statutory changes to h1b visas as well as other temporary business and worker nonimmigrant categories45 s m asserted that the office of the us trade representative ustr overstepped its authority by negotiating immigration provi sions in ftas and voiced opposition to trade agreements that purportedly prevent congress from revising immigration law on temporary professional nonimmigrants some expressed concern that professional workers from chile and singapore are held to less stringent standard than existing h1b law as result of the recent ftas46 proponents of these trade agreements argue that they are merely reflecting current immigration law and policy and that the movement of people is subsumed under the broader category of provision of serv ices and thus an i nherent part of any free trade agreement such agreements on the flow of business people and workers they maintain are essential to us economic growth and business vitality the ustr states that the labor attestations education and training fees and numerical limits provisions have been added to the ft as in response to congressional concerns the ustr further argues that the tem porary business personnel provisions in the ftas are not immigration policy because they only affect temporary entry47 this question has become one of the most controversial issues at this stage of the negotiations in services that the world trade organization wto are engaged in now in the round of negotiations ca lled the doha developm ent agenda several developing countries have criticized the visa restri ctions placed on temporary workers entering the united states particularly workers not directly affiliated with companies located in the united states and have also called for greater transparency of us immigration
