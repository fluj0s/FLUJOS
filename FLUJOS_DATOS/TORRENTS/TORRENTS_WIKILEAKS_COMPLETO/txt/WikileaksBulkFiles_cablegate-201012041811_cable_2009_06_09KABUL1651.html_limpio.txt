ref kabul 1480 classified by polmil counselor robert clarke for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary assistant ambassador mussomeli discussed range of issues with minister of interior moi hanif atmar on june 23 on the kunduz regional training center rtc dyncorp event of april 11 reftel atmar reiterated his insistence that the us try to quash any news article on the incident or circulation of video connected with it he continued to predict that publicity would endanger lives he disclosed that he has arrested two afghan police and nine other afghans as part of an moi investigation into afghans who facilitated this crime of purchasing service from child he pressed for cstca to be given full control over the police training program including contractors mussomeli counseled that an overreaction by the afghan goverment giroa would only increase chances for the greater publicity the moi is trying to forestall 2 c on armored vehicles and air transport for presidential candidates atmar pitched strongly to have the giroa decide which candidates were under threat and to retain control of allocation of these assets he agreed with the principle of level playing field for candidates but argued that direct support by foreigners demonstrated lack of confidence in giroa if giroa failed to be fair international assets and plans in reserve could be used on another electionsrelated issue atmar claimed that two helmand wouldbe provincial candidates and key karzai supporters disqualified under diag rules had actually possessed weapons as part of giroa contract to provide security for contractors 3 c atmar also was enthusiastic about working out arrangements with the 2nd marine expeditionary brigade meb in rcsouth to partner with the afghan border police abp on training and joint operations to extend giroa governance south he is considering giving bg melham highly regarded afghan officer responsibility for abp in nimruz and helmand provinces end summary kunduz rtc dyncorp update 4 c on june 23 assistant ambassador mussomeli met with moi minister hanif atmar on number of issues beginning with the april 11 kunduz rtc dyncorp investigation amb mussomeli opened that the incident deeply upset us and we took strong steps in response an investigation is ongoing disciplinary actions were taken against dyncorp leaders in afghanistan we are also aware of proposals for new procedures such as stationing military officer at rtcs that have been introduced for consideration note placing military officers to oversee contractor operations at rtcs is not legally possible under the currentdyncorp contract beyond remedial actions taken we still hope the matter will not be blown out of proportion an outcome which would not be good for either the us or afghanistan widelyanticipated newspaper article on the kunduz scandal has not appeared but if there is too much noise that may prompt the journalist to publish 5 c atmar said he insisted the journalist be told that publication would endanger lives his request was that the us quash the article and release of the video amb mussomeli responded that going to the journalist would give her the sense that there is more terrible story to report atmar then disclosed the arrest of two afghan national police anp and nine other afghans including rtc language assistants as part of an moi investigation into afghan facilitators of the event the crime he was pursuing was purchasing service from child which in afghanistan is illegal under both sharia law and the civil code and against the anp code of conduct for police officers who might be involved he said he would use the civil code and that in this case the institution of the anp will be protected but he worried about the image of foreign mentors atmar said that president karzai had told him that his atmars prestige was in play in management of the kunduz dyncorp matter and another recent event in which blackwater contractors mistakenly killed several afghan citizens the president had asked him where is the justice 6 c atmar said there was larger issue to consider he kabul 00001651 002 of 003 understood that within dyncorp there were many wonderful people working hard and he was keen to see proper action taken to protect them but these contractor companies do not have many friends he was aware that many questions about them go to srap holbrooke and in afghanistan there is increasing public skepticism about contractors on the other hand the conduct of the combined security transition commandafghanistan cstca is disciplined looking at these facts he said he wanted cstca in charge he wanted the anp to become model security institution just like the afghan national army ana and national directorate for security nds and the contractors were not producing what was desired he suggested that the us establish and independent commission to review the mentor situation an idea he said ambassador eikenberry had first raised atmar added that he also wanted tighter control over afghan employees he was convinced that the kunduz incident and other events where mentors had obtained drugs could not have happened without afghan participation armored vehicles and air transport for presidential candidates 7 c atmar expressed strong opinions about the use of armored vehicles for travel by presidential candidates that he has requested be provided to moi by the us and uk he said it was up to moi to decide whether candidate was under threat or not atmar opined that it should be an mod responsibility to provide air transport for presidential candidates amb mussomeli explained that we want level playing field which atmar agreed was necessary however atmar said there were two important considerations 1 some of the electorate will view that the candidates are controlled by foreigners if provided nongiroa transport and 2 bypassing the moi or mod with direct support by foreigners demonstrated lack of confidence in the afghanistan government when amb mussomeli said mod lacked adequate aircraft to cover all candidates atmar responded that mod could ask isaf for help but should retain control of the travel amb mussomeli pointed out that some reasonably worried that such plan will falter or will not be fairly implemented atmar answered just give us chance if we fail then you have your own planes and plans in reserve diagdisqualified candidates in helmand 8 c in discussion on two wouldbe provincial election candidates in helmand who were disqualified by the disbandment of illegally armed groups diag program atmar said he had looked into requests to stand firm against their reinstatement but it was big contentious issue that is not explainable to president karzai atmar said that the only reason these two candidates were barred was for having weapons apparently against diag rules in fact he said they were contracted by the state to have those weapons in order to provide security for contractors he acknowledged that the contract had not been properly registered and suggested that the giroa would take care of the registration afghan border police abp and partnering with the marines in rcsouth 9 c atmar enthusiastically proposed an moi meeting with the leadership of the 2nd marine expeditionary brigade meb and cstca to work out arrangements for good partnering training and joint operations with afghan security forces in rcsouth the meb would like two abp companies approximately 250 police currently located near lashkar gah to move south and to be mobile enough to move further south when opportunities arise the meb would like customs officer to be attached to these abp companies so that the reach of giroa governance can be extended when insurgentcontrolled or dominated territory is opened atmar stopped short of making final promise to give highlyregarded afghan officer bg melham whom he personally respects responsibility for the abp in nimruz and helmand provinces but he was aware of concerns about the current responsible officer bg noorzai kabul international school isk 10 u amb mussomeli expressed concern over plan by district police chief to remove security barriers at isk an primary and secondary school partially dependent on usaid and other mission funding support that keep the road closed to kabul 00001651 003 of 003 normal traffic removing the barriers could endanger the kids and teachers who walk between two compounds atmar said that he was very familiar with isk and barriers would be touched although he added that perhaps an arrangement could be made to unblock the road and have the isk security personnel search vehicles eikenberry
