science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542homeland security reducing the vulnerability of public and private information infrastructures to terrorism an overview summary this report assesses the impact of th september 11 2001 attacks on public and private information infrastructures in the context of critical infrastructure protection continuity of operations coop planning and homeland security analysis of the effects of the terrorist attacks suggests various lessons learned these lessons support three general principles the first principle emphasizes the establishment and practice of comprehensive continuity nd recovery plans one lesson learned in this area is to augment disaster recovery plans businesses and agencies who now must consider the possibility of complete destruction and loss of building may need to augment their disaster recovery pl ans to include the movement of people the rapid acquisition of equipment and fu rniture network c onnectivity adequate workspace and more corollary to this lesson learned is the need to assure that recovery procedures are well documented nd safeguarded so that they can be fully utilized when necessary second lesson is the need to back up data and applications without comprehensive backup sy stem that captures more than just an organizations data files significant amount of time can be lost trying to re create applications organize data and reestablish user access corollary to this lesson learned is the need to fully and regu larly test backup sites and media to ensure their reliability and functionality the second principle focuses on the d ecentralization of operations and the effectiveness of distributed communications the lesson of decentralizing operations can be applied to the structure and location of an organizations operations industry experts suggest recove ry sites be located at least 2050 miles away form the primary work site in addition some observers suggest that human resources should also be located in more than one pl ace to reduce the potential for losing significant portion of ones workfo rce in single event another lesson in this area is to ensure the ability to communicate with internal and external constituencies in the event of an emergency the demand for information skyrockets an organization not only needs to comm unicate with employees regarding actions and procedures but also with the citizen s and customers to whom it is responsible for providing goods and services the third principle involves the institu tionalization of sy stem redundancies to eliminate single points of weakness in this context the lesson of employing redundant service providers is applied primarily to telecommunications services in the event central switching station is disabled having multiple providers using different infrastructures for access can reduce the possib ility of an organization losing its communications services and being unable to carry out its responsibilities another related less on learned is the use of generic re placeable technology in the event of catastrophe the ability to re place equipment quickly with easytofind products that do not require comprehe nsive customization can contribute significantly to how quickly an organiza tions operations can be functional again this report will not be

vulnerability of public and private information infrastructures to terrorism an overview introduction analysis of the effects of the terrori st attacks of september 11 2001 suggests various lessons learned c oncerning public and private information infrastructures what results are some insights to the range of challenges and opportunities facing policymakers as they seek to identify relevant technical solutions to homeland security concerns this report considers these homeland security issues in the context of critical information infrastruct ure protection and tinuity of operations coop planning as part of the congressi onal and presidential effort s to develop and implement comprehensive response to homeland security concerns the role of information technology it has become an increasin gly important focus in july 2002 the president released the countrys first national strategy for homeland security outlining the strategic objectives critical mission areas and initiatives in support of the administrations proposed department of homeland security1 the strategic objectives included preventing terrorist attacks within the united states reducing americas vulnerability to terrorism and minimizing the damage and recover from attacks that do occur in november 2002 congress passed and the president signed into law the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 crea ting the department of homeland security common to both the national strategy document and the legislation is an emphasis on developing information sharing initiatives and fostering partnerships between and with in the levels of government and the sectors of industry the heavy reliance upon information t echnology to carry out mission critical tasks and provide other citizen services highlights the need to ensure these assets are protected backed up and resilient to att ack moreover the growth of the use of electronic government egovernment app lications to conduct governmenttocitizen interactions as well as governmentt obusiness and govern menttogovernment transactions has put additional pressure on the need to reconstitute systems quickly to minimize any disruptions and financial costs associated with major infrastructure failure2 in addition renewed emphasis is being placed on reducing the vulnerabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542crs2 2 continued 2002 p 21 3 for detailed analysis

rl30735 cyberwarfare by steven hildrethof the nations critical information infrastructures while more fully integrating and utilizing public and private in formation technology assets3 taken together these issues demonstrate the importance of ensuring the reliability and continuity of information technology systems as part of the governments overall approach to homeland security the accounts of succe sses and failures regarding how agencies and businesses responded to the septem ber 11 2001 attacks provide an unusual opportunity to examine options for furt her improving the nations emergency preparedness relevance and context of the september 11 2001 attacks in addition to the destruction of buildin gs and the loss of life the september 11 2001 attacks on the world trade center wtc and the pentagon inflicted heavy damage on elements of the countrys in formation and communi cation infrastructure this in turn affected how both public and private organizations were able to respond to the events of the day first res ponders experienced difficulties communicating among themselves4 citizens and some governmental officials experienced problems communicating by telephone due to overloaded and destroyed circuits as described in the sections below some agencies and businesses directly affected by the attacks had difficulties recovering and reestablishing data operations due to inadequate infrastructure andor the lack of backup systems f aced with an overloaded telecommunications system many turned to the internet which continued to function as designed to send and r eceive email messages regard ing the safety of family friends and colleagues however even in areas not directly affected by the attacks citizens and government empl oyees sometimes found dear th of information because some agencies shut down web sites or di d not use them to provide information regarding available resources and instructi ons on when and where to report for work for example it was reported that as of nearly 48 hours after they occurred neither the general services administration gsa or the central intelligence agency cia had posted any information regarding the terrorist attacks it was also reported that of the office of personnel management opm shut down its web site due to concerns related to cyberterrorism5 it is important to note that many of the technologyrelated problems that emerged from the september attacks have less to do with the capabilities of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542crs3 technology itself than with how it was imp lemented for example phone lines can be disrupted so organizations with criti cal functions need to secure redundant but separate means to communicate data can be stored and sent nearly anywhere but agencies need to establish protocols for regularly backing up important information to secure remote centers the mixed pe rformance of information infrastructures suggests that both the public and private sectors need to reexamine their information planning and practices so that they can better weather and rebound from catastrophic events the damage sustained by two important economic and military locations combined with efforts to restore services and prepare contingency plans also raise questions regarding the federal governments role and the private sectors ability to ensure the protection and continuity of th countrys informati on infrastructure eg telecommunications computer networks internet etc in the future it is likely that the full extent of the damage to information technology resources will not be made public due to concerns about nati onal security and business continuity traditionally both public and private sector organizations have been very reluctant to reveal publicly the extent to which their operations are affected by computer viruses and worms hacker attacks or similar security weaknesses this reluctance to share information occurs for two primary reasons the first is the interest in maintaining the confidence of customersc onstituents and by extension in the case of publicly traded companies maintaining market value the second reason is concern over being identified as target for future attacks and the possibility of revealing unwittingly or not other vulnerabilities however despite the validity of these concerns the reluctance to share information with the appropriate actors can serve as an impedime nt to recovery and prevention planning by further embedding potential weaknesses into the information infrastructure the country has become increasingly dependent upon despite the imperfect nature of the information available number of ssons learned can be identified and are discussed below to place these lessons in context the next section provides brief synopsis of how the public and private in formation infrastructures performed and were affected in the wake of the initia l destruction and the immediate reaction by individuals businesses nd the federal government summary of the events and impact of september 11 2001 overview due to the scope of the situation it is not possible to provide comprehensive accounting of all the organizations affected by the terrorist attacks however variety of examples are discussed in contex t to provide sense of the range of issues facing the public and private sectors as th ey continue to revi ew and implement new initiatives one means to gain an overall sense of the immediate impact of the september 11 2001 attacks is to cons ider how people and organizations communicated the attacks spurred tremendous spike

following september 11 2001 there were number of accounts of successes failures and lessons lear ned regarding continuity and disaster recovery planning in many cases these descriptions are specific to particular organization or business activity however one can identify some observations and lessons learned that are widely applicable and that policymakers and business leaders may wish to consider as they deve lop and implement ne w homeland security initiatives continuity of operations coop and disa ster recovery planning are not new concepts however surveys have shown th at only about half of american businesses have disaster management plans in place in many cases past threats are often the motivating influences for organizations to make these plans for example morgan stanley one of the tenants in the sout h tower of the world trade center adopted thorough plans in response to bomb threats being made during th persian gulf war in 1991 and reinforced those plans followi ng the 1993 bombing of the world trade center the financial services firms regular evacuation drills were credited as onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542crs9 31 james schulz new urgency for

hackers not terrorists major concern internetweek 1 october 2001 p11of the reasons why nearly all of its approximately 3500 empl oyees were able to escape before the buildings collapsed31 in the case of information technology disa ster recovery planning preparation for the year 2000 transition y2k has been cited by number of private and public sector organizations as one of the main r easons they were able to respond and recover quickly from the september 11 2001 attacks32 y2k planning began substantially in the 1990s led primarily by the private sector and followed by federal and state government agencies33 y2k preparation spurred many organizations to operationalize strategies for backing up data enabling remote working and enhancing communication links between or ganizations employees customers and vendors34 many tenants of the world trade center also cited the 1993 bombing of the building as their rationale for having veloped extensive disa ster recovery plans which they in turn attributed to their success in evacuating employees and preserving vital data35 the amount of time and resources spen t on information technology disaster planning can vary with the size and type of organization according to the gartner group research and advisory firm an average company allocates approximately three percent of its annual information t echnology budget to disaster recovery in contrast financial services companies which have to m eet requirements set by the federal reserve board andor the securities and exchange commission sec spend an average of seven to eight percent36 however if it may seem costly to dicate significant portion of ones budget to planning for an event with low chan ce of occurring the financial consequences for being unprepared can be even higher in the case of financial companies many if not most had invested in data backup nd disaster recovery facilities to one degree or another while this llowed them to save significant amount of customer and businesscritical data it was estimated that these firms will still spend 35 billion over the two years following the attack to replace their destroyed

disaster r ecovery planning is often compared to the preparations for y2k it is important to recognize that these scenarios are qualitatively different y2k d finite time line with clear indicator of success or failure in contrast the war on terrorism appears to be an ope nended and evolving process as the examples below demonstr ate measures of success are relative and the task of planning is ne ver truly done the lessons l earned today can help prepare for tomorrow but they do not represent the final word on information technology disaster recovery planning lessons regarding continuity and recovery planning and practices the events of september 11 2001 have brought new urgency to continuity and recovery planning and practices while attention has been growing over time this multifaceted undertaking can often be very challenging and frustrating process as planners try to coordina disparate parts of their organizations while trying to strike balance between how much they cannot afford to be unprepared and how much they can afford to spend on res ources they may never use further complicating matters has been the tendency for organizations to stovepipe the different protections relevant to information technology di saster recovery planning for example information security has often been handled independently from physical security similarly the compartmentalization of an organizations units and processes can contribute to fractured planning process that can leave an organization vulnerable40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542crs11 40 continued 8 october 2001 p18 41 deidre

2001 p35one reported example indicating the possible costs and consequences when an organization does not have fully integr ated plan is the may davis group the privately held financial services company had its offices on the 87th floor of one of the world trade center towers in addition to losing 100000 of equipment the firm apparently lost some regulatory documents and 1 million in revenue due to data loss and downtime41 less severe example is the secret service field office located in 7 world trade center which did have contingenc plan but had not fully implemented it at the time of the attack the agencys field office was able to resume operations the following day at an alternative location it reportedly lost some of the information it was collecting on criminal suspects42 another example is delo itte consu lting whose primary telecommunications hub in new york city located in the world financial center next to the world trade center towers was put out of serv ice affecting an estimated one thousand employees in the area as consulting firm deloitte considers its ability to share information with clients to be its core business during the weeks it took to rebuild its land line communication center deloittes new york area employees used cell phones to stay in contact with customers and fellow employees43 even organizations that have planned extensively can sometimes overlook small details that appear insignificant but later prove to be important one such example is american international group aig inc the financial services company has offices and

to use data from its automated backup system to be operational the day after the attacks however not all of its servers were part of the automated backup syst em and the backup tapes for these servers

2002 httpwwwgovexeccomdailyfed0202020602t1htm among some of the most prepared organizations their plans sometimes presumed the ability to eventually return to their offices even if only to retrieve equipment and paper files45 modern fire safety and construc tion methods have largely made the possibility of building collapse less likely so many organizations developed plans that focused on the movement of data to be used temporarily at backup facility these same businesses and agencies must now consider whether to augment their disaster recovery plans to include the m ovement of people the rapid acquisition of equipment and furniture network conn ectivity adequate workspace and more some organizations may need to be able to not just store but also to run mission critical applications at their backup site s and staff may need to be trained to implement such plan46 the possible need for more sophisticated data backup facilities suggests organizations may consider establishing hot site hot site is facility that has all of th data equipment software connectivity furniture and office space assembled and ready to use so that an organization can continue its computer operations uninterrupted in the event of disaster in some cases organizations will mirror their data directly to the hot s ite as an additional backup or in lieu of using backup tapes at the primary site while hot sites provide the greatest amount of redundancy and readiness the cost of establishing and maintaining such site can cost millions of dollars with additional yearly maintenance costs47 this raises cost effectiveness issues some hot sites however might serve dual purpose such as secondary data site or as part of comprehensive backup system48 organizations with more detailed recove ry plans were often able to respond better to the events of ptember 11 2001 in the case of the occupational safety and health administration osha the 21member office had contingency plan for its contingency plan after evacua ting the osha employees discovered their first designated meeting site was inaccessibl so they regrouped at nearby regional office after this office was evacuated they gathered at third site to implement their plan to provide advice and technical assistance to businesses and agencies in an effort to protect workers from being expos ed to hazardous substances and other safety risks at

invested 175 million to establish the facility which cost an additional 300000 per year to maintain however while an extended outage would ve resulted in the rapid loss of trading contracts to other exchanges in the united states and abroad nybots investment paid off allowing it to resume modified trading operations one day after the attacks50 corollary to this lesson learned is the need to ensure that recovery procedures are well documented and safe guarded employees need to be wellinformed and practiced for the responsibilities they are ex pected to carry out correspondingly just as one would not keep the sole backup tape s of important information at the primary data center in which they were created pr udent step would be to keep one or more copies of the recovery plans availabl at the appropriate offsite locations backing up data and backing up applications second lesson learned that is related to c ontinuity and disaster planning and practices is the need to have comprehe nsive backup system that captures more than just an organizations data files as di scussed above most of the financial services firms in or near the world trade center had comprehensive da ta management and recovery systems in place some highly automated systems will begin backing up data to remote center when significant temperature change or power loss in the building is detected51 cantor fitzgerald one of th hardest hit financial services companies losing 733 of its approxima tely 1000 world trade center employees including 150 information technology workers lost none of its data due to system that mirrored all of its software and data to its data center in rochelle park nj52 in contrast the us customs service was not as well prepared in addition to experiencing difficulties finding altern ative office space for its 800 displaced employees the office located in the world trade center complex did not have all of its files backed up to computers in its washington dc headquarters several months after the attack the customs service reportedly was still working to recreate some of its files from scratch while others were considered permanently lost53 in addition to backing up data organizations also need to backup the data catalogs directories and soft ware applications used with the data organizations that saved only their raw data had to spend

applications and email files that were not backed up to the site some of this information was backed up to tapes but the tapes were stored in fireproof safe kept in their world trade center tower office55 in addition to taking broader view of the digital tools and assets to backup and preserve organizations such as regulatory agencies and insurance companies that still rely heavily on paper files may wish to consider digitizing some of their documents as they are received despite much touting of the socalled paperless office the blizzard of paper that accompanied the dust and debris with the collapse of the towers suggests many organizations are still heavily dependent on their physical documents however the high co st of digital imaging requires companies and agencies to consider carefully which documents are most critical and often used one company that did have comprehensive digital imaging system in place before september 11 2001 was em pire blue cross blue sh ield developed over the past ten years starting with claims forms the insurance carriers optical storage system captures almost all of its paper documents as result the company lost only about two days worth of paper mail56 one company that decided to accelerate its plans to digitize and automate its paperbased information is kemper casua lty company which had offices on the 35th and 36th floors of one world trade center th kemper data backup system had all but the previous days and that mornings data backed up on tape at its headquarters it was also able to recreate the lost transactions for the missing data however according to media reports kemper lost thousands of paper documents including innumerable insurance policy applications the company had to spend significant amount of time and resources to recreate th information by going back to customers and kemper agents57 the securities and exchange commissi on whose new york regional office was located in 7 world trade center also did not digitize its paper records while the regulatory agency did have signifi cant amount of its data and files backed up electronically case files that took years to compile informal notes written down

operation any longer can prove to be difficult to recover the loss and reconstruction of the files generally can slow down the progress of some investig ations and possibly result in others being discontinued58 corollary to the lessons learned regarding comprehensive data storage plans is the need to fully and regularly test bac kup sites and media organizations that rely on cold sites backup sites that are not always in use and may require the organization to install hardware software or load data to become functional in the event of disaster could experience fu rther problems if they discover their tapes are corrupted or equipment does not work one organization that regularly tested its backup systems and information was nybot the exchange tested its backup site monthly and practiced its recovery plan every 60 days to assure its systems were working and its employees were familiar with the procedures59 lessons regarding decentralization second major category of lessons lear ned concerns the decentralization of operations and the effectiveness of di stributed communications the rise of networked computing and the internet s provided the opportunity to connect far flung locations around the country and the world many public and private sector organizations have used this technology to reach outward to new markets deliver new services and reduce communications co sts however the lessons learned discussed below suggest there is also need for organizations to turn this technology inward to reduce the vulnerabilities of internal operations and to strengthen communications links with internal as well as external constituencies decentralize operations the maxim dont put all of your eggs in one basket can be applied to variety of situations college applications job searches and investment portfolios it can also be applied to the structure and location of an or ganizations operations although many of the tenant s and neighbors of the worl d trade center had backup facilities some of these facilities were located within few blocks of their primary location resulting in the loss or at least the inaccessibility of data at both sites when it was needed most according to some industry experts recovery sites should be located at least 2050 miles way from the pr imary data center in addition some observers suggest that human resources shoul d also be located in more than one spothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542crs16 60 maggie semilof hackers not terrorists major concern internetweek 1 october 2001 p11 61 stan gibson dow jones leaves it in

733 of its employees including 150 of its information technology workers however despite th is devastating loss the firm was able to continue its operati ons in part by relying on employees in its other offices to assume some of the responsibilities of its world trade center office61 another company that benefitted from d ecentralization was blackwood trading llc the brokerage firms offices were located six blocks from the world trade center part of the area that lost power and communications service but it mirrored all of its data at remote site in jersey city nj it purposely chose site physically distant from its offices to reduce the chance of complete loss of data in the event of terrorist attack or natural disaster62 since september 11 2001 several other firms have decided to heed the decentralization lesson one of those organi zations is dow jones it had maintained offices at one world financial center adjacent to the world trade center which served as hub for 800 employees and its data production center while the damage to the building was not significant enough to prevent its eventual repair and reoccupation the damage di d render approximately 100 rvers 400 workstations and an estimated millions of dollars of the companys networking equipment inoperable as part of its new strategy to reduce its vulnerability dow jones reportedly decided to permanently move the companys data center to its backup facilities in south brunswick nj and move approximately half of its employees back to its original manhatta n location with the remainde r at other locations the financial information company plans to re ly on network of ne ws and data centers distributed around the country it will so rely more heavily on remote offices encourage telecommuting and establish new backup facility in secaucus nj separate from its south brunswick data center63 empire blue cross blue shield which benefitted significantly from its extensive backup system has also decide d to decentralize the 1900 employees from its world trade center offices into three different facilities in addition to spreading the risk the insurance carrier also observed that it is eas ier to conduct data recovery operation for smaller portion of its operations as compared to the larger whole in the event of disaster64httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542crs17 64 continued

httpwwwgovexeccomfeatures10011001spec4htmensure the ability to communicate with internal and external constituencies another lesson learned related to decentralization is the need to ensure the ability to communicate with internal and external constituencies in the event of an emergency the attacks of september 11 2001 forced many companies to rely on ad hoc networks to communicate with employees the overload of telecommunications networks including ce llular voice networks left many people scrambling to find way to get messages out some have suggested relying on wireless data backup systems as an alternative to voice networks in the case of an emergency one such network that proved useful for many people is data network which is used to support the blackberry pa ger mobile email and paging device65 in the weeks following the attacks the committee on house administration supplied blackberry devices and m onthly service to all 435 members66 demand for blackberry pager devices by other federal agencies has jumped dramatically since september 11 200167 most organizations are aware of th importance of communications with external constituencies citizens and customers in the case of government agencies this function is becoming associated w ith electronic government many people searching for information and guidance during the uncertainty that followed the attacks turned to corporate and agency web sites however the performance of these sites was mixed some sites immediately transformed themselves into centers for crisis information while others were shut down altogether the office of personnel management opm initially shut down its web site citing cyber attack concerns the site was brought back online late in the afternoon of september 11 2001 with the

traffic included the fbi the department of justice and firstgov fema regularly updated its web site with information the number of visitors to the fema site demonstrates the expectations of citizens to be able to find information online fema normally has 500000 visitors to its site every day on september 11 2001 that number soared to 23 million firstgov was bit slower in responding but by late in the day of september 12 had cobbled together page providing links to information from variety of federal state and local agencies as well as nongovernmental organi zations helping with the crisis the

category of lessons learne d involves the institutionalization of redundancy in information infrastructures redundancy as used here includes having computer or network system com ponents including hardware software and telecommunications links inst alled and ready to use as backup in the event primary resources fail related aspect of redundancy is the ability to replace andor reconstruct hardware and so ftware quickly and easily when necessary to prevent extended periods of downtime employment of redundant service providers redundancy or the lack thereof proved to be critical to many agencies and businesses in lower manhattan as scribed earlier most of the areas telecommunications lines were connected through two primary switching stations one of which was destroyed nd the other

located at 55 broad street in manhattan six bloc ks from the world trade center among the services provided by the buildings management company is full telecommunications infrastructure served by 14 voice and data carriers as result it was reported that none of th tenants lost access to their data networks and the few tenants who did use verizons voice services were able to switch to another of the buildings providers within 24 hours73 two other companies that had redundant networks were lehman brothers and empire blue cross blue shield lehman brothers which had offices both in and around the world trade center had fully redundant networks in manhattan and in jersey city nj along with duplicative widea rea links that kept all 45 of its branches connected74 empire blue cross blue shiel d whose backup system was referred to earlier also had multiple voi ce and data carriers that connected its world trade center offices to its redundant data cente rs outside of manhatta n which allowed the insurance carrier to continue to serve its 45 million customers75 it was reported that the insurance carrier was considering plans to install satellite r eceivers on the roof of its new building in brooklyn so it would be able to transmit da ta between facilities worldwide in addition to being less expensive alternative to using several high speed land lines the satellite receivers woul d also enable the company to continue to transmit data in the event that the citys land line infrastructure experiences disruption76 use of generic replaceable technology related lesson that some

equipment quickly with easytofind products that do not require significant custo mization is likely to be one of the factors affecting organizations future continuity and disaster recovery planning decisions future considerations although there are undoubtedly additional lessons learned from the september 11 2001 attacks the lessons highlighted in the previous pages provide broad sense of the breadth and depth of the issues faci ng public and private sector organizations while not allinclusive they emphasize three general approaches the establishment and practice of comprehensive continuity nd recovery plans the decentralization of operations and the development of system redundancies to elimin ate single points of weakness the lessons learned fro m september 11 2001 build in part upon the lessons learned from the 1993 world trade ce nter bombing and the preparation for the y2k transition however as agencies and businesses move ah ead with continuity planning and implementati on there are indicators that the character of this preparation is changing emphasis on business continuity over disaster recovery one change is that the new lessons learned appear to represent the shift to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31542crs21 81 the terms disaster recovery and busine ss continuity are often used interchangeably with little agreement as to their differences however disaster recovery is more of reactive function and is usually used in the context of an organizations ability to respond to specific event this involves rebu ilding and reconstituting capabilities damaged by natural or manmade disaster and could incl ude having period of downtime in which services cannot be delivered business continu ity on the other hand is more of proactive function in which an organization ensures its ability to continue to operate perhaps at reduced capacity and for an extended period of time until normal facilities are restored with little or interruption of service in the event of disaster business continuity also usually includes wider range of logistical cerns beyond technology such as employee communications alternative office locations and client interactions

continuity and disaster recovery planning81 comprehensive contingency plans perhaps once viewed at the least as optional and at the most as prudent measure may now be seen as an integral part of developing and maintaining an organizations informa tion technology infrastructure once considered remote possibility the permanent loss of facility while still unlikely must now be taken more seriously consequently an increasing number of organizations including small and midsized companies who often have more limited resources have begun to focus not just on disaster recovery but on business continuity in networked economy the costs of network downtime can be measured in tens of thousands of dollars per hour and as high as one million dollars per hour for highly technologydependent entities such as in frastructure services firms and energy companies82 other concerns such as the loss of electricity the increased frequency of computer viruses nd highprofile hacking attempts have also spurred many organizations to focus on co mprehensive business continuity planning rather than disaster recovery alone83 in addition to these higher standards there is also greater recognition of the qualitative change in preparation whereas some organizations may have felt their y2k readiness measures provided adequa protection there is now greater realization that continuity and disaster recovery planning is an openended and evolving process requiring reinforced nd redundant infrastructures regular practice exercises and testing of data backups and systems for example the pentagon which already had contingency plans in place embarked on its command communications survivability project in an effort to redesign its information technology contingency plans84 i

increased information sharing between federal state and local government as well as between the public and private sectors while information sharing figures prominently in plans for law enforcementrelated homeland security activities it also may play an important role in continuity planning and critical in formation infrastructure protection for example the chief information officer s cio council which serves as an interagency forum for the cios of thirty federal departments nd agencies decided to include representative from the national association of state chief information officers nascio in its activities in addition to collaborating on issues such as interoperability in wireless communications and electronic government initiatives several state cios are working with federa l officials on efforts related to homeland security information sharing and protecting against terrorism86 another example is operation dark screen initiated by representative ciro rodriguez87

preparedness to protect critical infrastructures from cyberattacks the organizers conducted both tabletop and live exercise88 as additional activities such as operation dark screen are carried out and
