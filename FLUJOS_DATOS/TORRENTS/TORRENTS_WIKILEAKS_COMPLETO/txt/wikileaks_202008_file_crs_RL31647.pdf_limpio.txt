is 209000 the appropriated amount is solely for the administrative expenses to carry out the program insurance payments were necessary during fy2006 insurance was provided on 24 loans and the appropriation was 208000 barber scotia college nc received loan of approximately 7 million through the hbcu capital financing program in 2004 the college lost its accreditation and its ability to participate in the federal student aid programs which subsequently led to majority of the student body withdrawing the large reduction in student enrollment caused the institution to lose substantial

obligation since march 2005 ba rber scotias prin cipal and interest payments have been made from the pooled escrow account previously discussed ed estimates that if barber scotias payments continue to be made from the escrow account without additional funds the account will be able to maintain barber scotias payments until 2014 barber scotias situation has also caused ed to reconsider its default

reauthorization in the 110th congress this section presen ts brief analyses of several issues that may be considered dur ing the reauthorization discussions authorized activities at present for most of the programs th legislation is very specific about which activities are authorized for grant recipients under title iii and t itle v however the existing language is not consistent among programs for example alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions are not specifically authorized to utilize title iii grant money for ndowment building while othe r part institutions are permitted to do so as are hbcus and hsis additionally hsis are allowed to use funds to establish outreach programs that address the drop out and retention rate within their community but none of the other programs is specifically provided comparable authority during reauthorization congress ma consider the differences between programs authorized activities there may be some activities that are inherently applicable to certain populations such as the establishment of teachers education programs to train more teachers to instruct native american students however other activities such as endowment build ing do not appear to be activities that necessarily apply only to certain institutions additionally there is difference in the amount of discretion programs are granted to develop activities that are not specifically authorized by the legislation the provisions permit part institutions to propose activities in their application that contribute to carrying out the purposes of the program and require they be approved by the secretary of education howeve r the provisions for tccus permit the proposal of activities not specifica lly listed so long as they contribute to carrying out the specified activities and the secretary of educa tion approves them the minority science and engineering impr ovement program provides wi latitude for designing activities to address the population they ar funded to serve unlike the other programs in title iii and t itle v mseip specifically states that the delineated activities are not limited to those listed this language provides grantees with the authority to develop activities that meet the general statutory purposes of the program congress may revisit how much flexibility institutions should be granted especially for activities that are not listed among the authorized activities the original congressional rationale for these limits may or may not continue to apply providing institutions greater latitude to establish activities that are not specifically addressed in the legislation may enable them to design activities that cater to the needs of the students who they serve but it also may make it more difficult to hold programs accountable and to co mpare programs effectivenesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31647crs15 waitout period the congress may debate the merit of having waitout period for some grantees but not for others the general part grantees are required to wait at least two years after the termination of grant period before applying for another grant most recently the congress eliminated the waitout period for hsis in 2000 the waitout period for tccus alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions was eliminated hbcus do not have waitout period the waitout period acknowledges that ther are more eligible institutions than available funds thus allowing new instituti ons to receive funds conversely since the grants are intended to provide ssistance to lessadva ntaged developing institutions preventing them from reapplying for two successive years may be perceived as stymying their development duration congress may debate the dur ation of support for individual institutions applying for grants the federal government has funded these programs and their predecessors for more than 40 years it is likely that many institutions have received substantial support from these programs for numerous ears given that purpose of these programs is to improve the fiscal stability and selfsufficiency of the participating institutions some may question whether these programs have been ccessful and whether individual institutions should tinue to receive aid for unlimited periods of time conversely the programs purpose is not solely aiding institutions to attain financial stability and self sufficiency mo st programs are aut horized to undertake activities to help meet the academic and ot her needs of disadvantaged students such as through student service programs thes would appear to be objectives that may require ongoing funding
