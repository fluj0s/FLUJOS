6401c09 shspec3 bad indicators in trying to relay truth it is always necessary to break it down into system by which it can be communicated the system that breaks auditing down into basic auditing technique and case analysis is useful one see the tape 6 11c05 shspec321 three zones of auditing and pp 539541 above case analysis now breaks down into the general subjects 1 case analysis 2 good indicators 3 bad indicators case analysis consists of keeping continuous eye on the pcs indicators case analysis is 1 noting when the gis are still present 2 being alert and noting when one has dropped out 3 looking to see what bi has appeared 4 programming to remedy the bi with some appropriate technique actually there is shifting back and forth between technique and case analysis case analysis contains programming see the book of case remedies bad indicators include the fact that the pc is in body not an ot the corresponding good indicator would be that he is there of his own volition the first bad indicator is that the pc looks like he doesnt want to be in session anymore that is good indicator is gone namely the pcs being there of his own volition the bad indicator is unwillingness to be there that is our first hurdle free choice not there of his own volition that ends the case analysis the above is simple example of case analysis from there on it is matter of selecting process to fit the case level what technique to use to handle this bi depends on the level of the pc and the auditor so case analysis starts out with the observation that the expected indicator or behavior ie the natural behavior of being the good indicator has gone out good indicators are actually the natural behavior of being the world particularly since freud with his idea of the censor has been crashing along on this lie that inhibited behavior is social behavior and that any uninhibited behavior is antisocial so the criminal is uninhibited so you have to punish him and put him in cell and if you inhibit him enough you will make social being out of him actually superinhibition brings about social catastrophes if you cant fix behavior you can always inhibit it you are suppressing it though and thetans forward actions and desires do not fade away they only submerge impulses do not fade away they only submerge this is axiom 0 thetan never gives up trying to create an effect holding grudge is 11 characteristic eg henry viii got even with the pope by creating the church of england this gives you better understanding of people in general seeing what happens when impulses meet with inhibition people get even you will understand history teen agers criminals and everything lot better if you realize that thetan never really gives up this is the secret of behavior this is why teenagers so commonly reject their families the child never forgives the parents for certain things often tiny things you have to find the source of rejection or revolt auditing easily brings this to the fore the child rejects his parents to get even besides forgiveness per is propitiation the source of mans ingratitude and the secret of leadership is just the fact that thetan never gives up as an auditor you are just auditing all the nutty aberrated inhibited times when the pc never gave up when he postulated something silly when he tried to do something stupid you can actually graph how some innocent goal or impulse goes through this process of degradation 1 it becomes inhibited submerged and warped 2 it emerges at lower level as an overt 3 below that it emerges as withhold you could graph that on any ambition 4 below that is unawareness which submerges down to 5 unconsciousness 6 humanoid that is how goal becomes an overt withhold unawareness unconsciousness and below that humanoid so when being comes in for auditing his being there of his own volition is the biggest good indicator there is he is surrounded by bad indicators which you are going to eradicate the hope factor is put in by validating whatever good indicators are present the next best indicator is that the pc is getting better betterness to us means less present in the sense of my ankle is getting better the pain confusion etc is less present betterment is the lessening of bad condition so the pc getting better wrongnesses less present is good indicator this is negative gain if all you did in session were to validate the good indicators that were present and attack and handle one by one the bad indicators that were present thereby restoring more good indicators you would get amazing results you would be enormously successful the pc would approach native state dont try to train or audit someone against his own volition assuming that you have tried and failed to change his mind it is bad indicator all you need to be able to do is to spot gis and when gis are not present to spot the bad indicator that is present and to go ahead and handle it if case goes on talking about something he hasnt gotten rid of it and you havent yet achieved negative gain in the area all your lowerlevel gains are based on destimulation and removal of bis progress on case is measured by the number of gis that you are restoring this applies to level iv or below note that this is the precursor of grades auditing bad indicator 1 pc nervous about auditing level 0 at the lowest levels you assume that the pc is not there on his own determinism and work on fixing this up you want to have pc who is not nervous about getting auditing at level 0 discuss scientology with him let him know what it is about try to get him there under his own determinism get him to decide level i discuss auditing healing therapies etc get his ideas about these things reassure the pc that you are not auditing him to make him guilty you are only concerned with making the able more able get what others ideas or opinions are about treatment and what it might do to him try to cope with the pc intellectually get into general discussion of his being audited level ii here you could run repetitive process which could go as follows what have you had to do which you didnt want to do or what orders have you had to follow about your health general ow would also be runnable at this level level iii pull missed withholds on auditing past auditing or treatment prepcheck any of those or something like on auditing goals or on being forced to be audited you could run r2h now renamed r3h you could do arc break assessments or find the pcs basic ideas about being audited how he originally felt about it level iv here youve got service facs arc breaks with auditors practitioners arc breaks that the pc has had in past processing etc etc at level iv we can find one session that the person didnt want in the past because of withhold or something that would be key point to knock out of the way you could run how would refusing to be audited make you rightothers wrong why shouldnt you be audited is crude but workable process at this level bad indicator 2 pc unfriendly or cool towards the auditor unappreciative of the auditor or auditing this opens the door to large area of withholds overts cut comm cut itsa etc you can run out of itsa by specializing in solutions only not problems even though the ta motion comes from solutions thus you sacrifice some present ta motion for greater amount of future ta motion you could spend fifty percent of your time on problems and fifty percent on solutions and get more ta by not running out of itsa it is fiftyfifty proposition this is because gpms are fifty percent terminals fixed solutions and fifty percent oppterms fixed problems both give good ta unfriendliness to the auditor could stem from the auditors keeping the pc from itsaing as area of interest including problems you must get into problems somewhat so that the pc has something to talk about at all the pc will get unfriendly if the auditor never gives him anything to talk about level 0 get the pc to discuss what damage the auditor might do to him or her this is lousy solution since it asks for more critical but it is better than nothing get the pc to explain why he shouldnt be audited this can get him quite friendly and right into session level i another lowlevel remedy would be how could you help this raises the arc of the pc you could also get the pc to explain any trouble he has gotten into by imparting confidences or talking too freely that also gets off few missed withholds you could use what are you willing to talk to about level ii you could use similar processes here as well as general ow on auditors level iii you could pull withholds missed by auditors you could prepcheck auditors practitioners help or failed help as indicated level iv you work on help and failed help on service fac basis using if you were really helped by auditing how would that make you wrong if you werent helped by auditing how would that make you right when pcs at levels v vi and vii are unfriendly to auditors there is some foulup in the root of the bank bad indicator 3 pc nervous about being audited in particular auditing room thats the auditing environment these things always run down to some horrendous ptp or arc break level 0 discuss the dangerousness of the environment level i discuss dangerous environments in general the trouble he has had in auditing rooms in practitioners rooms get solutions off how he has solved it level ii finding things that are safe level iii havingness level iv get associative restimulators here is suggested exercise make list of bad indicators that could be present if homo sapiens were dragged in chains into your auditing room then figure out what you might be able to do about these things given enough time perhaps over course of months you should be able to turn him into highflying pc by 1 seeing good indicator missing 2 noting all the bad indicators 3 selecting the one that is most in the road of auditing 4 eradicating that one first 5 continue handling the bis one by one by getting considerations off etc until more bis are present using this procedure you could get anyone matter how initially hostile he was to want auditing on his own determinism and not by overwhelming him auditing is converting bis to gis as you work the case remember that the person has had some impulses somewhere along the line that got inhibited and submerged handling those by getting back to them will give resurgence of the case
