united states than in other countries some consumers have attempted to import medications from abroad in order to realize cost savings the practice of importing prescription drugs outside the distribution channels established by the brandname drug company is commonly termed parallel importation parallel imports are authentic products that are legitimately distributed abroad and then sold to consumers in the united states without the permission of the authorized us dealer parallel importation may raise significant intellectual property issues many prescription drugs are subject to patent rights in the united states in the jazz photo decision the us court of appeals for the federal circuit confirmed that the owner of us patent may prevent imports of patented goods even in circumstances where the patent holder itself sold those goods outside the united states the jazz photo opinion squarely declined to extend the exhaustion doctrine under which patent rights in product are spent upon the patent owners first sale of the patented productto sales that occurred in foreign countries the courts ruling will in some cases allow brandname pharmaceutical firms to block the unauthorized parallel importation of prescription drugs through use of their patent rights several state and local governments are either themselves importing or encouraging others to import patented medications from foreign jurisdictions the eleventh amendment of the us constitution provides that federal court may not adjudicate lawsuit by private person against state except under certain limited circumstances the ability of private party to obtain remedy for patent infringement against state government is therefore uncertain eleventh amendment immunity may in some cases extend to political subdivisions of state as well in addition to any patent rights they possess brandname drug companies may place label licenses on their medications it is possible to draft label license restricting use of drug to the jurisdiction in which it was sold as result in addition to charge of patent infringement an unauthorized parallel importer may potentially face liability for breach of contract legislation introduced before the 110 th congress s 1082 addresses the importation of prescription drugs titled the food and drug administration revitalization act this bill would amend the patent act of 1952 to provide that importation into the united states of regulated pharmaceutical sold abroad by patent proprietor or its representative is not patent infringement introduction of an international exhaustion rule restricted to pharmaceuticals does not appear to be prohibited by the provisions of the socalled trips agreement which is the component of the world trade organization wto agreements concerning intellectual property another possible legislative response is the immunization of specific individuals such as pharmacies or importers from patent infringement liability alternatively legislative action need be taken if the current possibility of an infringement action against unauthorized importers of patented pharmaceuticals is deemed satisfactory

many us consumers as spending on health care has risen in recent years1 so too has consumer interest in purchasing more affordable medications overseas markets provide one possible source of less costly prescription drugs some comparative studies of prescription drug prices in the united states and foreign nations have concluded that prices for specific drugs may be significantly lower abroad2 these price disparities in some instances have encouraged individuals and firms as well as state and local governments to attempt to import comparable medications from abroad in order to realize cost savings3 the practice of importing patented prescription drugs outside the distribution channels established by the brandname drug company is commonly termed parallel importation4 parallel imports are authentic products that are legi timately distributed abroad and then sold to consumers in the united states without the permi ssion of the authorized us dealer these goods are legitimate in that they are produced by the brandname drug company or its authorized representative in particular parallel imports are not generic versions of brandname drug distributed by different manufacturer nor are they pirated copies that form part of the black market because parallel imports disrupt the marketing arrangements established by the brand name drug company however they are sometimes called grey market goods5 current debate surrounding the parallel importation of prescription pharmaceuticals has largely addressed the safety and efficacy of the imported medications6 this practice may also raise significant intellectual property concerns however many prescription drugs are subject to patent rights in the united states indeed because patented drugs usually have exact generic equivalent available in the marketplace7 economic incentives for parallel importation may be strongest for patented medications among the rights granted by an issued patent is the ability to exclude others from importing the patented product into the united states 8 as result even if foreign drug is judged safe and effective for domestic use brandname firms may nonetheless be able to block the unauthorized importation of prescription drugs through use of their patent rights legislation introduced before the 110th congress s 1082 would account for the patent implications of the parallel importation of pharmaceuticals in particular this bill would amend the patent act of 1952 to provide that it is not an act of patent infringement to import into the united states drug that was first sold abroad by

known as international exhaustion into the us patent law9 the parallel trade of patented pharmaceuticals involves fundamental tradeoff within the intellectual property law encouraging the labors that led to technological innovation on one hand and promoting access to the fruits of those labors on the other the patent system is built upon the premise that patents provide individuals with an incentive to innovate by awarding inventors exclusive rights in their inventions for limited period of time 10 some observers believe that diminishment of patent rights will decrease incentives to develop new pharmaceuticals in the future11 yet there is growing concern that drug prices are too high in the united states as compared to other nations some commentators believe that the patent system should not be used to regulate the movement of legitimate lawfully purchased products through the global marketplace 12 this report explores the intellectual property laws and policies concerning the parallel importation of patented pharmaceuticals into the united states13 it begins with review of patent policy and procedures the report then discusse s the current legal framework

many commentators have argued that the patent system is necessary to encourage individuals to engage in inventive activity14 proponents of this view reason that absent patent system inventions could

inability of inventors to capitalize on their inventions would lead to an environment where too few inventions are made by providing individuals with exclusive rights in their inventions for limited time the patent system allows inventors to realize the profits from their inventions further these rights are grounded in the us constitution which authorizes congress to delineate them15 the courts have also suggested that absent pate nt law individuals would favor maintaining their inventions as trade secrets so that competitors could not exploit them trade secrets do not enrich the collective knowledge of society however nor do they discourage others from engaging in duplicative research the patent system attempts to avoid these inefficiencies by requiring inventors to consent to the disclosure of th eir inventions in issued patent instruments16 there are still other explanations for the patent laws for instance the patent act of 195217 is thought by supporters to stimulate technological advancement by inducing individuals to invent around patented technology issued patent instruments may point the way for others to develop improvements exploit new markets or discover new applications for the patented technology18 the patent system may encourage patentees to exploit their proprietary technologies during the term of the patent proponents believe the protection provided by patents proprietary rights increases the likelihood firm will continue to refine produce and market the patented technology19 finally the patent law has been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inventor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license and even less ability to police the conduct of contracting party by reducing licensees opportunistic possibilities the patent system lowers transaction costs and makes technologybased transactions more feasible20 the current patent system has great number of critics some assert that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of invention the desire to gain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that technologically backward firms lose out to their rivals may well provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives 21 some commentators observe that successful inventors are sometimes transformed into complacent established enterprises that use patents to suppress the innovations of others22 others assert that the inventions that have fueled some of our most dynamic industries such as early biotech nologies and computer software arose at time when patent rights were unavailable or uncertain23 15 us constitution article i 8 cl 8 16 see eg grant v raymond 31 us 218 247 1832 17 pl

degrees of intuitive appeal none of them has been empirically validated conc lusive study broadly demonstrates that we get more useful inventive activity with patents than we would without them the justifications and criticisms of the patent system therefore remain open to challenge by those who are unpersuaded by their internal logic24

patent rights do not arise automatically inventors must prepare and submit applications to the us patent and trademark office uspto if they wish to obtain patent protection26 uspto officials known as examiners then assess whether the application merits the award of patent27 the patent acquisition process is commonly known as prosecution28 in deciding whether to approve patent applic ation an uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention29 in addition the application must disclose the best mode or preferred way that the applicant knows to practice the invention30 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit31 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the public domain32 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made33 if the uspto allows the patent to issue the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention 34 the term of the patent is ordinarily set at twenty years from the date the patent application was filed35 patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions or license others to do so the grant of patent permits the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery often by charging higher price than would prevail in competitive market 24 see crs report rl31951 innovation intellectual property and industry standards by john r thomas 25 pl 82593 66 stat

monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention or not patent owners who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal district courts the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit possesses exclusive national jurisdiction over all patent appeals from the district courts36 while the us supreme court possesses discretionary au thority to review cases decided by the federal circuit37 pharmaceutical patents are subject to special provisions created by the drug price competition and patent restoration act of 198438 this legislation which was subject to significant legislative revisions in 200339 is commonly known as the hatchwaxman act40 this statute establishes special rules for enforcement of certain patents on certain drugs and medical devices by brandname firms against generic competitors the hatchwaxman act includes provisions extending the term of patent to reflect regulatory delays encountered in obtaining marketing approval by the food and drug administration fda 41 exempting from patent infringement certain activities associated with regulatory marketing approval42 establishing mechanisms to challenge the validity of pharmaceutical patent43 and creating reward for disputing the validity enforceability or infringement of patented and approved drug44 the 1984 act also provides the fda with certain authorities to offer periods of marketing exclusivity for pharmaceutical independent of the rights conferred by patents 45

exhaustion doctrine an authorized unrestricted sale of patented product depletes the patent right with respect to that physical object46 as result of this doctrine the purchaser of patented good ordinarily may use charge others to use or resell the good without further regard to the patentee the courts have reasoned that when patentee sells product without restriction it impliedly promises its customer that it will not interfere with the full enjoyment of that product47 the result is that the lawful purchasers of patented goods may use or resell these goods free of the patent48 because it is the first sale of patented product that extinguishes patent rights with 36 28 usc 1295a1 2006 37 28 usc 12541 2006 38 pl 98417 98 stat 1585 1984 39 the medicare prescription drug and

exhaustion doctrine as the first sale rule49 for example suppose that consumer purchases an appliance at hardware store the appliance is subject to patent that is owned by the manufacturer later the consumer sells the appliance to neighbor at garage sale ordinarily the patent laws provide the manufacturer with the ability to prevent others from selling an appliance that uses its patented design50 in this case however the patent right in that particular appliance was exhausted when the manufacturer made its first sale to the consumer that consumer as well as any subsequent purchasers of that individual appliance may freely sell it without concern for the manufacturers patent51 g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g156g153g142g140g157g156g561 us patents provide their owners with rights only within the united states52 the grant of us patent provides its owner with legal rights in any foreign nation if inventors desire intellectual property protection in another country they must specifically procure patent in that jurisdiction ordinarily the foreign patent acquisition process begins with the submission of patent application to foreign patent office53 as practical matter multinational corporations often obtain set of corresponding national patents for each of their significant inventions although these patents concern the same inventionfor example the same chemical compound that possesses pharmacological propertiesthey often do not have precisely the same legal effect in each jurisdiction divergent wordings of the patents claims translations into various languages and distinctions between national patent laws and practice are among the factors that lead to these differences 54 under an important international agreement concerning patents the convention of paris for the protection of industrial property paris convention55 each issued national patent is an independent legal instrument one significant consequence of the independence of national patents is that they must be enforced individually56 for example suppose that an inventor owns patents directed towards the same invention in both the united states and canada following

price disparities between the united states and other nations create incentives for individuals to purchase medications from abroad and import them into the united states in order to lower health care costs or undercut the us distributor 58 in this context the term parallel imports refers to patented products that are legitimately distributed abroad and then sold to consumers in the united states without the permission of the authorized us dealer although these grey market goods are authentic products that were sold under the authorization of the brandname drug company they entered the us market outside the usual distribution channels for that drug the legal situation regarding the parallel importation of patented pharmaceuticals remains somewhat clouded in such circumstances the us patent proprietor may be able to use its patent rights to block the importation of grey market pharmaceuticals because this scenario involves the distribution of patented product that initially sold under the authorization of the patent proprietor it raises issues concerning the exhaustion doctrine 59 one position favorable to the patent proprietor is that the us patent is fully enforceable against imports despite the exhaustion doctrine under this line of reasoning the fact that the sale by the patent proprietor or its representative took place outside the united states is significant this line of reasoning relies on the fact that us patents exist independently of foreign patents 60 and that us patents are effective only within the united states61 as result this reasoning continues foreign sale cannot result in exhaustion of us patent this legal doctrinewhich restricts the exhaustion doctrine to domestic sales onlyallows the us patent to be used to block unauthorized imports of patented pharmaceutical62 competing view is that the exhaustion doctrine is not limited to domestic sales by the patentee or its representative but to all sales regardless of their location this position is commonly referred to as international exhaustion 63 under this view because the importer lawfully purchased authentic goods from the patent holder or its representative the us patent right is 57 ibid 58 see eg shubha ghosh pills patents and power state creation of gray markets as limit on patent rights 14 florida journal of international law 217 2002 59 nanao naoko et decisions on

that the sale technically took place under foreign patent64 in its 2001 decision in jazz photo corp v united states international trade commission 65 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit rejected the international exhaustion position and instead limited the exhaustion doctrine to sales that occur within the united states there the federal circuit issued succinct statement explaining united states patent rights are not exhausted by patent rights of foreign provenance to invoke the protection of the first sale doctrine the authorized first sale must have occurred under the united states patent see boesch v graff 133 us 697 10 sct 378 33 led 787 1890 66 some commentators have criticized the federal circuits reasoning in the jazz photo case and in particular the courts reliance on the boesch v graff decision67 in boesch v graff the plaintiff owned us patent for lamp burner an indi vidual named hecht who was not party to the litigation enjoyed prior user right pertaining to the lamp burners under german law the german patent statute allowed individuals who had used an invention prior to the date of anothers patent application the privilege of continuing to exploit the invention commercially without regard to the patent hecht had met the condit ions for this prior user right to apply and as result could sell the burners in germany hecht eventually sold some burners to the defendants who in turn imported them into the united states and commenced sales the plaintiff brought suit to enjoin the sale of the imported burners in the united states in opposing the injunction the defendants argued that they had lawfully purchased the burners and that the us patent should be subject to the exhaustion doctrine the supreme court rejected the defendants arguments holding the right which hecht had to make and sell the burners in germany was allowed him under the laws of that country and purchasers from him could not be thereby authorized to sell the articles in the united states in defiance of rights of patentees under united states patent the sale of articles in the united states under united states patent cannot be controlled by foreign laws 68 the facts and holding of boesch have suggested to some commentators that its precedential reach is quite limited in boesch it was prior user rather than the patentee or its licensee which made the foreign sale the patentee neither consented to the sale of the invention nor received compensation for that sale according to some obser vers this is much different state of affairs than the typical parallel importation case where either the patentee or an authorized overseas distributor makes sale as part of an armslength commercial transaction 69 64 see jamie s gorelick rory k

of the issue in jazz photo some legal commentators have questioned whether this apparent absolute ban on parallel importation will survive further judicial scrutiny70 the federal circuit has maintained this holding in subsequent case law71 however so the federal circuits statement in the jazz photo case remains the controlling patent law precedent in particular the federal district courts are bound by the jazz photo decision unless the federal circuit or supreme court alters the rule72 to summarize current law the federal circuit has taken the position that patent exhaustion applies only to sales that occurred in the united states this rule squarely rejects the principle of international exhaustion as result brandname drug companies may potentially block imports of patented medications into the united states even if the imported good is the patent owners own product legitimately sold to customer in foreign jurisdiction73

jurisdiction over patent infringement litigation77 this situation creates dilemma for patenteesthe only statutorily authorized forum is constitutionally unavailable and the only constitutional forum is statutorily unavailable at least for the assertion of conventional patent infringement claim this means that patentees only option would be state court suit charging the state government with taking or asserting general unfair competition principles in order to vindicate its patent rights78 the supreme court established one notable exception to the eleventh amendment prohibition against federal court litigation against state in ex parte young 79 the court allowed private citizens to petition federal court to enjoin state officials acting in their official capacity from engaging in future conduct that would violate the constitution or federal statute the doctrine is based on premise that state officers who violate federal law in the course of discharging the duties of their positions are acting outside the authority of their office and therefore do not qualify as the state or its agent for eleventh amendment purposes 80 the only remedy available under the ex parte young ruling is prospective injunctive relief however rather than monetary judgment that would compensate for past harms81 further some uncertainty exists over the application of the young exception to patents although the federal patent statute establishes the conditions under which inventors may obtain patents an individual patent is effectively the grant of private right not federal law congress attempted to abrogate the eleventh amendment immunity of states to patent infringement suits in 1992 the patent and plant variety protection remedy clarification act introduced section 271h into the patent act of 195282 that provision specified not only that the states were subject to patent infringement suits in the federal courts but that they were liable for any remedies that could be had against private party83 however the 1999 opinion of the supreme court in florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board v college savings bank found that congress had not properly abrogated state immunity to patent infringement litigation in the federal courts in keeping with the requirements of the eleventh amendment84 in florida prepaid and other opinions the supreme court did leave open the possibility that state could waive its eleventh amendment immunity by submitting to federal jurisdiction85 in addition congress may in some cases overcome state eleventh amendment immunity through legislation pursuant to another constitutional authority such as the fourteenth amendment86 76 the eleventh amendment to the us constitution stipulates the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state 77

supreme court issued the florida prepaid decision that would take this approach but none has been enacted87 the immunity to federal suit provided by the eleventh amendment is restricted to state governments and does not ordinarily apply to local governments88 as result city or county government is generally not entitled to claim eleventh amendment immunity and avoid suit for patent infringement in federal court however some judicial opinions have reasoned that political subdivision of state can qualify for eleventh amendment immunity where the locality is only nominally the actor and the state itself is the real party in interest in the litigation 89 this determination depends on the precise relationship between the state and its political subdivision under the circumstances of particular case90 g14g138g139g142g149g561g14g146g140g142g151g156g142g156g561 as noted previously the theory behind the exhaustion doctrine is that when patent proprietor makes an unrestricted sale of product to consumer the proprietor impliedly promises its customer that it will not use its patent rights to interfere with the full enjoyment of that product 91 as result lawful purchasers of patented goods should be able to use or resell these goods free of the patent92 in some circumstances however the patent owner may attempt to restrict customers use of good sales contracts are the typical mechanism for imposing such limitations contractual provisions that are placed on the product or its packaging are sometimes termed label licenses or bag tags 93 commonly observed label license is single use only as applied to printer cartridges or other goods that the manufacturer does not intend for consumers to reuse94 other patent proprietors have attempted to impose geographical limitations upon the use of their products label stating for use in canada only is representative of such restriction whether such label licenses are enforceable or are instead nullified by the exhaustion principle is complex legal issue however the prevailing view of the court of appeals for the federal circuit is that absent exceptional circumstancessuch as an antitrust violation or misuse of the patent by its proprietorthese restrictions will be upheld95 the legal theory is that the patent 87 jeffrey w childers state sovereign immunity and the protection of

state then the same treatment must be extended to all wto member states105 other than these basic national treatment and mostfavorednation obligations the trips agreement does not impose other

of options are available if the possibility of an infringement action against unauthorized importers of patented pharmaceuticals is deemed sound then action need be taken alternatively congress could confirm the federal circuits decision in jazz photo which rejects the doctrine of international exhaustion and confines the exhaustion principle to sales that occurred within the united states 107 if legislative activity is deemed appropriate however another possibility is the introduction of some form of international exhaustion doctrine into us patent law the trips agreement does not seem to require that country adopt the international exhaustion doctrine as an allornothing proposition applying either to all patented products or to none108 as result if congress chose to limit application of the international exhaustion doctrine to patented pharmaceuticals or some other specific type of invention then ramifications appear to arise with respect to the trips agreement obligations of the united states it s hould be noted however that there appears to be precedent either domestically or abroad for establishing an international exhaustion doctrine that is specific to pharmaceuticals at least two statutory mechanisms exist for implementing the international exhaustion doctrine into us patent law one possible approach would be to declare that importation into the united states of goods sold abroad by patent proprietor or its representative is not patent infringement legislation introduced before the 110 th congress s 1082 takes this approach with respect to patented pharmaceuticals specifying that it shall not be an act of infringement to use offer to sell or sell within the united states or to import into the united states any patented invention under section 804 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act that was first sold abroad by or under authority of the owner or licensee of such patent 109 in addition to codifying the international exhaus tion doctrine with respect to pharmaceuticals the amendment proposed in s 1082 may conversely d to the implication that the international exhaustion doctrine does not apply to patented inventions other than pharmaceuticals this 105 ibid 106 the united states has also entered into free trade agreements with certain of its trading partners certain of these agreements may also bear upon the parallel

case for inventions outside of the pharmaceutical field another statutory mechanism for promoting the importation of patented drugs is to immunize specific individuals from infringement liability the patent act takes this approach in the area of patented medical methods exempting licensed medical practitioners and certain health care entities from patent infringement in certain circumstances110 in the case of drug importation potential patent infringers include importers dist ributors wholesalers pharmacies and individual consumers should congress wish to promote llel trade in patented pharmaceuticals an explicit statutory infringement exemption could encourage individuals to engage in drug importation in considering these or other legal changes to the patent laws the possibility of label licenses should be kept in mind even if congress exempted drug importation practices or practitioners from patent infringement liability firms may still be able to stipulate through the contract law that drug sold in foreign jurisdiction is for use exclusively within that jurisdiction111 if purchaser instead imported that medication into the united states then the seller may have cause of action for breach of contract as result any legal chan ges may need to account for the ability of firms to use contractual provisions as something of substitute for patent protection in the area of prescription drug importation in addition the issue of drug importation may provide an impetus for clarification of the patent infringement liability of state governments112 some states as well as political subdivisions of the states have either seriously considered or commenced the practice of drug importation to the extent that these authorities continue this trend their potential eleventh amendment immunity to patent infringement case in federal court may present another significant issue concerning patents and drug importation controlling the costs of prescription drug spending on one hand and encouraging the development of new drugs on the other are both significant goals these aspirations may potentially conflict however although introducing international exhaustion into us patent law may initially lower the price of patented drugs it might also decrease the incentive of firms to engage in the research and development of new pharmaceuticals as well as to shepherd new drugs through timeconsuming and costly marketing approval procedures consideration of patent law reforms would likely be put into the larger context of drug costs which may be influenced by the pricing policies of foreign nations profits ea rned by wholesalers and other intermediaries the physical costs of shipment into the united states and other diverse factors 113 striking balance between increasing access to medications and ensuring the continued development of new drugs by our nations pharmaceutical firms is central concern of the current drug importation debate 110 35 usc 287c 2006
