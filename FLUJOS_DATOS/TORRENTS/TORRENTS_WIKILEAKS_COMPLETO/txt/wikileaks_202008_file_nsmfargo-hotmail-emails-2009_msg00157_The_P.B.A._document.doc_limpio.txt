the peoples business authority the reparationist humanitarian party one people one government one economy one utopia introduction and summary the proposed peoples business authority unified government owned economy and one world government offers an enhanced and more powerful political system than any other political system that will heighten every area of society by achieving every target that which society aspires and end every form of injustice in society by restructuring the global economy to be owned by and to serve the people first the most that it can perfecting and unifying economy with many direct and surprising positives rightful and legal claim for ownership by the nations and their peoples of all economic capital and profits past and present is proven and shown in this document and the illegality of modern disassociated and weak economic ownership which derives from false and illegal claims of royal ownership of all lands being granted by god is highlighted reasonable fair wage history will be judged to replace past over the top wage histories when claiming monies and assets that rightfully belong to the people and those who have been underpaid over the years will have their wage histories positively readjusted the value of wages being judged relative to average prices in nation throughout modern history and according to finances available in nationalglobal economies the massive potential of global economy united will ensure readjusted wages will be very high and advice to maintain or gain ownership of rich assets after wage readjustments is for people to put together their money with friends and acquaintances to share ownership of rich assets such as mansions yachts and flashy cars many new life enhancing ideas are introduced including streamlining the new unified economy which acts as one by twenty five to fifty percent 25 50 with the creation of cooperative unified economy with interbusiness competition sectioned out and with mechanisation investment this with business commerce and service maintained then with one hundred and thirty three to two hundred percent 133 200 more workers than the workforce capacity of the economy the total workforce will be applied upon this lesser number of employment positions this having all workers employed matter how many jobs are available in an economy and creating between three to six 36 months holiday time year for workers with year long wages when there ia greater number of workers sharing lesser number of employment positions full employment ensured always and employee wages funding economies will be ensured and of greater number workers will be able to increase their salaries by between twenty five to fifty percent 25 50 with second jobs if available instead of holidays under the total workforce applied upon lesser employment capacity policy public taxes will be lowered by substantial amount when all economic profits are under public ownership standards of living will be highered in every economy with services and goods produced and delivered of the highest quality possible and supplemented to affordable prices from the combined nationalglobal economic profits the standard of goods and services will also improve with all business secrets and procedures freely available to be used by every business in cooperative unified economy better health services free education university level education allowances and re housing schemes will be funded from the greater finance of the global economies profits and many life changing services such as satellite television and essential better healthier foods will be provided for free or at supplemented low prices ninetynine per cent 99 of housing will be rebuilt and upgraded to the highest level complete complement of community amenities for performance and tuition of sports and the arts will be funded and provided to every community economies will also be stronger because economies will be more profitable streamlined with less business overheads and with full employment ensured always peoples business authority economies able to better withstand recessions also business service and jobs will be protected by the combined nationalglobal economies profits and with unified economy business commitments such as pension providence will outlast businesses after closure and therefore will be more secure the workers career choices and education will be dictated by government so there are worker shortages in any sector and educated that are out of work in the sector that their education is directed to immigrants will be accommodated and provided with employments under government direction and illegal immigrants will be legalised all around the world this easily within peoples business authority nations means creating increased holidays for the native and stronger national militaries police public guards and health services the previous owners of the newly owned government businesses will be given the highest new jobs made available when total workforces are sharing lesser number of employment positions replacing their lost positions with top jobs business management being the most probable position offered to previous owners one world government with global business authority and global defence organisation will be setup in the interests of global prosperity and global security and common world language will be selected for all armies to learn so armies of every nationality can communicate and work together the funding of government owned world economy will end poverty and fund every charitable cause to completion putting in place every measure to eradicate and treat disease cure the worlds twenty eight million 28000000 curable blind end child labour and slavery which affects millions 1000000s food supply will be controlled protected and improved all around the world with healthy varied diets promoted to end malnutrition and its ill effects on mental and physical health and the natural disasters that occur due to global warming and other causes will be responded to with greater maximum resource fair trade will be attained trade unions encouraged and worker conditions and wages will be improved the scientific community are called on to gain complete knowledge of nature formation science to achieve the potential from this science of immortality for all life and curing every sickness we also have the potential with this science to produce foods petroleum and raw materials external from living bodies alternative theories on nature formation science and disease origination are offered and genetic engineering is encouraged to modernize our immune systems to protect us from every sickness monies out of circulation indefinitely will be given to charities crime and violence will be made impossible by establishing massive public defence forces in every nation who secure and section areas with use of checkpoints and searches of areas if under suspicion to seize guns bombs and illicit materials and to find and save any falsely imprisoned people public defence forces will also have peace keeping function to be armed protection for civilian populations and prevent wars ninety per cent 90 of armies will be converted into public defence forces crime will be further prevented with employment and education dictated and with laws to recoup all past illegal monies through certification and identifying the nature of all monies this shutting down criminal industry and preventing and recouping corruption prisons will empty over time with zero crime enforced and the dignity humanity and rights of the prisoner will be maintained and defended this encourages ex prisoners to be successful in life after release from prison heavy work introduced to prisons will also encourage this laws and policies will be introduced to protect unborn children families from domestic abuse and abolish the death penalty drug rehabilitation and treatment services will be made freely available for all world peace will be secured with the policy of democratic tribal sovereignty enforced and with winning arguments against the socalled modern muslim jihad and racism if they enter public awareness with world peace assured all child soldiers will be integrated back into society and the loss of life from war will be prevented the principals and ethics of democracy and peace will be embraced and adopted by peoples business authority parties all these policies can be achieved by every economy in this modern age with the power of economy serving the people with expense spared developed nations will be developed more to new first world standard and developing nations will be developed at great speed to meet this standard government and business the main forces that structure every life will unite and be people orientated under the peoples authority and will serve the people first greatly improving quality of life for all showing the rightful and legal ownership of the economy by the people due to the illegal historical hand out and sales of all lands and resources by royalty and lords to private investors and families in ages gone passing onto modern ownership the original royal claim of ownership being granted by god which passed onto modern ownership false and illegal the legality and rightful claim of ownership of the economy by government representing the people is shown in this document through analysis of the origin of modern ownership of all lands resources and businesses being from false claim of royal ownership of all lands being granted by god this claim illegal through this claim lords and royal figureheads sold and handed out all lands and resources worldwide to private investors and families which passed onto modern ownership the source of this illegal considering the illegality of the ownership of all lands and resources that has passed down through the ages and the rightful claim of ownership of all lands and the resources within by the people represented by their governments government can claim the wealth of their nations the business and natural resource industries capital and profits past and present on the peoples behalf through law and even if the aforementioned was not claimable by law ownership would still change into public hands democratically to heighten humanity and to save humanity from the modern day crisiss of poverty homelessness drug dependence crime war famine disease genocide inadequate responses to natural disasters slavery child labour underfunded health systems unfair trade unfairly low wages and lower worker conditions all of which can only be rectified by the policy and resources of government owned economies these tragedies are prominent in the present peoplepowerless capitalist system peoplefirst peoples business authority capitalism will raise the world out of these tragedies and allow everyone to thrive and prosper with zero neglect the peoples business authority urges governments or groups to take businesses to court to recognise the claim of ownership of all businesses by the people through national and world law and to raise awareness of the peoples business authority and its causes national ownership of economies what is proposed by national ownership is that the governments of every nation the representatives of the people claim ownership of every nations businesses and natural resource industries capital and profits past and present realigning capitalism away from the weak and illegal system of disassociated ownership to stronger and legal system of unified public economic ownership this creating powerful and caring people orientated and public owned unified capitalism capitalism is the greatest force on this earth involving people and needs to be controlled and to serve the people primarily that it is not owned organized and controlled under people serving unified system has lessened the life of every human and is tragedy upon history modern political systems internationally are trying to provide enough for all sectors of societys welfare but they fail even in this task with many sectors of society impoverished homeless enslaved starving diseased criminal warring and refugee national ownership of economy with peoples business authority policy would rectify these problems and quality of life for every person will improve correcting past monetary injustice with government and business service to the public heightened with stronger economies with cheaper and higher quality of goods and services with lower taxes with substantially increased worker holidays with all within nation accommodated with zero neglect including immigrants with complete compliments of community amenities with measures put in place for crime violence and every injustice to be eradicated completely from the world with every charitable cause funded to completion with better responses to natural disasters with greater protection for the environment and with greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions when economy is united and completely controlled by government under national ownership the nations can claim ownership of all businesses within their boarders through law and where there are sections of foreign multinational companies claimed by nation the nation will inherit and fulfill the productionsales contracts previously attained by the sections of the multinational companies and these sections of the multinational companies will still function as if they are still part of the multinational organization as they legally belong to the nation and will be seen as such in national and world law company names logos and contracts will be maintained under public ownership after peoples business authority national conversions until there is global recognition and conversion to the peoples business authority when company logos and names will be replaced with national names and emblems national ownership economy is an economy working for standards and quality of life first and profit second claiming the rightful ownership of past economic profits by replacing over the top wage histories with reasonable fair wage histories and those who have been underpaid over the years will have their wage histories positively readjusted and the way to maintainattain ownership of rich assets with rightful and legal ownership of economic capital past and present the nation will want proportion of past profits from every business to correct past monetary injustice and to fund global utopia that will last indefinitely for the minority of those who claimed the proceeds of excess business profits reasonable fair wage history will be judged to replace past over the top wage histories and the state will claim monies assets and lands that rightfully and lawfully belong to the people current and future wages will be aligned to these reasonable fair wage histories also the government will give time and first option to the minority of those who have had their assets claimed after judging appropriate lesser wage histories to officially buy back claimed lands and assets from hisher fairer wages the value of these assets will be lower with the deflating effect that readjusting peoples wage histories will have upon some markets and so the minority of those who have had their wage histories readjusted negatively will have lower amount to pay to regain hisher assets that otherwise would be sold by government at this lower price also those who have been underpaid over the years will have their wage histories upped to reasonable level and will receive bulk sum of money to correct history of underpaid wages the value of wages being judged relative to average prices in nation throughout modern history and according to finances available in nationalglobal economies the massive potential of global economy united will ensure readjusted wages will be very high individual business ownership has an unhealthy aspect for economies and nations they store large proportion of total economic profits putting large proportion of nations economic wealth out of use when the public represented by their governments seize this money the performance of economies will improve and wealth for the average citizen will increase also for the many who cant afford to maintain ownership of rich assets after wage readjustment and for those who would like to attain rich assets for the first time these people can put their money together with friends and acquaintances and share rich assets such as mansions yachts and flashy cars the benefits of unified peoples business authority economies lower public taxes with the massive combined profits of every business under public ownership the nations can afford to lower public taxes by substantial amount for every individual relieving the tax strain upon individuals and families streamlining unified economies by sectioning out competition and through mechanisation reducing employment capacities by twenty five to fifty percent 25 50 and then applying total workforces upon the employment capacities of economies giving full employment indefinitely and between three to six 36 months time off for workers with year long wages the greatest and most surprising benefit of unifying economies under central government ownership is that full employment can be easily achieved and all workers can receive three to six 36 months time off with year long wages when economies are completely developed under peoples business authority policy with revolutionary employment policy as is described next interbusiness competition created more jobs and business outlets than is needed in cooperative unified economies when national ownership comes into effect and economies are as one interbusiness competition will be sectioned out streamlining economies with greater profits from less business overheads all economies are also underdeveloped to different degrees which can be further streamlined with mechanization these policies streamlining economies to the extreme will make an estimated twentyfive to fifty percent 2550 less jobs available with business commerce and service maintained and in what is termed the total workforce applied upon lesser employment capacity policy with an estimated one hundred and thirtythree to two hundred percent 133200 more workers than employment positions workforces will share lesser number of employment positions creating three to six 36 months time off for workers workers covering for each other when taking time off the more workers per employment sector the more time off for each worker every year under this employment policy also full employment is ensured indefinitely matter how many employment positions there are and poverty and unemployment will be eliminated forever economies will resilient to recessions dependant on the massive total profits of economies which is assured even in negative economic climates and not on the number of employment positions an economy can create which is not as sure in negative economic climates also with three to six 36 months time off for every worker the worker has the option of using this time off to work two jobs year if available increasing hisher salaries by twentyfive to fifty percent 2550 anticompetitive business cooperation pooling profits business secrets and procedures for higher standards of living government economy ownership with the economy acting as one will cut out lower standard produce and provide the highest standard goods at affordable prices supplemented from the combined nationalglobal economies profits the standard of goods and services will also be heightened when all business secrets and procedures are pooled to be used by every business in cooperative unified economy the food industry for example when pooling together business secrets will provide the best foods from the recipes of the combined menus of all the worlds food industries cutting out lower standard food products from public consumption this effect will apply to every business highering the quality of every life material prosperity cheaply made goods that break and underdeveloped goods that become outdated prevent the build up of material prosperity for the population with system directed for the replacement of material goods over time for profits this occurs to keep businesses afloat and maintain jobs this policy criminal yet understandable when maintaining businesses and jobs in the new peoples business authority economy with full employment ensured always the need for creating below standard goods to maintain jobs and services is removed so all goods will be produced of the highest standard promoting the material prosperity of all people maximization of business and government services upgrading housing the world over providing more freely available services and idea of having internet like television servers peoples business authority policy will be to saturate business service potential with outlets serving every area also maximization of government services that operate at optimum levels will be delivered free education will be provided university level education allowances will be provided topgrade health services with zero waiting lists will be provided and re housing schemes for all living in substandard accommodation will be provided the building industry will serve the people and high standards first not profit first at the cost of standards as has occurred ninety nine per cent 99 of the substandard housing that costcutting disassociated economies built over the last century will be rebuilt and upgraded the world over to provide housing of the highest standard this affordable and doable by unified peoples business authority economies and will be long term policy put into action this ensures and increases jobs within the building trade long term and will make housing more suited to the better lives within the new economic environment that the peoples business authority will create and many services such as satellite television can be provided for free where previously kept for minority and prices of essential better and healthier foods can be reduced and many other life changing service industries can be supplemented as desired this all will be delivered with the extra backing of the massive profits generated by government owned economies also it may be possible to have big television servers like internet servers for every home where one can pick what you want to view from massive database of television shows movies music videos and documentaries this would add to the joy of every life and is probably possible providing full complements of community amenities to every local area most local communities in the first 1st world and in the developing world lack many amenities that should be provided to every community all local communities having complete complement of amenities will be policy attainable and affordable with the peoples business authority theatresmusic auditoriums will deliver plays musicals classical music and modern music performed by local talents and traveling entertainers music art and film tuition will be financed and provided social events can be staged and facilitated and also popular sports amenities will be provided the expression arts and sports should be enjoyed by all peoples and will be available to be enjoyed by every community in peoples business authority world stronger economies and future economic projections comparing peoples business authority economies with traditional economies peoples business authority economies will be stronger because they will be more profitable streamlined full employment will be ensured always desired businesses and services will be protected from closure by the combined nationalglobal economies profits and business commitments such as past employee pensions will survive business closure in unified economy the current unprotected economy fails communities and employees with mass job losses and lost pensions occurring even in the developed world nations are certain to meet economic recessions in the future as has happened repetitively in history with traditional economy todays illegal economies weak divided and vulnerable in unfavourable economic climates the perfect and stronger peoples business authority economies envisioned will better withstand economic crisiss with economies dependant on the massive total profits of economies which is assured even in negative economic climates and not on the number of employment positions an economy can create as of traditional economies this not as sure in negative economic climates with traditional economy without change to the peoples business authority economies will falter medium term due to natural resource depletion and material possession buildup the masses suffering job loss and impoverishment probable though the recent invention of air powered cars and engines may save humanity from being dependant on depleting stocks of oil these engines may also be used for home heating and electricity production even in todays positive economic climate change to the peoples business authority will greatly improve the nations and lives of those who dwell within people representing government owned economy is stronger economy ensuring the economic future of nation more so than traditional economy and must be converted to improving employment and developing economies to first world standard if the population of the planet is six billion 6000000000 the labour force is estimated to be less than three billion 3000000000 excluding women the retired and children out of this labour force 137 billion 1370000000 are termed the working poor living on less than two us dollars 2 day it is hoped that by developing first 1st world economies to new first 1st world standard and developing other economies to meet this standard using the increased potential of peoples business authority unified economies large proportion of the working poor will be redirected to better employments their working conditions will be improved and their wages can be increased to level that is fair government dictation of education placements and employments to meet the needs of society under this new system of full employment upon lesser number of work positions the government will dictate employments and education places to meet the needs of society exact this creating perfect economies and replacing criminal careers amongst the unemployed also there will be worker shortages in any sector with government employment direction and there will be educated that are out of work in the sector that their education is directed to the number of education places will equal the number of employments required in each employment sector the education system directly linked to the job system with students competing in examinations for available educationemployment positions the new government owned economy will also restructure employments deciding and re aligning present workers positions to meet the needs of society exact providing training to the repositioned workers for their new roles and an option to be considered if wanted by the public is higherlower work positions can be shared and rotated daily weekly or monthly between workers with the same qualifications but previously had betterworser jobs this is envisioned for simple jobs and not possible for highly skilled complex jobs this policy implemented will make fairer employment system accommodating immigrants there will be an everpresent ability to accommodate more workers with the implementation of the total workforce applied upon lesser employment capacity policy employment positions for those immigrating from the developing world can be made available easily at relatively little cost to the nations and this improving the life of the native with increased holidays also illegal immigrants will be legalized in peoples business authority nations legalisation making stronger nations with former illegal immigrants able to work for government institutions adding to the strength of the nations military police public guards and health services freedom to live travel and work in different nations will be heightened under the new peoples business authority system and if another developed nation has lower percentage of workers compared to employment positions the immigrant will be directed to work in that nation the immigrant asylum seeker refugee did flee their home due to war political persecution wrongful imprisonment unemployment or impoverishment to not accommodate immigrantsasylum seekersrefugees when it is within nations means is crime against our fellow human the peoples business authority in government will always accommodate everyone including immigrants accommodating the previous owners of businesses and wage ladders to remain the previous owners of the newly owned government businesses will be given the highest new jobs made available when applying total workforces upon lesser employment capacity the previous owners who will lose their top jobs with national conversion to the peoples business authority will have their jobs replaced with top jobs in the new system created business management being the most probable position offered to previous owners wages ladders remaining more important and more trained for positions earning higher wages progression to one world government with global business authority and global defence organisation one world government never seemed attractive or useful without economic ownership and control without this government has been too weak to tackle global issues the present illegal disassociated economycapitalist system unaware and unable to properly respond to humanitarian crisiss caring global peoples business authority government with full usage ownership and control of the global economy and its finances can solve and tackle all the worlds problems peoples business authority nations will rise alone at first but as the world approaches full global conversion one world government will be set up this one world government with global business authority and global defence organisation will both be setup in the interests of global prosperity and global security global business authority would control and configure for success the worlds total businesses and resources sectors developing all economies to new first world standard with zero neglect global defence organisation would also be created with control of every army to ensure the security of every nation and ensure trust and cooperation between the nations armies common world language being selected for all armies to learn making armies of every nationality able to communicate and work together with unified global military the nations safety is assured and the nations massive military spending on security can be redirected to public protection and service international government on defence and financial organisation levels while national government maintained as an administrative body and as service provider both active on diplomatic levels funding every charitable cause to completion curing curable blindness providing greater funding for the health sciences and eradicating and treating disease according to the sightsavers charity the blindness of twentyeight million 28000000 of the worlds thirtyseven million 37000000 blind people is curable if the money is provided to treat them the charity sightsavers restored the sight of over two hundred thousand 200000 people last year but clearly curing all the curable blind is out of sightsavers reach this effect is similar for most charitable causes charities unable to completely provide for or treat all the poor and sick this is the same with the millennium project which is also unable to tackle global poverty global peoples business authority community will have the greater funds to fulfill every charitable cause to completion to greater fund the health sciences and put in place every measure to eradicate and treat disease ending low level heavy labour upon children peoples business authority funding will eliminate child labouring in the nations statistics estimate there are over one hundred and thirty two million 132000000 children between the ages of five to fourteen 514 working the lowest employments in the world seventy per cent 70 of them in the agriculture sector the work that they do is in hazardous conditions is detrimental to their health and hinders their education and future careers they must be offered better life and can with the finances and care of peoples business authority world governments restructuring economies and developing them to new first 1st world standard creating economies everywhere which are completely free from child labouring and its ill effects upon childrens lifestyles health educations and futures slavery eradication in recent history slavery has emerged into third world and second world nations in the tens of millions 10000000s the two systems of slavery involved are called caste system slavery and debt bonded slavery caste system slavery occurs where families have been determined by radical religions or society to be part of slave class and spend their lifetimes as slaves debt bonded slavery occurs where people have taken loan for as little as the cost of medicine for sick child but are unable to repay the loan and so are claimed to be owned by employers available to be bought and sold for profit and are forced to work long hours 365 days year for lifetime these cases of forced slavery are most prominent in west africa latin america and asia peoples business authority government will succeed in abolishing this evil industry and liberate the worlds slave populations by enforcing antislavery laws and by developing all economies to new first 1st world standard creating economies which are without forced slavery ensuring and protecting food supply for nutrition immunity strength and mental and physical health global system of peoples business authoritys will take control protect monitor and distribute the worlds food supplies distributing food so all peoples have enough foods protected and the future of food supply safeguarded in the recent past millions have died each year as direct result of hunger and malnutrition these died from starvation or number of treatable infectious diseases their bodies and immune systems weakened by hunger and malnutrition these sorts of deaths are horrendous in nature and number and must not take place installing one world government under peoples business authority policy would oversee and protect global food supply world hunger malnutrition tiredness and mental and physical unhealthiness will end with peoples business authority finances and organisation securing and improving global food supply providing all peoples with appropriate strength health and immunity from healthy varied diets with complete economic control the natural disasters that occur due to global warming and other causes can be responded to with greater maximum resource and more can be done to fight global warming and preserve the environment with complete economic control under government ownership of economies the natural disasters that occur due to global warming and other causes can be responded to with greater maximum resource rising sea levels droughts forest fires floods the spread of tropical diseases and hurricanes and typhoons as well as earthquakes have ruined many lands and lives already every nation on this earth needs heavy funding to respond to and prepare for these natural disasters to avoid tragedy peoples business authority nations have the greater funds to achieve this also with complete economic control the nations and one world government can do more to fight global warming and protect the environment being able to lessen pollution and preserve and plant forests allowing trade unions and correcting unfair trading practice in second and third world countries trade unions are banned in some cases in second and third world countries they will be encouraged and allowed under peoples business authority global leadership many unjust companies also only allow nations raw materials exports only and dont let them manufacture and develop the raw materials to gain from the most profitable parts of their business sectors this will change when these companies are owned under the jurisdiction of peoples business authority one world government and the developing worlds nations will be allowed fair trading to gain the profits and wages they are entitled to unlocking nature formation science for immortality cures and food petroleum and raw material production alternative theories on nature formation science and disease origination are offered and genetic engineering is encouraged to modernize our immune systems to protect us from every sickness the peoples business authority calls on the worlds scientific community to learn how plants and animals make certain materials so we can produce food petroleum and raw materials directly external from living bodies also we have the potential with complete knowledge of nature formation science to live on indefinitely and to cure every sickness an alternative theory on how nature formation science works is that formative cells for every species of life may be instructed by radio signals constructed for the start of life on earth millions of years ago the diversity complexity and majesty of life on earth could not have been made randomly from beginner cells with evolution life was developed definitely by an intelligence and instructive radio signals upon dna is possible way this could have occurred there are new dna sequences which appear as bodies form and grow which points to the instructive radio signal theory for explaining the formation and development of all life with alternating dna sequencing more possible evidence of this theory is from heart attacks they may be caused from radio signal instructed dna receptor cells receiving instructive signals upon human hearts intended for other species who have faster and stronger hearts the human heart unable to cope with these instructions and failing causing heart attacks and death diseases cancers and every other sickness may also originate from accidental signal crossover creating bad dna sequences or these occur randomly we can learn to read how every cell is instructed by testing what every type of cell forms or produces when grown and then with complete knowledge of how every cell works we can control every organ in the human body with cell emplacement replacing diseased or weakened cells in organs maintaining health forever another theory on disease origination is that diseases cancers and sicknesses may have occurred due to random development of destructive cell processes that occur in the body such as first set of teeth loss or digestion process cells also genetic engineering to modernize our immune systems is encouraged and needed to protect and control our health from modern sicknesses the creators of life on earth did ancient genetic engineering to form and provide for life at the start of life on earth but their work hasnt been developed or updated with changes to our environment as new threats to human life appeared we need to update the creators of lifes genetic engineering work with modern genetic engineering work to sustain our lives we should create new types of immune cells using genetic engineering based on the format of the ancient and still in use immunity cells with correct engineering of immune cells we can defend our bodies from diseases and cancers that appeared after the creation of life after the creation and development work of our still in use immune systems ended modern day illnesses and diseases werent configured for when our immune systems were created in ancient times we must further on the work that the creators of life did do to further defend our health from cellular threats we have the potential as well with this immunity science to live forever on earth its up to humanity to defend itself and this is done with genetic engineering to defend the body money out of circulation to be given to charity money in bank accounts put out of use by the death of the account holders and out of reach of their families indefinitely unused by society should not be allowed go to waste and should enter circulation in the form of charity to life saving organizations such as unicef when all business money is under peoples business authority control this money out of circulation will need to be addressed giving it to charity is the right thing to do massive public defence forces to eliminate and prevent crime with the finance of business and natural resource industry ownership massive international public defence forces can be created and deployed throughout every nation securing public safety and ensuring global security financed protection force to compliment the forces of law and add strength to the military power of the nations will be created ninety per cent 90 of global armies will be converted into public defence forces these forces will be massive forces as large as is needed for public defence in national cities coasts and countrysides two technologies will be used in conjunction with sniffer dogs to up the awareness of public defences security scanners monitoring goods traveling between areas and cctv systems monitoring behavior within areas these forces securing and sectioning areas with checkpoints using security scanners and sniffer dogs monitoring what goods move through internal area divisions within nation and through nations borders preventing dangerous goods and dangerous people moving into or inside nation complete lockdown on illegal movements effectively ending crime and harm public defence forces will also search any area within nation if under suspicion to eliminate the threat from guns bombs and dangerous weapons seizing them and other illicit materials and they will find and save any falsely imprisoned people within nation public defence forces will also perform peace keeping function preventing war useful policing training and military training will be gained by the public defence forces so they can handle themselves against any force global guard setup for the strength of the nations protecting the nations from military terrorist and criminal threats all potentially harmful goods and chemicals produced on this planet will also be put under guard and those who order them will be tested and examined and the food industry will be protected and secured the present forces of law are globally under funded in number and cant halt the continuous wave of crime upon the nations peoples business authority funding into public defence forces with their possible massive number will halt crime completely when complimenting the police the public completely safe and prisons emptying over time with crime made impossible giving unrestricted powers in creating system to identify the legality of all monies preventing and recouping corruption and seizing illegal monies from criminal industry corruption has undermined the strength and service of many nations throughout history this has lessened in modern times but is still prevalent the peoples business authority will employ the preventative systems on corruption that current economies employ and will put in place system that certifies the legality of all money with all other monies placed under suspicion and investigated complete knowledge of all monies by the law will protect the society from crime and improve government efficiency and service the monies the result of past corruption being recouped and future corruption prevented and also the criminal money from the drugs industries the sex industries the criminal arms trade the humantrafficking industries and the slave industries can be identified with the system of certifying all monies and seized putting these evil industries out of commission the peoples business authority will employ an army of investigators to do this these monitoring and identifying the nature of all monies and seizing illegal monies so monies that fund the continuation of criminal industry will run dry ending criminal industry and protecting would be victims from criminal industry womens and childrens protection and independence government owned economies can afford to give help to suffering women and children in the form of free housing and living allowances making it so they can escape and be independent from households where there is violence raping or psychologically condescending behavior many individuals within family are trapped into domestic situations without the finances and qualifications to live independently if familylife becomes unlivable we need to provide for these and offer them services to allow them and their families escape traumatic situations this can be done by offering living expenses and housing to new areas with protection in the form of twenty four hour 24hr public defence guards and escorts afforded with peoples business authority finances the people who undermined the sanctity of the pastvictims will never have access to the pastvictims again if that is the wishes of the past victims and the pastvictims life will be livable once again abortion abolition and providing for unwanted children and orphans abortion of developed humans beyond cellular existence is to be made obsolete and illegal people talk of the womans rights and freedoms and people talk of the infant childs rights and future freedoms we need to compare these rights and decide on the right to live for both against the right to live for one the death of infant children is evil and harmful to the family and will cease with government services providing and caring for unwanted children it is wrong for the infant child to be murdered in hisher halfsleep and even if the child is the product of rape the child must live on the family suffering less with the child living on abortion will be made illegal globally and services will be provided for unwanted childrens welfare when the parent doesnt feel able to better care for the child or doesnt want to the nation will provide services for these orphan children such as mansionesque housing schooling and living expenses with carers until the child reaches maturity and becomes selfsufficient the forces of law to be correctional integrating the criminal instilling dignity within the prisoner and execution to be abolished the law courts destroy the lives of not only the criminal but also the criminals family sometimes beyond repair when they jail and fine the criminal peoples business authority policy will be governed to correct and nurture the life not destroy the life of the criminal and hisher family the justice system is right to punish the criminal this shows the wrongness of crime and makes crime negative risky gamble below the spirit of life for the would be criminal deterring crime the justice system also protects the people from criminal acts upon them but the justice system should do more to change the criminal and to instill dignity within the criminal with change and dignity upon the criminal safer society is made dignity is the enemy of every criminal act and should be promoted with work and rights to family and friends rights to visitation from friends and family are already available in most prisons but once year all criminals should be

authority policy prisons around the world will add manufacturing factories to them and not only be places of confinement with manufacturing factories within prisons prisons have the capability of paying for their keep and not be massive cost negatively to the nations it is criminal in its effects the policy of solitary confinement with work prisoners waste away and are unable to cope with and

violent conflicts throughout the ages the peoples business authority proposes lasting resolution to these disputes called democratic tribal sovereignty democratic tribal sovereignty involves nations people voting for what country they would like to belong these votes deciding which state the voter should pay taxes to and consequently the state provides services such as policing defence health services schooling electricity water transport and telecom to their newly declared citizens where there is mix of sovereignty declared in an area the declared for states involved will share expenses to provide the areas people with services according to percentage of the population that belongs to each state not only will democratic tribal sovereignty give happiness to those populations looking to realign their sovereignty it will also end the reasoning and tribal grasps for power that causes the occurrence of war terrorism famine and genocide from the time of declared sovereignties onwards with many marginalized tribal populations uncared for endangered and mistreated when they are minority in nation and with war terrorism famine and genocide threat upon public lives the peoples business authority calls for democratic tribal sovereignty to be enforced immediately under world law with political movement and if that fails through the strength of military showing the socalled modern muslim holy warjihad to be unholy and blasphemous the original muslin holy warjihad was conquest to spread their religion their perceived word and teachings from god killing people was not the message of the jihad promotion of religion of god was the revered god of the quran did not allow war on the christians or the jews who worshiped and still worship the same god as that of islam the holy warjihad that god ordered was war on the godless religion of the idols long after mohammed long after the revelations of the quran did muslims fight war against the christians of spain this war was against christian followers of the same god as that of islam and was not truly war for god it was not holy warjihad it was not ordered by god the original muslim holy warjihad was ordered by god it was war perceived wrongly to be for god and was called holy warjihad as many muslim conflicts have been since those who say that this war or that war is for god does not know if god approves of their war or if their war is pro god they are colouring humanities view of god with their beliefs of allegiance to god above others they have place to deliver testimony of gods will and are delivering blasphemy when declaring holy warjihad the modern muslim insurgency and terrorism is an example of this the insurgents and terrorists say they are fighting for god and that god favours their war they have place to say this these claims are false and are blasphemy also god has not shown he supports the insurgency and terrorism and yet the insurgentsterrorists claim god is on their side and is terrorist this blasphemy is an insult to our god and his name we cannot allow any longer the use of gods name as support for their violent cause we must protest and publicise against this terroristinsurgent blasphemy god and mohammed did not fight war against christians or jews these being followers of the same god of the revelations of the quran nonreligious even have sense and reverence for the god of jew christian and muslim and their followers in this modern enlightened age with the modern ability to easily learn languages and influence the media converting others to god with word and delivering his universal teachings is the true path of the follower of the enlightening and proud god of jew christian and muslim he the raiser of the humanitarian spirit of all this the strongest teaching from religion of god and is antiterrorist what can be done with this enlightenment religiously on the subject of terrorism and war is turn the terrorists against violence and use the exterrorists knowledge to fight terrorism and to speak out against terrorism publicising and televising their view as propaganda to prevent terrorist belief and related atrocities the delusion of different human races the concept of different races of humanity is false colour of skin is caused by people being exposed to the rays of the sun giving tanning effect entered into genetic coding over generations they lived in different intensities of sun exposure creating heavily tanned semitanned and nontanned skin colour and also different regional looks are caused by different food diets molding general appearance over the generations this analysis shows that racial distinctions are more than references to regional genetic evolutionary coding affecting skin shading and appearance of the body humanity has different species but regional appearance differences of the one species all should be seen to share the unifying bonds of human nature and be seen as equal racist attitudes and actions must not be entertained or believed in world peace saving forced child soldiers adult soldiers and public lives it is estimated that there are three hundred thousand 300000 children employed
