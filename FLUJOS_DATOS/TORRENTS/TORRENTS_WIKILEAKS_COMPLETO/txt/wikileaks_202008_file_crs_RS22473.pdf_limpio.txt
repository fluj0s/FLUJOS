the army more eﬃcient in combat operations the change to modular force and the reallocation of functions between active and reserve forces also meet some of the criteria that have long been argued as necessary to enable the army to better perform peacekeeping and related postconﬂict operations now generally referred to as stabilization or stability operations over the years number of diﬀerent proposals have been advanced some of which involve creating specialized forces that are dedicated at least part time to preparing for and deploying to such missions the army has long rejected proposals for dedicated peacekeeping forces as they would divert funds from combat resources and undermine the concept of general purpose fullspectrum force alternate proposals for augmenting personnel for such missions involve nonmilitary optionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs224731 peacekeeping is generic term that commonly encompasses range of activities undertaken in postconflict operations it originally was term that meant providing interpositional force to supervise the keeping of ceasefire or peace accord that parties in conflict had signed but it continued to be used as the range of activities grew recently such operations have been referred to by an army doctrinal term stability operations that also encompasses the diverse missions of operations in afghanistan and ira q stability operations include not only the peace operations ie peacekeeping and peace enfor cement but also related missions such as humanitarian and civic assistance counterterrori sm counterdrug and counterinsurgency ie foreign internal defense efforts stability ope rations are sometimes referred to phase iv or postconflict operations although reoccurrences of conflict are often possible another term is stabilization and reconstruction operations congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs22473 july 10 2006

combat resour ces and undermine the concept of general purpose fullspectrum force alternat proposals for augmenting personnel for such missions involve nonmilitary options in november 2005 the department of defe nse stated for the first time that the category of operations that has variously been referred to as stability operations stabilization and reconstruction sr operati ons and peacekeeping operations is core mission of the united states military1 this declaration contained in dod directive 300005 signals that the united states military s hould develop appropria doctrine

techniques and procedures for peace operations joint publication 3073 february 12 1999 3 the army is the most affected by peacekeeping and related stability operations of the four us services the marines have also borne considerab part of the burden as their strength is the ability to deploy rapidly to conflicts they do not however have the size or structure for extended operations the air force and navy usually participate to much lesser extent and over the past decade have made some changes to accommodate these missions its troops and structure and equip its forces to perform such operations since the early 1990s when such missions became staple of its operations the us military has developed considerab body of doctrine2 on such operations and has increasingly included related training in its regular training programs neverthele ss to many analysts the military particularly the army3 has considerable distance to go before it is adequately prepared for stability operations some believe that force structure reform is an area that particularly needs to be addressed although the army is restructuring its force in ways that are conducive to stabilization operations proposals to reconfig ure the army in order to dedicate forces specifically to such operations have been consistently rejecte d this report provides context for understanding the force struct ure of the us army the changes that commenced in 2003 as they relate to stability operations and major proposals for further reform this report will not be updated traditional army force stru cture and recent changes until mid 2003 the ar my continued to organize its forces around warfighting divisions of 9000 17000 troops as it had since world war ii in the 1990s however the number of active duty army divisions wa s cut from 18 to 10 as the number of active army troops was decreased by 60000 divisi ons were divided into three brigades of combat forces with separate perman ent support units support personnel include combat support such as construction engin eers military police signal corpsmen and military intelligence as well as combat serv ice support such as supply maintenance transportation and medical pe rsonnel most support forces were positioned above the division level in the armys four corps or elsewhere in the active and reserve forces and were assigned to deploying units as needed for the most part proposals for reform in the 1990s and early 2000s centered on an increase in the number of personnel in lowd ensity highdemand units ie those most heavily taxed by peacekeeping and related st ability operations these units have been concentrated until now in the reserve co mponent for severa l years many military analysts suggested that the overall force might be restructured to include more of the specialities needed for peacekeeping which so also regard as in short supply for warfighting or war termination periods and in units sized for peace operations civil affairs psychological operations psyo ps and military police units were frequently mentioned as specialties that were particularly needed in peacekeeping and

xiioperations but were in short supply in the active military as the army performed increasing numbers of these missions analysts noticed that such operations were built around one or two maneuver brig ades ie armor or infantry units of 2000 to 3000 troops with command and support elements drawn from divisional hq and elsewhere in the army as result some analysts recommended the development of maneuver brigades that are prepared for rapi d deployment and autonomous operations4 army active duty and reserve component restructuring in mid2003 the army began restructuring the armys active component into modular force5 and rebalancingpositions between the army activ and reserve forces officials have said these changes will involve some 100000 positi ons by fy2011 the primary reason given for these changes is to improve the armys warfighting capacity nevertheless they are also viewed as enhancing the armys ability to carry out broad fullspectrum range of missions including peacekeeping and st ability operations as well as homeland defense with less stress on the active and reserve forces 2005 congressional budget office study notes reservations as to whet her the modular force would actually reduce stress by substantially enhancing deployment times however6 one goal of rebalancing is to reduce reliance on the reserve compone nt during the first 15 days of rapid response operation and to limit reserve mobilization especia lly for high demand units to once every six years three changes ve particular implica tions for sr missions 1 the internal restructuring of divisions to make the army more mobile ie rapidly deployable or expeditionary and versatile the army is reconfiguring its ten divisions in order to make the brigade instead of th division or corps the armys primary unit of organization the reconfigurati on incorporates into combat br igades many or all of the support services necessary to make the brig ade more selfsufficient on the battlefield the newly configured brigades are referred to as brigade combat teams some divisions may maintain additi onal support personnel in separate brigades to be used for stabilization tasks in immediate postconflict situations 2 the increase in the active army of low densityhigh mand support personnel in order to support this restructuring and to reduce reliance on and use of the reserve component as discussed in th section on reserves above this increase involves the relocation of such positions from the reserves to the active force as well as reshuffling of positions within the active force for instance at the start of the restructuring only one of the armys 25 civil affairs ca battalions was in the active force while the others were in the army reserve combat batta lions range in size from 600 to 900 troops while civil affairs units average 150200 memb ers some ca battalions are now being moved to the active force although the prima ry capability will still reside in the army reserve other specialities being increased in the active forces that are especially relevant to peacekeeping and related operations are milita ry police special ope rations forces and certain engineer and transportation capabilities the army is attempting to increase thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22473crs4 7 an unclassified version was released in december 2004 defense science board 2004 summer study on transition to and from hostilities office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics washingt on dc quotes in this paragraph from pp 4547 access through the defense science bo ard website h ttp wwwacqosdm ildsb the board was tasked in august 2005 with furt her study on the organizational changes needed within dod to conduct s upport and manage stability operations this has not been completedpersonnel without increasing force size by converting certain combat positions such as heavy artillery and other lower demand sp eciality positions into support positions 3 plans also call for the creation of few thousand new reserve positions including positions needed for peacekeeping and rela ted operations especially military police the effect of these changes on the armys ability to perform functions from combat to peacekeeping and related operations is ope n to debate while some criticize the reforms as shortterm measures primarily geared to deal with the demands of several more years in iraq rather than with the combat realities of future battlefields others view them as insufficient if the army is to possess the types of forces necessary to carry out peacekeeping and related stability operations effectively proposals for enhancing army capacity for sr operations the following proposals that have been ma over the past several years range from relatively simple refine ments to significant restructuring they all involve the dedication of at least small number of forces primarily to sr even if only for temporary period they are listed in rough order of magnitude of the degree to which forces would be dedicated to peacekeeping from less to more extensive critics object that the more extensive changes create unnecessary dupli cation and involve costly tradeoffs defense science board study the defense science board 2004 summer study which recommended that stabilization be treated as an explicit mission in dod force planning provided the justifi cation for dod directive 300005 and provides guidance for continuing changes the st udy recommends that sr operations should be given more weight in planning and programming the future force 7 evaluating army force structure changes the board judged the army to be moving in the right directionby instituting modularity restruct uring the force to increase military police civil affairs psychological operations and other capabilities needed for sr operations and rebalancing capabilitie s between the active and reserv components it judged that sr operations will further be nefit if the army can defi ne modules of sr capabilities well below the brigade level and recommended the army experiment with innovative concepts of task organization and soluti ons at the battalion and brigade level us army war college study 2005 report prepared by col brian g watson while student at the armys pr emier command school states that current modular force plans are design ed for rapid decisive opera tions and lack necessary post combat stabilization capacity the study proposes that this perceived gap be filled in two ways 1 increasing the forces stabilization capabilities by making greater number of support services available to the brigades as needed and 2 creating unique command brigade that can serve as warfighting h eadquarters but would also be capable ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22473crs5 8 us army war college strategic studies institute reshaping the expeditionary army to win decisively the case for greater stab ilization capacity

from conflict it also urges policymakers to rec onsider the division of labor between the active and reserve components involved in the current rebalancing8 and recommends increasing stabilization capability in both components heritage founda tion report 2004 heritage f oundation report recommends that the united states not only reorganize and retrain existing combat forces to better equip them to perform occupational tasks nd assist other nations in improving post conflict capabilities but also build organizations and s upporting programs within the armed forces specifically designed to conduct post conflict duties9 national defense university proposal in 2004 the national defense university ndu proposed an extensive redesign of the us governments structures for planning organizing and carrying out sr operations10 major focus is the greater integration of civilian and military capabilities on the military side this would require the creation of two new joint ie with members from two or more services sr commands one command would have two pe rmanent headquarters hq units located in the activeduty force the other would be located in the reserves but with an active duty hq unit battalionsized units would be assigned on rotating basis to the commands and would be prepared for immedi ate deployment the study also proposed consolidating specialized hi gh demand personnel and transf erring some from reserve to active duty status specifically mentioned were military police civil affairs construction engineering medical and psycholog ical operations psyops personnel tradeoffs inherent in dedicating forces the us military has long resisted the concept of sizable dedicated peacekeeping units fearing that they might divert resources from the rest of the force and arguing that they would become substandard as good sold iers would not choose to make career of secondary missions nevertheless the idea of creating dedicated forces within the us military continues to be advanced by some analysts who judge that peacekeeping and related stabilization missions will be feature of future us security policy and that the creation of dedicated units would enhan ce the united states ability to successfully conduct such missions by developing pe rsonnel experienced in such operations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22473crs6 11 both cbo studies making peace while staying ready for war the challenges of us military participation in peace operations december 1999 and options for restructuring the army may 2005 look at dedicated peacekeeping units as part of larger studies evaluating advantages and disadvantages of range of proposals to address military ma npower and rapid deployment issues accessible through http wwwcbogov the 1999 study examined four hypothetical options for restructuring us forc to perform peace operations with less stress three of which involved dedicated brigades the may 2005 study examined hypothetical proposal to convert two army divisions into fi ve sr divisions four active and one reserve the cbo judged that this latter option might provide qualitative advantage as the mix of soldiers in each sr division to include military police engineers medical civil affairs and psychological operations units might be superior to the armys current combat forces for peacekeeping it also judged that the army would be less capable of fighting multiple wars simultaneously because it would have six fewer combat brigades p 33 12 see crs report rl32862 peacekeeping and flict trans itions background and congressional action on civilian capabil ities by nina m serafino and martin weiss for the current status of such optionstwo congressional budget office cbo studies which examined proposals for dedicated peacekeeping units found significan t tradeoffs involved in creating such units11 although the cbo examined such proposals largely in the context of the armys divisional force structure the findings on tradeoffs still appear applicable in general the cbo found that there might well be qua litative advantages in providing greater capabilities with the needed specialties for stabilization operations while disadvantages varied in general those proposals to dedica forces to peacekeeping that involved change in the size of the force would decrease warfighting ability while those that involved an increase in the number of troops w ould be more costly the earlier of the two reports issued in 1999 also examined an option to increase the armys readiness for peace operations that did not involve dedicated forces i increasing the number of support personnel essential to peacekeeping operations by conver ting an activeduty division into support units cbo judged that this option would also enhance the armys ability to conduct conventional war and calculated that while it would be costly to implement it would save m oney over the long run nonmilitary options the defense science boards 2004 summer st udy above views the effectiveness of changes within the military as depende nt upon related sr reforms elsewhere in government if members of congress believe additional capabilities are needed for such operations and do not wish to incur the co mbat effectiveness and monetary costs associated with creating additional military capabilities for peacekeeping they may wish to examine nonmilitary personnel options12 many analysts caution however that military personnel would still be needed for th early phases of st abilization operations in general civilian personne l cannot replace military troops in situations where combat is still in progress elsewhere in theater of operations and where the potential for renewed conflict is high nevertheless constabulary police civilian police with military skills and organization may be one civilian element highly useful in those early phases
