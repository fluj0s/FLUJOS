report recommended that in the absence of an immediate ar med threat within liberia an adjustment to the unmil military component by reducing one infantry battalion in mid2006 and another infantry battalion in early 2007 would be appropriate these adjustments would be followed by drawdown of the mission which should begin in early 2007 security conditions permitting in midmarch 2007 the united nations reported significant progress in meeting key benchmarks including the police and military training restructuring and reform management of natural resources and the creation of national security strategy and architecture though each of these activities has faced sometimes considerable challenges progress toward the reintegration of all excombatants and the consolidation of state authority has been slower however in large part due to resource constraints due to these and range of other reconstruction and development challenges and notwithstanding areas of progress in midmarch 2007 citing what he called limited progress made in meeting the benchmarks for the consolidation and drawdown of the mission secretarygeneral ban kimoon recommended yearlong extension of the unmils mandate in august 2007 secretarygeneral ban kimoon recommended that drawdown process linked to attainment of several core benchmarks be initiated these benchmarks focus on multifocal improvements in police operational capacity completion of national security strategy and architecture and implementation thereof nationwide by december 2008 training and operationalization of two newly trained military battalions by september 2008 and september 2009 respectively and the restoration of the rule of law and achievement of increased operational capacity by government agencies throughout liberia

disappointing performance by the transitional government the public remains eager to see rapid job growth and rapid improvements in social services and the construction of physical infrastructure particularly in support of education healthcare and transportation in recent public comments sirleaf has assured liberians that her government is successfully continuing to build the groundwork for

generate jobs and incomes several road building projects are currently underway and the government is examining options for largescale electricity generation and longdistance power transmission

legal system that is substantially modeled on that of the united states though not entirely for instance federalism is absent liberias government is made up of three branches that exercise separate powers and authorities bicameral legislature which consists of 64member house and 30member senate presidentially led executive branch that controls multiple line ministries and several independent agencies and judiciary legislators are directly elected by voters in each of liberias 15 counties while the president is directly elected by universal suffrage the president and house members are each elected to sixyear terms and senators serve nineyear terms except in cases of irregular vacancies of elected positions presidents may serve up to two terms although the sirleaf governments mandate is derived from the constitution that of the ntgl was extraconstituti onal during its tenure those provisions of the constitution and laws of liberia that were inconsistent with the provisions of the 2003 comprehensive peace agreement were suspended though all other provisions of the constitution remained in force although liberias constitution provides for system of checks and balances among the three branches of government in practice the executive branch has historically exerted extensive influence over the legislature the judiciary and local governments historically liberian presidents have wielded exceptional sometimes extraconstitutional powers and closely controlled the legal system the security forces and the economy as well as headed majority ruling parties liberia has also long suffered from the effects of public sector corruption and tradition of political patronage this often resulted in uneven urbancentered socioeconomic development and often deprived large segments of the population notably the rural indigenous majority of access to public goods and services given this history president sirleaf could have attempted to aggregate predominant power in her office but doing so would have run counter to her emphasis on building national unity constitutional and institutionally robust governance fighting corruption and institutionally developing the state her emphasis on developing state institutions and processes rather than exerting presidential command authority may mean that she is both less likely and less able to rule in the largely unilateral manner of her predecessors however she also came to power with weaker electoral mandate than those of past presidents neither sirleafs unity party nor any other party commands legislative majority similarly candidate was able to command majority support in the initial 22candidate presidential first round presidential vote the relative strength of opposition parties in the parliament initially led some observers to hypothesize that liberias legislators might bridge their party differences and cooperate in furtherance of their collective institutional power visavis the executive branch and take on more engaged and assertive role in policymaking than has been traditional to date however president sirleaf has often been able to dominate the national policy agenda this is attributable in part to limited capacity within the legislature the limited legislative experience of many current legislators the fractionalized party makeup of the legislature and to the governing experience of sirleaf and many in her cabinet most bills continue to be originated by the executive branch and passed with presidential priorities intact notable exception to this pattern was the legislatures september 2007 rejection of the asset seizures bill targeting former president taylor and his associates

the mixed governance record of its predecessor the ntgl the ntgl was able to successfully carry out most of the basic functions assigned to it under the august 2003 peace accord but its efforts to restore state authority and the rehabilitate state institutions were hampered by central government ministry inefficiencies widespread resource constraints and lack of institutional and financial system capacities and trained manpower despite such challenges it did make significant progress during the last half of its tenure during this time many revenue customs immigration and local officials were deployed to sites outside monrovia regional central bank offices were also opened permitting salary payments without recourse to timeconsuming travel to monrovia the process of deploying government officials upcountry was supported by usaid which has supported the rehabilitation of administrative buildings in several key counties among the most challenging issues facing governance capacitybuilding efforts were persistent reports of corruption within the ntgl in some cases on large scale alleged acts were particularly notable in the context of importexport transactions government contracts and budgeting and the issuance of commodity marketing or land natural resource and associated concession rights 49 the secretarygeneral reported in midmarch 2005 that there was lack of ntgl transparency in the collection and use of revenues and the resistance of some government and public corporation officials to reforms and audits aimed at fighting corruption s2005177 the world bank and bilateral donors made similar observations and called for transparency measures national fiscal and budget obligation mechanisms and voucher record keeping systems under the ntgl were chaotic and subject to manipulation by key officials in some cases 50 in some government agency budgets the miscellaneous expense budget account category other was reportedly substantial in many cases and expenditures of such other funds were said to have been carried out in an ad hoc manner with few controls actions by the transitional legislature either to appropriate for private use or pay very nominal lease fees for expensive vehicles that each legislator was given drew local and foreign condemnation in november 2005 the us embassy in monrovia stated that the us government was shocked and disappointed by the recent incidents of transfers of liberian government property and resources into private ownership this drains vital government resources that could otherwise be used for critical developmental programs and sends the wrong signal to international donors who finance such programs it also perpetuates the culture of abuse of public trust and impunity that has contributed to two decades of decline in liberia the us embassy considers these transfers unscrupulous irresponsible and contrary to the public interest of the people of liberia liberian government resources are for the benefit of the liberian people and should not be misappropriated for private use 51 49 see for instance the analyst ntgls past haunts bryant others march 9 2006 regarding liberian parliamentary

attention during the ntgls tenure because of their financial significance and potential longterm effects on national development experts and donor governments questioned the propriety of march 2005

agreements first signed in 1926 giving firestone rights to large plantation areas for the cultivation of rubber 53 the contract was amended in part because firestone contended that it was unable to exploit its holdings due to fighting over the last decade and half and in order to boost foreign investment in liberia the deal gave the firestone group surface rental and other rights to nearly 200 square miles of active or proposed rubber plantation land for 36 years in exchange for 50 per acre per year and various investments tax payments social and infrastructure development outputs and

contended that the ntgl lacked legal mandate to negotiate longterm concessions that such functions could only be carried out by duly elected government and that such deals should be negotiated in manner more favorable to liberian economic and other national interests54 the contracts were also politically controversial the mittal deal was the subject of rival bids by the large mining firms global infrastructural holdings limited gihl bhp b illington and real tito and its ratification was contested legally and in parliament some civil society critics have alleged that the deals were not undertaken in transparent manner55 mittal denied that charge and maintained that the contract was won in transparent and competitive bid process and will bring significant foreign investment and

proposed iron ore investment arrangement would be made into multiuse railroad regardless of what firm was awarded mining rights 57 the firestone contract has also drawn attention for other reasons some firestone plantation workers have complained about poor working conditions and high production quotas some environmental advocacy groups and residents living near firestone rubber processing

comparing the old mittal contract and the new one63 according to global witness nongovernmental organization critic of the original mittal contract improvements in the revised contract include provisions requiring iron ore prices under the contract to be set by the ore market in contrast to the first contract which gave mittal the right to set the price thereby giving it control of royalty rates and tax payable and encouraging transfer pricing limited fiveyear tax holiday for mittal in comparison to an indefinitely extendable one liberian national control over two key public infrastructure assets the port of buchanan and the railway to yekepa major iron ore mine site the nonexemption of mittal from future human rights or environmental laws passed by liberia recognition of the mittal parent companys responsibility for liabilities faced by its operating affiliate in liberia and increased balance between the rights of existing property holders and mittal regarding the latters right to expropriate new concession land 64 global witness however continues to criticize what it asserts is the contracts precedence over liberian law on income tax royalties and other payments due to government it also views in negative light contractual confidentiality clause which will make it very hard for liberian citizens to monitor revenue flows from mittal and ensure the government uses the money wisely to reduce poverty65 such measure would likely be subject to change if liberia were to comply with the international extractive industries transparency initiative eiti

exports in 2003 but research findings indicate that for 2002 such earnings totaled at least 146 million and could have been as high as 180 to 200 million 76 although precise data on the value of prewar timber revenues vary such revenues are generally thought to have comprised as much as half of all export earnings depending on such factors as price rates of cutting and relative use of sustainable forestry practices future export levels could vary widely from those estimated for 2002 when forestry concessions were administered by the taylor regi and harvested by commercial interests

report88 liberias current congress could potentially play more prominent role in governance than have its predecessors in part because president sirleafs party does not enjoy majority in either chamber of the legislature many members are enthusiastic about their representative role and are determined to assertively exercise the constitutional powers and responsibilities of the legislature89 range of challenges may however impede the realization of such goals key impediment is the relative inexperience of many of liberias legislators although number of members are professionals with varying private or public sector experience and few served previously in the legislature as members or staff the vast majority have never previously held elected office and have lawmaking or policymaking experience in meetings attended by the author in july 2006 many members expressed need for instruction or information regarding the basic functions of being legislator the workings of the committee system and the legislatures oversight appropriations authorizing and constituent relations roles in many cases members are unable to turn to their personal staffs to provide expertise on legislative functions because as is common across the public sector in liberia many staff lack appropriate training or jobspecific skills in many instances the professional work of the legislature is carried out by university students reportedly because pay levels are viewed as too low to attract trained professional staff in other cases staff reportedly lack appropriate skills because they were hired based solely on contacts and family relationships with little regard to competence or training rendering many officesdysfunctional 90 there is also paucity of institutional resources available to members committee staff are virtually nonexistent and the legislature as whole lacks many of the assets necessary to independently carry out its principal roles the two chambers largely lack bill drafting expertise and most bills are drafted by the executive branch or by outside organizations parliamentary record keeping capacity is also limited legislative debates and votes are recorded by hand in part due to lack of audio or stenographic recording equipment legislative debates and decisions therefore are reportedly often documented incompletely and sometimes erroneously 87 the report

appears to curtail the institutions potential effectiveness in comparison to many countries the size of liberian members office staffs is large and high proportion of members staffs perform nonlegislative services such as food preparation gardening and driving similarly despite general lack of resources the two chambers of the legislature maintain duplicate services each for instance has its own research department these institutional challenges are compounded by dearth of office space and equipment the legislatures capitol building which was looted and suffered decay due to neglect during the civil war lacks most basic functional infrastructure elements such as water and electricity though it is currently undergoing an upgrade see below some liberians including some legislators as well as outside observers are also concerned that legislators lack of knowledge regarding their normative and constitutional roles as representatives of the public may cause some to seek use their offices for purposes of private gain rather than to serve the public such concerns were highlighted in october 2006 when just prior to the slated start of ussupported project to rehabilitate the capitol building see below several liberia news reports described acts of alleged looting of the capitol building by some members and staff of the legislature who were reported to have removed and appropriated government property for personal use from the capitol 91 similar concerns reportedly arose in relation to legislative negotiations relating to th recently enacted forestry law reforms according to informed observers during talks prior to the passage of the forestry reforms some legislators made remarks suggesting that they viewed successful outcome of the reform process as being one in which they personallyas persons representing the public in contrast to the general liberian public itselfwould directly benefit from processes at issue such as the allocation of forestry concessions or revenues certain amount of ongoing public skepticism about government transparency in general may be attributable to public perceptions formed of the ntgl and of the transitional legislature the decisionmaking conduct of which was often opaque and sometimes allegedly corrupt see transitional governance above and to widespread reports of corruption under previous liberian

lebanese businessman in house delegation to doha qatar those seeking his ouster claimed that snowe was unfit to serve as speaker snowe fought his ouster attempt by arguing that the vote against him was illegitimate because it did not take place in the capitol which is in disrepair and is undergoing renovations proponents of his ouster cited that fact as the reason that the vote was held off capitol grounds snowe also accused his opponents of receiving bribes from the executive branch in exchange for seeking his ouster such charges were denied by legislators and the presidency snowe subsequently appealed to the supreme court asserting that the vote to remove him was unconstitutional the court ruled in his favor but some of his opponents argued that the courts interpretation was erroneous and should be ignored while others argued that the courts ruling should be followed and that snowe should be removed under alternate legal procedures the ruling however spurred the

but will use the physical premises of the icc in the hague the netherlands to conduct his trial and related hearings taylors transfer to the netherlands was made for reasons of security and to prevent potential instability in sierra leone and liberia where his trial could prove politically controversial and emotive101 the decision to transfer him to the hague remains topic of debate the decision to transfer the trial to venue outside of sierra leone or the continent of africa stimulated debate over the over the implications for justice of the transfer102 some have contended that taylors trial should have been conducted in the country where his alleged crimes took place such an outcome in this view would demonstrateboth to victims and perpetrators of international human rights and laws of war violations in sierra leone and the surrounding sub regionthat accountability for such actions can be achieved in the same social and geographic contexts in which they were committed similarly some have argued that the didactic and symbolic value for the region of local public trial would be greater than one conducted abroad in part because it would allow more direct and proximate access to the court proceedings by the local population some observers have worried that because many sierra leonean journalists lack the ability to cover the trial directly due to cost or other factors sierra leoneans would be deprived of key channel of information and anal ysis accessible to them in the local patois krio an englishbased creole and responsive to local concerns sierra leoneans lack widespread access to television and print media particularly western media sources that are more likely to have the resources to cover trial in the hague other factors cited in favor of holding trial

factor that might spark political unrest or conflictsuch as taylors trialshould be avoided given the relatively fragile and recent transition to peace in liberia and sierra leone both of which have extended histories of political instability in this view moving the trial to the hague has decreased the chance that political controversy prompted by taylors trial may lead to local unrest and has undercut his ability to directly appeal to or rally potentially armed followers should he attempt to use the trial as political platform some have also maintained that holding the trial in distant location would help sierra leoneans and liberians overcome the legacies of war local trial according to this point of view might present too immediate and visceral reminder of the wartime suffering that many in these two countries have only recently overcome sierra leoneans this line of reasoning emphasized are weary of war and its effects and want to move past their experiences of wartime

extradition have been delicate matters for president sirleaf because her government was not party to his asylum deal or indictment but was charged with resolving issues arising from them prior to his transfer to the court some observers had raised concerns over the hypothetical possibility that the stability of sirleafs government might be undermined if sirleaf were to alienate or anger supporters of former president taylor particularly given that he won the presidency with 753 of the vote in 1997 and because he is former warlord whose factional fighters had reputation for brutality prior to her midmarch 2006 visit to the united states sirleaf had stated that her administration would eventually seek the repatriation of former president charles taylor from nigeria or his transfer to the scsl under certain conditions these included consultations with and the assent of regional leaders who managed the process of leading to his exile accommodation for certain unspecified timing considerations and transfer process that would not undermine the security of liberia she also reportedly said that she did not view it as an immediate priority she specifically stated that any solution would require the concurrence of the european union the african union and west african leaders with whom she met during regional preinauguration consulting tour in part intended to address certain national and regional sensitivities notwithstanding these actions in march 2006 her government formally requested taylors extradition from nigeria prompting the sequence of events leading to

calls for special court to try crimes committed during liberias civil wars 108 many liberians who suffered the death of loved ones or personal attacks and other crimes and some have expressed desire to see those who committed such deeds punished109 some observers have suggested however that president sirleaf does not in general support prosecuting those who committed war time atrocities during the 19892003 civil wars because such tribunals might reignite old antagonisms and conflict such sentiments may be held by many liberians in part due to personal or familial linkages to parties involved in the conflict and due to concerns similar to those cited in favor of moving the taylor trial to the hague some have argued that the current legislature might not support the creation of tribunal because some of its members might be targets of subsequent prosecutions the creation of tribunal could face legal barriers as well as political ones some peace agreements covering liberia first civil war contain amnesty provisions for wartime crimes there is apparent legal barrier to one that might cover liberias second civil war however the 2003 comprehensive peace agreement provided for recommendation for general amnesty to all persons and parties engaged or involved in military activities during the liberian civil conflict that is the subject of this agreement but did not explicitly provide for one it did however endeavor to address issues of impunity as well as an opportunity for both the victims and perpetrators of human rights violations to share their experiences
