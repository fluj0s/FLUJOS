has occurred in varying degrees in most industrial economies and can be seen as natural outcome of economic progress and rising living standard when examined from the standpoint of real output and level of employment the us manufacturing sector has shown considerable stability over the last 20 years because the apparent deindustrialization has been coincident with rising level of international trade particularly recent increases in trade with many lowwage developing economies there is an inclination to see causality running from rising trade to faltering manufacturing sector yet economic analysis indicates that while rising level of trade can have adverse consequences for particular industries it is unlikely to adversely aï¬€ect the whole manufacturing sector increased imports may hurt some industries but the increased exports needed to pay for those imports helps other industries therefore across all tradeable goods producing industries there is net loss of jobs moreover

across all tradeable goods producing industries there is net loss of jobs moreover exporting i ndustries tend to pay higher wages than import competing industries rising trade deficits are somewhat different matter trade deficits are not function of rising level of trade they are largely rooted in domestic macroeconomic forces that affect domes tic saving and investment decisions including the government budget trade defi cits do not lead to any net loss of output or jobs for the economy but they will lik ely change the composition of output and employment between tradeable and nontradeab goods it is very likely that the manufacturing sector which produces tradeab goods will be adversely affected by large and growing trade deficits although that effect is probably not as large as commonly believed an economic force that has clearly d strong impact on manufacturing is steady and often rapid rise in sector productivity the impact of productivity on sector employment is far larger then the effect of trade deficits in the past productivity rise has llowed the manufacturing sector to expand output with fairly steady level of employment recent acceleration of the pace of productivity advance raises the possibility that in the future efficiency gains may outpace output growth and lead to significantly slower growth of sector employment policy response that would have direct positive economic effect on the manufacturing sector is action toward reducing the trade deficit an indirect policy response would be to raise the pace of development of new tec hnology and new products through added support for areas of idea creation that the private market will insufficiently support there will still be need to ameliorate the destructive aspect of economic progress if

the roles of trade productivity and recession introduction in recent years there has been regula rly recurring concern about the apparent deindustrialization of the us econom manufacturing seems to be steadily diminishing presence in the american ec onomy accounting for smaller and smaller share of gross domestic pr oduct gdp and employing smaller and smaller share of the labor force the typical concern is that withering away of manufacturing is the loss of an activity vital to the continued economic wellbeing of american workers for many this sector of th economy is seen as the source of economic vigor and the provider of millions of good jobs if manufacturing fades away in this view so will the high standard of living of many citizens deindustrialization is hard ly phenomenon that is unique to the united states it is also evident in varying degree in mo st other industrial ec onomies both in mature economies such as the united states and in newly emergent economies such as china hong kong korea and singapore nor is it recent ccurrence as aspects of decline have been underway at vary ing pace in the united states japan and europe for nearly 30 years looking at this process 1997 imf study concluded deindustrialization is simply the natural outcome of successful economic development and is genera lly associated with rising living standards1 of late concern about deindustrialization in th united states has been heightened by particularly protract ed decline in manufacturing output and employment since the 2001 recession with si gn of significant improvement in the recovery so far always highly sensitive to the path of the business cycle the impact of the recession of 2001 and its afterm ath may be particularly sharp for manufacturing because much of the slack demand is the consequence of pronounced and protracted weakening of inve stment spending and export sales both are important sources of mand for manufactured goods although the recession was generally mil d it coincided with major stock market crash and weak equity prices have likely reduced the ability of consumers and business to finance new spending so during the recession the september 11 terrorist attacks occurred and since the recession there was major corporate governance scandal and the start of the war with iraq this succession of unusualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs2 2see oecd economic outl ook 74paris 2004 3more imports must be payed for with fo reign currency to earn foreign currency the united states must sell an equal value of exports to the foreign economy those exports can be the sale of either goods eg computer ai rplane wheat or assets eg stock bonds real property the export of more goods has direct positive effect on domestic output and employment the export of more assets s an indirect positive effect on domestic output and employment through the stimulative effect of lower interest rates caused by that sale increasing the capital inflow to domestic credit markets events has probably raised uncertainty and reduced confidence in the marketplace an ebbing of confidence will have par ticularly negative impact on forward looking activities such as business investment in new plant and equipment in addition high dollar exchange rate and slow growth abroad during this time period took its toll on export sales activity in the manufacturing is strongly linked to these two components of final demand nd protracted weakness in th areas transmits sharp negative impulse to the sector but these are likely to be temporary problems in 2003 the pace of economic growth in the united states quickened and most analysts expect the economic expansion to maintain this revived mo mentum also the dollar has weakened substantially since early 2002 with furthe r depreciation probable and the pace of economic growth among major trading partners is likely to accelerate2 for some however the worry is that more than the temporary negative effect of recession and its aftermath is hurting the manufacturing sector more enduring forces of decline are suspected to be at work that make it likely that economic recovery for the overall economy will not br ing the us manufacturing sector back to where it was in 2000 because the apparent deindustr ialization has been concurrent with rising level of internati onal trade particularly trade with many low wage developing economies some observers see causality running from rising trade to faltering manufacturing sector the ba sic vision in this regard is one where rising tide of imports from lowwage c ountries s upplants american producers and eliminates american manufacturing jobs rising level of trade can surely have adverse consequences for pa rticular industries but it is unlikely to have net negative effect on the whole sector because rising level of imports requires rising level of exports to pay for them3 some import competing industries lose but some export producing industries gain in contrast rising trade deficit wh ich is not necessary consequence of rising level of trade reflects macroeconomic conditions that generate bias against domestic produced tradeable goods and will likely have net negative impact on the manufacturing sector nevert heless the trade deficits negative repercussions on the manufacturing sector are probably smaller then commonly believed and it is unlikely that this effect can be the principal cause of manufacturings difficulties another powerful economic force affectin g the manufacturing sector is rising productivity historically rapid productivity growth in manufacturing has steadily reduced the number of employees needed to produce any given level of output since the 1970s productivity has risen more or less in step with the rising demand forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs3 manufacturing output allowing for fairly steady level of employment since the mid1990s however the rate of productiv ity growth has accelerated at that time demand also accelerated and the level of employment rose productivity advance continued through the recession and in th is environment of shrinking demand its impact on employment was necessarily negative if as the current economic expansion proceeds high rates of pr oductivity growth pers ist and demand does not keep pace then the level of employment in manufacturing w ill not regain its pre recession levels finally we can not rule out that as in the late 1970s the longterm structure of demand in the us economy has agai n shifted away from manufactured goods with consumers allotting smaller share of their total spending to this type of output regardless of the stage of the business cycle or the national origin of the manufactured product we can expect that these several forces acting in conjunction would have very strong negative effect on the manufacturing sector this report attempts to sort through these forces trying to assess what role each might have played in the recent travails of the us manufacturing sector as well as their possible impact on the future path of that sector possible po licy responses to these events such as industrial policy trade policy worker re training and adjustment technology policy and trade deficit reduction will also be evaluated manufacturing in the us economy 1950 to 2000 evidence of decline as share of current dollar gdp manufacturing output has been in near continuous declin in the post worldwar ii era falling from nearly 30 in 1950 to less than16 in 2000 employment in manufacturing as share of total employment has also d eclined over this period from about 30 in 1950 to around 14 in 2000 the corollary to th trends is an equally steady rise in the output and employment share of the service sector that sectors share of gdp has increased from about 35 of gdp to about 55 over this time period while its share of employment increased from 55 to 80 declining shares of current dollar gdp and total employment are not unique to the american manufacturing sector having also occurred in most other indus trial economies in th is time period this pattern of change would seem to suggest that there has been substantial shift in the structure of expenditures away from manufacturing and toward services such shift could be part of the normal evolution of demand in high income economies but may also be seen as the adverse impact of rising level of trade with lowwage developing economies on th manufacturing sector evidence of growth and stability significantly different picture one of relative stability and growth rather then decline emerges if the us manufacturing sector is viewed from the perspective of th sectors contributi on to real gdp and its absolute level of out put and employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs4 4falling demand for domestic manufactured goods could reflect reduced demand for continued steady share of real gdp the value of current dollar gdp can change due to either changes in the price of out put or to changes in the volume of output real gdp is dollar measure of the volum of output the number of things actually produced decline in the current dollar share of gdp can therefore be the result of fall in the price of sector output or fall in the volume of sector output or both the economic significance of decline in current dollar gdp share will be different depending on whether price or volume is the primary force behind the change if falling price is the primary cause it indicates that the sectors claim on the economys productive resources is declining but that the real demand for its output the volume of goods produced and purchase d is not declining real output and the real output share could be steady or rising indicating steady or rising importance of manufactured goods in th economys overall demand for goods and services this would also mean that there has been decline in the principal demandside determinant of the sectors level of employment other factors unchanged the same real out put requires the same level of employment to produce it and rising real output requires higher level of employment of course real output and real output share can stay the same or rise even if current dollar output or current dollar share is declining on the other hand if falling current do llar gdp share is the result of fall in the sectors volume of output or relatively slower growth of real output it indicates that the economys demand for the goods th sector produces has fallen absolutely or as share of total expenditures in add ition if the sectors real output falls other factors constant so would th level of employment in th sector if manufacturings falling share is the result of sector real output rising slower than the overall economy employment would still increase but not as rapidly as in the steady or rising share case the two alternative reasons for falling current dollar share tell very different stories about the process of deindustrialization in the 1950 to 2000 period if that decline reflects falling price for the manufacturing sectors output it is favorable outcome for the overall economy as it is getting the manufactured goods it wants for steadily lower price and such decline is not bad news for the manufacturing sector for it maintains its share of the economys real demand for goods and services and steady volume of output will not cause any fall in the level of i ndustry employment if the decline in current dollar gdp share is the result of falling real output it can also be seen as proce ss that is good for the wider economy as consumers are shifting their real spending towards the things that they prefer but reduction of real output would seem to be clearly bad news for the manufacturing sector as it is producing less and less of what the economy wants and fewer and fewer workers will be needed to produce that shrinking output it is this circumstance where domestic manufactured goods are sm aller and smaller part of real economywide demand and are truly fading economic presence that seems most consistent with the notion of deindustrialization4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs5 4continued domestic manufactured goods or reduced demand for manufactured goods generally regardless of the national origin of the goodsfigure 1 change in manufacturings real gdp share in 1991 at the beginning of the prev ious economic expansion manufacturings share of real gdp was 158 and by the ex pansions peak in 2000 that real share had increased to 172 therefore there was absolute or relative decline in manufacturings production of goods over this period longer term view of the behavior of manufacturings share of real gdp would afford more telling view of manufacturings evolving standing in the us economy unfortunately due to their method of estimation real gdp shares may gi ve an inaccurate measure of real share for more distant years we can get around this problem however by comparing the movement of an index of manufacturing output relative to an index of real gdp this measure cannot tell us what the share is but it can tell us whether that share has likely risen or fallen looking at plot of this measure since 1970 in figure 1 shows rather trendless path l ooking beyond the periodic ups and downs caused by the business cycle manufacturings real shar declined moderately from the late 1970s through the 1980s but then increased modera tely through the 1990s all in all the us manufacturings sectors relative pos ition in real demand and output has been stable not in decline source us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis and us department of labor bureau of labor statistics rising level of output steady share of real gdp in growing economy does not mean that the level of manufacturing real output has been steadyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs6 5one might expect that the fall in the relative price of manufactured goods could lead to an increase in the quantity of those goods purchas ed the relatively steady share of real gdp indicates that this has not occurred and that the demand for manufactures is not price elasticrather it has steadily risen from 1970 to 2000 the cumulative increase in manufacturing real output was 144 that tr anslates to an annual average rate of growth of 30 only slightly slower th an the 31 pace of the overall economy this is not the picture of sector that was in significant economic decline moreover it shows that for nearly three decades there has been shift in the structure of demand away from manufactured goods and toward services what has occurred is significant change in the relative prices of the output of these two sectors the average price of manufactured goods has steadily fallen while that of services has steadily risen what has largely been in decline in manufacturing for the last 40 years is what consumers need to spend to purchase those goods5 steady level of employment the other element of relative stability in the manufacturing sector through to the business cycle peak in 2000 has been the level of employment the sharp fall in employment after 2000 is examined in subsequent section of the report manufacturing employ ment as share of total employment has certainly fallen down from about 25 in 1970 to about14 in 2000 but the actual number of people employ ed in manufacturing has not seen such dramatic change particularly over the last 20 years figure 2 plots the level of manufacturing employment from 1970 to 2003 we can see there that despite considerable economic turbulence empl oyment did on occasion rise above 18 million and reached post war peak of 190 million in 1979 consistent with moderate fall in manufactur ings share of real gdp after this period sector employment levels in the 1980s also notch ed down tending to fluctuate between 17 and 18 million employees at the peak of the 1980s expansion employment pushed to near 18 million this is also the approx imate range for the level of employment during the long economic expansion of the 1990s reaching peak of about 176 million employees in 1998 and standing at about 173 million employees at the expansions peak in 2000 over the 30year period from 1970 to 2000 there was some slippage of peak employment down from 19 million workers in the 1970s to about 176 million in 1998 but the fall off is certainly not precipitous and as discussed in the next section c ould be more apparent then real httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs7 6see the white house economic report of the president washington dc february 2004 p 71 and raymond j matalonijr u s multinational companies operations in 2001 survey of current business washington november 2003 pp 92 7productivity data obtained from us departme nt of labor bureau of labor statisticsfigure 2 manufacturing employment in millions of jobs source bureau of labor statistics the effect of domestic outsourcing some of the slippage in peak employment noted above is likely matter of statistical defin ition particularly in recent years there has been significant amount of domestic outsourcing companies are now contracting out for many activities once done internally and many of these jobs are now counted as em ployment in another sector of the economy therefore the measured employment in manufacturing is lower but the measured employment in the service sector in which these workers are now classified is higher and there likely has been net loss of j obs to the economy from this redefinition it has been judged by some that this phenomenon is sizable and could account for large portion of the measured ma nufacturing job loss between 1990 and 20006 the effect of rising productivity another important factor that has certainly had an effect on employment in this sector is rapid and in recent years accelerating increases in productivity as noted above manufacturings steady share of gdp in growing economy has meant th at its level of output has grown apace with the economy this rising output level we have just seen was produced using fairly steady number of workers therefore another steady feature of the us manufacturing sector has been relativel high rates of productivity growth from 1970 th rough 2000 manufacturing productivity advanced at 31 average annual rate7 this average however masks the significant acceleration in the pace of productivity increase over this period during the 1980s manufacturinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs8 productivity advanced at 29 averag annual rate fr om 1990 to 2000 this accelerated to an annual average of about 39 and over the last four years of that interval the pace quickened further to 46 also the pace of productivity growth was increasing relative to the pace of output growth in the manufacturing sector over the 1970 to 2000 period output increased at slightly slower average pace of about 30 during the 1970s output in ma nufacturing grew faster than productivity for the 1980s and 1990s however manufacturing output grew slower than productivity averaging about 29 while productivity over the same period advanced at about 32 this recent acceleration of productivity growth would explain why despite achieving similar output shares the level of employment in manufacturing during the 1990s expansion fell slightly short of reaching the peak level of employment reached in the 1980s expansion as well as help explain the fall from the postwar eras peak employment in 1979 an estimate of the employment effect of higher productivity sense of the force productivity can have on employment can be judged by calculating the number of workers that would have been needed to produce the manufacturing sectors real output in 2000 at the productiv ity rate of 1990 in 1990 the average real gdp per employed person in manufacturing was about 62000 if that rate persisted for the next 10 years that is if th ere was productivity advance production of 2000s real output would have required 256 milli on workers that is 86 million more than were actually employed in 2000 or an increase of nearly 50 and would have boosted manufacturings share of to tal employment from about 17 to over 19 rather than falling to 13 as it actually did of course the substantive economic out come of rising productivity trend is that society has been able to gain the ri sing output of the manufactured goods it wants without rising co mmitment of labor resources to th is sector as result it would have been possible for t hose resources to be used to expand the production of services and increase the total quantity of goods and services available to consumers this productivitydriven gain has manifested to consumers as the steady fall in the relative price of manufactured goods and steady rise in the purchasing power of consumers income the efficiency gain s afforded by productivity growth are what propels rising living standard and the manufacturing sector has been now and in the past the leading source of hi gher productivity for the us economy the effect of rising international trade popular discussion of the state of the us manufacturing sector will typically quickly focus on the impact of international trade on output nd employment in this sector while the spending of the domestic economy is strongly weighted toward services trade flows tend to be largely of goods particularly manufact ured goods therefore activity in the manufacturing sector is likely to be mo re sensitive than the wider economy to changes in the level composition and ba lance of trade however the economic impact of these trade effects on manufactur ing is different in form and magnitude then commonly thought for the united states the total level of trade exports plus imports has grown steadily and substantially over the post world war ii era total trade as share ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs9 8this globalization of the american economy has also occurred in the trade of financial assets ie stocks bonds bank accounts and real property in fact such capital flows have grown even more spectactularly than has trade in goods and services because asset transactions occur at greater speed and volume than goods transactions they have stronger effect on exchange rates therefore asset ma rket flows most often become the determining force behind changes in the balance of trade in goods and services asset flows will be animated by the relative rate of return on dom estic versus foreign assets relatively high rate of return on domestic assets will make them attractive to foreign buyers and induce net outflow of assets net outflow of assets tends to appreciate the exchange rate because the the demand for the domestic currency needed to buy the domestic assets also rises the appreciating exchange rate will induce net inflow of goods and services trade deficit conversely relatively low rate of return on domestic assets will make foreign assets more attractive to domestic buyers and induce net infl ow of assets net inflow of assets tends to depreciate the exchange rate because the demand for the foreign currency needed to buy the foreign assets also rises deprecia ting exchange rate will induce net outflow of goods and services trade surplus 9remember that with balanced rise in the leve l of trade increased imports must be payed for with an equal valued increase in the export of goods or assets 10for discussion of these tre nds see douglas irwin free trade under fire princeton princeton university press 2002 pp315gdp grew from 9 in 1960 to 22 in 20008 economic analysis tells us that rising level of trade with imports and exports rising in balance is means for enrichment for the economy as whole trade will ch ange the composition of output favoring domestic industries that are re latively efficient and have adverse effects on industries whose relative inefficiency dictates using foreign pr oduction source there is however strong economic reason to expect rising level of trade per to have any net negative effect on the manufactur ing sector rising imports hurt some industries but an equalsized in crease in exports helps others9 the composition of us trade has also changed for example in 1960 agricultural goods were 22 of expor ts but by 2000 had fa llen to only 6 conversely capital goods over the same peri od have gone from 30 to 46 of total exports on the import side automobiles moved from less then 4 to about 16 of total imports and apparel has increased from 10 to 25 of total imports however the greatest change on the import side is th increased imports of capital goods rising from 4 of all imports in 1960 to 45 in 2000 more generally the composition of both imports and exports has shifted towa rds manufactured goods and the majority of trade in manufactured goods is now tr ade in intermediate goods g oods used as inputs to the process of production not g oods ready for final sale to households10 such compositional changes are indicativ of changing consumer demand here and abroad shifting comparative advantage and increasing fragmentation of the production process across ma ny economies again these compositional changes caused by trade are part of an enri ching process that is good for the overall economy but in the process helps so industries and hurts others the effect of growing trade deficits since the 1980s recurring aspect of us international trade has been the running of large trade deficits over thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs10 11the compositional effect is different than that induced by rising level of trade in that case the change was among tradeable goods pr oducing industries in the case of trade deficits however the change is between tradeable and nontradeable goods producing industries 12the significance of intraindustry trade vari by industry for industries that make sophisticated manufactured goods it tends to be very high with over 90 of trade of this form in labor intensive industries that manufacture less sophisticated products very little trade is intraindustry intra i ndustry trade is to great degree manifestation of wide spread move towards more fragmented production processes or what is called vertical specialization it is estimated that about 13 of th growth of world trade since 1970 is the continuedeconomic expansion of the 1990s the tr ade deficit increased from 48 billion in 1992 to 444 billion in 2000 or from 07 to 44 of gdp large trade deficits are not necessary counterpart to rising level of trade or shifting composition of trade those deficits are the result of the us economys pronounced tendency to spend beyond what the domestic economy can produce borrowing from the rest of the world to purchase net inflow of foreign output trade deficit to help meet the economys total demand for goods nd services foreign and domestic standard economic analysis indicates that trade deficits do not lead to any net loss of output or employment for the whol economy but trade deficits will likely alter the composition of output and employme nt as the forces behind those deficits generate rising exchange rate and thereby rising incentive to allocate resources away from production of domestic tradable goodswhich are largely manufactures towards the import of foreign tradeable goods and towards the production of non tradable products which are largely services11 in most cases this market churning induced by trade deficits is expected to have negative effect on the output and employment of the united states principa l tradable goods sector manufacturing however the negative effect of trade deficits on manufactur ing is probably not as substantial as commonly believe d focusing on the 1992 2000 period the 300 billion rise in the trade deficit in manufactures in this period was unlikely to have caused likesized reduction in the produc tion of domestic manufactured goods nor caused proportionate loss of manufacturing employment this is because most often trade deficits are means of au gmenting the goods available to domestic purchasers allowing the nation to spend beyond current domestic output through the availability of both domestic and foreign output there are several reasons why imports and domestic output will rise together first with such strong demand in an economy operating near or at its produc tive capacity and unable to generate substantial nearterm expansion of its productive capacity it is possible for many domestic industries to be working at full capac ity even as there are also large inflows of similar or related fore ign products both domestic and foreign output of particular product is needed to meet cu rrent demand second because very large share us trade is intraindustry trade in intermediate products trade within the same industry due to an internationally fragmented production process final product will often be composed of several components so of domestic origin and some of foreign origin12 with this structure of production an increase in the demandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs11 12continued result of this phenomenon and can be expected to be even higher for the trade of an advanced industrial ec onomy such as the united states for further examination of the nature and significance of intraindustry trad see paul krugman and maurice obstfeld international ec onomics theory and policy reading ma addison wesely 1997 pp 139142 for further examination of the vertical specialization phenomenon see david hummels dana rapoport and keimu yi the nature and growth of vertical specialization journal of international economics 54 june 2001 pp 7596 13 see the operation of us multinational companies survey of current business washington march 2002 pp 2454for the final product will increase both dom estic output and imported foreign output regardless the level of capac ity utilization finally ther may simply be domestic counterpart for some goods because product differentiation has led to specialization across countries in the production of partic ular goods the economic gain from such specialization arises from economies of scale not comparative advantage and is common among high income economies w ith very similar resource endowments for these reasons to substantial degree the size of the trade deficit during an economic expansion as during the 1990s ca nnot be taken as oneforone measure of reduced domestic output and th loss of the associated jobs during the 19922000 economic expansion the us economy was in such circumstance strong acceleration of investment spending pushed economywide spending well beyond current domestic pr oduction with the difference made up by net inflow of foreign output trade defi cit without this net inflow from abroad some investment would not have occurred or domestic c onsumption would have had to be reduced yet as the trade ficit increased the economy grew at record breaking speed and the unemployment rate was pushed to record breaking lows investment spending is largely spendi ng on manufactured goods and as observed above domestic manufacturing output grew even faster then the overall economy the sector quickly reached high level of capacity utilization and sector employment rose to levels near the employment p eaks of the 1980s among us multinationals in manufacturing which account for large share of sector employment and trade there was evidence of us firms during this period diverting activity from the domestic parent to their foreign affiliates the output and employment of these firms rose in both domestic and foreign operations13 this all strongly suggests that to large degree the trade deficit in this period was means to augment the manufactured goods available to the economy rather th an substitute for domestic manufacturing output nevertheless the inflow of goods that trade deficit affords is unlikely to perfectly mesh with the economys ex panding spectrum of demands for goods in such period remember that more than half of economywide spending is on services services represented 53 of tota l expenditures in 2000 whereas the trade deficit is primarily vehicle for acquiri ng goods rather than services services accounted for only 18 of all imports in 2000 if at this time the economys spending beyond domestic output was composed heavily of spending for services as well as goods then the inflows from the tr ade deficit would not be of the kind of output that would directly satisfy this mand and rising exchange rate and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs12 14in the framework outlined above the trade deficit would not have increased over the course of the economic expansion if the in vestment boom had been financed by domestic saving if that occurred there would be net capital inflow appreciation of the exchange rate and increase of the trade defic it this scenario also assumes that domestic manufacturings productive capacity could expand apace with rising demand exigencies of economic efficiency would likely induce some substitution of foreign manufactured output for domestic manufact ured output in other words market forces acting primarily through rising exchange rate that makes foreign goods relatively less costly will reallocate some domestic resources away from the relatively less efficiently produced at the higher exchange rate domestic manufactured goods and allocate those resour ces towards the domestic service sector the import of relatively more efficiently produced at the higher exchange rate foreign manufactured goods serves as substitute for the reduced domestic production of certain manufactured goods as result the size of the domestic manufacturing sector is smaller and the service sector larger then they otherwise would have been remember that this substitution effect occurs concurrently with the augmentation effect discussed above th erefore the manufacturing sector can still be expanding output overall it would s imply not be expanding as much as it otherwise might overall the economy with th use of the trade deficit finds the most efficient way to use domestic and fore ign sources of supply to meet its total demand for goods and services an estimate of the employment effect of the trade deficit in the 19922000 period how substantial was the adve rse effect of the trade deficit on manufacturing the apparent relative steadiness of the manufacturing share of real gdp and level of employment make it clear that the trade deficit did not induce any absolute decreases of output or employme nt in the manufacturing sector therefore what adverse effect there was would have to be essentially question of how much larger would the manufacturing output sh are and employment level have been if there had been increase of the trade deficit that is during vigorous economic expansion led by rapid increase in domes tic spending on investment goods which are largely output of the manufacturing s ector might domestic manufacturings share of real gdp have pushed higher than it did if the trade deficit had not risen14 rough estimate of this effect can be made as first step let us establish an absolute upper bound for the rising trade deficits impact on output and employment in manufacturing between 1992 and 2000 for this purpose it is assumed that increase in the economywide trade deficit would also translate into increase in the manufacturing trade deficit if the 300 billion rise of the manufacturing trade deficit in this period had represented oneforone substitution of foreign manufactured goods for domestic manufactured goods then without the rise of the trade deficit domestic manuf acturing output could have been 300 billion higher in 2000 given that the average value added for manufacturing worker in 2000 was about 92000 ie total value dded divided by total empl oyment then to produce an extra 300 billion would have require d about 33 million more workers thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs13 15 output and employment data can be found in the 2004 economic report of the president cited above increase would have brought the secto rs total employment to 206 million in 2000 and its share of total employment from 130 to 156 it is interesting to note that the maximum possible employment effect of the trade deficit is much smaller than the estimated employment effect of the productivity increase over the same period that was calculated earlier of course the probable effect of the trade deficit on manufacturing employment would likely be less than 33 million as wa s discussed earlier in the report because of domestic capacity constraints because of the fragmentation of most production processes and because there is domestic source of supply sizable portion of the trade deficit does not come at the expe nse of domestic output and employment so erasing those imports would not add to dom estic output or employment also the conditions that caused the overall trade deficit not to rise would also likely lead to significant increase in the level of services exports and forestall full shifting of domestic resources into the pr oduction of manufactured goods the other point that suggests manufactur ing employment gain of less than 33 million is that an increase to 206 million wo rkers would push the sectors level of employment far above its historical peak of 194 million workers reached in 1979 we also observe that throughout the 1970s wh trade pressures were negligible and when manufactures share of total spending was likely higher than now the sectors employment fluctuated in range of between 18 and 19 million workers given that since the 1970s productivity in manufacturing increased faster than output it seems improbable that even without rising trad deficit employment in 2000 would have reach 205 m illion if we take the historical hi gh of about 19 million workers as plausible upper bound then the employment ga in from having increase of the trade deficit falls to 17 million nevertheless whether the employment impact was 17 million or 33 million without an increasin g trade deficit during th 1992 2000 expansion employment in manufacturing would have likely been significantly higher however by comparison this anal ysis finds that the negative impact of the trade deficit on manufacturing employment was likely 13 the magnitude of the negative impact of productivity increase stimated above over th same time period events since 2000 confluence of negative forces from 2000 to 2001 the real output of the manufacturing sector fell nearly 100 b illion and through 2002 real output of the sector was still 70 billion below the 2000 leve l data on gdp by sector for 2003 are not yet available but the absence of any significant rebound in the industrial production index for the sector in 2003 sugge sts improvement may not be great the fall of manufacturing employment in this period was more dr amatic down by about 15 or by about 26 million jobs15 three broad macroeconomic forces have most likely come together to cause these declines two from the demandside and one from the supplysidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs14 one demandside force is the recession of 2001 and the tepid pace of recovery in 2002 and early 2003 real gdp increased only 03 in 2001 and advanced at rather slow 21 in 2002 the pace of economic growth steadily improved during 2003 moving up at 31 this gives hope that the economic expansion is now progressing at healthy pace but so fa r has not had strong positive impact on the manufacturing sector the demand for manuf actured goods is particularly sensitive to the economys cyclical path in th face of shortterm economic weakness spending on consumer durab and capital goods tends to be postponed until better economic conditions emerge also in contrast to the service sector accumulating inventories must be worked off be fore increasing current production and employment thus while the overall econom had significant slowing of economic activity the manufacturing sector the make r of those consumer durables and capital goods experienced outright declines w ith output falling nearly 6 since 2000 the second demandside factor is the tinued rise of the us trade deficit since 2000 the overall trade deficit incr eased about 130 billion and the deficit in manufactures increased about 80 billion it is likely that growing trade deficit in period of economic slack would have stronger negative effect on domestic manufacturing as domestic producers face not only falling demand but also smaller share of that demand relative to foreign pr oducers ie smaller share of smaller pie during an expansion rising trade deficit also reduces the domestic share but rapidly rising demand can still cause domes tic producers absolute position to rise ie smaller share of bigger pie the force working from the supplysi is continued rapid advance of productivity in the manufacturing sector spite the slow pace of economic growth productivity in this sector has advanced by at least 11 since 2000 while this will translate into benefit for the overall ec onomy rapid efficiency advance now means on average that fewer workers are needed to produce any given volume of manufactured goods in other words ev if there had been recession and further increase of the trade deficit employment in the manufacturing sector would likely have fallen substantially when this sizable productivity effect is combined with the demand weakness that has occurred it is not surprising that there has been fairly substantial negative impact on employment in the manufacturing sector not only has the demand for manufactured g oods fallen and not only has the domestic producers share of that demand fallen but the number of employees needed to produce that smaller output has also fallen substantiallyie smaller pie smaller piece and many less workers needed to produce that piece than was true only three years earlier estimating the separate impacts the relative impact of these three forces on the manufacturing sector can be approximated using some simple calculations in 2000 real gdp originatin g in the manufacturing sector was about 1600 billion and the sector employed about 173 million workers this translates into an average real output produced per worker of about 92000 with 11 cumulative productivity increase in manuf acturing since 2000 the comparable real gdp per employee value in 2003 is estimate d at 102000 with these values in hand some simple estimates are possible httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs15 16this does not take into account that absent productivity increases and the associated reduction of the price of manufactured goods the demand for manufactured g oods could been have weaker and employment lower the effect of weak demand what would manufacturing employment be in 2003 if there had been productivity ga ins since 2000 rough estimate can be made by dividing 2003s value of real gdp originating in manufacturing by 2000s real gdp per worker with change in productivity the value of gdp per worker would be same in 2003 as in 2000 it is too early to know the actual real gdp value for 2003 but conservative estimate would probably be about 1500 billion dividing that 1500 billion by the 2000 real output per worker value of 92000 tells us that with unchanged produc tivity since 2000 about 163 million workers would have been needed to produce the 2003 output level this is reduction of one million workers from the 2000 employment level this number can be taken to be the approximate effect of weaker mand on employment in manufacturing16 apportioning the weak demand effect between recession and the trade deficit it is also possible to make rough estimate of the relative contribution of the two demandside forces recession and the trade deficit this can be accomplished by estimating an upper bound for possible effects of the trade deficit on employment in manufacturing as noted earlier the trade deficits potential decrement to manufacturing output can be larger then the change in the manufactures trade balance between 2000 and 2003 that deficit in manufactures was 325 billion in 2000 and is running at about 400 billion pace for 2003 suggesting cumulative increase of about 75 billion over this threeyear span if we assume that this increase in the trade deficit in manufactures represents oneforone reduction in the demand for domestic manuf actured goods then at the 2003 level of gdp per worker of 102000 the 75 billion in lost domestic sales could translate into reduction of as much as 730000 domestic manufacturing jobs therefore perhaps as much as three fourths of the milli on lost jobs lost to weak demand is the result of the rise of the trade defi cit in this period of slack demand this 730000 jobs is however an upper bound and we must consider that there are other forces associated with the trade deficit that may lead to some positive effects on domestic manufacturing output and employment the overall trade deficit which increased about 100 billion between 2000 and 2003 occurs with like sized inflow of foreign capital such capital inflows tend to lower interest rates and provide stimulus to spending for interest rate sensitive activities such as housing and consumer durables spe nding stimulated in these areas of the economy will likely induce some increased spending on manufactured goods foreign and domestic also the generally lower price of imports tends to increase us real income inducing increased demand for all other goods foreign and domestic it is plausible that these effects could work to creat 100000 or more manufacturing jobs and would bring the estimate of impact down to 650000 jobs lost to the trade deficits rise since 2000 nevertheless it is likely fair to assume th at rising trade deficit in period of slack demand will largely come at the expense of domestic production and employment and as observed in the 19922000 period even at its maximum possible effect the impact of the trade deficit on employment in manufacturing in this more recent period is also much smaller than the effect of productivity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs16 the effect of productivity productivity growth however has not been constant with cumulative productivity increase of at least 11 between 2000 and 2003 real gdp per worker has likely in creased to about 102000 to produce the estimated 2003 output of 1500 billion at th is higher productivity level would require about 147 million workers th difference between 147 million and the 163 million calculated above is 16 million work ers and is the estimated contribution of productivity increases to overall job ss in the manufacturing sector since 2000 this tells us that since 2000 had there been reduction of demand for manufactured products whether due to rece ssion or trade deficits as much as 62 of the 26 million job loss would have likely occurred because of improved efficiency summarizing the discussion of this section it is far to early too tell whether portion of the fall in the output of th manufacturing sector since 2000 is consequence of structural reduction in the economys longterm demand for domestic manufactured goods that share has fallen from the peak levels reached in the 1970s and further decrement coul d be occurring we do know however that over the last two decades the domestic manufacturing share of real gdp has remained fairly steady therefore until proven otherwise the more credible assumption is that the recent weak dema nd for domestic manufactured goods is in part the lingering effect of the recent recession and the fairly tepid recovery that has followed and also the effect of the continued rise of the trade deficit at time when there was sizable economic slack the an alysis above suggests that these demand side forces can account for about 40 of the manufacturing jobs shed since 2000 the remaining 60 of the manufacturing j obs lost since 2000 are likely the result of rapid productivity increases that occurred ove r the subsequent three years this has meant that not only was there less output to produce due to w eakness of demand but also that it took significantly fewer wo rkers to produce that smaller output than would have been required only three years earlier looking to the future can demand keep pace with productivity the demandside forces of weak aggregate spending and large trade deficits need not be enduring because they can be allayed by macroecono mic policy rapid productivity increases however may well be an enduring feature of the economy and from the standpoint of the overall economic wellbeing not one policymakers would want to stop for the manufacturing sector the prospect of fading negative effects from the demand side means that it could po ssibly regain or surp ass its prerecession share of gdp but for employment it is not just question of demand the manufacturing sectors ability to reclaim st jobs will hinge importantly on the pace of productivity increase over the course of the ongoing economic expansion expectations for demand there are good reasons to expect that as the current economic expansion progresses the manufacturing sectors output will rise from its current low level but will it recl aim its prerecession share of real gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs17 employment in manufacturing can also be ex pected to rise along with rising sector output but will the 26 million jobs lost ce 2000 be reclaimed this report does not attempt to forecast what will happen but projections of pl ausible scenarios can give some insight into the shape and magnitude of the forces which will determine these outcomes the problems related to recession are exp ected to soon pass therefore the level and share of output the us manufact uring sector will likely achieve as the economic expansion proceeds will depe nd on one the economys demand for manufactured goods relative to nonmanuf actured goods and two the degree to which the forces that determine the trade balance alter the demand for domestic manufactured goods relative to foreign manufactured goods as mentioned above there is strong evidence that the economys spending share for manufactured goods has been permanently reduced but the likely pace of economic growth in the ongoing expansion is generally projected to be somewhat slower than was true in the previous expansion of particular im portance for domestic manufacturing in this regard is the prospect of less exuberant investment spending by businesses prime source of demand for manufacturing output however boost to the demand for ma nufactured goods may well come from the trade balance the real dollar exchange rate on tradeweighted basis has already fallen about 13 since 2002 and furt her depreciation is expected if this occurs it is probable that the trade deficit particularly the real trade deficit will soon stop rising and begin to fall such shift in spending from foreign to domestic output would likely give significant boost to the demand for domestic manufactured goods the likely coincidence of healthy paced economic expansion and decrease in the trade deficit suggest that the manufacturing sector could over the next three to four years return to n ear the 17 share of real gdp that has been typical in recent years of course any given percentage share of gdp will represent higher or lower level of real manufacturing output depending on the level of gdp at that point in time the faster the overall economy grows the greater will be the level of real manufacturing output for given share by manufacturing and the larger will be the level of employment associated with that share other factors equal how fast will the overall economy grow currently most forecasts for real economic growth fall in the 35 to 40 range proceeding c onservatively we will assume for this exercise that real economic growth will dvance at an average pace of 35 over the course of the current economic expansi on we will also assume that by 2007 the overall economy will have reached fu ll employment and that in 2007 the manufacturing sector has as occurred in the last expansion reached 17 share of real gdp expectations for productivity given 17 share of real gdp the level of employment in manufacturing will pend on the pace of productivity growth in the sector over the fouryear interval bein g considered here making an assumption about the nearterm path of productivity in manufacturin g is somewhat problematic due to the sizable variations in its rate of increase in recent years we know that during the 1982 to 1991 expansion productivity in the manufacturing sector had anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs18 average rate of increase of 28 du ring the1992 2000 expansion that rate increased substantially to 37 nd over th 1994 2000 subperiod productivity moved up still faster at 43 average nnual rate slowing to less than 20 in recessiondominated 2001 manufacturing pr oductivity came back strongly at 60 in 2002 and advanced at 43 pace in 2003 what pace through 2007 there is cons ensus among economists that the trend rate of productivity change has increased significantly over the pre1990s pace of near 30 but that trend rate is probably not as high as the 60 pace set in 2002 and probably somewhat slower then the brisk 43 pace of the booming late 1990s conservative but credible assumption fo r productivity growth in the manufacturing sector would seem to be trend ra increase of around 40 per year prospects for employment in manufacturing given the above assumptions what would be the implied vel of employment in the manufacturing sector in 2007 growing at 35 aver age annual pace real gdp in 2007 would be 112 trillion and manufacturings 17 share of that total woul d be approximately 19 trillion with productivity in manufact uring increasing at 40 annual pace the value of real gdp produced per wo rker in manufacturing would rise from 102000 in 2003 to about 118000 in 2007 divi ding the dollar value manufacturings assumed share of real gdp in 2007 by the estimated dollar value of the average workers contribution to real gdp in that year tells us that about 161 million workers would be needed that would be an increase of 14 million manufacturing jobs over the 2003 level nd mean that about 54 of the 26 million jobs lost between 2000 and 2003 would be re stored thus desp ite economic recovery and regaining typical share of real gdp the manufacturing sector would not re employ about 12 million workers if productivity in that sector advances at 4 per annum during the current expansion the question that might be asked is what share of real gdp would manufacturing have to reach by 2007 to reemploy the whole 26 million workers within the assumptions of this scenari the manufacturing sector would need to reach real output level of near 21 trilli on which translates to an 185 real gdp share as discussed above share of that size has not been reached in recent years but is probably not beyond reach if the demand for domestic manufactures gets sufficient boost from smaller trade deficit in the framework of this scenario if the trade deficit in manufactures fell by enough to boost demand for domestic products by 150 billion manufacturing employme nt would rise to 173 million in 2007 reclaiming the 26 million jobs lost between 2000 and 2003 while optimism about the trade deficit in the exercise above leads to more favorable results for manufacturing the ssumption of 4 annual average rate of productivity increase could be seen as overl conservative and some might judge that significantly faster rate is more likely this report does not venture to predict what the actual rate might be but it is illustrative to consider what the effect might be of plausible faster average productivity increas for instance consider the impact of assuming that productivity in manufacturing moves up at 50 rather than 40 over the next four years the outcome is that with 170 real gdp share 50 productivity growth leads to an employme nt level in manufact uring of about 155httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs19 17china probably comes to mind as an example of country many of whose industries are gaining comparative advantage over many us producers yet very large part of what china has gained in the united states has been at the expense of imports from other foreign producers in latin america and other asian nati ons for discussion of this point and other aspects of trade with china see the economic report of the president washington february 2004 pp 6568 million in 2 007 as compared to 161 million in the first scenario in this circumstance about 2 million of the 26 million lost jobs would not be reclaimed what level of demand fo r manufactures is needed to reclaim all 26 million jobs doing the same type of calculation as above tells us that the that manufacturings share of real gdp in 2007 w ould need to be about 190 that size share is well beyond recent experience as well but probably c ould be achieved if there was large enough reduction in the tr ade deficit in manufactures that would probably require trade defic it reduction of about 250 billion likelihood of alternative outcomes again these are only rough estimates but they do convey the relative importance and dynamic tension of demand and supply forces on the future level of em ployment in manufacturing in thinking about the actual future path of these severa l variables we can make some reasonable judgements about the most probable dir ection of error in the assumptions made above and perhaps narrow the ra nge of possible outcomes regarding productivity recent history w ould strongly suggest that productivity growth in the manufacturing sector is more likely to fall above than below 40 per annum most economists think the us economy has experienced substantial and likely long lasting increase in productivity and is unlikely to see any deceleration from this faster pace that productivity has grown more rapidly since 2000 than in the 1990s can be seen as limited evidence that the trend rate of productivity in manufacturing could be above the 40 assumption used in the first scenario regarding the trade deficit it seems likely that it will soon stop rising and perhaps see significant fall dollar depreciation that has already occurred combined with the prospect of further depreciation and accelerating economic growth abroad bode well for some turnaround in the trade deficit but fall on the scale suggested above is problematic neverthele ss sustained reduction of the trade deficit would present the best chance for more favorable output and employment outcomes in manufacturing that said falling trade deficit does not mean that particular industries will not s till face stiff foreign competition nd continue to lose market share and shed jobs most often these will be situations where comparative advantage is shifting to foreign sources of production and the domestic industry will continue to decline despite an expa nding economy and falling trade deficit17 finally regardless of their nation of or igin it is unlikely that consumers will allocate substantially larger share of thei r spending to manufactured goods than has been true in recent decades the trend in the us and other industrial economies inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs20 recent years has been relative steadiness of that share if that share does change the longterm evidence indicates that the movement will most likely be down taken together these probable tendencies suggest that it is optimistic to expect manufacturing real output to greatly exceed 17 or for employment to increase by much more than 15 million workers over the next few years given the uncertainties for productivity and the trade balance the mo re probable direction to correct for error in this estimate is down rather than up policy options there are two classes of policy responses to deindustrialization those that are an attempt to arrest the process and those that are an attempt to ameliorate the process policies to arrest include industrial policy to promote specific industries trade policy to protect specific industrie s technology policy to support growth of productive knowledge and macroeconomic policy to reduce the trade deficit polices to ameliorate include all policies that attempt to support and facilitate the adjustment of workers hurt by the often di sruptive process of economic change in market economy these include unemploym ent insurance adjustment assistance support for retraining and wage insurance arresting deindustrializations advance in considering policies to arrest the pr ocess of deindustria lization the question that needs to be asked is should this pro cess be stopped we have already noted that this is process evident over several decades to varying degrees in nearly all industrial countries it would largely seem to be market driven process that occurs along with rising prosperity and may be seen as na tural evolution for successful economies traditional or preindustria l economy will avoid the disruptions and change that market forces cause but this stability comes without the steadily rising living standard brought by sustained economic growth such growth is the hallmark of the modern industrial market based economy it is process of creative destruction however where advan ce seldom comes without costs yet there can be market failure th at is for some reason markets are not performing efficiently and resources ar being under or over allocated to some activities where market failure occurs it is possible for public policy to craft an improvement of the economic outcome that is most often easier said then done the issue of economic policy responses to arrest deindustr ialization is most usefully explored in the context of the three broad economic forces that have been acting upon the manufacturing sector domestic demand both structural and cyclical forces trade both the level of trade nd the trade deficit and productivity growth response to changed demand

temporary and will most often be reversed during the s ubsequent expansion macroeconomic policy has done much to forestall the occurrence of downturns and min imize their severity but recessions have not been eliminated nor are they likely to be soon as recurring part of the economic landscape recessions to large degree must be endured while impr ovement of the effectiveness of stabilization policy is an appropriate goal as prac tical matter there is proba bly little more macroeconomic policy could do at this time to help impr ove the state of the domestic manufacturing sector through revival of aggregate spending large tax cuts are already in place and monetary policy has been strongly stimula tive positive response to these policies often comes with significant lag but it does occur so too with the longerterm changes in the structure of demand economywide there is economic rationale for trying to slow or reverse the slow shift of expenditures away from manufactured goods and toward services the economys task is to respond in the most efficient wa to the changing preferences of consumers not to preserve the position of any particul ar activity such as manufacturing boosting the economys creative forces some might argue that to some degree supply creates its own dema nd that is the development of new productive techniques new pr oducts and new industries will generate new demand for manufactured goods the generation of steady stream of such innovations has been an important strength of the us economy however the argument proceeds without some degree of nurturing thr ough public support these valuable economic outcomes will not occur or will not occur at the optimal scale if left to the workings of the private marketplace alone the class of policies used to support such special activities or industries is called industrial policy so may assert that industrial policy could have positive effects on the size and scope of the domestic manufacturing sector through its boosting the pace of generation of new and desirable goods and of more efficient production techniques most popular variants of industrial po licy are not effective from an economic perspective selection crite ria based on high value dded linkage effects growth potential or countering industria l policies of other countries are flawed because they are not aimed at correcting any actual market failure and if pursued will most often reduce econo mic welfare not increase it examination of actual industrial policie s undertaken in japan and europe and driven by such criteria suggests that they achieved mixed success at best18 an economically sound case for one varian t of industrial polic can be made if externalities benefits that accrue to parties external to the firm

considerable amount of economic evidence s shown that the social rate of return to rd for variety of research projects often greatly exceeds the private rate of return suggesting that too little

the level of investment undertaken by firms could be as little as 25 of the level what is economically optimal20 while clearly good for the overall ec onomy and providing the prospect of benefit to

leve l of trade through the removal of various manmade barriers to trade such efforts are unlikely to adversely affect the domestic manufacturing sector as whole there will be positive effect s on some industries and negative effects on other industries if the economy is to import more then it must also export more to earn the foreign exchange needed to pay for imports it can export more goods

prices and reduced array of goods available to the cons umer if trading part ners retaliate with the elevation of their own barriers the costs go higher still economic theory and evidence indicates that trade protection will most often be very costly means by which to help the domes tic manufacturing sector22 reducing the trade deficit as discussed above trade deficits do not lead to net output or employment loss economy wide but they do shift the composition of output and employment and this shift in composition will likely have an adverse effect on the domestic manufacturing sector this adverse effect in non recession periods however is likely much smalle r than commonly believed economic analysis also indicates that trade deficits confer benef its on the economy the capital inflow that is the necessary counterpart of trade deficit serves to increase the flow of saving available to the economy and has favorable effect s on activities typically financed by saving flows such as busin ess investment and re sidential construction most recently the trade deficits of the 1993 2000 period allowed the us economy to undertake rates of investment that exceeded the flow of domestic saving availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs24 23 in the 1990s we saw rise in public saving as budget deficits fell however this was more than offset by the strong rise in investment spending at that time accordingly the trade deficit increased because government can di rectly control only one piece of the saving investment relationship it can only exert forc on this process that pushes in the desired direction but it can not guarantee the eventual outcome this is not unlike other forms of macroeconomic policy that generally work by biasing economic activity in particular directionto finance that investment higher investment will have the positive effect of boosting the economys rate of economic growth and boosting future living standards of course trade deficit can also be means of boosting current consumption this occurred with the trade deficits of the 1980s as government and households boosted spending at the expense of saving and used an inflow of foreign saving the flip side of the trade deficit to support high er rate of consumption both public and private not higher rate of i nvestment in this case there was added investment or boost in produc tive capital and thus increase in future output would be forthcoming in this situation trade ficit is merely means of swapping future consumption for current consumption in either case the borrowing from foreigners that trade deficit reflects will have to be paid back in the first circumstan ce debt repayment can be taken from the added output the higher investment produces and not necessarily require that future consumption be reduced if the boost in economic growth is large enough the debt could be repaid and future consumption increased in the second circumstance debt repayment comes at the expense of future consumption this could also be an economically acceptable outcome depending on how one views the reason for boosting current consumption was it the result of free and informed choice by market participants or the result of flawed economic policy our tolerance for trade deficits and the problems they cause for domestic manufacturing may be differentially affected by our valuation of these alternative motivations for those deficits particularly if public policy through its spending and saving ie expenditure and revenue decisions s played role in the process if smaller trade deficit is judged the appropriate goal economic policy can be used to reach that goal to reduce the trade deficit the economy must save more andor invest less if it is also judged prudent not to achieve this reduction at the expense of domestic investment then the economys rate of savi ng will have to be raised this is the same thing as saying the economys rate of consumption will have to be reduced higher saving can come from the private sectorbusinesses and households or from the government by the reduction of budget deficits economic policys ability to affect the private saving rate is problematic but macroeconomic policy can certainly change the government saving rate smaller budget deficits reduce the governments use of the nation s saving and budget surpluses are an addition to the nations saving therefore policies that move the budget away from deficit and toward surplus other things unchanged23 will tend to raise the saving rate and reduce the trade deficit this will occur of course as depreciating exchange rate works to change the composition of domestic outputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs25 24the trade deficit will also be reduced if fo reign lenders curtail their accumulation of us assets in this case however there would be increase in us saving so in this circumstance the adjustment must occur thr ough higher domestic interest rates and lower domestic investment the favorable effect of the smaller trade deficit on trade sensitive sectors is counterbalanced by the adverse effect on domestic interest sensitive sectors the dollar depreciation seen since early 2002 is most likely being driven by shift away from dollar denominated assets by foreign investor s because the economy is now operating with considerable slack the adverse effects of this capital outflow have been negligible for fuller discussion see crs report rl31032 the us trade deficit causes consequences and cures by craig k elwell 25the economic effects of increased productivity are qualitatively the same as higher level of trade both give the country more effici ent ways to acquire the goods that it wants stimulates export sales and dampens import spending and in the process likely boosting the output and employment of the us manufacturing sector24 response to increased productivity to the degree that industrialization and falling em ployment in manufacturing are the result of increased productivity there is economically sound r eason for trying to abate this process productivity improvement is the engine that drives longterm economic growth and undergirds rising standard of living us ing policy to slow it would be an action that would make the united states and the world economy poorer then it otherwise would be from the standpoint of overall economic wellbeing it is best to use as few resources capital and labor as possible to produce any given output smaller commitment of resources in one endeavor frees resources to be used in other useful endeavors and thereby enlarges the output available to the economy productivity increases will also translate into higher wages for workers and the increase in wages can occur without any loss of co mpetitiveness to lower waged foreign workers if you produce 10 times more output per hour as foreign workers you can be paid 10 times more per hour without economic disadvantage25 the economic concern with productivity is not that it is too fast rather is it rising as fast as it should are there ma rket failures that are retarding productivity growth the discussion above about id ea creation suggests there might be ameliorating deindustrializations costs economists view deindustria lization as largely characteristic of the normal evolution of maturing market economies and most often accompanied by increased economic efficiency and improvement of overall economic wellbeing however economic progress in market economy does not occur wit hout costs the recurring malady of recession and shortterm une mployment seems to be an unshakeable aspect of market economys process of wealth creation workers laid off due to recession often reclaim their old job but while unemployed their economic well being is generally reduced httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs26 living with creativedestruction in addition to periodic shortterm instability markets do their job of creating wealth through process of creative destruction market for ces prompted by changing consumer demand advances in technology and productive efficiency or shifting comparative advantage between nations relentlessly allocat and reallocate the productiv resources of land capital and labor to more efficient uses from ss efficient uses using resources to more efficient applications creates wealth but redirecting resources out of less efficient uses is often destructive force disrupting the lives of workers in less efficient activities whose jobs are eliminated in this case unlike cyclical unemployment workers will not be recalled to their old jobs and must often embark on costly process of adjustment jobs are creat ed and destroyed but the new jobs will unlikely employ but fraction of those whose job was destroyed and for many of those who have lost jobs the adjustment to the next best alternative will be slow and costly new skills may be needed move to new location may be necessary and for many reduced wage may be required for reemployment balancing equity and efficiency labor market disruptions are new problems and most advanced industria l economies have veloped policies to provide some degree of support for those di splaced by recession or the ever present churning of market forces th policy challenge in this regard continues to be to craft initiatives that equitably co mpensate and assist those who are displaced while also serving efficiency by encouraging timely adjustment to reemployment establishing the right balance between equity and efficiency remains matter of controversy however generous compensation without suffici ent incentive for adjustment tends to rigidify labor markets and diminish economic efficiency this has been common criticism of economies in the euro area their compensation to unemployed workers is relatively generous and the incentives for adjustment to new job relatively low this has the consequence it is argued th at the pace of economic growth in these countries is subpar in contrast less ge nerous compensation with stronger incentives for adjustment can lead to more flui d labor markets and boost in the pace of economic growth but will also tend to in crease economic inequality and degrade the social environment this would be the european critique of the american economy one that achieves high degree of economic efficiency but without proper degree of economic fairness leading to wide ning gap between rich and poor and between the skilled and less skilled which is the better approach to balancing equity and efficiency is not judged in this report but to better inform that judgement it is perhaps useful to consider some matters related to the level of support given displaced workers and the rising level of risk of lost job they may face labor market volatility and th level of social insurance it can be argued that in the united states and ot her industrial economies the post world war ii economic order was built upon an explicit or implicit social bargain workers would accept the periodic disrup tions associated with the market economys cyclical and destructive traits that are inherent to its rapid creation of wealth and risinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32350crs27 26for further discussion of the issue of public versus private provision of unemployment insurance see crs report rl32194 job loss causes and policy implications by marc labonte 27for current legislative issues about unemployment insurance see crs report 95742 unemployment benefits legislative issues in the 108th congress by celinda franco 28this concept of risk encompasses both the likely incidence job loss the duration of unemployment and the level of possible adjustment costs 29see dani rodrik has globalization gone to far institute for international economics washington dc 1998 pp 4966 30 to offset the tendency for higher level of unemployment support to impede timely adjustment to new employment even if at wer wage some have argued that there needs to be greater use of wage insurance that is payment to the worker by government that would compensate the worker for sizabl percentage of the difference between lower wage in new job and the higher wage in the old job this would not be permanent subsidy lasting only long enough to assure firm reattachment to new job and to enhance the prospect of being on steady track to high er wages see lori kletzer and robert litan prescription to relieve worker anxiety institute for international economics policy brief 012 feb 2001 economic wellbeing if thos disruptions were cushione d by government provision of various types of economic support to see them through these rough spots public support rather than workers themselves buyin g insurance against the risk of job loss is called for because the market failure caused by the problem of adverse selection will prevent the private mark et from providing an adequate level of coverage26 while the welfare state may have changed in form and extent over the years these worker support policies remain an integral piece of the modern industrial economy27 the level of economic s upport an unemployed or displaced worker receives can be seen as form of social insurance agai nst the risk of job loss and its associated costs that fluctuating and ever chur ning market economy exposes workers to28 the argument can be made that if the velocity of market churning has increased in recent years due to the combined or individual effects of rapidly rising level of international trade acceler ating productivity advance or more quickly shifting consumer demand then the volatility of the labor market and the risk of unemployment that each worker faces has also increased some observers believe higher level of risk would warrant higher level of economic support this does seem to be the case among oe cd countries for exposure to the risk associated with international trade where there is fairly strong correlation between openness and levels of government support expenditures29 there is conceptual reason for increased risk from other market forces to be seen any less deserving of increased public support30 finally remember that most often market forces set in motion positivesum process they cause labor market disrup tion but they have so created increased economywide income that exceed s the associated costs therefore it is possible to compensate adversely affected workers and still leave the winners better off than they were before the impact of the market force
