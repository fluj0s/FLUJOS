as us strategic comp etitor administration officials faced an early test in april 2001 when chinese na val aviation jet collided with us navy reconnaissance plane over the south chin sea after september 11 though us officials came to see beijing as potential ally in the fight against global terrorism while prc officials saw the antiterrorism campaign as chance to improve relations with washington and perhaps ga in policy concessions on issues important to beijing such as on us arms sales to taiwan us antiterror priorities led some to suggest that cooperation against terro rism could serve as new strategic framework for sinous relations many however saw complex ities and pitfalls on this road to cooperation for one thing the prcs definitions of what constitutes terrorism are significantly more expansive than those of the united states and include any political expression of independence both violently and peacefu lly expressed by tibetans uighur muslims taiwanese and others since the united states maintained that the anti terror campaign must not be used to pe rsecute these groups sinous cooperation already faced early limits also us do minance of the antiterrorism effort made washington suddenly appear to be more threatening competitor for influence in central asia where beijing had been maki ng successful political inroads in recent years and in pakistan with which beijing has had traditionally close relations moreover although the antiterror cam paign appeared likely to overshadow more traditional uschina bilateral problems it seemed unlikely to eliminate them sensitivities remained over longstanding issues such as chinas abusive record on human rights issues and on accusations that it routinely violates its nonproliferation commitments increasing the possibility that weapons of mass destruction can fall into the hands of terrorists the prc remained suspicious about the accidental nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade in 1999 concerned about what they see as an encircling us presence in asia and wary of us technological advantages and global influence taiwan remained the most sensitive and potentially explosive issue in sinous relations w ith us officials increasingly supportive of taiwans security and its quest for inte rnational space and prc officials adamant about reunifying taiwan under the one china policy the 107th congress was legislatively active on issues involving china enacting pl 10710 authorizing the president to seek observer status for taiwan in the world health assembly and

relations in the 107th congress policy developments 20012002 uneven relations since 1989 since 1989 us relations with the pe oples republic of china prc have followed an uneven course with modest improvement s overshadowed by various recurring difficulties and setbacks longstanding bilateral difficulties have included us problems with the prcs worsening hum an rights record growing tensions over the prcs southern military buildup opposite taiwan and taiwans political status and continued controversy ove r allegations of chinese pr oliferation of weapons to unstable regimes punctuating these have been periodic crises including the prcs provocative livefire missile exercises in the taiwan strait in 199596 allegations of chinese espionage and leaking of us military secrets in 19971998 the accidental nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade in may 1999 and the collision of prc jet fighter with us navy reconnaissance plane over the south china sea in 2001 all these pr oblems have occurred against steady drumbeat of growing mutual suspicion over the perceived security threat that each poses to the other the george h w bush administration spent its four years from 1989 1992 trying to protect uschina relations nd field policy of engagement with china against mounting congressional opposition in the wake of the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown the clinton adminis tration initially adopted markedly different position stating that the united st ates should use its economic leverage to promote democracy and change in the prc but like his predecessor president clinton also came to favor policy of engagement with china policy that clinton officials came to call strategic partnership the overall engagement policies that both the bush and clinton administrations pursued continued to be criticized by segment of american observers including members of congress who increasingly came to see the prc as americas principal longterm security threat upon assuming office in january 2001 the george w bush administration promised tougher approach than that of either of his predecessors describing the prc as strategic competitor of the united states bush administration officials indicated they would broaden the focus of american policy in asia concentrating more on japan and other us allies and deemphasizing sinous relations the administration faced an early test of its policy on april 1 2001 when chinese jet fighter collided with us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane over the south china sea forcing the us plane to make an emergency landing at military base on chinas hainan island in tense stando ff the prc held the 24member us crew for eleven days and required the us military to dismantle the ep3 and ship it back to the united states rather than repair it and fly it back httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31729crs2 1 for more on the 16th party congress decisi ons see crs report rl31661 chinas new leadership lineup implications for us policy by kerry dumbaugh the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks ag ainst the united states appeared to affect the policy calculus for both washington and beijing the bush administration appeared to see the potential for sinous cooperation against global terrorism as priority and us officials downplayed other key differences and problems in the relationship evident during much of 2001 us officials sought prc antiterrorism support with countries in the region and in initiatives put before the united nations security council where the prc is perm anent member but bush administration officials also suggested that only limited c ooperation would be possible and in the intervening months since september 11 the president and others in his administration continued with policy appr oach that appeared tougher toward the prc and less solicitous of beijings views in response to these tougher bush administration initiatives beijing took what many view as surprisingly low profile although prc leaders were thought to be wary of the precedents being set by newly assertive us policy toward taiwan and an expanded us presence in central and south asia their statements on these and other us initiatives remained muted in fact some suggest that prc leaders appeared anxious to assure smooth sino us relations in 200120 02 going out of their way to be nonprovocative despite greater us assertiveness it may be that this lowprofile prc approach was the result of an ongoing leadership transition with which beijing was and remains preoccupied1 from november 8 14 2002 for instance the communist party held its 16th party congress during which it selected hu jintao as the new party secretary named new 24member politburo and new ninemember standing committee and made substantive changes to the party constitution some observers have suggest ed that beijings views toward us policies may undergo some change once the l eadership transition is completed later in 2003 key events in bilateral relations us reconnaissance plan eprc fighter collision uschina relations faced an early crisis during the george w bush administration on april 1 2001 when us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane and chinese f8 jet fighter collided in the air over the south china sea the chinese fighter was reported to have crashed and the damaged us plane accompanied by the second chinese fighter made an emer gency landing at military base on chinas hainan island us officials claimed that standard military procedure calls for the planes crew to destroy sensitive information and technologies prior to landing in such instances but it is unclear to what extent the crew was able to do this the chinese military proceeded to hold the 24 u s crew members for 11 days and the plane for longer period as both sides disputed the facts questions of international law and each others obligations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31729crs3 us officials stated that the ep3 was conducting r outine solo reconnaissance mission approximately 5060 miles off the chinese coast when it was intercepted and followed by two f8 chinese jet fighters us military officials say that such reconnaissance missions have been routin for decades including interception by chinese fighters but that chinas interceptions had grown increasingly aggressive in 2001 resulting in us diplomatic protests according to the us account in this particular case one of the chinese figh ters swooped under the us plane and then collided with it perhaps as the slowermoving us plane was banking to turn us officials contend that in such emergency situations international law allows for the plane to remain inviolate sovereign territo ry of the owner country the united states asked the chinese to respect the integrity of the plane and demanded its return as well as the safe and immediate return of the crew while apparently agreeing that the us plane was approximately 50 miles off the chinese coast chinese officials claimed that the us plane had violated chinas airspace and caused the accident that resulted in the crash of the f8 chinese fighter they claimed that the plane landed at th chinese military base without permission and they rejected the us assertion th at the plane could not be boarded under international law several days after the incident the chinese military permitted us officials to begin sporadic meetings with the planes crew members going into the weekend of april 78 2001 bush adminis tration officials expressed cautious optimism that crew members would be released within few days but the chinese media and highranking chinese officials began insisting on us apology and implying that this was prerequisite for an further discussions about the fate of the crew and plane us officials insisted that apology was warranted because the collision was purely an accident and the us plane was operating lawfully in international airspace on april 12 2001 the prc released th 24 american crew members it had been holding since april 1 2001 the crew s release came after secretary of state colin powell expressed regret and sorrow ove r the apparent death of the chinese f8 pilot which caused the collision and after the us ambassador to china retired admiral joseph prueher delivered letter to chinese officials which stated that the us government was very sorry that th us plane entered chinas airspace and made an emergency landing without recei ving verbal clear ance an account by xinhua an official chinese media outlet continued to adhere to chinas line that the us plane had rammed the chinese jet fighter many observers believed that the heart of the ep3 standoff ultimately concerned the status of the island of taiwan which beijing claims as part of china one important function of us military rec onnaissance flights off southern china is presumed to be monitoring the systematic military buildup china has been conducting on its coast opposite ta iwan chinese officials ve been critical of us policy toward taiwan and vocal in insisting on chinas right to use force against taiwan initially many us observers believed that uschina relations would suffer lasting damage as result of the ep3 crisis perhaps jeopardizing chinas normal trade relations ntr st atus and its chances of success in its bid to host the 2008 olympic games ultimately however the incident appeared to have lasting affect on the bilateral relationshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31729crs4 september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 against the world trade center the pentagon and the plane that crashed in rura l pennsylvania appeared to alter some of the policy calculations for both washington and beijing bush administration officials quickly focused on the antiterrorism campaign as top us priority in light of which other us foreign policy objectiv including those associated with sino us relations appeared secondary us officials sought prc support with countries in the region and in initiatives put before the united nations security council where the prc is permanent member and holds veto power beijing for its part appeared to see the us antiterrorism effort as chance to improve sinous relations and demonstrate that china could be responsible global player the initial prospects for mutual support and cooperation were encouraging in message to president bush on sept ember 11 2001 prc president jiang zemin condemned the terrorist attacks and ffered condolences according to the white house in phone call with president bush the following day jiang promised to cooperate with the united states to comb at terrorism the prc also voted with others in the security council fo r resolution 1368 2001 which among other things unequivocally condemned the terrori st attacks and expressed its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks on september 20 party secretary jiang zemin declared th at the prc offered unconditional support in the antiterrorism campaign and the prcs foreign minister tang jiaxuan reportedly assured president bush late in september that beijing would share intelligence with the united states on september 24 2001 group of counter terrorism experts from the prc arrived fo r meetings with their counterparts in washington many began to speculate that the us antiterrorism effort could serve as new framework for uschina relations but in other ways the prc sent mixed signals early on about its support for the antiterrorism campaign strong statemen ts of unconditional s upport were qualified by later expressions of concern about us or nato military action faultfinding with us intelligence information and warnin gs that civilians should not be targets of allied military action also the prc strongly preferred that global antiterror efforts be conducted through the auspices of the security council where it had voice and not purely through us unilateral effort or coalition of us allies the prc itself has been the target of bombings sabotage and other terrorist attacks primarily thought to be committe d by small groups of muslim extremists largely uighurs based in xinjiang in chinas far northwest for years there have been unconfirmed reports that some muslim activists were based in afghanistan receiving training from the taliban reports that appeared to gain more credence late in 2001 when it was revealed that number of uighurs from xinjiang had been captured in afghanistan prc officials also have strong connecti ons to and influence with pakistan which in the past had aided the taliban government and which became key country in usled antiterrorism fforts after september 11th in addition beijing also is an active member in what is now the shanghai cooperative organization

executions after summary trials torture and other cruel punishment and th ere continued to be lack of adequate medical care arbitrary arrest and detention judicial corruption denial of fair trial and other arbitrary official interferences with individual privacy and liberty the report also cited major flaws and deficiencies in chinas criminal procedure law it stressed that th judiciary is not independent despite constitutional provisions to the contrary and that judicial and police corruption is endemic in china however the repor t said there were ongoing government efforts to correct systemic weaknesses in the legal and judicial systems that there was growing public debate in china over the inadequacies in the legal system and that an increasing number of citizens were seeking redress through the courts and making use of the new legal re medies available to them but the george w bush administration appeared to shift from the traditionally broad and generalized us approach

priority for the bush white house in 20012002 it did receive action in the 107th congress7 religious freedom membership data on religious organizations in the prc suggested that the number of religious adhere nts in china continued to grow in 20012002 despite rigorous restrictions on religious prac tice put into place in 1994 among other things prc restrictions continued to prohibit evangelical activities and required all religious groups to register with the relig ious affairs bureau rab registration has required religious groups to reveal th names and addresses of members their contacts in china and abroad and details about leadership activities and finances churches and other religious institutions seen conducting public services in large chinese cities have been among these r egistered and therefore legal groups groups whose members have refused to register with the rab are known as unofficial or house churches during the 107th congress the prc intensified further the campaign against these independent religious groups that it had begun in 1999 when american news accounts began to give wide c overage to reports that th government was arresting religious practitioners and giving them harsh jail sentences on july 22 1999 for instance the government outlawed falun gong spiritual movement in china said to combine buddhist and taoist meditation prac tices with series of exercises the november 6 1999 peoples daily suggested that falun gong presented the greatest danger to the nation that had ever existed in its 50year history in the intervening years the government continued to arrest falun gong leaders impose harsh prison sentences and close the sects facilities as consequence of falun gong the national peoples congre ss on october 30 1999

october 2002 at the end of the summit meeting and on number of occasions since then prc officials have emphasized that china had long supported nonnuclear korean peninsula but beijing stopped short of

make the prc potentially important but uncertain part ner in us policy efforts on the korean peninsula prc support for nonnuclear north korea is thought to be genuine since an unpredictable north korean regime armed with nuclear weapons could spur regional nuclear arms race among non nuclear powers along chinas periphery such as taiwan japan and south korea in addition international response to aggression by desperate nucleararmed north korea could prompt assistance to pyongyang by the prc the only country with mutual defense treaty with north korea the prc therefore has ample cause to seek to curb north korean nuclear aspirations and to contain its difficult ally but collapse of the fragile north korean regime could have qually unhappy consequences for the prc leading to floods of

united states meetings that were deliberately kept lowkey but which ne vertheless offended chinese leaders prompted by congressional efforts the clinton wh ite house on october 31 1997 announced it would designate special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department primary function of which would be to encourage dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama

ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by broadly representative nominating committee the basic law of the hong kong special continuedcongressional interest in tibet during the 107th congress remained strong the incoming george w bush administration in 2001 announced that it would retain the position of special coordinator for tibetan issues within the state department and named to the post paula dobr iansky under secretary of state for global affairs to date the highestranking us official to hold that position in addition to including number of provisions on tibet in the foreign relations authorization act of fy20022003 pl 107228 the 107th congress considered legislation to support the aspirations of the tibetan people to safeguard their own culture and identity hr 1779 as well as various resolutions rela ting to human rights in tibet and prc dialogue with the dalai lama32 hong kong after the smooth transfer of hong kongs sovereignty from british to chinese july 1 1997 hong kong began to face uni political challenges that it had not encountered when the territory was sovere ign british colony having been granted high degree of autonomy from beijin g for selfgovernance hong kongs policymakers themselves have had to deal with issues as wideranging as social welfare programs housing industrial comp etitiveness and edu cation all of which have been subject to an increasingly dive rse public debate hong kong officials at times have been criticized as insufficiently vigilant in protecting hong kongs interests against encroachment real or imagined by beijing during the 107th congress series of unpopular government decisions in hong kong contributed to increased public criticism and di saffection as result sp irited debate in hong kong focused on number of issues proposed antisedition laws article 23 of hong kongs constitution the basic law require s the government to enact laws to prohibit acts of treason successi on sedition or theft of state secrets although it does not specify timetable or deadline for such laws after fiveyear hiatus th hong kong government issued proposal for an antisedition w in october 2002 and opened the issue for public commentary with legislative action expected early in 2003 many fear such law will make it easier for beijing to pressure hong kong to crack down on politically innocent acts eroding hong kongs current favor able human rights environment government accountability hong kongs chief executive is not elected by universal suffrage and its civil service are career employees with lifetime contracts33 this led many to charge thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31729crs23 33 continued administrative re gion of the prc chapter iv article 45 34 specific intention of the hong kong policy act was to permit the us government to treat hong kong differently from the way it treats the rest of china in us law thus the united states has an extradition treaty with h ong kong but not with china maintains liberalized export control regime with hong kong but rest rictive one with china and gives hong kong permanent mostfavoredna tion mfn trade status or normal trade relations as it is now known but gave that status to china separately upon its accession to the wto 35 section 586 foreign operations appr opriations act for fy2002 pl

attempted to address this issue in mid 2002 by appointing new tier of non civilservice ministers to head government departments facto cabinet for the chief executive which ostensibly owes him political allegiance the new ministerial system remains controversial hong kongbeijing relations prior to 1997 hong kong thought that its interests would best be served by insulating it as much as possible from the prc including assuring the integrity of the hong kong border protecting hong k ong from prc labor migration and maintaining separate currency and financial system but by the 107th congress growing view in hong kong was that these protections were increasingly artificial that they were hampering trade and other contacts and that hong kong may be losing business opportunities in the prc to less constrained global competitors pressure quietly built throughout 20012002 for easing travel and other restrictions along th hong kongchina border current us policy toward hong kong is set out in the ushong kong policy act of 1992 pl 102383 in addition to have required an nnual us government report on hong kongs conditions throug h march 2000 this act allows the united states to treat hong kong differently from the way it treats china predicated upon an autonomous hong kong under the act the president has the power to halt agreements or take other steps if he termines that beijing is interfering unduly in hong kongs affairs34 the 107th congress amended the us hong kong policy act to extend the annual reporting requirement through march 200635 in addition on february 7 2002 the house task force on hong kongs transition created at the behest of speaker newt gingrich in 1997 filed its ninth repor t assessing conditions in hong kong following the transition to prc sovereignty36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31729crs24 us policy trends during the 107th congress the bush administr ation deemphasized uschina relations broadened the focu s of us policy in asia and notably increased and clarified us support for taiwan while it remained receptive to sinous dialogue the bush white house appeared willing to ignore the views of the prc and occasionally of us allies in pursuit of us interests this more assertive policy approach was departure from previous us administrations which had favored policies of engagement with the prc and ambiguity toward taiwan after the tensions over the collision of us and chinese military aircraft early in 2001 beijing responded to this us appr oach with marked reduction of anti american rhetoric while the prc continued to object to us arms sales to taiwan visas for taiwan officials and sancti ons on prc companies its objections were reticent and appeared crafted to avoid di srupting usprc relations as result prc and us officials were able to m eet and cooperate on va rious matters in 2001 2002 even in the midst of continuing real differences on taiwan human rights and other issues some credited this notable improvement in usprc relations with the more assertive policy approach of the bu sh administration by remaining open to bilateral dialogue but lowering the priority it gave to uschina relations they argued the white house reduced the leverage beijing had over the us policy process and forced beijing to be more pr oactive in seeking productive relationship with the united states but others attributed the improvement in relations to variety of factors while the us approach may be one they say others include the international realignments brought about by the antiterror campaign and the effort to disarm iraq the ongoing generational leadership transition in china mutual prc us interests in nonnuclear and stable korean penins ula and an increasing prc focus on its considerable domestic economic and social challenges in any event many observers say th at the purposeful pragmatism behind the us approach in 20012002 has lowered th temperature in what had become heated american political bate since 1989 over the direc tion of us china policy according to these observers the current pproach appears to have charted an uneasy middle territory between the three different camps into which the us policy community had sorted itself over sinou s policy after the tiananmen square crackdown those camps are engagement caution and threat described below engagement the engagement approach toward the prc which dominated us policy since the nixon administration including in the george h w bush and william clinton administrations underlying this approach is belief that trends in china are moving inexorably in the right direction that is the prc is becoming more economically interdependent with the international community and therefore will have greater stake in pursuing stab international ec onomic relationships they contrast this behavior favorably with that of disruptive states such as iraq or afghanistan those who are not part of the international system and who may support the kind of global terrorism that struck the united states on september 11 2001 some also believe that greater wea lth in the prc will push chinese society in directions that will develop materially betteroff more educated and cosmopolitan populace that will over time pre ss its government for greater politicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31729crs25 pluralism and democracy therefore accord ing to this view us policy should seek to work more closely with the prc in order to encourage these positive longterm trends some proponents of the engagement approach f ear that viewing the prc as threat is selffulfilling prophecy that could promote possible breakup of the prc with potentially disastrous po licy consequences for us interests caution american proponents of what might be called cautious policy toward the prc stress that beijing officials still view the world as statecentered competitive environment where power is re spected and interdependence counts for little this group sees prc leaders as deter mined to use all means at their disposal to increase their nations wealth and power they suggest that prc leaders may be biding their time and conforming to many international norms as strategy until china builds its economic strength and can take more unilateral action once it succeeds with economic modernization this argument holds beijing will be less likely to curb its narrow nationalistic or other ambitions because of international constraints or sensitivities threat third and more frontational american pproach has been based on the premise that the prc under its current form of government is inherently threat to us interests and that the chinese political system needs to change dramatically before the united states s any real hope of reaching constructive relationship with the prc according to this approach beijings communist leaders are inherently incapable of longterm positive ties with the united states rather beijing seeks to erode us power and arm us enemies in the region despite the statements of support for the us antite rrorism campaign according to this view the prcs repeated violations of its nonproliferation co mmitments have actually contributed to strengthening and arming nati ons that harbor global terrorists us policy should focus on mechanisms to change the prc from within while maintaining vigilant posture to deal with disruptive prc foreign policy actions in asian and world affairs key 107th congress actions and legislation relating to china us commissions on china in the year 2000 the 106th
