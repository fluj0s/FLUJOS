policy division may 26 2006 abstract this report highlights major elements of the massachusetts legislation and raises issues that congress and other observers may consider as details of the states health reform plan are worked out during implementation order code rs22447 may 26 2006 crs report for congress received through the crs web the massachusetts health reform plan brief overview april grady analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447 in april 2006 massachusetts passed legislation that aims to achieve nearuniversal health insurance coverage by expanding medicaid and state childrens health insurance program schip eligibility providing premium subsidies for certain individuals and mandating the purchase of insurance for those who can afford it to make private health insurance plans more affordable and accessible it modifies state insurance laws eg it merges the states nongroup and small group markets and creates public entity called the connector to serve as clearinghouse for the purchase of insurance by small employers and individuals who are not offered subsidized insurance by large employer to pay for the legislation the state will redirect some existing medicaid funds that are used to reimburse health care providers primarily hospitals for treating uninsured and other patients who generate uncompensated care costs it will also obtain additional federal medicaid and schip dollars using new state general fund appropriations and revenues from employers that do not offer health insurance another significant source of funding while not necessarily flowing through state coffers is the mandate that requires individuals to purchase insurance or face financial penalties over time the state expects to redirect additional funds from uncompensated care reimbursement to other uses eg premium subsidies as its uninsured rate declines however the legislation continues to provide significant support for hospitals and other providers this report highlights major elements of the massachusetts legislation and raises issues that congress and other observers may consider as details of the states health reform plan are worked out during implementation it will not be updated background the states low uninsured rate and its ability to redirect and augment existing financial resources were two key factors working in favor of the recently passed massachusetts health reform legislation input and support from across the political spectrum also played an important role congressional research service the library of congress crs2 in terms of its uninsured population massachusetts has lower percentage of uninsured residents than most states according to data from the census bureaus current population survey cps 117 of massachusetts residents were uninsured for all of 2004 compared to the national average of 1571 based on its own biennial survey the state estimates an even lower uninsured figure massachusetts spends about 2 billion annually in combined state and federal dollars to support health care providers primarily hospitals that treat uninsured and other patients who generate uncompensated care costs2 much of this funding is provided through medicaid joint federalstate program that finances health coverage for certain lowincome individuals as well as disproportionate share hospital dsh payments for hospitals that serve large numbers of lowincome and medicaid patients hoping to put existing funds to better use the state obtained federal permission under its medicaid waiver3 to redirect approximately 13 billion in dsh and other medicaid payments that largely benefit hospitals toward plan to reduce its uninsured rate4 the massachusetts health reform legislation whose details still must be approved by the federal government as required under the states medicaid waiver was more httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447 than year in the making with input from political leaders on both sides of the aisle insurers academics businesses hospitals community organizations and others the legislation garnered widespread support whether or not this support will remain strong as details of the states plan are worked out during implementation is an open question highlights of the legislation highlights of the massachusetts legislation are presented below in terms of the impact on various stakeholders5 although governor romney vetoed several of the provisions discussed here they were preserved by the legislature through overrides as mentioned earlier there are varying estimates of the size of the uninsured population in massachusetts however it has been widely reported that the states health reform legislation assumes 550000 uninsured residents of whom 92500 will obtain coverage 1 crs report 96979 health insurance uninsured by state 2004 by chris l peterson 2 providers may incur uncompensated costs when they provide free care to the uninsured but also when they treat insured patients whose coverage excludes certain services or provides reimbursement below the actual cost of care frequent complaint about the medicaid program because the state has history of using complex financing mechanisms to obtain federal funds not all of the 2 billion actually results in payments to providers for more information see blue cross blue shield of massachusetts foundation roadmap to coverage publications available at httpwwwroadmaptocoverageorgpubsmainhtml 3 section 1115 of the social security act gives the secretary of health and human services the authority to waive certain statutory requirements of the medicaid program and others thereby allowing states to operate their programs in ways not otherwise allowed under

the individual mandate and 35000 will remain uninsured insurance market to make private health insurance plans more affordable and accessible the legislation modifies state insurance laws and creates an independent public entity called the commonwealth health insurance connector to serve as clearinghouse for the purchase of insurance as of july 2007 the state will merge its nongroup and small group 50 or fewer employees health insurance markets prior to the merger special commission will examine the impact on premiums6 in 2005 the median total monthly small group premium was 365 for an individual and 950 for family in massachusetts7 there is moratorium on the creation of new statemandated health benefits until at least january 2008 to increase the range of highdeductible plans linked to health savings accounts hsas with lower premiums that are available in the state health maintenance organizations hmos will be allowed to offer such plans insurers offering family policies will be required to cover children for two years after they lose dependent status or through age 25 whichever occurs first httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447 the connector will facilitate access to private insurance plans for small employers and individuals who are not offered insurance by large employer one with more than 50 employees that pays part of the premium plans will be offered through the connector beginning in april 2007 these plans will have to meet the same requirements as other plans in the state except that they may contract with selected providers allowing plans to negotiate lower payment rates or steer individuals to quality providers instead of any willing provider allowing individuals with insurance to have more choices the connector will be the only source for specially designed lowercost plans for young adults ages 19 through 26 the board of the connector will establish and manage system for collecting all premium payments made by or on behalf of individuals obtaining insurance through the connector small employers that obtain insurance through the connector must accept binding agreement that specifies conditions of participation eg the employer may only change its health plan eligibility criteria or contribution amounts during time period designated by the connector individuals the legislation aims to insure nearly all state residents through combination of expanded medicaid and state childrens health insurance program schip eligibility premium subsidies and an individual mandate as of july 2006 childrens eligibility for masshealth the states public coverage program funded with medicaid and schip dollars will increase from 200 of the federal poverty line fpl to 300 in 2006 300 fpl is 49800 for family of three and 60000 for family of four enrollment caps for certain disabled hivpositive and unemployed adults will be raised benefits that were cut in 2002 eg dental vision will be restored eligibility 6 the state estimates that nongroup premiums will drop by 24 although recent study found that merging the markets could increase small group premiums it did not take all components of the final bill into account

insurance partnership program part of masshealth that helps pay the employee share of premiums for individuals who work for small employer that pays at least half of its employees premium costs will increase from 200 to 300 fpl as of october 2006 certain uninsured individuals with family incomes at or below 300 fpl 29400 for single person will be eligible to have premium assistance payments made on their behalf through commonwealth care health insurance program operated by the connector to qualify individuals must neither be eligible for public coverage nor eligible either directly or through family member in the past six months for insurance offered by an employer that pays at least 20 of the premium for family coverage or 33 for individual coverage program enrollees will face deductibles those at or below 100 fpl 9800 for single person will receive full premium subsidies and those between 100 and 300 fpl will receive subsidies on sliding scale determined by the board of the connector until june 2009 the states four medicaid managed care organizations are the only plans that may receive premium assistance payments from the program unless specific enrollment targets are not met as of july 2007 all adult residents of the state are required to have health insurance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447 if it is deemed affordable at their income level under schedule to be set by the board of the connector individuals will report their insurance status on state income tax forms beginning with tax year 2007 those who do not have insurance and are not exempt from the mandate will lose their state income tax personal exemption the current state income tax rate is flat 53 with personal exemption of 3575 for singles and double that amount for married couples if the personal exemption did not apply the maximum increase in tax liability would be 189 for single person and 379 for couple some state or federal tax provisions could reduce this liability beginning with tax year 2008 an additional penalty will be levied for each month an individual is without insurance equal to 50 of the lowest premium for which he or she would have qualified it will be collected through withholding of state income tax refunds if refund is due or the penalty exceeds the refund amount the state will notify the taxpayer and may use existing state income tax enforcement and collection procedures to obtain the balance owed employers to help finance the legislation some employers that do not offer insurance will pay fees to the state if an employer with more than 10 employees does not offer group health insurance plan to which it makes fair and reasonable premium contribution to be defined in regulation it will pay fair share employer contribution of more than 295 per employee per year if employees or their dependents incur 50000 or more in free care costs paid by the state in any given year separate free rider surcharge of between 10 and 100 of the states cost may be levied the free rider surcharge will not apply to employers that offer to contribute toward or arrange for the purchase of health insurance including through the connector or the states insurance partnership program are subject to collective bargaining agreement that governs the employment conditions of an individual receiving free care or have 10 or fewer employees employers with more than 10 employees also must adopt and maintain cafeteria plan that allows health insurance premiums to be paid on pretax basis health care providers although the state expects to redirect additional funds from uncompensated care reimbursement to other uses eg premium subsidies as its uninsured rate declines the legislation continues to provide significant support for hospitals and other providers in each of fy2007fy2009 90 million will be used to crs5 increase medicaid payment rates for hospitals and physicians hospital rate increases after fy2007 will be contingent on adherence to quality standards and achievement of performance benchmarks new state health care quality and cost council will establish goals develop performance benchmarks and maintain consumer health information website with cost and quality data organized to the extent possible by facility clinician or physician group practice payment rates for two medicaid managed care organizations affiliated with hospitals in boston and cambridge that treat large numbers of uninsured and other patients who generate uncompensated care costs will be maintained with 87 million in each of fy2007fy2009 these hospitals and others in the state will continue to receive significant medicaid payments more than 1 billion in fy20078 to cover uncompensated care costs state and federal budgets to pay for the legislation the state will redirect some existing medicaid funds that are used to reimburse health care providers primarily hospitals for uncompensated care costs eg the state will redirect 160 million to commonwealth care premium subsidies in fy2007 massachusetts will also obtain additional federal medicaid and schip dollars at least 144 million in fy2007 using new state general fund appropriations 125 million and revenues from employers that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447 do not offer health insurance at least 45 million9 another significant source of funding while not necessarily flowing through state coffers will be insurance premiums paid by those who comply with the individual mandate and financial penalties paid by those who do not issues to consider in any health insurance system including the one that massachusetts has planned for itself there are two overarching tradeoffs the first is between benefits and costs more generous coverage entails higher costs which must be borne by someone the second is among participants who share the costs insurers providers employers families and individuals government and taxpayers the massachusetts legislation provides framework for achieving nearuniversal health insurance coverage that attempts to balance these tradeoffs it also leaves many important details to be worked out during implementation the remainder of this report discusses some of the issues massachusetts will face as it continues to address tradeoffs in its health reform plan individual affordability since many people will be required to purchase health insurance key question is how much premiums will cost in 2005 the median total annual small group premium was 4380 for an individual and 11400 for family in massachusetts for single person making 29400 per year 300 fpl the median premium represents almost 15 of gross income for family of four making 60000 300 fpl it represents 19 premiums may represent smaller percentage of income if they are paid on pretax basis since the tax savings in effect reduce the cost if lower cost health insurance plans are not available some people could be exempted from the individual mandate under the connectors affordability schedule others who purchase 8 massachusetts executive office of health and human services cms waiver submission information available at httpwwwmassgoveohhs 9 premium subsidy spending and medicaid and employer revenues ibid crs6 plans that offer lower premiums in exchange for high deductibles or other significant cost sharing requirements may find it difficult to pay for care state cost premium costs are also concern for the state because it will be providing subsidies for individuals at or below 300 fpl via the commonwealth care program since it has an ongoing relationship with the medicaid managed care organizations that have been given exclusive rights to the programs subsidies until june 2009 initial premium costs may not be major issue however if more people qualify for subsidies than anticipated or plan premiums are higher than expected state costs could increase as safety valve the legislation allows for cap on commonwealth care enrollment however this could leave some individuals unable to afford insurance another issue for the state is that its federal medicaid funding is capped under its medicaid waiver if program costs surpass fixed budget ceiling the state must fund the excess with stateonly dollars or cap enrollment in recent waiver documents the state estimates that its health reform legislation leaves approximately 12 million in room below its medicaid budget ceiling over the next two years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22447 subsidy design the design of sliding scale premium subsidies for the commonwealth care program will affect both individual affordability and state cost presumably consideration will be given to how the subsidies interact with the affordability scale set by the board of the connector for example if the board determines that an affordable policy for single person at 200 fpl 19600 should cost more than 10 of income subsidy might be set to equal the difference between 10 1960 and the lowest premium available to the individual if the gap between affordable and actual premiums is large subsidy costs for the state could be high employer coverage there are number of provisions in the massachusetts legislation that are designed to prevent employers from dropping coverage or offering different health plans to different workers and to prevent individuals from dropping private coverage in favor of public however state officials have noted that creative behavior down the road may require additional policy changes to discourage erosion of the employer market federal perspective as discussed earlier although massachusetts expects to obtain additional medicaid dollars to help finance the legislation federal funding will not exceed cap agreed to under the states medicaid waiver the state will also rely on schip another capped funding source to date the federal government has assisted massachusetts and other states that have exhausted their federal schip funds by redistributing unspent funds from other states and more recently providing an additional appropriation less straightforward federal and state cost of the massachusetts legislation may come in the form of forgone tax revenue because employers will be required to set up cafeteria plans that allow health insurance premiums to be paid on pretax basis income and payroll tax receipts may be reduced aside from the issue of financing there are other ways in which federal legislation could have an impact on the states health reform efforts for example bills such as s 2510 and s 1955 which contain reforms intended to improve access to health insurance for small businesses eg new purchasing arrangements federal standards for benefit coverage might require the state to rethink major elements of its legislation
