may again decide whether to continue to protect the ecosystem on the coastal plain of the arctic national w ildlife refuge anwr or to open it to oil and gas drilling with good prospects of finding economically recoverable amounts of oil less certain are the actual amounts of oil and gas to be found the impacts of development on world oil prices and on th us economy including employment although recent substantial increases in il and gas prices tend to boost estimates of economically recoverable oil tight world oil supplies crude oil and petroleum product price increases and the decline in crude oil production in the l ower 48 states have produced numerous proposals to ex pand us oil production or reduce us oil consumption one of these proposals to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to il and gas development has generated considerable c ontroversy over the years anwr ecological and potential oil resource the coastal plain of alaska just east of pr esent sites of oil production is the virtually undisturbed home to wide variety of plants and animals several species there are protected by international trea ties or agreements this 1002 area is part of the arctic national wildlife refuge which was created in 1960 the refuge was expanded and made offlimits to oil and ga s development in 1980 explicitly to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity and for other purposes anwr also is promising us oil prospect seismic studies and drilling outside the restricted area have led to estimates of good chance of finding significant quantities of economically recoverable oil2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21030crs2 3 us geological survey the oil and gas potential of the arctic national wildlife refuge 1002 area alaska 1999

numbers of fields used in the text are roundeda contingency tree the oil market and economic impacts of anwr oil development would depend upon the amount of oil discovered the sizes of the individual fields the response of the world oil market to the discovery the amount of oil eventually produced the state of the us economy and the effects of additional us oil producti on and any change in world oil prices the response of the world il market and the economic impact would be contingent upon the unknown and uncertain outcomes of the above factors possible anwr volumes and development costs major determinants of the co st of developing oil fields in anwr would be the total amount of oil discovered that would be ec onomically recovered nd the sizes of the individual discoveries there are high degrees of uncertainty in both areas the latest geologic assessment 1998 by the us geologi cal survey usgs estimated that there is 95 chance that there are at least 43 billion barrels bbl s and 5 chance there are at least 118 billion bbls of technically recoverable oil recoverable with current technology but ignoring costs in the restri cted area with mean estimate of 77 billion bbls3 estimated economically recoverable amounts are cons iderably smaller usgss latest economic assessment found that if the price of crude oil is 55 per barr 2003 dollars there is 95 chan ce of at least 390 billion bbls nd 5 chance of at least 1074 billion bbls of economically recoverable oil in the 1002 area with mean estimate of 714 billion bbls4 these estimates reflect field deve lopment practices introduced and cost and price changes since usgss 1998 assessment quantity estimates increase with higher prices and decrease with lower prices but increments of increase decrease as assumed prices rise the usgs estimates also have very wide ranges with respect to oil field sizes among the larger sizes which oil companies probably would consider first the estimates show 95 chance of three or more fields and 5 chance of six or more fields with 256512 million bbls of technically recoverable oil 5 chance of four or more fields and 95 chance of one or more fields with 5121024 million and 5 chance of 1½ fields or more and 95 chance of 03 fields or more with 10242048 million bbls5 during the exploratory phase each company w ould have data and then would select the most promising areas based upon its own interp retation of geologic data its own resource assessment and its own financial criteria as exploration and development progress smaller fields probably would become attractive if and when infrastructure is in place thus given that the sizes both of possibl overall discovery and of individual fields are unknown all estimations of the overall cost of developing anwr are hypothetical httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21030crs3 6 the pattern of the distribution of fiel d sizes is based upon figure ea2 in usgs the oil and gas potential of the arctic national wildlife refuge 1002

existence of 39 billion bbls of economically recoverable oil in seven 100million bbl fields six 200 millionbbl fields three 375millionbbl fields and one 750millionbbl field 2 the existence of 1074 billion bbls of economica lly recoverable il in ten 200millionbbl fields six 375millionbbl fields four 750millionbbl fields and two 1500millionbbl fields6 these cases are based upon the previ ouslydescribed 95 probability and the 5 probability of economically recoverable oil at 55 per barrel 2003 prices advances in arctic oil velopment technology equipm ent and configuration of facilities reduce both the surface footprint and the development cost per barrel of discovery7 these advances have made devel opment more capital intensive onsite but more labor intensive offsite mainly performing data analysis very crude benchmark to use for estimating the outlays that would be entailed could be the 1 billion reported to be the cost of constructing the pine field which has about 430 million bbls of reserves alpine is recently developed field on the alaskan north slope that employs advanced arctic technologies however alpine is appr opriate as cost benchmark only to the extent that the geological conditions accessi bility of the hypothe tically discovered fields and variety of other factors in the refuge are similar to those at alpine all of which adds another dimensi on of uncertainty to this hypothetical formulation if hypothetically the fields associated with an overall 390billion bbl discovery of economically recoverable oil are of the same nature and degree of difficulty to develop as alpine and if as is unlikely development costs are proportional to field size using alpine as the benchmark and if it is assumed that the alpine development cost was 1 billion total development cost of 390 b illion bbl discovery w ould approximate 94 billion if hypothetically fields associated with 1074 billionbbl overall discovery are of the same nature and degree of diffi culty to develop as alpine and if as is unlikely development costs are proportional to field si ze total development cost of that overall discovery would pproximate 269 billion8 at roughly 240 and 250 per barrel of ec onomically recoverable reserves the hypothetical estimate totals which exclude exploration costs appear low for arctic conditions and low even compared with ove rall us averages in 20012003 major us oil companies experienced us onshore finding costs of 935 per barrel with exploration costs accounting for about onethird based upon eia surveys9 however because the extent to which the developer of alpine may have included exploration costs in the 1 billion is not known cost accounting differs by company that figure may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21030crs4 10 energy information

third quarter 2005 table 1too low for the purpose of estimating hypothetical anwr development outlays moreover additional infrastruct ure would be required if fiel ds are distant from existing staging areas including pipeline to the trans alaska pipeline system oil market response other things being equal an increase in s upply would be expected to result in price decline or lower price than would occur otherwise the size of price decrease would depend to some extent upon how close world oil output would be in relation to world production capacity and upon the reaction of ot her suppliers to the world oil market crs estimates again based on hypothetical and uncertain scenarios that peak plateau production from economically r ecoverable volumes of 390 billion and 1074 billion bbls based upon 55 per barrel in 2003 dollars or about 58 in 2005 dollars would range from roughly 04 million to 16 million bbls per day assuming pipeline capacity imposes constraints production c ould begin within 10 years and could last at least 30 years declining from the peak if exploration starts in 2006 peak production levels probably would be reached in about 2025 eia pr ojects world oil production to total 1189 million bbls per day in 202510 on the basis of the aforementioned scenarios anwr production from the respective discove ry volumes at their peaks around 2020 would range from about 03 to 13 of world output projected by eia if supply in the world oil market is tight in 2025 and the market reasonably competitive 16 million bbls per day of anwr production could result in lower world oil prices in the short run opec and ot her producers however may cut output sooner or later to offset the supply effect as s occurred before for example opec reduced production volumes three times in 2001 in response to falling oil prices us economic effects development of anwr for oil production c ould affect the us economy directly through new economic activity generated by the devel opment and production itself indirectly through the ripple effect of such activity indirectly through the effects of any change in oil prices and indirectly throug h any effects on the amount spent to import oil key factor would be the unpr edictable state of the economy hypothetical outlays of 94 billion and 269 billion with an income multiplier of two applying to them would come to 005 and 015 of projected gross domestic product gdp in current dollars for the ear 2025 assuming for simplicity that all the outlays occur in one year11 if the outlays are spread over more than one year the impact in each year would be less but the total effect would be about the same if there is some spare capacity the oil and gas producing i ndustry and its supplie rs would benefit however if the economy is at full employment the multiplier effect would be transitoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21030crs5 12 gdp projections by global insight 2005 us executive summary october 2005 p 11 2025 the us economy the 25year

multiplier is the term used to denote the total impact of the initial sp ending multipliers differ by the sector of the economy in which the investment takes place multiplier of two is reasonable for the type of spending discussed here 14 only the oil prices of 2005 and january 2006 have attained the levels of the early 1980s 15 oecd economic outlook december 2004 p 135 it is assumed that monetary policy would accommodate the price rise other estimators simulations have had comparable results 16 bls estimates at httpwwwblsgovem pempind4htm estimates are based upon 2002 labor productivity bls does not publish estimates for oil and gas field services separately 17 crs could not locate data th at would indicate the proportions hypothetical lower scenario continuedoutlays of similar magnitudes in 2025 when the economy is projected to be about 80 larger than in 200512 would have much smaller relative effects13 impacts on some geographic regions and industrial sectors alaska oil producers and manufacturers of drill pipe would be greater but some smaller in analyzing the impact of changes in energy costs on the economy as whole or on individual sectors it is worth noting that the relative price of oil has decreased ce the oil price spikes of the 1970s and early 1980s14 energy use per unit of output has fallen the shares of production costs accounted for by energy have dropped across the economy with relatively few exceptions and energy costs as share of gdp have declined it appears also that any price effect woul d have to be large and sustained for the effects to be substantial on macroeconomic scale the organization for economic cooperation and development oec d estimated that rise in oil prices of 15 per barrel would cause us gdp to be lower by 045 and 055 in the first and second years after the shock15 the price effect of 13 addition to world oil supply resulting from anwr production probably would be m odest and temporary but the macroeconomic result of price decline may not be proportional employment effects oil and gas development in anwr would generate additional jobs in the national economy to the extent that development results directly and indirectly in net economic stimulus key factor is whether the economy would be at less than full employment the direct effects are less uncertain than the indirect given the uncertainty of the effects of anwr il on world oil prices and any consequent beneficial effects of lower energy prices on the economy as whole order of magnitude estimates can be made for jobs generated by the hypothetical development outlays by using the national av erages of 573 jobs directly and indirectly required per 1 million of sales by oil and gas producer s as estimated by the bureau of labor statistics bls and 16 jobs per 1 million of sales by oil and gas field service companies as estimated by the au thor based upon historical data16 adjusting for price increases since 1996 and assuming that each of the above groups accounts for half of the outlays it can be estimated that 94 billion would lead hypothetically to about 86000 jobs and that 269 billion would lead hypothetically to about 245000 jobs17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21030crs6 17 continued 47 billion by oil producing companies 119 deflator x 573 jobs per million 22600 jobs 47 billion by oil field service companies 119 deflato r x 16

drilling 19 dean baker using wefas procedure but di fferent assumptions estimated the job gain at 46300 in hot air over the arctic an assessment of the wefa study of the economic impact of oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge center for economic and policy research september 4 2001 11 ppin contrast 1990 report by the wefa group estimated that the economic impact of oil development in anwr would result in net gain in employment of 735000 in the peak year of job creation18 much of wefas job gain results from estimated large beneficial macroeconomic eff ects of lower world oil prices that are based partly upon its assumption that the amount of anwr economica lly recoverable oil would be near the high end of 1987 anwr resource estimates19 these differences in estimates of job generation illustrate the importance of the ro played by macroeconomic relationships and other assumptions used in making such estimates the impact of anwr development on empl oyment would be affected by the continually changing overall state of the ec onomy in the long run the unemployment rate is determined by the structure of th labor market and at full employment jobs generated by anwr development would come at the expense of an approximately equal number of jobs taken from the rest of the economy the effect of anwr oil on world oil prices would be uncertain and any price drop would have to be large and sustained for the macroeconomic effects to be reasonably noticeable any employment gain from benefici macroeconomic effects of drop in oil prices may be offset by harm to oil pr oducers not participatin g in anwr development who may reduce their operations and workforce other things being equal their suppliers and local economies may be affected as well import effect as the us marginal source of petroleum net imports would be reduced by virtually one barrel for ever barrel of anwr output the economy would benefit temporarily through reduction in its oil import bill and in the income transferred overseas to pay for the oil using eias crude oil price projection for 2025 of foreign crude oil of 54 per barrel and assuming midrange anwr out put of one million bbls per day the oil import bill would be cut by 197 billion in that year improving the us merchandise trade balance in the very shor t run however the relative fall in dollars flowing abroad could cause the dollar to appreciate which would tend to reduce us exports of other goods and services and ex pand imports to some extent reversing some of the initial improvement should anwr oil lower oil pri ces consequent increase in economic activity may further increase us im ports of other goods and services the trade deficit basically reflects the desire of americans to borrow abroad versus the desire of foreigners to invest or borrow in the united states
