nevertheless some observers maintain that these two gangs may develop the capacity to become organized criminal enterprises capable of coordinating illegal activities across national borders yet others find them to be more criminally organized or sophisticated than other street gangs at issue for congress is whether the ms13 and m18 gangs constitute an emerging transnational criminal threat the federal response to the ms13 and m18 gang problem has largely involved the enforcement of criminal and immigration laws including the deportation of alien gang members more recently federal efforts have focused on prosecuting gang members under the racketeer influence and corrupt organizations rico statute deported alien gang members have established ms13 and m18 gang cliques in their home countries and some experts suggest that us deportation policies have effectively transported usstyled gang culture to parts of central america and mexico moreover evidence shows that deported alien ms13 and m18 gang members have established revolving door migratory pattern of repeat illegal reentry into the united states raising concerns that these migratory alien gang members may become involved in narcotrafficking smuggling and other criminal activities along the usmexico border legislation has been introduced in the 110 th congress and one such proposal has been passed by the senate that would strengthen the enforcement of immigration law directed at alien gang members and provide additional tools to federal prosecutors to pursue members of violent gangs such legislation

salvatrucha ms131 and the 18th street gang also known as the mara 18 or m18 have raised concern among policy makers for several reasons2 first membership in these gangs has spread from the angeles area to other communities across the united states second there are concerns that these gangs are becoming transnational primarily because ms13 and m18 cliques are being established in central america 3 and mexico third evidence suggests that these gangs are engaged in criminal enterprises normally associated with better organized and more sophisticated crime syndicates fourth and perhaps most disturbingly for policy makers in post911 world alarms have been sounded in some circles that international terrorist organizations like alqaeda could exploit alien and narcotics smuggling networks controlled by these gangs to infiltrate the united states to date however evidence suggests that these gangs and international terrorist groups are cooperating with one another 4 nonetheless at issue for congress is whether the ms13 and m18 gangs constitute an emerging transnational criminal threat this report provides an overview of the ms13 and m18 gangs5 examines how ms13 and m 18 gangs are different from other gangs and organized crime groups and discusses what constitutes transnational gang the report also explores whether ms13 and m18 gangs are transnational gangs discusses the various federal responses to these gangs and examines legislation that would target alien gang members specifically and members of violent gangs in general the report concludes with discussion of selected issues g6g142g143g146g151g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g561 there is single definition of what characteristics constitute transnational gang6 various definitions have cited one or more of the following characteristics in defining transnational gang 1 such gangs are criminally active and operational in more than one country 2 criminal activities committed by gang members in one country are planned directed and controlled by 1 the word mara is spanish word for gang and marero means gang member these terms are more commonly used in salvador in the recent literature on latino transnational gangs the term maras has come to refer specifically to the ms13 and m18 gangs 2 although there are other domestic gangs with transnational members ms13 and m18 are the focus of this report because they have been the most prominently discussed by the media and policy makers 3 for more information see crs report rl34112 gangs in central america by clare ribando seelke hereafter cited as gangs in central america 4 personal communication with brian truchon fbi director of the ms13 gang task force june 2007 hereafter cited as crs communication with truchon 5 this report addresses the domestic aspects of the ms13 and m18 gangs the international perspective on these and other gangs in latin america is beyond the scope of this report for information on the international perspective see gangs in central america 6 transnational gangs are not new phenomena in the united states and have included gangs composed of members of asian russian african serbian bosnian jamaican and other races ethnicities and nationalities some of these transnational gangs have evolved into highly organized an d sophisticated criminal enterprises known for influencing government officials and the judiciary in the countries in which they operate in the united states the most wellknown example of this type of crime syndicate is the mafia or cosa nostra composed of members of sicilian descent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34233g22g145g142g561g15g21g556g343 g345g561g138 g151g141g561 g343g350g157g145g561

adapt to new areas and 4 the criminal activities of such gangs tend to be sophisticated and transcend borders for gang to be considered transnational it would appear that the gang would have more than one of the aforementioned characteristics however with respect to the ms13 and m18 gangs much of the literature characterizes these gangs as transnational merely because they are present in more than one country g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g152g151g561g157g145g142g561g15g21g556g343g345g561g138g151g141g561g15g556g343g350g561g9g138g151g144g156g561 two predominantly latino gangs ms13 and m18 have taken place on the national policy agenda as membership in these gangs has spread from angeles to other parts of the united states although street gangs are largely an urban phenomenon ms13 and m18 cliques have emerged among disaffected latino youth in suburban and rural areas across the country according to national gang survey the ms13 and m18 gangs have an established presence in washington dc northern virginia certain cities in maryland nashville tennessee new york new york houston texas and other rural and urban areas 7 the m18 gang is much larger gang than the ms13 in terms of overall membership with approximately 30000 members nationwide compared with 800010000 ms13 members nationwide in 20058 however the ms13 gang has generated greater media coverage and congressional attention9 in recent years federal law enforcement authorities have targeted ms13 and m18 alien gang members for deportation an action that some argue has contributed to the development and proliferation of usstyled gangs in central america and mexico10 although membership in the ms13 gang is largely salvadoran and membership in the m18 gang is largely mexican both gangs have recruited members in the united stat from other central american countries some have argued that as result of this intermixed membership both gangs have established gang cliques in salvador honduras guatemala and mexico that are modeled on and perhaps linked to us ms13 and m18 gangs 11 according to some central american and mexican ms13 and m18 gangs maintain elements often referred to as lastyle gang culture commonly found among angelesbased gangs12 because the gangs are present in multiple countries some contend that these gangs are transnational 7 the national youth gang center nygc survey does

the 1980s during this period thousands of salvadorans fled the civil war in their country13 by the end of the 1980s some estimates indicate that more than 300000 salvadorans had settled in angeles14 one hypothesis on the gang formation asserts that salvadorian immigrants during this period banned together and formed the ms13 gang15 ms13s early membership is reported to have included former guerrillas and salvadoran government soldiers whose combat experience during the salvadoran civil war contributed to the gangs notoriety as one of the more brutal and violent angeles street gangs16 moreover the gang developed widely reported reputation of employing unusual methods of violence including using machetes in gang attacks17 despite the gangs reputation sources in law enforcement indicate that little evidence exists to substantiate that the ms13 gang is more violent than other street gangs18

unsophisticated criminal activities and tend to have loose leadership structure firstgeneration gangs participate in opportunistic criminal activity and intergang rivalry22 secondgeneration gangs are characterized as having an organized structure similar to business they tend to assume market rather than turf orientation23 secondgeneration gang activities tend to be drugcentered moreover these gangs tend to operate in broader areas and have centralized leadership 24 thirdgeneration gangs are characterized as highly sophisticated mercenarytype groups with goals of power or financial acquisition and set of fully evolved political aims25 third generation gangs tend to operate in global environment and may embrace quasiterrorism or true terrorism to advance their goals26 most urban gangs fit into the first and secondgeneration characterizations27 some researchers believe however that the ms13 gang in some central american countries has characteristics of thirdgeneration gang28 although such researchers do not link the ms13 gang to terrorist groups they assert that the ms13 gang and terrorist groups have similar characteristics such as having propensity for indiscriminate violence intimidation and coercion that transcends borders and targets nationstates29 in the united states the ms13 gang does not appear to have escalated to thirdgeneration gang however evidence suggests that the gangs presence in multiple states as discussed above and its criminal activities indicate that the gang is evolving this point is underscored by the 2004 national drug intelligence center ndic threat assessment report despite the generally loose organization of the ms13 gang the ndics 2004 report warned that the gang was increasing its coordination between chapters in angeles washington dc northern virginia and new york perhaps indicating efforts to create national command structure 30 continued in street gangs the new urban insurgency by max g manwaring pp 811 available

between street gangs transnational gangs and organized criminal enterprises can be blurred the following section highlights some of the major distinctions between these criminal groups

generally most researchers agree that the primary distinction between transnational gangs and other domestic street gangs is that transnational gangs are criminally active and operational in more than one country in some cases they may be characterized as gangs in which members in one country typically commit crimes that could have been substantially planned directed and controlled by the gangs leaders in another country 31 other researchers characterize transnational gangs as very mobile highly adaptable to new geographic areas and maintaining connections in their native countries32 as previously mentioned most street gangs are either first or secondgeneration gangs transnational gangs however share some of the same characteristics as thirdgeneration gang for example transnational and thirdgeneration gangs tend to operate in global environment that is their criminal activities transcend bord ers moreover with respect to their criminal activities both types of gangs tend to have level of sophistication that closely resembles organized criminal syndicates

federal bureau of investigation fbi as any group having formalized structure whose primary objective is to obtain money through illegal activities 33 such groups tend to have vertical hierarchy strong leadership sanctions for failure of its members to abide by codes of loyalty and level of entrepreneurial expertise the specific criminal acts that organized criminal enterprises tend to engage in are specified in statute as part of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico34 and the violent crimes in aid of racketeering vicar35 statutes according to the fbi organized criminal enterprises maintain control of their illegal activities through tactics such as actual or threatened violence graft and extortion the activities of organized crime syndicates can be sophisticated enterprises capable of adversely effecting localities regions and in some cases the nation as whole 31 james finckenauer meeting the challenge of transnational crime national institute of justice

with the exception of thirdgeneration gangs street gangs are generally considered distinct from organized criminal enterprises because they typically lack the hierarchical leadership structure organizational structure capital and manpower required to run sophisticated criminal enterprise street gangs are generally more horizontally organized with lots of small cliques with their own leadership and centralized overar ching leadership setting strategy and enforcing discipline most often gang leaders are easily and quickly replaced by other gang members without disruption to the gangs activities street gangs often engage in some of the same types of criminal activity as organized criminal enterprises but generally at much lower levels and not always strictly driven by entrepreneurial objectives research indicates that most street gang crime tends to be opportunistic and improvised as previously discussed street gangs tend to be concerned with issues such as neighborhood territory or turf protection and maintaining respect for the gang and its members another key difference between street gangs and organized criminal enterprises is evident when comparing federal prosecutions of organized crime with federal prosecutions of street gang offenses in gang cases the prosecution can face obstacles prosecuting these cases under the existing rico statute which has been instrument in hampering if not dismantling organized criminal enterprises generally when federal criminal gang case is being developed for rico prosecution prosecutors must demonstrate that the crimes were committed or were connected to the interests of criminal enterprise 36 although many cases against organized criminal enterprises have been successfully prosecuted under the rico statute it is more difficult to develop rico case against street gangs g15g21g556g343g345g561g9g138g151g144g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g142g141g561g5g155g146g150g142g561 the washington office on latin america wola37 researched and interviewed ms13 members in the washington dc area over period of year38 as result of the research wola issued report in february 2007 in which it concluded that ms13 and m18 members in the washington dc area were not engaged in systematic effort to become more involved in organized crime the report found that the areas ms13 membership was sizable although the members criminal activity was largely limited to petty theft and neighborhood extortion the analysis of the ms13 gang in the washington dc area concluded that active gang hot spots existed but that the maras did not constitute major public security issue 36 to investigate and prosecute organized criminal enterprise s the fbi relies on the enterpri theory of investigation eti under this investigative model the investigation and prosecution are focused on the criminal activities of the entire criminal enterprise rather than on just those committed by any single individual this approach targets all aspects of the criminal operation to disrupt and ultimately destroy the tire structure of the enterprise in fact an essential part of the eti strategy is to show that the individuals in such an organization commit criminal acts solely to benefit their criminal enterprise using the eti the fbi can support the prosecution of the criminal enterprise under rico statutes or its related statute vicar and seize the enterprises assets to seriously disrupt or dismantle entire criminal organizations 37 wola is nongovernmental organization focused on democracy

evidence that the washington dc areas gangs are indeed criminally active and may show signs of increasing criminal sophistication39 for example they assert that in the washington dc area immigration and customs enforcement ice agents reported ar resting 233 known violent gang members 190 of which were ms13 members in 2006 in addition milestone case for the federal prosecution of gang members under the rico statute was based on ms13 members committing crimes in the washington dc area two ms13 gang members were convicted of murdering six people and attempting to kill four others in federal case prosecuted in prince georges county maryland 40 the two convicted ms13 members were part of an indictment brought against 22 ms13 members successfully prosecuting racketeering conviction against ms13 members is seen by some analysts as evidence that the gangs criminal activities are becoming increasingly organized and sophisticated 41

generally considered to meet at least one of the characteristics attributed to transnational gangsthey are present in more than one country and with respect to the ms13 gang evidence suggests that the gang is becoming more organized which is another characteristic of transnational gangs for example recent criminal cases involving ms13 defendants have included information and testimony that gang members in maryland were in telephone contact with other ms13 members in cities across the country and on occasion with ms13 members in salvador42 criminal cases brought against ms13 also indicate that the gang members share information and in some cases that cliques in one area have loaned weapons to members of an ms13 clique in another area43 this evidence of contact communication and perhaps criminal cooperation is seen by some experts as an indication that the ms13 gang could evolve from street gang into more sophisticated transnational gang 44 some critics contend that the transnationalization of the ms13 and m18 gangs began with the deportation of alien gang members from the united states in the mid1990s they assert that the increase in deportations of aliens to central america and mexico initiated by changes made to immigration law in the mid1990s45 led to the establishment of ms13 and m18 cliques in those countries however the actual number of alien gang members that were deported is not clear from the immigration removal data others assert that these countries already had gang problem and that ms13 and m18 cliques were not formed in mexico and central american countries as the result of gang migration or as an effort to establish new gang franchises or otherwise further 39 james c spero us dhs ice testimony before the us house of

m18 cliques have established growing presence in 24 of mexicos 32 states 48 ms13 and m18 gangs in central america and mexico are reported to have larger total memberships and are reportedly more

has been focused on securing the us borders and ports of entry the long porous southern border with mexico is considered vulnerability in part because of the relative ease with which illegal aliens narcotics and contraband are smuggled into the united states as well as the extent to which people cross into the united states illegally policy makers have been concerned about human and narcotic smuggling rings and the possibility that such profitdriven enterprises could be used by terrorists to enter the country undetected 50 although there is data linking the ms13 and m18 gangs with organized smuggling activities there are concerns that the gangs may become more organized and sophisticated in their criminal activities

involved in the fight against gangs through the enforcement of criminal and immigration laws the department of justice doj administers the primary federal efforts to investigate apprehend and

of these bills would amend th rico statute by expanding the definition of racketeering activity to include gang crime these bills also would provide for increased penalties for racketeering activities

united states is not definitively known moreover with the exception of established ms13 and m18 cliques in central america and mexico it is not altogether clear whether these two gangs pose transnational threat it is noteworthy however that despite the transnational aspects of the ms13 and m18 gangsthey are criminally active in more than one countryin many respects they are different that other domestic street gangs nevertheless ms13 and 18 th street gang members pose criminal threat to the communities where they reside and conduct their criminal activities in addition evidence suggests that previously deported members of these two gangs reenter the united states illegally across the usmexico border

bills introduced in the 110th congress would permit or require in the case of mandatory minimum sentences longer imprisonment for those convicted of certain serious crimes if they are committed by gang members proponents of these types of antigang measures argue that such enhanced federal penalties are needed to address the rising gang crime in communities across the country they contend that longer sentences will deter violent gang related crime and encourage greater cooperation by gang members with law enforcement and prosecutorsthe rationale being that gang members facing longer prison sentence will be more inclined to cooperate with prosecutors providing useful information on the gang and its members in exchange for shorter prison sentence 88 critics of harsher criminal penalties and mandatory minimum sentences argue against these proposals on several fronts on the broadest level some critics oppose the further federalization of laws that have been traditionally under the sole jurisdiction of states and localities these critics cite the growing number of new federal laws recently estimated at almost 4000 89 they also argue that state and local law enforcement officers have the necessary experience and local intelligence sources to investigate and prosecute gang crimes which may vary greatly by state region and locality whereas federal sources are strained as they cope with investigating and prosecuting national threats90 opponents of mandatory minimum sentences for gangrelated crime also point to the greater expense of imprisonment versus the costs of prevention

effect of these harsher penalties arguing that in certain situations individuals break the law notwithstanding severe criminal penalties92 in addition researchers have often noted that imprisonment can serve to strengthen gang allegiances and function as criminal finishing schools for gang members93

the goal is to effectively dismantle the criminal enterprise as previously mentioned federal prosecutors have successfully prosecuted organized criminal syndicates under the rico statute and have recently sought the prosecution of several ms13 gang members proponents of expanding the federal rico statute to include violent gangrelated crimes argue that having gangspecific rico provisions is n ecessary to pursue violent gangs such as the ms 13 and m18 gangs they contend that such prov isions would provide law enforcement with an important tool to investigate and prosecute gangrelated crime moreover they contend that gang specific rico provisions will help federal prosecutors pursue gangs that have moved drug trafficking and other criminal activity onto federal land to avoid detection and state or local prosecution opponents argue that existing rico laws are sufficiently broad to provide for the successful prosecution of gangrelated crime despite the obstacles faced in developing successful rico gang cases gang members have recently been successfully convicted under existing federal rico statutes the recent conviction of three ms13 gang members in hyattsville maryland 94 adds credence to the argument that existing rico laws are sufficient in addition other gang cases have been federally prosecuted under rico statutes in the past and several states have enacted stateversions of ricolike laws for prosecuting gang conspiracy cases95 91 for example see diverting children from life of crime measuring costs and benefits by peter w greenwood karyn model c peter

previously discussed one of the more overt tools used to dismantle gangs has been the enforcement of immigration law because street gangs such as ms13 and m18 may have some number of foreignborn members immigration enforc ement ie deportation is direct method for disrupting these gangs ice sweepsof alien gang members have netted both ms13 and m 18 members with criminal histories as well as alien gang members without criminal histories some critics contend that the gang problem cannot be resolved through immigration enforcement alone they argue that not all gang members are foreign nationals and such policy could lead to ethnic and racial profiling furthermore they assert that deportation is not longterm solution to the gang problem because evidence suggests that alien gang members are crossing illegally back into the united states they also argue that by deporting alien gang members the united states is deporting its gang culture to other countries

gangs in general and the ms13 and m18 gangs specifically are limited the organizational strength of ms13 and m18 gangs across national borders and their ability to carry out serious criminal offenses is an important indicator of their potential threat to the domestic security of the united states currently the national youth gang center nygc97 authors survey on youth gangs while the survey includes responses from major law enforcement jurisdictions ie urban areas it does not include every rural and suburban law enforcement jurisdiction as gangs spread to nontraditional areas in the country ie rural and suburban areas the need to capture data in these areas becoming increasingly critical more detailed reporting of gang crime could help develop more refined information on the incidence of such crime and the migration patterns of these gangs g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the concept of transnationalism was coined in the aftermath of the first world war in discussion of americas composition as an immigrant meltingpot and the implications for assimilation and maintaining cultural connection to ones previous homeland98 more recently the concept of transnationalism has been used to describe the ideals of globalization the free movement of people the sharing of culture and improved communications across national boundaries and generally has been considered positive concept however in the context of crime policy particularly after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 transnationalism has assumed more ominous connotation and the potential for gangs in the united states to become transnational has become concern to lawmakers the phenomena of gangs is complex multifaceted and constantly evolving the allure of gangs has traditionally been thought to be response to issues associated with poverty and disparities in 96 see crs report rl33351 immigration enforcement within the united states by alison siskin et 97 the nygc survey is

gangs today are more violent more organized and more widespread the problems associated with stemming the spread and sophistication of ms13 and m18 gang activities may reflect current limitations to addressing what is now generally considered multinational and regional problem the problems associated with these two gangs cannot be solved by arrests prosecution imprisonment and immigration enforcement alone the fact that these two gangs exist and operate outside of the united states and beyond the reach of domestic law enforcement agencies indicates that domestic responses may not fully address the broader problems presented by these gangs and that multilateral and multinational approach in combination with domestic efforts may be warranted recent efforts of various federal agencies working together with the governments of other countries particularly salvador on their problems with ms13 and m18 indicate that the federal response is moving toward bilateral approach to addressing the problem whether the problem of these two gangs continues to be approached as domestic social issue domestic security issue multinationalregional issue or combination of these concerns has yet to be determined congress may consider these and other issues in shaping legislative response to this complex policy concern
