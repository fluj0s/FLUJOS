6108c31 shspec48 what is auditing there are two stages of poor auditing 1 the auditor audits naturally 2 then learns the rules and audits all thumbs with the rules eventually the rules fall back to where they belong and he does fine the basics of auditing are what they are you are auditing human being the auditing is addressed to case auditing must be done what is auditing auditing is the pc in session willing to talk to the auditor and interested in his own case and able to talk to the auditor interested in own case does not mean interested in session the session itself should never be interesting witch doctors maintained such compelling presence that the patient couldnt help being interested in the session this was the wrong way to operate there was such complexity in the tech that it took half lifetime to learn eg the technique of piercing scream followed by silence then an hypnotic command then resuming the scream at the same pitch and volume or the ability to leap with back somersault through the smoke hole of wigwam or lodge and sit on the trees so as to apparently disappear then talk down through the hole in spirit voices this would be so interesting that the patient would come back to life in scientology you walk into these expectations of what healer is supposed to be and do but the fake is the guy who doesnt know model session and cant do this or that so he isnt an auditor youve got the nowimsupposedtos theyve got potent reasons in back of them but they also become badge of being pro his ease in handling the form impresses the pc and has magical effect omit some of the forms and the pc suspects that theres something wrong with your auditing this can be ridiculous form for the sake of form and magical effect its good to know and use the forms but auditing comes back to something else running cases its always more important to run cases than to run according to form the form just makes it easier as guideline when youre really expert the form wont even be apparent itll just look like youre doing something effective this requires real skill you have to be completely comfortable with what you are doing making it look utterly natural while doing it utterly by the rules in this respect auditing is like doing japanese paintings doing it by the rules makes it harder because you have to be natural while doing it by the form which is artificial if you fall short of appearing totally natural you will fall short of total control there is real art in using rudiments without the pc noticing the order youre using so he complies because its so natural that it must be addressed to him it is communication that is compelling it must sound so casual that it sounds perfectly relaxed and theres question in your mind about what you are doing or where you are going or what you are going to achieve and this very casualness seems to speak of reserved power like rolls royce idling at the curb ease is power strain is never power quiet voice is more commanding than loud one this is based on the effect scale naturally its easy for you to audit pc with tremendous control if you yourself are not anxious if you are confident you can control any part of the situation you are not trying to interest him in the session and he feels theres nothing for him to look at but the bank nothing to see but his case the ease with which you can do it is based on confidence which is based on wins and ability when you have ideas that you wont win your confidence drops the reality factor has to be in and if you are anxious about somebodys case youll appear anxious about his case i handle it another way i say gee i sure am worried about your case these days the pc says really i havent been worried about my case why are you well you never say gee whiz i just realized you just keep on running this thing this creates much higher reality than robotic iamgoingtoaudityounowdofishfly if you look confident but feel unconfident hes likely to respond to your anxiety the more he withholds this the less hell go into session it doesnt help the pc for the auditor to be an unknown factor to the pc as long as the auditor stops short of eval or inval or q and the auditor should keep the rfactor in the reality factor begins in your command of your information if you dont feel you have command of the information and you pretend to have command of your information your session will come cropper every time you cannot help it matter how hard you try session goes to pieces only on these points of unreality in the auditor in the auditor you can find the points of unreality by asking what did you disagree with in that session youll find thats where things go awry because theres r in the session if theres r theres or c dont think there is any lag on this when the r goes the others drop at once you may become aware of them later the unreality entered into the session by the auditor causes the auditor to get peeved with the pc session is basically an arc activity if theres been high arc in the auditor it will materialize in the pc pc can look at his bank as well as he can communicate good auditor has highly perceptive pc the same pc audited by another auditor with low arc is not as perceptive these factors have always existed if you feel annoyance or anxiety with the pc that will drop the r and cut c this can be destructive to the pc because the auditor projects low perceptivity this is one of the first factors that got in the road of dianetics auditor presence in the session varied an auditor who is confident creates an auditing environment in which it is safe to depart into the nevernever land of the unknown so its the auditor and the emotional tone of the session which determine what takes place when youve been auditing long time and havent cleared somebody you arent operating on very high level of confidence when youve seen somebody get cleared your confidence level goes up to hopeful when youve cleared somebody you get confident when youve cleared string of them you get insouciant but that in itself is reality when youve not gotten results you feel less confident about pcs so youre auditing in an environment which has low arc in it false note in the auditors confidence is always detectable the pcs attention goes off his case onto the auditor because he feels theres something here he doesnt know and theres something unknown in the session unknownness is the keynote here the auditor doesnt know whether he can produce result or what he can do or whether hell get the pc through etc he has determination of the final result to the pc it adds up as the auditor not knowing so theres mystery in the session the pc may try arduously to spot the notknow because of the mystery which sticks him the auditor cant keep the pc in session because the pcs attention is on the auditor how much mystery does he smell lrh would disabuse him of any mystery he can how long the session will be if thats relevant any mystery about whats going on just destroy it you tell him what you are going to run if youre going to ignore something etc the arc break disappears because so much r has been thrown into the session always try to make the pc right never make the pc wrong but dont make the pc right at the expense of making yourself wrong if challenged because of legitimate flub lrh would normally catch it before the pc does if he doesnt he figures hes slipping you should know more about whats going on in the session at any given moment than the pc does therefore you have more r therefore more control if the pc is telling you whats going on something is seriously out and probably has been for weeks the pc is not always right but the auditor doesnt have to tell him hes wrong theres need to prove anything to the pc to prove is one of the basic games of the thetan so the pc can easily get into this games condition but if he does something earlier is out some rfactor i would never audit someone to electrify the community weve done it and its never been effective its the old prove game you dont use scientology to prove it works because youve gotten into games condition before you start and an auditing session is not games condition and you should know it every homo sapiens is in games condition this could easily take precedence over session so just dont play because if you let it be games condition youll both lose since the pc wont let you get him better at the least whiff of games condition the pc will take off in that direction as soon as you agree to have game with the pc auditing does not exist when you drop out r youve entered an ingredient which can lead to games condition youre withholding something from the pc so obviously theres game just the fact that you are doing this causes this atmosphere auditing is an activity of an auditor taking over control of and shepherding the attention of pc so as to bring about higher level of confront ability he has got to be able to confront more of what he has done and is doing etc youre not really changing the pc you may remove valences etc which makes him appear to have changed but what you are really doing is to extend the pc and to familiarize him with himself and his bank and the universe on various dynamics so his attention has to be shepherded and not all by the automaticity of the auditing command because the pc is going to duck you can count on the fact that every stuck picture is in some degree held there but the pc can look at the action surrounding the stuck point if he can look at the stuck picture the indication that he can regard the action is that he can regard the stuck picture which is blanking it out the pc is the one who brought up the stuck picture changes on cases which are rapid and beneficial frequently come from shepherding the pcs attention not from permissive grind grind grind if the pc offers up something his attention is on and the auditor refuses to help him look at it the pc can get upset the pc doesnt know what hes looking at he needs to be guided into looking at what he hasnt confronted the pc often indicates hes in trouble by sweating screaming writhing etc the only fast way the auditor can get him out is by not letting him escape the auditor shouldnt dress for anything except case gain dont change process because it isnt going fast enough change the pcs attention the way out is the way through so if hes stuck in something move him through it an auditor cant do this if he has reality on what the pc is doing if the pc is looking fixedly the way to handle it is to get him to look little further the stuck picture is stable datum which hes busily looking at to avoid looking at the confusion around it when you get him to look at the confusion the stable datum can blow with case that has black field ask whats on the other side of it with an invisible field or an invisible case with pictures get which way he is looking and get him to look in different direction its up to you to direct the pcs attention why because he himself in that very bank he has been in has his attention fixed on these objects solely for one reason because he has been powerless to direct his own attention in that particular bank and in those particular situations if an auditor doesnt do any attentiondirecting the command alone will do it but far more slowly but there will be arc if the pc believes the auditor doesnt care if you want fast clearing youll just have to get down to the fundamental which is that the auditor is someone who directs the pcs attention through his bank
