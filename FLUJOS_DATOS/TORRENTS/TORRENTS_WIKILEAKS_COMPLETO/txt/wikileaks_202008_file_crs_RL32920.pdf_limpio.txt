sustainm ent funding to complete homeland security projects begun in previous years finally dhs intends to authorize urban areas to apply for funding for homeland security projects that have dualuse for terrorist incidents or natural disasters capabilities such as evacuations and search and rescue teams50 critics of the present funding distribu tion method including some members of congress and the national commission on terro rist attacks upon the united states have stated that the funding distribution methods used to provide federal homeland security assistance to states and localities are inadequate and unfair51 the issue of allocation of dhs counterte rrorism training funding is part of larger issue the distribution of federal homeland security funding to states and localities52 the allocation of counterterrorism training funding however presents some policy questions that can be addre ssed separately from the issue of federal homeland security ssistance distribution it could be argued that every st ate should receive minimum amount of homeland security funding but that not ev ery state and locality can receive priority in counterterrorism training terrori sm intelligence may identify one state or locality at greater risk of attacks whereas other locations may not be at the same risk some states and localities may have greater risk of terrorist attacks due to their population density or critical infrastru cture additionally it could be argued that state or locality should not receive training funding that would allow first responders government officials and emergency managers to attend counter terrorism training that would not enhance their preparedness because the state orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32920crs15 locality does not face terrorist threat have critical infrastructure or possess threat specific counterte rrorism equipment these arguments however may not ddress the need for baseline counter terrorism training it could be argued that every state should receive the same training due to the unpredictable nature of terrorism some may argue that neither the absence of critical infra structure nor relatively low population density protects state or locality from terrorist attacks from that perspective every state and locality can be seen as needing some if not an equal amount of counte rterrorism training possible approaches include status quo congress could determine that the present amount of training and funding that states and localities receive is adequate in support of this position it might be argued that the current allocation of training funding and priority of training is necessary to ensure that every state and locality is provided baseline amount of counterterrorism training this option however does not address the argument that some states and localities are at greater risk of terrorist attacks and may need more training or funding than those st ates or localities at lesser risk establishing training attendance priority if congress were to decide that the present counterterro rism training provided by dhs is not fully meeting the needs of states and localities at greater risk of terrorist attacks it could direct dhs specifically gt through statutory or c onference language to establish priority attendance list of states and localities this list could give training priority to states and localities that are determined to be at greater risk of or vulnerability to terrorist attacks gt with access to intelligence concerning the national terrorist threat might be designated to determine which states and localities appear to have greater need for training this option however might result in some states or localities receiving reduced training due to the limite d space in and availability of the training programs and it could be argued that this would not ensure adequate security for some states and localities increasing funding for specifi c states or localities congress could direct gt to increase funding to specific states or loca lities based on terrorist threat information since congress through the usa patriot act directed only that minimum of 075 of total ppropriations be allocated to states for homeland security it could through statutory or c onference language require gt to provide additional f unding to specific states and loca lities for counterterrorism training this option could increase preparedness of states and localities at greater risk of terrorist attacks as determined by threat inform ation this option however would require gt to coordinate terrorist threat inform ation with its alloca tion of shsgp funding which it presently does not do supporters of this position would be likely to argue that since gt coordinates terrorist threat information with its allocation of uasi funding it could do this for shsgp allocations possible redundancy and conso lidation of department of homeland security training within dhs gt and the federal emergency management agency fema administer training programs at the state and local levels and at national training institutes at the national level fema administers the emergency management institute emi and the national fire academy nfahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32920crs16 gt does not directly administer any training institute however it provides guidance and funding to training institute s that are part of the national domestic preparedness consortium ndpc described ear lier in this report some training programs offered by emi and nfa have similar subject matter in training provided by ndpc training institutes such as incident management homeland security planning hazardous ma terial incident re sponse emergency operations and wmd response because of the possible similarity of these training programs for state and local first responders it c ould be argued that there is need to consolidate or coordinate tr aining offered by these two separate dhs agencies femas firefighting training provided by the nfa however focuses primarily on the needs of local fire departments whereas ndpc provides some training primarily focusing on law enforcement some of the training that is tailored to specific profession such as law enforcement or firefighting would not seem to be redundant basic or introductory training such as incident management or wmd response however may not be specifically ta ilored for single pr ofession or type of first responder this possible redundancy of training and the potential consolidation of training may be policy questions that congress may choose to address through oversight of dhss role in providing assistance to states and localities possible approaches include status quo if congress were to determin that there was redundancy or need to consolidate dhs training prog rams it could allow dhs to continue to provide first responder training through tw separate agencies this would allow emergency managers law enforcement pe rsonnel firefighters and emergency medical personnel to apply for and receive training from the two agencies and the training institutes they administer this option however appears to leave unresolved the claims of possible redundancy of traini ng or the possibility that these training programs are not coordinated government accountability office gao evaluation of programs congress could ask gao to undertake an evaluation of dhs counterterrorism training programs the evaluation could re view odp and fema training curricula individual courses intended and actual tr ainees and training facilities after conducting review of these courses gao mig ht be able to identify any duplication of training and possible options for consolid ating or coordinating this training this option would give the committee additional tools for oversight of these programs hr 1544 as reported sec tion 6 proposes this evaluation this option however would require the committee to work with gao to set mutually acceptable scope and time for the study coordination of department of homeland security training i f congress were to find undesira ble redundancy in training programs it could direct dhs to be more attentive to coordinatin g the counterterrorism training programs administered by gt and fema dhs coul d possibly establish board to review the gt and fema training programs and to recommend coor dination or other steps to reduce duplicationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32920crs17 consolidation of department of homeland security training i f congress were to determine that there is need to consolidate dhs training programs it could direct dhs through stat utory or conference language to conduct review of its training prog rams and develop plan to consolidate its training this consolidation might involve the removal of similar programs provided by gt and fema to ensure there is redundancy if congress did not consider this consolidation adequate to ensure agains t redundant or uncoordi nated dhs training it could also direct dhs to consolidat all counterterrorism training under one agency gt might be directed to assume the responsibility of administering not only its training but also the training fema provides first responders through emi and nfa some would argue this is gical choice since gt is responsible for administering the funding to states and calities that assist them in receiving this training this option however might be seen as impractical due to the specific training emi provides state and local emergency managers that is specific to natural disasters and the specific tr aining nfa provides firefighte rs fema historically has administered training programs for emer gency managers and firefighters whereas gt has
