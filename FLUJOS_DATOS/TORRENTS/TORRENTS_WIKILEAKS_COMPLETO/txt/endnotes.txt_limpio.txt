leelanau talk is shutting down for now and the leelanau school administration must be thrilled at the age of 16 i helped organize school walkout something on scale that the school had never seen before before that i was working quietly to get shit changed meeting with administrators making deals keeping an eye on student council giving people clean urine helping get people out of trouble giving out proxies helping the lup and some things that nobody will ever know were connected to since then i have been constant problem for the leelanau school parents would call up and ask about what was on my site why kids staged walkout etc this isnt my imagination this is something i have both verified with parents and staff members this isnt about just myself being pissed and talking about myself or bitching about odell keep reading it was all there theres nothing students couldnt do to change the conditions they lived in i put myself my diploma and my future on the line i got pulled in to frileys office and blamed for everything they could come up with hacking must have been him flyers must have been him contraband suddenly appearing or disappearing must have been him so why didnt anything happen was it my organizing style the lack of student interest intimidation by the school administration im not going to answer that question here everybody has their opinion on it including myself and it doesnt really matter what i think anyways as im not going to be involved from here on ive slowly realized that my effort here has been pretty much wasted nobody gives fuck who actually has the power to anything the students themselves it felt great to shoot first but very few shot second this isnt to say there isnt value in what i did or what is on the site just that the idea of students doing shit about the school was always farfetched lets face it most kids at leelanau are rich fuckups im not as rich as most of them but i came from the same situation they dont give fuck about freedom their rights or anything like that because when it comes down to it daddy will pay the right amount to the right people and bail them out theyre stuck in the cycle of nihilism the belief that they are powerless to change things or that things wouldnt be any better if they magically were changed besides who would risk their diploma to change shit when the social drama is so intense that they dont even have time to deal with their own personal problems that landed them here in the first place theres good quote from lord of the rings movie that i generally despite but i think it applies here indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him for every little thing we fight about amongst each other we become further divided this works to the schools advantage as they realize that the further divided we are over our own social shit and the further they can make us turn on our friends by threatening us in their offices the less likely we are to be able to seriously challenge them on any terms let alone our own ill give it to you falling right into this was major fault of mine this type of divide and conquer is classic law enforcement tactic thats been used from the roman empire to cointelpro to groups im currently involved with im not saying that people should put up from abuse from other students but what im saying is sort that shit out and get back to what matters most if you have to ostracize somebody for being an asshole do it but dont get so involved in it that its all you think about theres some seriously fucked up stuff that ive seen go down on the leelanau school campus all the way from snitching to sexual assault and gangstyle beatdowns for reason at all and were all going to have to deal with these problems on our own as community instead of turning to the school for help when we feel in over our heads honestly the school doesnt fix shit and we all know that we all know that social drama doesnt magically stop when something is said at quiet period about it we know harassment doesnt end at the doors to the academic building if were going to take down leelanau or even change single part of it were going to have to do it on united front and put aside our differences for something better if we want to help kids when they get fucked by the school or suddenly cant graduate for financial reasons were going to have to work together not everybody can be united such as students that snitch or rat people out but thats not the majority of kids and if it ever is start small and build from there for years ive been paying to host this website and its just not worth it anymore fuck leelanau yes but more importantly fuck those who did nothing about it fuck you if you snitched on and fuck you if you got away with shit because of my assistance but did nothing on your own fuck you if you saw students mistreating each other and did nothing about it if youre one of those people i hope you take that to heart to stand by while your friends are getting busted or hurt isnt smart nor it is safe its cowardly there are people out there struggles going on for life and death and i was wasting time on my old boarding school theres real problems out there bigger than leelanau more changeable than the leelanau school more important than leelanau at least for at the moment im shutting down the site for good and im not working on this anymore im not paying for po boxes anymore and im not bailing you out anymore i dont even know half of the kids who go there anymore and those who i do know are for whatever reason not doing anything if stuff is going to change its going to change without ive taken everything from this site and put it into big file if somebody wants to really start fucking shit up at this school they can take my old work and build off from there if somebody really wants to make the administrators shit their pants they can do it themselves i hope that you think about what i said especially about the social problems at leelanau for decades leelanau has been openly and openly violating laws by intimidating students and taking away their rights is somebody going to do something about that whoever it is it clearly isnt for decades leelanau students have been stuck in rut of powerlessness and caused much of it ourselves who is going to fix that who is going to solve our social problems or stop assault on our campus you motherfucker thats who ive uploaded bunch of files to the site this is everything from the site and you
